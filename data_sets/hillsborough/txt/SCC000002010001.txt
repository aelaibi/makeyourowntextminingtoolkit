                                            HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR
              On 15th April there was an horrendous disaster at Hillsborough.
        95 people died, many were injured.   I have been appointed by the Home
        Secretary to conduct an Inquiry into the disaster.

              May I convey my deepest sympathy to the bereaved and injured and
        the same from the Inquiry Staff.

              The terms of reference of the Inquiry are to investigate the events
        at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on 15th April and make
        recommendations in relation to crowd control and safety of sports grounds.

              I am solely responsible for the Inquiry, representation and
        recommendations.

              I am assisted by two assessors; Brian Johnson, Chief Constable of
        Leicestershire and Professor Maunder, a professor in Mechanical
        Engineering at Newcastle University.

              This is a preliminary hearing to set out the nature of the Inquiry,
        procedures and to hear applications from parties wishing to be
        represented.

              This is not a law suit where it is a case of winning or losing, it
        is not akin to a criminal trial. No    one is on trial.

                  The Inquiry will look at:-

                   (1)       What happened
                   (2)       Why it happened
                   (3)       The lessons to be learned   and recommendations.

              If allegations are made I willconsider them and if appropriate     make
        a finding.

               The object is to find the facts with all speed. I do not want this
         constructive purpose spoilt by accusation and counter-accusation .

               Regarding the scope and length of the Inquiry, because the people
         involved as witnesses run into the 1,000's, West Midlands Police are
         carrying out the exercise of gathering evidence. I welcome letters. All
         relevant evidence should be available but I want the Inquiry to be quick
         and thorough .

               I want to keep oral evidence within bounds.  I will not allow oral
         evidence which does not add to that already given but written statements
         will be considered.

               The Inquiry will have three Counsels, Andrew Collins Q.C., Alan ’
         Goldsack and Bernard Phillips. All witnesses who give oral evidence are
         called on my behalf.

                   That witness may also be called by their advisors.




HB3AAB/PGT/1
                Before any witness is called they have to have first given a written
          statement. The witness may be cross-examined but I will limit
          cross-examinations as I think fit.

                If an allegation is made against a body or an individual, that body
          or individual must be informed and can call evidence in answer to the
          allegation.

                The oral hearing will commence on the 15th May at 10.30 a.m., and
          will concentrate on the events of the 15th April and why it happened. The
          Inquiry will be public.

                The second part of the Inquiry - relating to the future- I will give
          directions later on how this will be conducted.

                I would like to receive written submissions on recommendations for
          crowd control and safety at sports grounds as soon as possible.

                The press will be given proper assistance and save in exceptional
          circumstances copies of statements made by a witness will be available to
          the press shortly before that winess is called.

                 There will be no photography or filming or sound recording during
           the Inquiry. I can and will enforce that rule.

                I request the press not to interview any witness before they have
          completed their evidence to the Inquiry. I believe that will only impede
          a difficult task.

                I expect parties to be represented by lawyers. Any person or body
          wishing to be represented must show good cause. They must have a direct
          interest and it must be fair to be represented.

                 If there are several parties covered by the same interest they
           should join together.

                Any decision today on representation is not final.

                 If a party does not wish to be represented they can offer to make
           evidence available through a statement as soon as possible.

                 In relation to costs, there are no statutory provisions. The
           Secretary of State is able to meet costs and I make recommendations to the
           Secretary of State.

                 I will consider that at the end.   Costs would be on a common fund
           basis.

                 I intend to make recommendations to pay the reasonable costs of
           anyone who ought to be represented who may not know if they can afford it.
           Certainly the families of the injured and deceased.

                 I       will be sympathetic to football supporters, in particular
           Liverpool supporters. I will be recommending that Liverpool supporters
           costs are paid.

                 Lord Justice Taylor - will agree 1 team to represent families.

          Mr.   Makin                   - represents 7 deceased, 50 injured - not entirely
                                          happy with what took place at consortium meeting.
                                          Counsel very busy. I represent so many interests
                                          already there may be difficulties in only one
                                          advocate.



                 Lord Justice Taylor - I don't see any difficulty. If for good
                 reason, separate representation is needed, I will consider it, but
                 it will have to be quite extraordinary.

          Mr. Jackson                   - instructed by Football Supporters Association.

                 Lord Justice Taylor - satisfied will represent Liverpool Supporters
                 - work out what part want to play in first stage and what better for
                 second stage.

                 Costs - I will probably recommend are paid by the Secretary of
                 S ta te   .
          N.B. If anyone wastes the time of the Inquiry I will consider the matter
          of costs very carefully.

                Lord Justice Taylor - responsible for perimeter fencing - grant
                representation.

          John Dyson                - Football Association. Interest general and
                                      specific. F.A. Cup responsible for selecting

                                      Liverpool should be at the Leppings Lane end.

                Lord Justice Taylor - I am not settling civil claims at this
                hearing. Will grant representation.

                   Interested parties will receive copies of written statements.

          Wood Q.C.                 - South Yorskhire Police - considerable interest.

                   Lord Justice Taylor - will be represented.

          Colvin                    - National Council for Civil Liberties - no
                                      appearance.

          Swainson                  - Liverpool City Council, Sefton, Knowsley, Wirral,
                                      St. Helens, Met. District Council. Lancashire and

                                      Representation in a collective capacity:-

                                      (1) unlike most disasters - particularly affects
                                      Merseyside. Local Authorities can justifiably
                                      represent the wider people.

                                      (2) Authorities believe by granting
                                      representation can demonstrate awareness of need
                                      for fairness, openness and thoroughness.

                                      Degree of sensitivity and suspicion of
                                      communities represented.

                   Lord Justice Taylor - country aware of loss/grief Liverpool.   For
                   the Inquirty representation to contribute to what happened and why.
                   Can't see what representation will add. Want views of football
                   supporters. Don't think need representations from the local
                   authorities to impress on me or the public the need for impartiality
                   and openness. I reject the application - not through a lack of
                   sensitivity but from a sensitivity of the need to get on quickly.' I
                   respect your reason but am not persuaded.

           Wright                   - St. John's Ambulance. Don't want representation,
                                      reserving our position.

                Inquiry achieving purpose - will have to keep good time - tight ship

          King                    - application to change venue of Inquiry to
                                    Liverpool.

                 Lord Justice Taylor - no good reasons here - ground services - not
                 minded to move part of the Inquiry to Liverpool. Will consider
                 later.

                 - first part - what and why
                 - second part - future.

          King                    - application to give statements direct to the

                 Lord Justice Taylor - don't have to go through the police, but has
                 to be a comparing of information, but can present direct evidence.

          King                    - want assurance statements will only be used    for
                                     the Inquiry, not civil claims.

my conclusions on the complex and difficult issues arising from the need to improve crow d safety and
crowd control a t sports grounds. Even for High C ou rt Judges there are only 24 hours in a day. It was
clear th a t even w orking a t all possible speed a full repo rt could n o t be prepared and in your hands in
sufficient time before the next football season, due to start in the middle o f August.

   10. I had tw o alternatives; either to rep o rt nothing until I had com pleted all aspects o f the Inquiry, or
to prepare an interim report giving the results o f my investigations into the events at B radford and
Birmingham, together with some prelim inary recom m endations on safety m atters and crow d control based
on these investigations. I decided it would be right to choose the latter alternative, as safety levels m ust be
improved quickly. It m ust however be appreciated that the time scale has necessarily prevented as full or
detailed an investigation into these complex m atters as I would have wished. The interim report is therefore
subm itted for y our consideration.

  11. I am now proceeding w ith the rem aining aspects o f the Inquiry and will produce my final report as
soon as I reasonably can.

                                    The fire at Bradford City Football Ground

                                     •*.           CHAPTER 1

                                               How did the fire start?

      1.1 A t ab o u t 3.40 on the afternoon o f Saturday 11 M ay 1985 a fire started in block G o f the m ain stand
  o f the B radford City football ground, at Valley Parade. In about five m inutes the whole stand was in total
  flames. 56 people lost their lives, in addition m any were seriously injured.

     1.2 There are three questions which I have to consider: (1) how did the fire start; (2) why did the fire
  start and cause such casualties; and, (3) w hat lessons are to be learnt for the future so as to prevent such a
  disaster ever happening again?

  The Ground
     1.3 It is situated at Valley Parade, Bradford. It has covered accom m odation on three sides and an open
  terrace know n as Spion K op on the no rth side. The pitch runs from no rth to south. O n the west side was
  the main stand with which I am concerned. It held ju st over 2,000 people. The accom m odation has been
  subject to some alteration. The standing area in front o f the stand has twice been reduced to accom m odate
  pitch widening: but the buildings are substantially as they were in 1908. A plan o f the stand is at Appendix


    1.4 The stand was some 90 metres long. It was set on the side o f a hill. It divided approxim ately into
 two equal longitudional sections separated by a w ooden fence which was about 4 to 5 feet high. Above the
 fence, spectators were provided with tim ber seats, affixed to timber; below, there were polypropylene seats
 affixed to concrete. These seats were num bered from 1 to 151 above the wooden fence, from 1 to 140
 below. They were divided in blocks, from block A to block G . Block G was the m ost northern p a rt o f the
 seating area. Access to and from all seating sections was from a long corridor extending alm ost the full
 length o f the back o f the stand. It was located at the highest point next to the same perim eter wall along
 Valley Parade. Entrance, turnstiles and exit doors led directly from the road to the corridor which in turn
 fed the various sections o f seating.

    1.5 A t the northern end o f the main stand and all along the" front, terraced standing areas were provided.
 This area is know n as the Paddock. In front o f the Paddock ran a brick wall between 4 and 5 feet high. In
 fron t o f this wall was a track and then the pitch.

     1.6 Because o f the natural slope o f the hill there was a void underneath the wooden floor o f the stand
 between the seats and the ground. Its depth varied between 9 inches and 30 inches. The back p a rt o f the
 seating in G block, the area in which the fire started, consisted o f 9 rows, lettered I to Q and numbered
 from south to north, 141 to 151. Seat num ber 141 adjoined the steps leading up to the corridor. N um ber
 151 adjoined the Paddock. The upper section o f the seating accom m odation was separated from the lower
 section by a tim ber partition which went along the whole length o f the stand. There were only two points
 o f access from the front seating to the corridor a t the back o f the stand, namely between blocks B and C
 an d between E and F. There were also steps to the back corridor at the south end o f the stand adjacent to
 block A.

   1.7       The close boarded ro o f was covered throughout its length with roofing felt, and supported by three
 row s o f steel columnsosdthLtimber trusses and purlins.

 The Club
     1.8 The C lub was form ed as a rugby club in M ay 1903. Its original name was M anningham Rugby
  Football Club. It then became a Soccer Club. It was prom oted from the 2nd Division as cham pions to the
• 1st Division in 1908, when the Bradford City A ssociation Football Club (1908) Ltd was form ed It won
 the FA Cup in the 1910-11 season. It stayed in the 1st Division until 1922. It then dropped from the 2nd
 in to the 3rd Division in 1927. It achieved 2nd Division status again in 1928, which it held unlil the 1936^37
 season. From that time it has spent its entire years in the 3rd and 4th Divisions until the present season
 at the end o f which it was prom oted to the 2nd Division.

   1.9 M r Stafford H eginbotham was a D irector o f the 1908 club from 1965 until 1973 and durine that
 period became C hairm an. He had no connection with the club from then uqtil 1983 when the 1908 cluh
 £400 000° receivership and subsequently into liquidation. It apparently had debts’ o f somewhere over



                                                         3
  1.10 Since 1983 a new com pany, B radford City Association Football Club (1983) L td, has been form ed.
R elations between the Club an d the police have been excellent. M r H eginbotham is D irector and Chairm an,
M r J C T ordoff and M r P Fleshet also constitute the non-executive board o f D irectors. M r T N ew m an is
the C om pany Secretary and A dm inistrator, M r M Ryan is in charge o f lotteries and prom otion, M r T
Cherry is the team m anager/player and responsible for all m atters relating to football. His assistant is M r
T Y orath. M r A Gilliver is the Stadium M anager and is responsible for the ground, the bar, and m atch
day catering an d general maintenance.

   1.11 In addition there is a secretary to the football m anager an d there are a num ber o f full-time and
part-tim e people who w ork in the lotteries office. There is a m aintenance m an w ho is responsible for general
m aintenance a t the ground; there is an assistant groundsm an, and various other people in part-tim e and
full-time em ploym ent.

   1.12 By the sum m er o f 1984 when the club was in a m ore stable financial position, six people were asked
to join as Associate D irectors in order to lend their expertise to the club on practical rather than financial
m atters.

   1.13 The financial position o f this club was n o t substantially different from a num ber o f others w ho lurk
in the depths o f the 3rd and 4th Division. The gates o f these clubs are insufficient generally to provide
adequate financial stability. Thus directors an d chairmen, often local businessmen themselves, devote a
substantial am ount o f their own m oney in order to keep their football clubs afloat. Football at this level is
run on a shoe string.

   1.14 T here were in the 1984-85 Season, 31 first-team League an d C up matches. T he total attendance
was 186,532, an average o f ju st over 6,000. M r H eginbotham gave evidence at the public inquiry. H e took
a highly responsible attitud e to the events which had caused so m uch grief. H e gave every assistance to the
police in their inquiry and to us in ours. In the course o f his evidence he was asked this: “ I think th at you
yourself w ant to say som ething abo ut the responsibility o f the club itse lf’, Answer: “ Yes, a great deal o f
effort was p u t in to im prove the club an d a great deal has been achieved since the new com pany was
formed. M any im provem ents have been m ade to run the Club b u t as the C hairm an o f the Club I accept
the responsibility for the executive and m anagem ent I employ. I accept the responsibility for the m anner
in which the Club is run and the direction which the b oard give to it. There are obviously things that could
have been done on th a t day o r before th a t day th at would have helped the situation with the benefit o f
hindsight. I am prepared to say th at there are a num ber o f things we all wish had been done o r had been
thought o f prior to this terrible tragedy” .

The outbreak of fire
    1.15 Saturday 11 M ay 1985 was to be a day o f celebration for the B radford City Football Club. They
had w on the 3rd D ivision cham pionship and were to be prom oted. This was their last game o f the Season.
The visitors were Lincoln City. Before the game started, the trophy for the cham pionship was presented
to the Club. The m anager was presented with an aw ard for “ M anager o f the Y ear” . The Vice-President
o f the Football League attended; so did the D eputy Lord M ayor o f Bradford, together with civic dignitaries
from twin towns in G erm any and in Belgium. It was indeed a day o f celebration. A crowd estim ated at
some 11,000 attended.

   1.16 Before the m atch started, in addition to the presentations, there was a parade. N o serious crowd
trouble was anticipated, nor took place. A sm oke canister was throw n on the other side o f the ground, as
was a m eat pie. There was «ome chanting. There was the norm al exchange o f pleasantries that occur at
football grounds between groups o f spectators and the police; otherwise there was little incident off the
field. Some seven or eight were arrested either inside or outside the ground.

   1.17 The m atch kicked off at 3 pm. It was by all accounts a fairly dull game. Shortly before h alf time
the fire started. The first police message was timed ju st after 15.40 and 58 seconds. O n the television film
produced by Y orkshire Television a fire is visible and timed at 15.40.

   1.18 Sitting in Row I which is the fron t row o f this section o f G block were M r Alcock in seat 141, M r
 Bennett 142, M r Brownlie 143, M r Tem pest senior 144, M r Tem pest ju n io r 145. Detective Constable
 Blanchfield 146, and his son 147.

  1.19 In row J, was M r Wetherill in seat 141, M r Kolawole 142. M r Jarvis 143. and his grandfather 144,
 Mr C lew orth 145, M r W ilkinson 146, M r Levitt 148, and M r Pachela in 149.

  ^ 1.20 M r Alcock first knew o f something amiss when he heard M r Brownlie say th at he could see some
  flames underneath the stand in front o f him. M r Alcock looked over and he could see them as well. He
  described a hole roughly between seats 142 and 143 which he thought was about 2" long and about H "
  wide. H e could see w hat appeared to be paper o r debris o f some kind underneath, which was on fire.

    1 21 M r Brownlie told the public inquiry th at ju st before half time he felt his right leg was warm and
 he bent dow n and rubbed his eg. H e rem arked, “ Hell, it’s warm down there” . W hen he looked he saw
 there was a fire; he descnbed the gap in the floor as being no m ore than ¥ ' in width and he supposed it
 extended the length o f the plank. The fire appeared to him to be about 9" below the floor board. M r
 Bennett descnbed how his feet started getting warm: he therefore stood up. He said that there was a crack
 in I f „ ° r boards below him and he could see fire through it. H e described the crack as being between i"
 and £ wide.                                                                             8

     1.22 O ther witnesses in the area noticed that there was a smell o f smoke which they variously described
 as the smell o f plastic burning, an d o f cigarette or pipe tobacco. The evidence given by M r Brownlie M r
 Bennett and M r Alcock was graphically confirmed by the still photographs which appear in Appendix 3.
 The general public took a large num ber o f photographs which have been o f great assistance to the police
 and to the Inquiry. One o f those photographs, letter A, shows the flames under the floor boards immediately
 under the seat num bered J141. There is visible a gap. T he other photograph, letter B, shows flame undo-
 J 141 and smoke coming out from underneath.

    1.23 N one o f the witnesses in this p a rt o f G block saw anything thrown from outside which could have
 caused th a t fire. There was, as is custom ary after this sort o f disaster, a great deal o f rum our and talk A
 num ber o f witnesses m ade statements to the police suggesting th at a smoke bom b had been throw n into
 G block and that is w hat had caused the fire to start. The police investigated that. Detective Superintendent
 C ooper set up a m ajor incident room with a team o f 100 detectives. W ithin 14 days all those who had been
 seated m this p a rt o f G block except those who had unfortunately died had either come forward o r had
 been traced. Detective Superintendent C ooper and his officers investigated allegations m ade by a total o f
 14 people elsewhere in the ground that various missiles had been thrown. A t the end o f that investigation
 he said th a t there were two people who still believed th a t items were thrown. N either o f those two people
 were talking about a smoking object. H e and his officers were satisfied that that view was either inaccurate

 box which was level with rows I and J in G block, but some 40 yards further away. His description as it
  ppears in the edition o f 13 M ay o f the Daily S tar was: “ A smoke bom b caused the tragic Bradford football
fan« r     COnVinCu     ll’ was Sltting only yards away from the seat o f the inferno that killed at least 52
tans. I saw everything, every hornfying second, I saw a smoke bom b throw n by hooligans from the stand
  joining the main building and I know that the killer who threw it would have escaped ” The article
continued in similar dram atic vein.                                                                   am ue

    1.27 Superintendent C lapham , who was com m ander o f the police task force a t Bradford and responsible
 after the fire for dealing w ith the search o f the stand, described finding some rem arkably u n b u m t paper
 and debris in block C. T h at consisted o f a copy o f the B radford Evening Telegraph and A rgus for M onday
 4 N ovem ber 1968, the w rapper for a* packet o f peanuts costing six old pennies, and other w rappers and
 packets indicating th at they had been m anufactured before decimalisaton. Superintendent C lapham said
 there were other things which h ad clearly been there for a very long time. I am satisfied there was likely to
 have been all under the m ain stand a smiliar accum ulation o f debris to that found in block C.

   1.28 A gap in the floor boards was confirmed by Dectective Constable Blanchfield who described how
 some m onths before, when he was a t the ground w ith his son and a friend o f his son, th a t friend lost his
 scarf through a gap in the flooring. It was in another p a rt o f the stand. When they tried to retrieve it they
 could not.

   1.29 M r Gilliver, who is the stadium m anager an d responsible for the condition o f the stadium and
ground, said th at there was some rubbish in the stand, but not as m uch as everybody m ade out. He had
been able to see some rubbish under the stand w hen they had done repairs. They removed the rubbish
before blocking the stand up again. T hat was when kick boards under the seats had been repaired. This
had occurred during the suinm er o f last year. He accepted that there were still gaps through which debris
could fall. M r Lawn, a m aintenance m an, described debris being under the boards which he had seen
through dam aged kick boards. H e said it w ould be impossible to reach through the dam aged coverings to
retrieve o r to remove the m ajority o f the rubbish.

    1.30 M r R A C ooke is a forensic scientist attached to the Forensic Science Laboratory a t W eatherby, a
Bachelor o f Law and a M em ber o f the Institute o f Fire Engineers. H e described the floor boards as being
close boarded b u t n o t tongue and grooved. H e understood th at because o f the age o f the structure a
shrinkage o f tim ber had allowed gaps to open between the floor boards which would allow rubbish to fall
through. H e m ade a comprehensive search with his team o f the area in I 141-146 an d K 141-146. He
found charred debris abo ut 6" to 8" deep. H e said that represented shrinkage from probably uncharred
materials, so it would be to some degree higher than that. It may have been even 12" deep in its original
u n b u m t state.

   1.31 Superintendent C lapham found no evidence o f paint o r accelerant or gas cylinders o r anything o f
th at nature which could have caused o r contributed to the fire. I conclude th at the fire was not started by
any m alicious means.

   1.32 A report was commissioned through the D epartm ent o f the Environm ent Building Research
Establishm ent from the Fire Research Station at Borehamwood. T hat report appears in Appendix 4. D r
Woolley o f the Fire Research Station carried out a test by dropping, from a reasonably norm al hand
height, a lighted m atch. H e found that in th at test 25 per cent o f dropped lighted matches were capable o f
igniting m aterial a t floor level. A dditionally, one match which broke would also have set light to combustible
materials.

   1.33 D r W oolley concluded th at it was perfectly possible that a lighted match dropped through a gap
in the floor, could have ignited rubbish a nd th at a lighted cigarette might have done so, although he thought
the latter w as less likely, on balance.

   1.34 A m ong the debris found by M r Cooke were cigarette packets, match boxes an d m atch sticks,
brandy bottles, disposable soft drinks bottles, polystyrene drinking cups and sweet wrappers. There were
several m atch boxes which had the remains o f carbonised m atches still in, but there was one which appeared
to be a full m atch box found under seat I 145. N o incendiary devices, fireworks or aerosol cans were found,
an d he concluded that a small flame source such as a dropped m atch was probably m ore likely than a
dropped cigarette, though he could not elim inate a dropped cigarette. There were in rows I and J people
w ho were sm oking, as indeed there were generally in block G. I am quite satisfied that the cause o f the fire
was the dropping o f a lighted m atch, or a cigarette or tobacco on to debris beneath the floor boards in
rows I or J, in between the seats 141 and 143. It is quite impossible to determine who caused the fire to
start; indeed it would be grossly unfair to point the finger a t any one person.

  1.35 The answ er to the question how the fire started, is that is was due to the accidental lighting o f
debris below the floor boards in rows I or J between the seats 141 to 143.

                                  Why did the fire start and cause such casualties?
 .   2.1 It is clear that the whole period between the first appreciation o f the presence o f fire under the floor
   boards by the spectators, until the total conflagration o f the entire stand from to p to bottom and end to
  end, was abou t five minutes. Those in the im mediate area o f the fire seemed n o t unreasonably to think
   that it was simply some paper which had caught fire, th a t it was o f no particular significance, and th at
  within a short period o f time steps would be taken to deal with it.
 ...



    2.2     W hen M r Bennett, Row I, seat 142, saw the fire he said: “ O ur feet were w arm , I ju st stood up and
 somebody said, whether it was me, my nephew o r the other lad, ‘O h there is a fire under there’, and I said
 •there sure is, I’ll go and get a fire extinguisher’.” H e then went to the back o f the stand to get a fire
 extinguisher. H e did no t find a fire extinguisher, but he found three policemen. One o f those was Police
 Constable Lyles. M r Bennett said: “ C an you get a fire extinguisher, there is a fire dow n there?” PC Lyles
 asked PC Thom pson to get a fire extinguisher and he himself went dow n to look a t the fire. H e was
 followed by PC Frankland. PC Lyles described the fire when he got there in this way: “ It appeared a t first
 that it was a very m inor fire, all we saw was a small am ou nt o f smoke, I was no t sure th a t ‘fire’ was really
 the right w ord to describe it, it appeared to me to be a m in or incident.” While M r Bennett had been talking
 to the police M r Brown had emptied ab ou t a q uarter o f a cup o f coffee on the fire, which had no effect.
 PC Lyles shouted to some other officers, who were standing on the touchline, to get a fire extinguisher
 Owing to the background noise they thought he had asked for the fire brigade and they therefore radioed
 to the fire brigade.

  ; 2.3 W hen PC Frankland got to the scene he saw a thin wisp o f smoke coming through the floor boards
 and he could see w hat appeared to him to be a small piece o f paper burning.

    2.4 T he police messages recorded on tape have been transcribed. They are autom atically timed. It has
 since transpired th a t the clock on the tim er at the date o f the inquiry was 25 seconds slow. It m atters not
 for the purpose o f this Inquiry. The first message received by the police control abo ut the fire is a message
 from PC 2573 Johnson to control, timed some time after 1540.58 seconds, and it reads as follows- “ PC
 2573 to C ontrol” , C ontrol to 2573 “ 2573 go ahead” , 2573 to C ontrol, “ Can you get the fire brigade the
 m ain stand . . . there is a fire urider the m ain stand . . . clear it, over.” 1541.18, C ontrol to 2573 “ Y ou say
 you w ant the m ain stand cleared as well.” 1541.19, 2573 to C ontrol, “I t’s the bottom . . there is a fire
 under the stand.” 2573 to C ontrol, “ D id you get that?” 1541.41, C ontrol to 2573, “ W e are requesting the
 fire brigade the other p art o f your message is broken can’t read you.”

   2.5 C hief Inspector M awson was Acting Superintendent from the M anningham sub division and was in
charge o f the police operation at this ground on this day. H e was standing near the players’ entrance by
the club house. He heard the word “ fire” on his police radio and immediately went down to G block from
where he saw smoke coming. On the Y orkshire Television film, on which timings have been provided he
can first be seen moving from his position a t 1543.57. By 1544.12 there are plainly visible flames coming
from G block. By 1546.20 the whole stand is well ablaze.

    2.6 PC Lyles said to the people who were close by, th at they should move, but it did n o t appear to those
 in the im mediate vicinity that there was any urgent danger; those further away could see smoke, and a lot
 o f them assumed that there had been some sort o f smoke bomb. The game continued for a short while It
-is-dear from all the evidence and indeed from the still photographs which show people standing close'by
 and watching flames, that people were very reluctant to move.

   2.7 PC Lyes said: “W e did not get m uch reaction from people in the stand, obviously they were watching
the m atch and in fairness the fire did not look m uch from where they were sitting. A few o f them moved
ou t into the aisles tow ards the top o f the steps.” The police officers did finally persuade people to move.
N o doubt the increase in smoke and flames was itself a powerful factor in that respect.

   2.8 The speed with which the fire took hold was graphically described as faster than a m an could run.
 ^ !       ro o f covered with tarpaulin and sealed with asphalt itself rapidly took fire; the burning asphalt
added its own fuel to the flames and injury to the spectators. The presence o f the ro o f itself caused the fire
to spread horizontally at a very fast speed.

  2.9 D r Woolley described it in this way: “ A substantial rubbish fire may have developed within 90
seconds, capable o f igniting adjacent timbers within about 30 seconds.” He describes in Table I o f his
repo rt th a t within abo ut a minute 20 square metres o f seating would be involved. The factors causing the
spread o f the fire were, the void half filled w ith rubbish; air to feed the fire; tim ber in close proxim ity to
the original fire; the uphill slope-of the stand; and the construction and shape o f the roof. It all led to
spontaneous ignition in advance o f the path o f the actual fire. He went on to describe the effect o f the
presence o f the ro o f on the flame in this way: “ As the flame increases in height and as it expands over a
larger an d growing area o f the flooring m aterial, its height increases until it touches the ceiling or a
horizontal level. Once it goes under, o r has to go under, that ceiling, because it can only get air from one
side now and not all the way round, there is an enorm ous lengthening effect o f the flames underneath that
roof. N ow , th at is a standard picture th at is seen n o t only in this fire but in m any others in buildings where
fire develops and goes beneath the ceiling. Very approxim ately, a flame will have five times the length under
a ceiling th at it would have in a vertical direction.” A nd he said that it was this length o f horizontal flame
w hich gave witnesses the impression o f a moving ball o f fire coming tow ards them.

   2.10 In addition D r Woolley described that ahead o f the flame would be a dense thick smoke, particularly
in this case for those in the back corridor o f the stand. The report and calculations by D r Woolley appear
in A ppendix 4 and in the various papers annexed to his report. It is unnecessary to repeat that scientific
detail in the main body o f the report.

   2.11 There was no fire fighting equipm ent in the stand. The only fire fighting equipm ent in the ground
consisted o f a num ber o f fire extinguishers in the various club bars at an end o f the m ain stand. PC
T hom pson had set o u t to find these. A lthough he was not aware where they were, he w ent dow n the
co rrid or immediately behind the back o f the seats o f the main stand. H e reached the tea hut and asked for
a stew ard and the fire extinguishers. H e was told th a t it was no t known where either were to be found.
Accordingly, he got on his radio to control and asked for fire extinguishers and fo r the doors to be opened.
T h a t message, as recorded, only refers to doors being opened, it was timed a t 1541.55.

   2.12 M r Ryan, who is the Commercial M anager o f the Club, was on duty supervising lottery payments.
He was standing a t the back o f block H . H e was approached by a policeman who shouted a t him to get a
fire extinguisher. H e ran the full length o f the stand behind the seating area into the m ain entrance to the
club house, picked up the fire extinguisher and ran back. H e went back along the corridor and had just
passed the gents’ toilets. He said there were an enorm ous num ber o f people approaching him and then
sm oke overtook and enveloped him and it was difficult to see. H e was never able to use the extinguisher.

  2.13 The large quantity o f black smoke which the fire em itted has been described by witnesses as like
the smoke caused by burning tyres. M any spectators naturally sought to go ou t the way th at they had
come in and m oved at varying degrees o f haste tow ards the back o f the stand to seek safety through the
exits.

The Exits

   2.14 A t the back o f the stand is a long corridor running the whole length o f the stand. From that
corrido r there are a num ber o f exits into South Parade. These are m arked on the plan at A ppendix 2. At
the southern end o f the corridor leading from the corridor into the club house there was a wooden door,
letter Z, opening inwards into the club house. It was closed but not locked. In the club house there was a
glass alum inium double door, letter A, which opened inward into the club house which was closed but not
locked.

   2.15 M oving northw ards along the corridor, there was a small wooden double door, letter B, leading
from the corridor into South Parade and opening outw ards, A t 3.30 pm one side o f th at door was unbolted
to enable people like players’ wives, who had an invitation to go into the club house, to go there via South
Parade and entrance A. It was the norm al practice o f the stewards (A nthony and Peter Keating) to stay
there until 5 or 10 minutes after h alf time. A t the time o f the fire, therefore, one p art o f d o or B was
unbolted and the other p a rt o f the d o o r was closed but n o t locked. There were two small exits, letters C
and D, which were w ooden openings into South Parade. They were boarded up a t the time and were
unavailable as exits.

   2.16 N ext were double wooden doors, letter E. They opened outw ards, the d o o r had a bolt into the
lintel, a bolt into the floor (although there was no hole in the floor to receive the bolt) and a sliding bolt
in the middle. T h at sliding bolt was secured by a locked padlock. However, it could be opened w ithout
needing to unlock the padlock by undoing one bolt at the top and pushing both doors together. T hat was
open a t the time o f the fire, having been opened by Police Sergeant H endrick and other dog handlers.
  2.17 There was a boarded up opening, letter F. It was forced open during the fire. There was a similar
wooden d o o r which had been boarded up, letter G . This too was forced open.

   2.18 There were then four turnstiles num bered 2, 3, 4 and 5. N um bers 2 and 3 were steel turnstiles going
from floor to ceiling. They could only be used as an entrance into the ground and not as an exit. The door
to turnstile 2 was not opened on th at day and was padlocked; the d oo r to turnstile 3 was opened when
spectators came into the ground, but the door had been locked closed thereafter. The locking o f those
doors was o f no significance because it was impossible for those inside the ground to get out through the
turnstiles a t opening H.

   2.19 Turnstiles 4 and 5 were mechanically operated and they were waist high. On the roadside there
were doors which opened inwards; after spectators had entered, the turnstiles were secured by chain and
padlock. A lthough it would have been physically possible to climb over the turnstiles, exit through the
doors was impossible because the doors themselves were secured w ith a padlock from the inside. There
was thus no exit from J. T o the right o f J there was, however, a store which was alongside the turnstile.
T hat store was used for the counting o f money. T he d oo r from there onto the road was unlocked. There
was no indication anywhere where the exits were, o r that this particular route through the store was an
available exit. There was evidence that it was used by a num ber o f specators to get out.

   2.20 The next exits were some double doors, letter K , which opened inwards. They had been closed and
locked by bolts with a padlock on. It was M r K eating’s practice to undo the bolt and pull the gates, both
together, so th a t he could undo the gates w ithout needing to use the key to the padlock. In fact, these
doors were burst open by a num ber o f spectators from the outside during the fire. The next opening from
the corridor was into the gents’ toilets. F rom the toilets there was no exit into South Parade. Three people
died in the toilets. The next exits were two small openings, letters M and N , which are described on the
plan as being boarded up openings. M r Lawn w ho was employed as the m aintenance m an said th a t about
three m onths previously he had been asked to unblock a d o o r by M r Gilliver and had done so. H e identified
th a t as M . M r Gilliver himself identified it as N.

  2.21 Turnstiles 6, 7, 8 and 9 were entered from the corridor by entrances O and P. The turnstiles were
waist high and at the time o f the fire were secured by chain and padlock. These turnstiles had doors on to
South Parade which opened inward into the ground. T hey were each locked with bolts and padlocked.
N um bers 6, 8 and 9 were forced open during the course o f the fire while turnstile 7 remained shut. The
m ajority o f spectators who died did so by exit K and the exit through turnstiles 6-9 through main exits O
and P. The over 70’s and under 20’s accounted for over h alf o f the casualties.

  2.22 There was a single wooden door, letter R. which opened outw ards. It was closed and locked-with
a sliding bolt and padlocked. It was forced open during the fire and people escaped therefrom.

   2.23 There was a d o or at the end o f the corridor leading tow ards the Paddock, letter X, which was a
w ooden hinged door. It opened inw ards into the m ain stand; it was bolted on the inside o f the m ain stand,
it was not locked and it was opened during the fire. A t letter S which was the exit from the Paddock into
South Parade there were double wooden gates which opened outw ards. They were closed and secured by
a large wooden beam inserted into metal rests across the back o f the door. T h at door was open at the time
o f the fire.

  2.24 Turnstiles 10 and 11 led from the Paddock into South Parade. The turnstiles were locked and
chained, so too were the doors leading into them.

   2.25 M r W ilkinson who had been attending this stand for over 20 years (the last eight years as a reaular)
said that it was not an easy ground to get out o f even when the gates were opened, that he used to sit and
w ait because it was packed solid getting out, it was always a 5 or 10 minute job. Chief Inspector Mawson
said th at as far as this stand was concerned, it was quite plain it could not in any way measure up to a
capacity to evacuate the num ber o f people it contained in 2 \ minutes.

   2.26 The answers to the question therefore why the fire started and caused casualties are that, firstly the
stand was a wooden structure, with a void u nder the seats, in which debris could and did collect; and
secondly th a t the available exits were insufficient to enable spectators safely to escape the devastating effects
o f the rapidly spreading fire.
  2.27 The H om e Office and the Scottish H om e and H ealth D epartm ent published a G uide to Safety a t
Sports G rounds (Football) in 1976. It is called the G reen Guide and it recomm ends measures for im proving
safety a t existing football grounds. Paragrap h 8.11 o f the G reen Guide reads:
  “A com m on feature in the construction o f stands which is a fire risk is the provision o f voids under the
  seating. These voids become the resting place for paper, cartons and other com bustible materials which
  can be ignited, unnoticed, by a carelessly discarded cigarette end. W herever possible such spaces should
  be excluded but where they exist they should be sealed off so that paper etc cannot find its way into
  them .”
Paragraph 10.6 Housekeeping reads:
  “O ne o f the potential causes o f fire in football grounds arises from the accum ulation o f waste paper,
  program m es, packets and other com bustible m aterials which are dropped by spectators. As stated in
  parag rap h 8.11 this can present a particular problem in stands. Every effort should be m ade to reduce
  this hazard. All p a rts o f buildings should be inspected before and after every event and accum ulations
  o f com bustible waste cleared as quickly as practicable or stored in a safe place pending clearance.”
Paragraphs 8.2 and 8.3 read:
  “8.2 Every stand should be provided with sufficient exits to allow for the orderly evacuation from the
  stand o f all spectators likely to be accom m odated.
  8.3 E vacuation time, which will depend largely on the fire hazard present in the stand, should be within
  the following limits.
  a. 8 m inutes where a stand is o f non-com bustible fire resisting construction, the interior use and contents
     present a low fire risk and the exit staircases are n o t vulnerable to a fire occurring within the stand;
     and
  b. 2.5 m inutes for stands o f a low er standard.
  T he conditions at a particular ground may call for interpolation between these times.”

  2.28 H ad the Green Guide been complied w ith this tragedy would n o t have occurred.

   3.8     It follows, therefore, th at as a m atter o f practice, while the physical safety o f the building and the
m aintenance and good housekeeping o f the ground m ust always be the responsibility o f the club, the police
have to take the de facto responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all th a t entails, during the game. Tfie
significance o f this aspect was highlighted by a num ber o f questions raised ab o u t the responsibility for
evacuation. It is clear th at neither this police force, n or m any other police forces, so far as we can ascertain
have received any training or briefing in the question o f evacuation. It was suggested th at the fire service
w as m ore experienced in evacuation during fires. It seems to me, however, th at the only organisation
present and capable o f supervising an evacuation is the police. E vacuation may be necessary for a num ber
o f reasons, there may be a bom b hoax, a p art o f a stand may collapse, there m ay be crowd disorder so
th a t people need to be got out o f a stand, there m ay be a fire. There may be other emergencies.

   3.9nIt follows that the police should now consider w hether training for police officers for emergencies
should not include some direction o r training on how best to evacuate a particular ground. A lthough it
m ay sound like a form idable undertaking, w hat is necessary is for the police to consider the particular
grou nd which is under their control and to consider in the light o f the exits presently available in each
particular part o f the ground, how best to organise the evacuation o f spectators in those portions o f the
g roun d if an emergency should arise. It does n o t seem to me th at any very great difficulty would arise. M r
D om aille made the point that if the police were to be responsible for evacuating sports grounds, they would
be required to do the same a t other types o f premises. The answer to th at is th a t the police generally are
n o t present at other premises, n o r need they be. M r Dom aille said th at police officers were trained in a
general way to react to all emergencies. H e emphasised that police need to be flexible in their response to
w h at occurs in grounds. In the situation which obtained at Bradford they behaved with com m endable
efficiency, even w ithout form al training. They also behaved with enorm ous bravery. I recommend therefore
that evacuation procedure should be a m atter o f police training and fo rm part o f the briefing by police officers
before a football match. W hether it is justifiable to go further in the m ore explicit allocation o f responsibilities
is something to which I shall give further thought.

   3.10 Paragraph 10.7 o f the G reen G uide (which will need some alteration to cover police training and
briefing) reads:
“ 10.7 Emergency Procedure and S ta ff Training
   10.7.1     It is essential that plans should be m ade for dealing w ith emergency situations. Joint consultation
between the m anagem ent o f the ground, police, fire, am bulance and other emergency services should be
held in order to produce agreed plans o f action.
   J 0.7.2 While the public are in the ground an adequate num ber o f staff should be m aintained to cover
entrances, exits and other strategic points.
    10.7.3     All such staff should be trained in the use o f the fire fighting equipm ent provided and in the action
to be taken in the event o f a fire.”
   3.11 The num ber o f police officers employed at football grounds has risen enermously over the last
decade. Fears were expressed abou t the financing o f police officers a t football grounds; it is not within o ur
term s o f reference to consider that. I need only point out th at the use o f police officers at football grounds
is a very expensive exercise, bo th financially and in m anpow er. Certainly, so far as the smaller clubs are
concerned, it is a financial burden, which they m ay n o t be able fully to carry. This could have disastrous
consequences for law and order. But if a football club w ants to stage a function, and needs police w ithin
its premises they m ust either be properly paid for by the club o r the function n o t take place. In the end it
is a m atter for the organisers o f sporting functions how they arrange their affairs.

   3.12 M r D om aille disclaimed police responsibility for the state o f the premises, and rightly so. W hat he
said was this: “T he club is a private enterprise, that is putting on a football m atch on private property. It
has club m embers and other people are its custom ers. The m anagem ent o f the club, and the looking after
o f the people, as they come in, is a m atter for the stewards, provided a t the club, in the same way that
usherettes act in a cinema.” He went on to say, “ I expect my officers to draw the attention o f the club to
w hatever they thought was wise to draw the attention o f the club tow ards. If then nothing happened then
I w ould have thought that, if it was in respect o f fire, we would talk to the fire brigade and if it were in
respect o f something structural and nothing was being done ab o u t it, we should contact the C ounty Council
if we were very concerned ab o u t it.”

    3.13 T hat is w hat they in fact did in June 1984. Superintendent Briggs had been to the ground in M arch
 o r April 1984 when a ball was kicked against the lower p art o f the stand and a piece o f wood dropped off.
 H e also noticed th at pieces o f felting from the grandstand ro o f were being blown ab o u t o nto the pitch.


                                                           12
         After the m atch he went and saw M r Heginbotham. They went together to look at the roof. They discussed
         the fact that the roof, as a result of the wind and rain, was in a dangerous condition.

           3.14 M r Briggs subsequently saw M r Tordoff who was the Vice-Chairman o f the Club. M r Tordoff
         asked M r Briggs if he would be prepared to confirm in writing by an official police letter about the damage
         which had now become worse. As a result on 27 June 1984 M r Briggs wrote to M r Newman, the Secretary
         of the Club, in these terms:
           “D ear M r Newman,
           Dangerous Grandstand
           I should like to bring to your attention the dangerous condition o f the Valley Parade grandstand roof
           at your ground. Whilst appreciating it is due to fair wear and tear its condition is such that it could
           come down at any time. I am particularly concerned for the safety o f spectators inside the ground should
           anything untow ard occur before this is repaired, and additionally o f the dangers which could be caused
           to other members of the public using the adjacent road. Y our cooperation and early attention to this
           m atter would be much appreciated please, Y ours faithfully.”

            By January 1985 approval for the repair had apparently been given. By an irony the work was due to
         start on M onday 13 M ay, that is to say two days after this disaster.

)          3.15 So far as safety o f the premises is concerned, the local authorities are responsible for issuing safety
i        certificates in respect o f designated grounds under the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975. The local
e        authority team for that purpose includes police officers. I recommend that this practice should continue.

            3.16 The Green Guide provides at paragraph 17.6 th at loud-hailers should be available for the use of
         stewards and police in directing or instructing spectators. N either stewards nor police had loud-hailers?
         The difficulties of communicating in an emergency ot this sort are illustrated by the fact that when a police
         officer asked for a fire extinguisher another officer thought he wanted the fire brigade. Although the
         communication difficulties played no part in this disaster, there is undoubtedly a greater sense o f urgency
n        if instructions are given by a loud-hailer. There is also added authority. 1 endorse the provision in the
ie       Green Guide.

            3.17 There was no police radio control unit on this ground. It was located half a mile away or so. It
         has to be a m atter o f judgm ent and of physical space where the control unit is situated. There is always
         the danger, if it is situated in the ground that that the control unit itself may be burnt down or vandalised.
         In a large well equipped ground it would obviously be better to have an officer in control of communication
         on the ground. He could see w hat was happening and direct matters accordingly. I shall be recommending
         the introduction o f closed-circuit television as a weapon against hooliganism. If possible the officer, or
         officers, should be monitoring the cameras trom a position in the ground where they themselves can see
         w hat is happening.

            3.18 It is, however, up to each individual police force to locate their control unit as seems best to them
         to deal with the problems which arise. If the control is at headquarters there is available sophisticated
         communications and tape recording equipment. A lot o f problems at any football ground are not only
         inside the ground but outside. M r Domaille favoured having the control room in the ground at Bradford.
         Inspector Boocock, who is a communications officer of the West Y orkshire M etropolitan Police, had in
         fact been to the ground in the previous November with M r Briggs to see if they could find a site for a
         control room. The only available accommodation was the drying room which was not satisfactory and
         accordingly control was operated from outside, without adverse effect.
            3.19 The police enquiry into the events arising from the Luton/Millwall game had strong reservations
         about a control unit being sited on the ground. It must be a m atter for each police force.

         The Public Address System
            3.20 There was at Bradford no means by which the police could cut into the public address system. On
         other grounds I have found the same thing. Quite often the only way for the police to get in touch with
         the person in charge of the public address system is to use a telephone. This is obviously unsatisfactory. It
     f   is not possible for a civilian user o f the public address system to be allowed to use the police radio network.
         T he reasons for that are obvious. It is, however, clear that it is vital th at the police should be able to cut


                                                                13




                                                                                                                  !»
. into the public address system. The G reen G uide in paragraph 17,5 says: “ Preferably, the system should
  be capable o f being controlled from a central control point.” I endorse th at view.
                                 i. '
      3.21 M r T h o rn to n was the pools p ro m o to r employed by the Bradford City Football Club, and responsible
  for using the public address system. It was his practice to play recorded music before the m atch started, at
  h a lf time and after the m atch. H e m ade announcem ents abo ut sponsorship, police messages, cham pionship
  ceremonies an d so on, as was necessary. There was to be a draw at h alf time and he was to announce the
  w inning ticket num ber. F o r th at purpose he was in the m anager’s office and was trying to contact one of
  the players who was to m ake the draw,

    3.22 As a result o f som ething th a t was said, he saw some smoke. H e w ent ou t o nto the balcony and
 then saw a small fire. H e then ran into the general office and asked the secretary to phone the fire brigade,
 which was done in his presence. H e then went back to the public address system and announced a message
 to this effect: “ Please d o not panic, m ake your way to the front, on to the pitch,”

   3.23 He said in his evidence th at he gave that message twice. H e says he heard the message himself and
 he h ad spoken to a num ber o f people since who did hear the message. H e repeated it on a third occasir
 but he does n o t think th a t th a t got through.

    3.24 There is an appreciable body o f evidence that no message was in fact heard. W hether th a t was due
 to the excessive noise o r due to the fact th a t the system was n o t working properly, due to the fire, it is not
 necessary to decide. I am satisfied th at M r. T hornton did m ake the announcem ent which he said he did.
 Even if it h ad been heard, I think it unlikely it would have m ade any difference to the consequences o f the
 fire.

    3.25 Paragraph 17.5 o f the G reen G uide also says:
    “Public address equipm ent should be installed so th at broadcast messages can be heard u nder reasonable
    conditions by all persons o f norm al hearing in any p a rt o f the ground to which the public has access, . . .
    T he power supply to the system should be such as to enable it to continue to operate in an emergency
    such as a fire, o r a failure o f the m ains supply,”

   3.26 I endorse the recom m endation th at the system should be such as to enable it to operate in an
 emergency and not as happened here, so th a t once one speaker was out o f action all the others were.



 Police Radios
   3.27 It is clear from the evidence given at the public inquiry, from the transcript o f the tape and fron,
 hearing the tape myself, that a num ber o f problem s arose form the use o f police radios.

   3.28 Each group o f officers had a personal radio, no t every officer. There can be no criticism o f that. A
 special channel was arranged fo r reporting to control.

   3.29 The problem o f com m unication a t B radford, as indeed elsewhere, is that the personal radio sets are
 only devised for one officer to speak at a time. T hus an officer seeking to send a message, calls control.
 C ontrol then replies. If another officer seeks to speak at the same time, the effect will be that neither officer
 can be properly understood by control.

    3.30 Because o f the enorm ous noise a t any football ground, particularly during an emergency, it is very
 difficult for the reporting officer to m ake him self understood by control. There was a considerable body of
 evidence o f officers having relayed messages to control which were no t received, and o f messages which
 were received, bu t no t in fu ll O ne example has already been given at paragraph 2.4. A lthough the messages
 are exceedingly difficult for the untrained to decipher, the control o perator who was trained and experienced,
 was able to understand enough o f the vital messages so the the difficulties o f com m unication played no
 p a rt in the tragedy.

    3.31 But the fact th a t there were difficulties in com m unication caused some disquiet. As a result I heard
 the evidence o f M r A Hulm e, w ho is a C hief Telecom m unications Engineer with the H om e Office D irectorate
 o f Telecom m unications. He described the operational system, namely a channel specially allocated for this
 particular exercise, personal radios o f the B um dept type and control located at a base station on the top


                                                           14
 iid         IbT an office block in Bradford. Normally everybody on the ground with a personal radio hears a message
             ^transmitted by control, but only control hears the message from the police officer’s personal radio. It is
             ■ possible, however, to operate on what is called the “ talk through” , so that every officer hears the message
             ‘which his colleague is transmitting. T hat was the system which operated on this day. In addition to the
             fproblem of one officer talking over another officer there is the very real problem caused by the effect of
             ’ the noise in the area where the officer is trying to transm it. The personal radios with which we are concerned
             |a re the familar type which effectively are boxes with a built-in microphone. There are m ore sophisticated
             ^microphones which serve to cut out background noise, descibed as noise cancelling types, but they are of
             ::head-set type installation. There is an operational objection to their use. It is undesirable that an officer
              ‘wearing a head set should come into confrontation with a hooligan.
             'ri-L.i


                  3.32             M r Hulme said that in the range of equipment th at they had at the moment there was no means of
age       ^ in c o r p o r a tin g a better microphone into that box.

               , 3.33 It is not only in relation to fire but also in relation to hooliganism that is essential that a police
md            officer can communicate and be clearly understood by control. I recommend therefore that early attention
ion        W be given by the Home Office Directorate o f Telecommunications to consider the practicality o f producing a
           ' ~tmresuitable personal radio.                                  “ "       "

              Access for Emergency Vehicles
                       3.34     Paragraph 11 of the Green Guide deals with access for emergency vehicles. It does not spell out
                    ■that an area around the ground should be kept clear so that emergency vehicles can readily reach the
         -sri+fi.L:
                     ground. In the television film helpfully provided by Y orkshire Television it was clear that a fire appliance
                     had to mount a pavement because o f parked cars. N o complaint was made by the fire brigade about this,
                     nor any suggestion that it had any adverse effect on putting out the fire.

              v 3.35 Cars were allowed to be parked in Burlington Street. It might appear from the plan that that
              connects with Valley Parade but it does not, in fact, do so. It was expected that emergency vehicles would
              come down Valley Parade and not Burlington Street. However, it is quite impossible during an emergency
              for every driver o f an emergency vehicle to know precisely which road he should go down. Additionally,
              o f course, a fire appliance may be needed at one p art o f the ground, an ambulance at another. Accordingly,
  an
              I recommend that there should be incorporated in the Green Guide in paragraph 11 a provision that, wherever
              practicable, roads within a quarter o f a mile o f a sports ground should be kept entirely free o f parked vehicles.
              1 appreciate that at some grouncTs~this may interfere with "the control ot buses bringing visiting supporters
              and add to the hooligan problem. In London and some other cities it may be impossible because o f the
              location o f the ground.            ~

rom           Power of Search

                 3.36    Some disquiet was expressed by the police about their powers to search in England and Wales.
at. A         Those powers are now contained in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which comes into effect on
              1 January 1986. Section 1 reads:
                   “(1) A constable may exercise any power conferred by this section:-
                       (a)    in any place to which at the time when he proposes to exercise the power the public or any section
                             o f the public has access, on payment or otherwise, as o f right by virtue o f express or implied
                             perm ission.........................
                   (2 ) Subject to subsections (3) to (5) below, a constable:—
                     (a) may search:—
                             (i) any person or vehicle;
                           (ii) anything which is in or on a vehicle, for stolen or prohibited articles; and
                       (b) may detain a person or vehicle for the purpose of such a search.
                   (3) This section does not give a constable power to search a person or vehicle or anything in or on a
                       vehicle unless he has reasonable grounds for suspecting that he will find stolen or prohibited articles.”
leard
orate                  (7) An article is prohibited for the purposes o f this P art o f this Act if it is:—
r this                 (a) an offensive weapon; or
e top                  (b) an article:—


                                                                            15
         (i) m ade o r adapted for use in the course o f o r in connection with an offence to which this sub-
             p aragraph applies: o r
        (ii) intended by thje person having it w ith him for such use by him o r by some other person.”
  “ (9) In this P a rt o f this Act:—
        “ offensive w eapon” m eans any article:—
    (a) m ade o r adapted for use for causing injury to persons; or
    (b) intended by the person having it with him for such use by him o r by some o ther person.”

  3.37 By Section 2, the constable is required to give his nam e and the nam e o f his police station, the
object o f the proposed search and his grounds for proposing to m ake it.

   3.38 It is quite clear th at large num bers o f people bring into football grounds offensive weapons. H ow
this can be dealt with under the A ct is a m atter which will have to be considered hereafter. So far as fire is
concerned, there is an increasing use o f sm oke bombs, which m ay well not come within the definition o f
an offensive w eapon, (ie is “m ade o r adapted fo r use for causing injury to persons”) this m akes the exercise
o f the pow er o f the police to stop and search a person w hom they suspect o f carrying a smoke bom b, <
even w hom they can see is carrying a smoke bom b, exceedingly difficult.

    3.39 It was suggested th a t it should be a condition o f entry to a sports ground th a t a person is willing
to be searched. T h at governs the problem once inside the ground, but does not deal with the problem o f
how to search spectators before entry. This, however, has plain practical difficulties. Once spectators are
inside the ground, their num bers m ay be such th a t it is alm ost impossible to conduct a satisfactory search.
I t is also im portant th a t they should not get into the ground if they are carrying m aterial which is likely to
dam age either property or persons.

   3.40 Likewise, it is quite im practical when there are very substantial num bers o f supporters pouring
through the gates to go through the routine o f giving the nam e o f the officer, the police station, the object
o f the proposed search and the grounds fo r proposing to m ake it. M ore particularly, an officer may have
no reasonable grounds for suspecting th a t he may find a prohibited article on a particular spectator, other
th an the fact th a t it is frequently brought into sports grounds.

   3.41 If police officers can in fact be given the right to stop and search anyone when they have entered
the ground (by m aking it a condition o f entry) it would in my view be m uch m ore satisfactory th at they
should have the same right by statute before entry. D oubts have been raised w hether the right o f search
before entry can be conveyed to a police officer by m aking the right a condition o f entry. If there is no
such right, the police then have to fall back on the powers under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
which require “ reasonable grounds for suspecting” . While they may have reasonable grounds for suspecting
in general they may have none in relation to a particular individual. I am m inded'to recommend, therefore,
that in England and Wales the police be given the unfettered right o f search before entry to fo o tb a ll grounds
by statute.

   3.42 Smoke bom bs m ay do no actual dam age but the panic which they are likely to engender am ong
spectators is very great. I recommend that consideration be given to m aking it a criminal offence in England
and Wales to have a sm oke bomb or similar device at sports grounds. In Scotland it m ay already constitute
the common law offence o f breach o f the peace.

Fire Services
   3.43 It so happened th at on the day before the m atch, fire officers had gone to the ground at the request
o f the football club, in order to help to w ater the pitch. They left on the ground some seven lengths o f
hose o f 75 feet each. W hen the fire broke out on the Saturday afternoon, Leading Firem an Evers together
w ith Firem an H anney, finding the hose which was rolled up in front o f G block, decided to try an d get
the hose up through the terracing to the fire hydrant which was outside the ground at the no rth end o f
South Parade. Having run out the hose on the sideline o f the pitch they decided th a t it w ould be more
useful if they discontinued trying to get the hose into operation and helped people over the wall. This they
did.

  3.44 Sub-Officer Greig was in charge o f a w ater tender located ab o u t half a mile away from the ground
which was the first fire appliance to arrive. He parked by the entrance to the Club. W hen he arrived there


                                                        16
       were a vast num ber o f people running away from the ground, thick clouds o f smoke, and flames lifting
       from the exit ju st at the left o f the club ground.
       T-'' ■
       ■■ 3.45 T he capacity o f his w ater tender was insufficient to deal with the fire. H e located the hydrants. A
       plan showing the hydrants was prepared for the Inquiry. The nearest ones were all 4” hydrants. M r Greig
       said th a t for a fire o f this m agnitude they were n o t adequate, and the nearest hydrant which was a double
       hydrant o f 12” was ab o u t half a mile away, at Snowden Street.

         3.46 In a w ritten submission to the Inquiry m ade by the Fire Brigades U nion it was suggested th a t the
       water supplies adjacent to the ground were insufficient to deal with the severity o f fire, and th a t it was the
       norm al practice for w ater authorities to restrict the m eter supplies at weekends.

         3.47 M r G reig was asked about th at. H e said: “ The pressure was as it normally is in th a t area, it is just
       the fact th a t I knew there would not be sufficient w ater, which is the reason I decided to go for the double
       hydrant o n Snowden Street, there was no o ther reason th a n th a t and my own local knowledge.”

          3.48 H aving spoken to Leading F irem an Evers, M r G reig asked for five pum ps, two specials and four
       am bulances. H e knew th a t the initial attendance would be two pum ping appliances from Bradford. He
       also knew th a t he would get a Sim onitor which is an appliance with an extendable boom at the head of
       which is a m onitor for directing w ater. T hus he would have 10 appliances.
.:21
       3.49 M r G reig said th a t there were cars parked on C ornw all R oad and Cornwall Terrace. They did not
    hinder his entrance at all; the problem was the people running away from the ground. H e was instructed
_   by the Station Officer from B radford to look after the w ater supplies. H e got hold o f a police traffic
    m otorcyclist, told him where he w anted his appliances an d the police officer took them to the hydrants
  • th a t M r G reig identified. A t th a t time two or three m ore pum ping appliances had been asked for.

          3.50 M r G reig said th a t when he arrived there was no chance o f putting out the fire. H aving seen the
       film and looked at the timings th a t is clearly right.

          3.51 The only difficulty encountered was spoken o f by F irem an W ood who described three occasions of
       vehicles driving over and breaking the hose connections. These were emergency vehicles and by the time
       the hoses had been connected there was n o chance o f saving the stand.

          3.52 M r K neale was the A ssistant C hief Fire Officer fo r the West Y orkshire Fire Service and was on
       duty on the day at headquarters. H e went to the ground. N o one in the fire service mentioned any specific
       difificulty in getting to the scene to him; an d the driver o f the appliance which appeared to have been held
       up on the television also did n o t com plain to him.

       Fire Precautions at the ground
          3.53 T he only fire extinuishers at the ground were the portable fire extinguishers in the club house. It is
       generally agreed th a t it is n o t possible to have fire extinguishers at a football ground in places which would
       otherwise be suitable, because o f the dangers arising from their use by hooligans. It is very unlikely th a t
       even if there had been a fire extinguisher readily available it would have made the slightest difference to
       this fire.

           3.54     However, it would obviously be prudent fo r thought to be given as to whether fire extinguishers
       could not be housed somewhere away from the eyes o f supporters such as refreshment stands o r stores.
       The provision o f fire equipm ent at designated grounds is governed by safety certificates. I recommend that
       those managing grounds not governed by safety certificates should give serious consideration, with the assistance
       o f fire authorities, to the presence in a ground o f suitable fire fighting equipment. Paragraph 10.5 o f the Green
       G uide reads:
         “ 10.5 Fire fighting equipm ent
         10.5.1 In m ajor grounds it may be necessary to provide a suitable w ater supply for fire fighting in the
         form o f statutory o r private fire hydrants.
         10.5.2 F o r first aid fire fighting by m em bers o f the staff hydraulic hose reels should preferably be provided.
         These should be sufficient to provide adequate protection to the whole floor area, and should be installed
         in suitable positions by entrances, exits and stairways.
         10.5.3 W here hose reels are not provided portable fire extinguishers should be installed in sufficient
         num bers to give adequate cover. The num ber and type will depend upon the size, layout, fire separation


                                                                17
  an d risk in each building. Fire extinguishers should conform to the appropriate British Standard
  specification and be m aintained in good w orking order.
  10.5.4 W here high fire risk areas such as large storeroom s and enclosed o r underground car parks are
  situated under stands consideration should be given to the installation o f an autom atic fire extinguishing
  system such as sprinklers, or, alternatively, an autom atic detection system.
  10.5.5 Advice should be sought for the local fire authority on the type, am ount and siting o f fire fighting
  equipm ent required.”
   I endorse its views.

    3.55 It is no use having reels o f hose or fire extinguishers in a football ground unless someone is trained
 to use them . N one o f the stewards at Bradford, an d I suspect elsewhere, had ever had any fire training.
.Some o f the safety certificates th a t I have seen for designated grounds provide th a t stewards s h a llb e.
 trained. I recommend that this practice should be adopted in all sports grounds■ It was suggested to me that
 the presence o f a fire officer throughout a m atch would be o f assistance. A t some grounds I have visited
 they go ro u nd the ground before the m atch and then leave. There are undoubted difficulties o f financing
 and m anning in the fire service, and it m ay well n o t be practical to have on every sports ground a trained
 fire officer. However, it is essential th a t there should be a fire warning system to alert the staff in case o f
 fire w ithout causing panic to the public. O n some grounds th at I have visited this is done by means o f a
 coded signal. P aragraph 10.3 o f the G reen G uide recommends th at there should be a fire w arning system
 to alert the staff and I endorse that. There were no sprinklers in this ground. I have had m any suggestions
 from m em bers o f the public about the use o f sprinklers and o f perm anent w ater pipes in and around the
 ground to control hooliganism. I d o n o t regard these as, either practical o r desirable. So far as sprinklers
 to p u t out fire are concerned, there are problem s a b o u t their use at football grounds. The risk o f abuse by
 hooligans is substantial. But it is u p to each local fire authority to decide on the fire precautions which are
 particularly appropriate to the premises which they have to consider.

   3.56 Finally, I would like to com m end the fire services for the efficient and expeditious’way in which
 they dealt with this very serious fire.

 The position of the Fire Authority at law
    3.57 By Section 10.1 o f the Fire Precautions A ct 1971, Sub Section 2, “ If as regards any premises to
 which this Section applies the Fire A uthority are satisfied th at the risk to persons in the case o f fire is so
 serious th at, until steps have been taken to reduce' the risk, to a reasonable level, the use o f the premises
 ought to be prohibited or restricted, the authority may m ake a com plaint to the court; and the court on
 being similarly satisfied m ay by order prohibit o r restrict, to the extent appropriate in the circumstances
 o f the case, the use o f the premises until such steps have been taken as, in the opinion o f the court, are
 necessary to reduce the risk to a reasonable level.” “ C o u rt” means a m agistrates’ court.

    3.58 By the Safety o f Sports G rounds A ct 1975, safety certificates are required in respect o f premises
 designated under th a t Act. Safety certificates axe issued by the local authority. One o f the authorities
 concerned with the issue o f that safety certificate is the Fire Authority. Detailed conditions are included in
 the safety certificate particularly relating to fire. A copy o f a typical safety certificate appears at Appendix
 5.

    3.59 The view th at the Fire A uthority took in this case about fire prevention in non-designated grounds
 was set out by M r Byrom w ho is senior divisional officer o f the West Yorkshire Fire Service. He was asked
 w hat he regarded as being the actual responsibility of the fire service for fire prevention in places like
 B radford City football ground which is a non-designated ground. He said: “ It would be the same as
 happens in all the other premises th a t the fire service are responsible for, and anywhere in the country
 w here people w ork, play, meet, drink, whatever, we would give goodwill advice on request and it would
 then be the responsibility o f the person receiving th at advice to carry out that request. It is an impossible
 task to be everywhere where everyone works or plays.” M r Byrom explained th at the Fire A uthority had
 neither the resources no r the finances to visit sports grounds, th at if they were asked for their view ab o u t
 a p articu lar problem they would give it, and th a t thereafter it was up to the owner o f the premises to take
 such steps as he thought fit to deal w ith the problem .

   3.60 So far as Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is concerned, it seems th at fire authorities
 exercise their powers under that Section only when the circumstances are such th at there is an immediate
 danger to persons and th a t any delay whatsoever in taking action upon the dangerous circumstances could
be tantam ount to accepting there was no danger. P u t a n o th er way, w hatever interpretation is p u t on Section
10 o f the Fire Precautions A ct 1971, in practice, it is only used where there is an immediate risk o f a fire
taking place. It was suggested th a t, if there is a duty to exercise the power under Section 10 there is also a
corresponding duty to carry out inspections so as to ensure th a t premises have n o t got into a state where
Section 10 should be invoked. The W est Y orkshire Fire A uthority do not accep t'th at proposition, no r do
I. Section 10 gives the pow er to a fire authority if a risk comes to its notice. They are not, however, required
to take steps to ascertain the risks, n o r do they have the resources so to do.

   3.61 It was rightly pointed out to me th at unless some responsibility is p ut upon the fire authority to
examine sports grounds (apart from a ground which is designated and therefore requires a safety certificate)
the risks o f a fire on a Bradford scale will continue. There is m uch force in this argum ent. I am minded to
make two recommendations—firstly that Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 should be amended so
that it reads: “ ................i f the Fire Authority is satisfied that the risTc to persons in the case o f fire is such
that until steps have been taken to reduce the risk                        Secondly, that because o f the greater ease o f
access there should be power fo r the Fire Authority to apply to the High Court fo r an injunction under Section
10 or in Scotland fo r an interdict to the Court o f Session. By changing the wording from “ so serious” to
“ such” the Fire Authority will then have power to m ake the application where something less than an
emergency exists. It is hoped that the power will be exercised in cases other than those which are now
regarded as wholly exceptional.

  3.62 On 18 July 1984, as a result o f a visit by an engineer of the West Y orkshire M etropolitan County
Council, a letter was written to the Secretary o f Bradford City Football Club about the state o f the ground.
There were two m atters of fire risk m entioned, and they were these:
  “M ain grandstand. . . (B)— The tim ber construction is a fire hazard and in particular there is a build up
  o f combustible materials in the voids beneath seats. The carelessly discarded cigarette could give rise to
  a fire risk. (C)— Egress from the grandstand should be achieveable in 2.5 minutes.”

  3.63 A copy of that letter was sent to the fire service, they took the view that it was a m atter o f good
housekeeping for the occupiers o f the football ground to deal with and saw no reason to take the m atter
any further.

The local authority
  3.64 W est Yorkshire M etropolitan C ounty Council is the responsible local authority under the terms of
the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975. The only ground in their area which was designated and certified
was the ground at Elland R oad belonging to Leeds U nited. A copy o f their safety certificate appears at
Appendix 5. As a result o f a decision o f the Fire Services Committee on 5 M arch 1976, a working team
was set up. It consisted o f a-representative o f the D irectorate o f Engineering, a representative o f the Chief
Fire Officer, the Assistant Clerk Special Services and an administrative officer both from the Chief
Executive’s and the Clerk’s D epartm ent. In addition, the team was augmented by a senior police officer
for the Division where the particular stadium was located, and by a representative o f the building control
officer for that District.

  3.65 The West Yorkshire M etropolitan County Council Fire Services Committee, following meetings
held in 1975 and 1976 resolved on the 2 June 1977:
“(a) T h at the Executive D irector o f Engineering, the C hief Fire Officer and the D irector o f Administration
      (or their nominees) be designated “ Authorised Officers” under Section 1 o f the Safety o f Sports
      G rounds Act 1975.
 (b) T h at the Director o f A dm inistration in consultation with the Chief Constable and the Local Building
      A uthority be authorised to issue safety certificates under the A ct.”

  3.66 The time scale o f designation in relation to a 3rd Division club being prom oted to the 2nd Division
was considered. It involved waiting for a club actually to be prom oted, and as a result o f that a whole
season could elapse with a club playing in the 2nd Division before the whole o f the safety requirements
had been fulfilled.

   3.67 It was also thought im portant by West Yorkshire M etropolitan County Council to prom ote safety
at non-designated grounds which nevertheless might stage matches which attracted considerable crowds.
O n 3 August 1982 a letter was written to Huddersfield Town Football Club, Halifax Town Football Club,
B radford City Football Club, Yorkshire County Cricket Club, and Leeds Rugby Football Club, pointing


                                                             19
o u t th at, while they were n o t yet subject to the Safety a t Sports G rounds A ct 1975, C ounty Council officers
were willing to give guidance on w hat m ight be required, by asking the grounds to accept the offer o f
assistance and to arrange a.meeting. N o reply was received to th at invitation from B radford City Football
Club. In February 1976 and twice in M arch 1976 as a result o f a request by the police, an official from the
D irectorate m ade visits to the ground and p u t a m axim um capacity on the num ber o f people who could
use the ground. T he Club was visited in N ovem ber 1981 for inspection o f the floodlight towers.

   3.68 The next tim e there was any contact between the Council and the C lub was ju st prior to 4 July
1984, when M r N ew m an, the Club Secretary, inquired w hether the C ounty Council would be prepared to
provide a letter which could help the Club in obtaining a g ran t from the F ootball G rounds Im provem ent
T rust to assist with the repair and recovering o f the m ain grandstand a t Valley Parade.

  3.69 M r Shaw, who was the principal engineer dealing with the m atter, arranged to meet M r N ew m an
on 4 July 1984. M r N ew m an explained to him the problem concerning the ro o f covering and reference was
m ade to a report prepared by the Tim ber Research an d D evelopm ent A ssociation (T R A D A ) concerning
the necessary repairs.

  3.70 Having looked initially at the m ain stan d ro o f structure an d m ade notes, M r Shaw then h ad v
quick look aro u n d the ground while M r N ew m an was looking for the tim ber report.

  3.71 Two letters were then drafted on b ehalf o f the Council to be sent to the Club, the first d ated 11
July 1984 read as follows:
  “ I refer to my engineer’s visit to your g round on 4 July 1984 and a copy o f the inspection repo rt by
  T R A D A o f the west grandstand ro o f covering, passed to him . I wish to confirm the findings o f that
  rep o rt th a t the existing felt ro o f covering an d the areas o f decayed boarding resulting, consequently
  creates an unacceptable crow d safety hazard an d should be rectified as soon as possible.”
   M r Shaw agreed th a t the “ unacceptable crow d safety hazard ” referred to the condition o f the ro o f
covering and th a t the opinion o f M r Tow nend o f T R A D A in his report was “ from the inform ation gained
from the inspection there would ap p ear to be no m ajor imm ediate danger to the crowd using the stand,
o ther than from w ater leaking th rough.” M r Shaw said th a t he w rote the letter o f 11 July in order to help
the club obtain a grant. Unless the C ounty Council h ad said th a t the repairs were necessary as a m atter o f
safety the grant would n o t be obtainable.

  3.72 T hat letter was sent, together with a letter o f 18 July 1984, which read as follows:
     “ D ear Sir
     S a fety in Sports Grounds
     Bradford C ity A F C
       F u rth er to my engineer’s visit to your ground o f 4 July 1984,1 am pleased to enclose a letter which
     m ay assist you in obtaining a grant from the Sports G ro u n d T rust, tow ards the cost o f re-covering
     the main grandstand roof. N othing in th a t letter should be construed as implied approval o f the
     condition o r structural adequacy o f the stand.
         As the West Y orkshire M etropolitan C ounty Council is the Licensing A uthority under the Safety
     o f Sports G ro u n d Act 1975, it may assist you to know w hat some o f the C ouncil’s o ther considerations
     would be, should at some tim e in the future the provisions o f the Act apply to B radford City A F C
     ground.
       These are:
       1. M ain Grandstand
       (a) The unusual construction o f this stand m akes an appraisal o f structural adequacy desirable.
       (b) The tim ber construction is a fire hazard and in particular, there is a build-up o f com bustible
           m aterials in the voids beneath the seats. A carelessly discarded cigarette could give rise to a fire
           risk.
       (c) Egress from the grandstand should be achievable in 2.5 m inutes.

       2. Other Stands
       (a) A ppraise for structural adequacy, and m aintain to adequate corrosion protection standards.
       (b) Repair defective ro o f sheeting.

           4. Crush Barriers
           (a) Test, strengthen and repair to acceptable standard.

           5. Terraces
           (a) O verhaul terracing to provide acceptable surfacing an d slope.
           (b) Provide adequate exits from terracing.
            These considerations are contained within the publication “ Guide to Safety a t Sports G rounds—
         F ootball” published by H.M .S.O .
            In concluding may I p o in t o u t th a t the above considerations would form p a rt o f the statutory
         consultation process required under the provisions o f the Act. The C ounty Council is obliged by
         law to have regard to other considerations eg. Fire Safety/Precautions (Chief Fire Officer); crowd
         control/supervision (Chief Constable); and local building control requirements (B radford M etropolitan
         D istrict Council).
         Y ours faithfully,
         Executive D irector o f Engineering.”

    3.73 There was no reply to th a t letter. On 30 April 1985 the County Council wrote again “ I am sure
 th a t the people o f the county are pleased with your success in getting prom otion to the 2nd Division of
 the F ootball League. C ongratulations are due to all concerned on this achievement. As you know your
 g ro u n d will probably eventually require a general safety certificate since it is norm al practice for the
 Secretary o f State to designate grounds within the 2nd Division as needing such a certificate under the
 term s o f the above Act. This duty is the responsibility o f this authority. There are several disciplines, police,
 fire service, structural engineering and building control, which are involved in such m atters, and I think
 th a t an early meeting o f these officers, together with club officials, would be useful so th a t a general
 discussion on procedure, requirem ents etc, can take place. Perhaps you m ight let me have a few dates on
 which this preliminary meeting m ight take place.”
       T h a t meeting was scheduled for the W ednesday after this disaster.

    3.74 T he C ounty Council took the same view as the Fire Service, namely th at having offered to give
 advice they were under no obligation to take any further steps. They took the same attitude towards Section
 10 o f th e Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 as the Fire Service had to Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions
 A ct 1971.
       Section 10 o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 reads:
       “ I f the court is satisfied, on the application o f the local authority, that the risk to spectators at a sports
       gro un d is so great that, until steps have been taken to reduce it to a reasonable level, their admission
       o u g h t to be prohibited o r restricted, the court may by order prohibit o r restrict to the extent the court
       considers appropriate in the circumstances o f the case, admission o f spectators to the whole o r any part
       o f the ground, until such steps have been taken as, in the opinion o f the court, are necessary to reduce
       the risk to a reasonable level.”

        3.75 T he local authority regarded their powers under section 10 as emergency powers. The note alongside
     Section 10 says in the Act: “ Emergency Procedure” . In August 1975, just before the Act came into force,
     the H om e Office issued a guidance note to the C hief Executives o f County Councils which reads inter alia:
     “ Section 10 is an im p ortan t emergency power. Should a m agistrates’ court, on the application o f a local
     a u th o rity , consider th a t the risk to spectators at any sports ground is so great that their admission should
     be prohibited o r restricted until remedial action has been taken, the court may make an order accordingly.
     T his p o w er applies to any sports ground whether o r not it is required to have a safety certificate. In practice
     it is n o t expected th at the power will often need to be exercised. In the case o f a small football stadium ,
     for exam ple, not subject to the designation order procedure, consultations between the local authority and
     the club concerned are expected to secure the provision of a reasonable standard o f safety on a voluntary
     basis” .
    3.76      The local authority explained th a t they h ad neither the resources in m anpow er nor in finance to
 examine every single sports ground and take offenders to court. I am minded to m ake a recommendation
 sim ilar to that in respect p f the fir e authority, namely that Section 10 o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds A ct
 1975 should be am ended in like manner to Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A ct 1971, and that an application
fo r an injunction to the High Court (or in Scotland fo r an interdict to the Court o f Session) should be an
 alternative remedy.

   3.11      I am satisfied th at the local authorities have set ut> a proper organisation for im plementing the
 Safety o f Sports G rounds A ct 1975 and operate it in a satisfactory m anner.

 The Health & Safety Executive
   3.78 The H ealth & Safety Executive are the governm ent body responsible for enforcing a num ber o f
statu to ry provisions, m ost notably the H ealth & Safety a t W ork A ct 1974. The H ealth & Safety Executive
were given responsibility under the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 for a very limited range o f specialised
purposes where the m anufacture o r storage o f highly hazardous m aterials create special problem s arising
from processes. Section 3 o f the H ealth & Safety at W ork A ct 1974 states, “ It should be the duty o f every
em ployer to conduct his undertaking in such a way as to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable, tl
persons not in his em ploym ent w ho m ay be affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their health or
safety.”

   3.79 W hen th at Bill was going through Parliam ent, the D epartm ent o f Em ploym ent m ade it clear that
responsibility for fire m atters w ould not fall to the H ealth & Safety Executive but would be the concern of
the Fire A uthorities. A num ber o f instructions were issued to the Factory Inspectorate and they can be
summ arised as follows:
 (A) The prim ary responsibility for the general fire precautions in the place o f w ork will rest with the Fire
      A uthorities u nd er the Fire Precautions A ct 1971.
  (B) Because o f the very b ro ad term s o f the H ealth & Safety at W ork A ct 1974 inspectors have authority
      to deal with all aspects o f safety, an d so there will inevitably be a certain dual responsibility for fire
      safety. It m ust be bom e in m ind th a t the enforcing au thority under the Fire Precautions Act 1971
      has the prim e responsibility and the provisions in th a t A ct should be used wherever possible. T hat
      authority is the Fire A uthority. Inspectors m ust avoid any appearance o f interfering in the Fire
      A uthority’s duty.
 (C) Inspectors will n o t norm ally inspect general fire precautions when undertaking inspection on premises
     other than special premises. This policy has been reconfirmed by the C hief Inspector within the last
     two years.
 (D) However, if m atters o f serious concern are discovered with regard to general fire precautions but no
     immediate risk to life is involved, they should be discussed with the appropriate officer o f the Fi
     Authority. Inspectors should not, w ithout consulting their A rea Director, issue im provem ent notices
     in respect o f general fire precautions in premises where the prim ary responsibility rests with the Fire
     Authority.
 (E) W here an im m ediate risk to life is involved, the responsibility o f issuing an im mediate prohibition
     notice should be considered; if it is decided to issue such a notice the inspector should telephone the
     Fire A uthority with a view to taking jo in t action.

  j 3-80 Although it is accepted th a t under Section 3 o f the H ealth & Safety at W ork Act 1974 the Factory
 Inspectorate could enforce m easures to afford protection to the public, faced with the all embracing nature
.of the Section, they had to consider h o w to enforce it in such a way as to m ake the best use o f their
xesiiurces. They were also anxious not to cut across the duties o f other local authorities responsible Ynr
 specific aspects o f public safety.

    3.81 They therefore adopted a policy o f concentrating the enforcem ent o f Section 3 on the remedying
 o f hazards which were not caught within the net o f other legislation. The effect o f th a t was that, so far as
ike, was concerned, except in special premises, they did n ot regard it as their concern.

   3.82 In Septem ber 1980, before the present B radford City Football C lub was form ed, M r Laird, who is
the Principal Officer at Leeds employed by the H ealth & Safety Executive attended at the ground and saw
M r Newm an. The report on th at visit is set out in a contem poraneous note made by M r L aird. The relevant
p art o f the note reads as follows: “ There was very little com pliance with the G uide to Safety at Sports
G rounds, and M r N ew m an said th at although he knew o f the existence o f the G uide it was not really his
responsibility to see w hether o r not particular recom m endations o f the G uide were met. Responsibility for
Structural safety at the ground was with M r G arside, a D irector at the Club, w ho was also a builder. It
was agreed with M r N ew m an th a t J would write outlining some o f the m atters requiring attention and in
due course meet M r G arside to discuss the Club’s view o f these m atters.”

  3.83 On 10 September 1980 M r Laird did indeed write a letter. Having pointed out in num bered
paragraphs that part o f the terracing a t the Spion K o p was badly broken, th at the surfaces o f the gangways
were n ot level, th at access from the Spion K op to the M idland R oad exit was extremely steep and the toilet
arrangements behind the M idland R oad stand were unhygienic, M r Laird w rote this:
  “ O ther m atters which I noted which do not present the same degree o f hazard to those referred to above
  included cracks in the wall between M idland R oad stan d and the pitch. The lack o f some crash barriers
  at the Bradford end and the m aintenance o f barriers a t th at end o f the ground; arrangem ents for the
  painting o f the Bradford end ro o f structure should be m ade. In the main stand the void area between
  the concrete supporting structure and the wood floor should, after rem oval o f rubbish, be completely
  blanked off .......... T he foregoing m atters, particularly the num bered ones, are in my opinion as to
  order o f seriousness o f the m atters observed. I would suggest, therefore, you consider these m atters and
  we arrange to meet in ab o u t one m o n th ’s time in o rd er th a t we may discuss possible action” .

   3.84 M r Laird did n o t draw that recom m endation a b o u t the rubbish in the void to the attention o f any
other enforcing authority. The reason was that it said in the Green G uide th at that was a fire hazard and
was therefore the responsibility o f the fire brigade. H e considered it inconceivable th at there could be a
ground the size o f B radford City’s in the middle o f B radford which the fire brigade did not know about.
H e was doing no m ore than following the recom m endations m ade by the D epartm ent.

  3.85 On 15 January 1981 M r Laird again visited the Club, still u nder the old m anagem ent. The Secretary
was not available but there had been w ork done to some o f the terracing at the Spion K op. On 26 January
1981 there was a record o f a telephone call which reads as follows: “ M r Newm an said that the M idland
R oad exit, th a t’s the exit from the K op, was n o t used. Toilet accom m odation would be reviewed at a
meeting in April, other m atters would be attended to as time and funds became available.”

   3.86 On 1 July 1981 M r Bennett from the H ealth & Safety Executive called. N obody in a responsible
 position on behalf o f the club was available. The same position obtained a fortnight later. However, on 16
 July 1981 M r Bennett carried o u t a basic inspection. H e recorded: “ Progress is being m ade on some o f the
 m atters identified by M r Laird at the beginning o f the 1980-81 season. F o r example repairs to the Spion
 K op terracing is continuing, additional crash barriers have been installed, and the re-decorating done. The
 m ost serious outstanding m atter is undoubtedly the very steep exit to M idland R oad from the corner of
 the Spion K op/M idland R oad stand. M r Newm an said application had been m ade for planning permission
'to redevelop the M idland R oad side o f the ground, b u t this depended on finances becoming available, in
 view o f the club’s present League position, Division 4 , 1 do n o t think this will be in the immediate foreseeable
 future

   3.87 On 22 July 1981 M r Bennett w rote a letter to the Club in which he said:

      “There were a num ber o f areas in which you did n o t comply with the recom m endations o f the code,
   I would therefore ask you to consider these and draw up proposals on a time scale for implementing
   suitable modifications. In my opinion the m ost serious area is the very steep exit from the corner o f the
   Spion K op/M idland R oad stand to M idland R oad and this therefore should be a given priority. I would
   also ask you to consider the evacuation procedure for the main stand, this is largely constructed o f wood
   and from paragraph 8 o f the code you will see th at it should be capable o f evacuation in 2 \ minutes.
   Please consider the above points and write to me detailing your'proposals.”

   There was no response to th a t letter.

  3.88 M r Bennett w rote on 3 N ovem ber 1981, draw ing attention to his letter o f 22 July m aking particular
m ention o f the M idland R oad exit. H e asked th a t his letter o f 22 July should be given urgent attention.

    3.89 There was a letter from the C lub on 6 January 1982 to the H ealth & Safety Executive which reads
 as follows:
    “ W ith reference to y our letters o f 22 July and 3 N ovem ber last, it is ou r intention to make M idland Road
   into executive private suites for next season and therefore the entrances will be modified appropriately.”
    3.90 D r H artley, who is also a n Inspector o f the H ealth & Safety Executive, visited the Club o n 6 A pril ‘
 1984, and had a look round the premises. By this time the new Club had been formed. H is note refers to
 two new floodlight towers being erected, b u t th at very little seemed to have been done ab o u t the steep exit
 to M idland R oad.

   3.91 On 1 A ugust 1984 M r L aird visited the ground with the intention o f seeing w hat w ork had been
done. H e inspected the exit from the Spion K op to M idland R oad. The note on the contem poraneous
docum ent was th a t M r Laird would check by telephone by A pril 1985 to find o u t w hat the position was
a b o u t the exit from the Spion K o p to M idland R oad.

   3.92 The reason why the visits were so limited was explained by M r Laird. The H ealth & Safety Executive
have a form in which the Inspector assesses the quality o r otherwise o f the compliance with the statutory
obligations. If it is a high standard o f compliance it is n o t necessary to m ake a frequent inspection; if it is
a very p o o r standard o r non-com pliance it is necessary to m ake a m ore frequent inspection. In Septem ber
1980, the ground was rated as being relatively low priority for inspection and the same applied in 1981
an d 1984.

   3.93 T he inspection rating docum ent, however, records that in 1981 and 1984, there was a finding that
there was a substantial risk to the public; and th at th at risk was “ fire, place o f w ork and m eans o f access.”
M r L aird explained that the substantial risk to the public, which he had in mind, related to the exit to
M idland R oad from the Spion K o p and to the possibility o f people slipping, with consequences similar to
th a t which occurred a t Ibrox Park, when m any people were killed.

   3.94 It is clear from the foregoing th a t M r Laird was doing no m ore than following the directive from
his D epartm ent. It does, however, highlight the problem o f dual responsibility. There is a serious risk o f
duplication o f w ork, resulting in a waste o f resources. T here is also a risk th a t inform ation, available to
one authority responsible for safety, will n o t reach ano th er authority. I f the prim e responsibility for the
safety o f premises in relation to fire is to lie with the Fire A uthority (and it is essential th a t one authority
should be given the responsiblity), then it is absolutely vital th a t any inform ation com ing to the H ealth &
Safety Executive about danger from fire, should instantly be com m unicated to the Fire A uthority.

   3.95 It is also essential th a t any inform ation coming to the Fire A uthority ab o u t m atters for which the
H ealth & Safety Executive are responsible, should be brought to their attention. M r L aird said th a t if,
every time they found some litter lying ab o u t which m ight constitute a fire hazard, they had to notify the
Fire A uthority, they would never get any w ork done; it was really a m atter for the occupier to be responsible
for his own good housekeeping. N aturally it m ust be a m atter o f degree but I recommend that there should
be urgent consultation between the Health & Safety Executive and the fire authorities and local authorities as
to how best to coordinate and communicate their inspections and reports.

The Ambulance Service
    3.96 O ral evidence was not given by the A m bulance Service. However, a very large num ber o f statem ents
 by those involved were available to the public inquiry. There were some criticisms ab o u t staffing levels,
 ab o u t a fault developing in the telephone lines and some criticism o f the facilities for calling in staff. There
 can be no doubt but th a t the A m bulance Service perform ed with its usual high degree o f efficiency and
 devotion. Such criticism as individual officers have will, no doubt, be considered by the ap propriate
.authorities and it is not necessary for me to deal with them further.

St John’s Ambulance
   3.97 There were on duty at the ground ten members o f the St Jo h n ’s A m bulance Brigade. N o oral
evidence was given by their m em bers but their statem ents were before me. Additionally, a w ritten submission
from them was received m aking the following points:
  (a) there was n o statutory requirement for adequate first aid to be provided at any football ground in
      m any cases a first aid room and o ther facilities were either inadequately provided o r not provided at
      all;
 (b) there was a feeling th at the mem bers did n o t receive p roper recognition at football m atches, no r was
     appropriate recompense paid to the St Jo h n ’s Ambulance.

 3.98 Everyone recognises the value o f the w ork done by m em bers o f the St Jo h n ’s A m bulance. The ten
members on the ground undoubtedly did an enorm ously valuable service attending to those injured. They

                ".The Hospital Services
                2 3.100 While not strictly within the terms o f ou r Inquiry, we have received a num ber o f letters praising
                ■ the work o f the hospital staff. It is right that this should be publicly recorded.

                    The Club Stewards
                .     3.101 The stewards at Bradford City Football Club were under the general direction of M r Chappell
                    who was a General Secretary employed by the Bradford Council Social Services Department. He had been
                    acting as a steward at the football ground for a period o f some 36 to 37 years; there had been no formal
                    instructions to the stewards, but M r Chappell said that the stewards were responsible people and they
                    discussed on an informal basis those matters, which they considered relevant. He described his stewards
                    as a team of people who sold cushions and assisted or directed people to designated seats.

                       3.102 There were stewards at the back of Blocks A, B, C, D, E, F and G. They ranged in age from 73
                    to 12 and they were 9 in number. They regarded their job as simply to arrange for the easy entry of
                    spectators to their seats and to direct them to the part of the ground to which they wished to go. Some of
                    them had distinctive jackets, but not all. M r Anthony Keating described the reason for not wearing his
                    this way: “We used to have a steward pinny on but we got spotted out too easily with them you know, we
                    got more trouble than what it was worth so we didn’t bother wearing them after th a t” . W hen asked why
                    he got trouble, he said: “ Because if they see a steward you got a load of m outh after you, booting you up
                    and everything” .

                       3.103 The stewards were not paid. They did it because they were loyal supporters of the club. They had
                    no training in fire fighting nor in crowd evacuation no r in crowd control in the sense o f dealing with
                    hooligans. It is clear that the stewards could have done nothing more to have prevented this fire from
                    starting or spreading.

                      3.104 I recommend, as happens in designated grounds that stewards should be trained and instructed firstly
rities as           about fire fighting, and secondly on how best to assist the police in evacuation. (See also 3.8 and 3.9).

                       3.105 There were two Keating brothers in the main stand on duty on this day, acting as stewards. The
                    whole of their family had been involved in the club in one way or another for some time. M r Anthony
                    Keating who is now 27 had been involved for some 13 years, M r Peter Keating who is 26 had been involved
                    also for 14 years. A set of keys to the doors was kept on a board in the gatesman’s room. It was M r Peter
                    Keating’s responsibility to look after the doors and gates leading into South Parade. It was his practice to
                    unlock those doors some 20 minutes before time. The reason for that was to prevent spectators inside the
                    ground from opening the doors and allowing spectators outside the ground to come in. This was not only
                    because they would not have paid, but more im portantly because it would then not be possible to segregate
                    visiting supporters from home supporters, with all the consequential difficulties resulting therefrom. This
                    practice seems to be prevalent at a number of clubs.

                      3.106 Just before half time he went and opened gate B. Having done so he stood there with his brother
                    Anthony which was his normal practice until five minutes or so after half time when he would have closed
                    the gate. He saw gate E being opened by two policemen. Accordingly, he walked up to that gate along the
                    road outside the ground. He then saw people coming out of gate S onto South Parade from the Paddock.
                    On a previous occasion he had seen people coming out from the Paddock with the idea of getting into the
                    back of the stand without paying. Accordingly, he walked along South Parade in order to see what they
                    were going to do. When he got there he could see a lot of smoke. He was asked by a policeman to open
                    gate X, he tried to do this but was driven back by the smoke. In fact it was not locked because the turnstile
                    operator at T had unlocked it earlier. It was then quite impossible for him to open door R because o f the
The ten               e. This was the only door which was in fact locked and could not be opened by the simple process of
id. They            opening the bolts and pushing at the doors. In fact it was kicked open during the fire.


                                                                         25
     3.107       A t football m atches there is a particular problem o f locked doors because the clulj needs to be
   sure th a t spectators do n o t enter the ground, save through the turnstiles. I was given examples o f cases
   were spectators h ad been able, through one m eans o r another, to open doors which were n o t locked, and
   get in in substantial num bers, w ithout paying. There have been other occasions when the stewards have
   been attacked, in order th a t the keys, which they hold, could be used.

   3.108 It is, however, beyond d o u b t that all doors should be capable o f being opened immediately, in an
   emergency. In theory there should be no difficulty, even if the door is padlocked, in having a steward
   m anning a door, w ho can open it a t a second’s notice.

     3.109 T hat does n o t take account o f hum an failing. The steward m ay well w ant to go to have a cup o f
  tea, go to the lavatory, o r m ore likely, w atch the game. The ro a r o f a-crowd a t a prom otion m atch o r C up
  gam e is likely to arouse the attention o f even the m ost conscientious steward. O n one ground which was
  visited the authorities explained th a t they did n o t pay their stewards b u t watching the game was the reward
  for their attendance.

     3.110 A t one g round I was told o f stewards opening the exit doors tow ards the end o f the second half
  an d then themselves leaving the ground. This enabled supporters to move from one p a rt o f the ground to
  an o th er an d thus breach the segregation arrangem ents. This is yet another reason for doors perm anently
  to be m anned.

     3.111 P aragraph 6.14.6 o f the G reen G uide says:
     “ All exit gates should be m anned at all times while the ground is used by the public so that they can be
     opened immediately in an emergency.”
  - , / recomm end amending this paragraph to read "A ll exit sates should be manned at all times while the,
  ground is used by the public and be capable o f being opened immediately, from inside, by anyone in an
  em ergency”.

  — 3.112 It is n ot sufficient to have adequate an d suitable exit facilities, unless an indication is given to
- spectators as to where they are. W e endorse parag raph 6 . 6 o f the Green G uide th a t an indication o f where
  the exits are should be given by w av o f sign o r other direction.

    3.113 In addition to the recom m endation th a t exit doors should n o t be locked. I also endorse the view
—th a t exit doors should open outw ards only. There have been disasters in public places where the crush o f
 people inside has prevented doors, which will only open inwards, from being opened at all. See Green
 G uide p aragraph 6.14.

    3.114 The position o f the stew ards needs to be reconsidered. The safety certificate issued by the West
  Y orkshire M etropolitan C ounty Council, in respect o f Leeds U nited Football G round, says inter alia:
    “T he holder shall ensure the attendance a t a specified activity, o f stewards in the following num bers and
    w ith the following duties, th a t is to say:
   (a)   2 2 stewards to m an such exit doors and gates, as are n o t open continuously while the stadium is in
         use for the specified activity;
   (b) 50 stewards to control and direct spectators within the stadium and to patrol the stadium and deal
       w ith any emergency including raising the alarm an d extinguishing fires; provided th a t such num bers
       m ay from time to time be varied as directed by the police. Such stewards shall be required by the
       local au thority and the police an d shall be identifiable by dress an d distributed (subject to any direction
       o f the police) in such a m anner as to discharge competently the functions specified above.”

    3.115 In addition, the safety certificate requires the stewards to be properly trained to deal with an
  emergency. The certificate reads as follows:
    “W ritten instructions approved by the local au thority an d the police ab o u t the action to be taken in case
    o f emergency shall be readily available to all staff and stewards a t all times, and in particular each
    m em ber o f staff a n d stew ard shall receive a personal copy o f such instructions. All m em bers o f staff and
    all stewards shall in the m onth o f July in every year receive practical instruction and training appropriate
    to their responsibilities in case o f emergency. Exercises for all staff an d stewards shall be carried out
    regularly to ensure the sm ooth operation o f procedures for dealing with an emergency. All members o f
    staff and stewards shall receive refresher training once at least in the m onths o f O ctober and January in
    every year. All training instructions and exercises shall be carried o u t by a com petent person.”


                                                          26
:to be                 t e r 3 116 It has to be remembered that the prime responsibility for the arrangem ent o f affairs at the ground
                      l i lies'with the football club. To that end they should ensure that the stewards, particularly those that have

m an
sward              ?       3.117 I am conscious that there are financial restraints on football clubs,but it is o f vital importance
                      that stewards should not regard themselves, nor should they be regarded, simply like usherettes at a cinema,
                   ^ showing people to their seats. They should have a real responsibility in regard to the safety of spectators
|u p of             ■■"at grounds. To that end I recommend that the Green Guide should contain a provision, in relation to stewards:
   Cup              ~ ( i ) that they should be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency relating to fire or evacuation;
Eh was                 (2) that they should be g iven written instructions about the action to be taken in cases o f emergency;

Inently
                       The Club
                         3.118 There were two causes of this fire and the resultant casualties; the presence o f litter under the
Ecan be                seating, and the absence of sufficient exits!

                         3.119 There was some evidence that steps had been taken to keep the stands free from litter and to
hile the               extract litter from voids when kick boards were replaced. The fact remains that there was appreciable
   in an
                       quantities o f litter in the voids. W ith the construction o f flooring as it was at Bradford that was almost
                       inevitable. To remedy the situation would have required greater expenditure o f money and resources than
                       was available to the Club.

                          3.120 The financial position o f the Club in 1983 was th at it had debts in excess o f £400,000. In order to
                       retain its position in the League, which was anxious to reduce the number from 92 to 80, M r Heginbotham
                       said he had to persuade a number o f those on the M anagement Committee of the Football League to

crush of
  Green
                         3.121 The condition o f remaining in the League was that the 1983 Company had to meet a large number
                       of financial conditions. They had to pay the Football League debt, and the debt to the bank in full. The
                       creditors o f the old company had to be paid 60 per cent. There was a potential loss of £100,000 in the first

Jalia:
                       addition to the gates, and a very low priority was given to additional expenditure.

                          3.122 The first priority o f the Club was to ensure that it was financially viable within its own finances.
lium is in             Any work or improvement or alteration wTas wholly related to finances that were available. The letter from
                       the Health & Safety Executive in June 1981 was addressed to the old Club and M r Heginbotham was
la n d deal            unaware o f it. He did not see the letter of 18 July 1984 until the M onday following the fire. The reason
  numbers              was explained by M r Newman, the Secretary. He was visited by M r Shaw in July 1984. He received the
fed by the             letter of 18 July 1984 through the Receiver, who was handling the affairs o f the Club. He showed the letter
I direction            to Mr Tordoff, who was the Vice-Chairman. There was a Board meeting on 7 August, at which M r
                       Heginbotham was present; M r Tordoff was away.

fl with an                3.123 M r Newman had with him, at the Board meeting, the letters o f 11 July and 18 July. They were
                       stapled together. The letter of 11 July was referred to but not the letter o f 18 July. It was then put on a
L n in case            file marked “ Football G rounds Improvement Trust” .
Eular each
jf staff and              3.124 M r Tordoff saw the letter o f 18 July at the time. It referred to rubbish in the voids. He understood
ppropriate             that to refer to some surface rubbish in the stand, on the seats or the surface o f the floor-boards, and not
tarried out            underneath the floor-boards. He said: “We must have the area swept there” . Likewise M r Tordoff did not
members of             consider the question o f evacuation in 2 \ minutes. He had seen the stand evacuated with no problems at
[January in            all, in very short periods o f time, after matches had finished. He considered that the 2 \ minutes was really
                       a matter for the future.


                                                                              27
   3.125 M r H eginbotham said th a t even if he h a d seen the letter o f 18 July, he would n o t have taken any
 action because he regarded it as a reference to a standard which a designated club should achieve. It
 occurred during the closed'season. Shortly before there h ad been a religious meeting and he thought the
 system o f clearing the litter was perfectly satisfactory.

    3.126 H e was aware o f litter being able to accum ulate when kick boards were knocked off b u t he said
 it would have been a m ajor task, alm ost a dism antling o f the stand, to have rem oved litter th a t was likely
 to have gone u nder broken kick boards. H e accepted th a t it should n o t have been there, b u t said th a t the
 cost would have been considerable and it w ould have been a m ajor task. T he stand h ad been there fo r 75
 years. By an irony, it was the second to last gam e before the tim ber flooring would have been replaced by
 concrete. T h at w ork would have started o n the following M onday.

    3.127 T he problem facing M r H eginbotham and his B oard o f D irectors was a problem facing a great
  num ber o f directors o f clubs in the T hird and F o u rth D ivisions. T h a t was the problem o f finance. It is,,..
r however, a problem th a t cannot simply be dismissed on th a t account, because the public are entitled to
  expect th a t sports grounds will be reasonably safe.

 Perimeter Fence
     3.128 A num ber o f witnesses pointed o u t th a t if there h ad been closed perim eter fences at B radford, the
  casualties would have been on a substantially higher scale. T h a t is undoubtedly true. It is undesirable th a t
  there should be closed perim eter fences w here there is risk o f firef-However, perim eter fences exist m front,
  o f non-com bustible stands, where there is always a risk o f a bom b-hoax o r som e form o f riot necessitating
  emergency evacuation.

    3.129 M ost o f the perim eter fences I have seen have a facility enabling them to be opened. The usual
  reason is to allow the press o f people, w ho have been pushed against the fence, to be let o u t to reduce the
  crush, to rescue innocent spectators w ho w ant to get o u t o r to enable police to enter to control or arrest
  spectators.

     3.130 Clearly, the perim eter fences need to have gates in them and the facility for immediate opening in
  an emergency. T he local au thority will have to decide, in respect o f each ground, whether a perim eter tengg_
  can properly be p u t up. if there be n o t one now , and in those cases where there are perim eter fences, to
  ensure th a t there are sufficient and adequate m eans o f exit, including exits through the perim eter fencg
  itself. P aragraph 7.9.1 o f the G reen G uide applies.

  The Future
    3.131 H ow then can such a disaster be prevented in the future? As I indicted in paragraph 2.26, th
  construction o f this w ooden stand, the fact th a t it was a w ooden stand and the inadequacy o f the exits
  were the causes o f the fire and resultant casualties.

    3.132 I would like totally to prohibit perm anent w ooden stands (including those m ade from com bustible
  m aterials) and I recommend that the building o f new perm anent stands o f combustible materials be prohibited
  as a general rule. I recognise, however, th a t there are a very large num ber o f them in existence and th a t to
  forbid their use would be a draconian step to take. I w ould seek to avoid taking this step if reasonable
  m easures to protect the public could be taken as an alternative.

     3.133 I was told it is n o t econom ic o r practical to treat stands with fire resistant substances and also
  th a t it m ay give a false sense o f security if it is done an d n o t renewed.

      3.134 The difficulty is this: although there are a large num ber o f w ooden stands at sports grounds, they
   are not necessarily particularly large in size. T hus a sports ground m ay comprise only a w ooden stand,
   from which exits are inadequate. It m atters n o t w hether the ground is capable o f holding 20,000, 2,000 or
   200. If there is a stand for 200 people, which is likely to suffer the same fate as the Bradford stand, the
   danger is as great even if there is no oth er accom m odation at th at sports ground.

      3.135 It is clear th a t while p aragraph 10.6 o f the G reen G uide (nam ely th at every effort should be m ade
   to reduce the hazard caused from the accum ulation o f waste paper) is a sensible recom m endation, in
   practice, floor boards are going to get dam aged, gaps are going.to appear and debris is going to be dropped.
   G iven the problem o f supervision at a num ber o f clubs it is n o t practicable to prevent this.
   3.136      Thus, if wooden stands rem ain, there is going to be a continuing risk o f fire from the accidental
dropping o f a m atch through gaps in the floor boards on to litter which has accum ulated below. But the
fact th a t there is a risk o f fire does not necessitate the im m ediate prohibition on the use o f w ooden stands.
Many private an d public premises are similarly m ade o f w ood o r other com bustible m aterial. W hat is
necessary, and very im portant, is th a t even if there is a risk o f fire, the risk o f danger to life caused by that
fire, should be eliminated.

 ' 3.137 The fire service view seems to be th at, as a general rule, w ooden stands should be replaced by
non-combustible stands. They are equally o f the view, th at provided adequate exits are available, they will,
for the time being at any rate, be n o t unwilling to sanction the continued use o f w ooden stands.

  3.138 The provision and m aintenance o f suitable an d adequate exits is the m ain m eans o f escape and I
recommend that suitable and adequate exits shall be provided in all sports grounds. There are other fire
precautions which I have already outlined in the course o f this report: they are good housekeeping; the
provision for p roper warning o f fire; the provision o f fire fighting equipm ent; the training o f stewards;
appropriate evacuation procedures; and adequate com m unication arrangem ents.

  3.139 The H om e Office has already asked chief fire officers to visit all sports stadia in their areas. I
understand th a t the results o f those visits are already know n. It is thus possible, so far as fire is concerned,
for the Fire A uthority to determ ine w hat is necessary to ensure safety in w ooden stands.

   3.140 It is, therefore, n o t necessary to extend the scope o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds A ct 1975 by
designating every sports club which happens to have a w ooden stand. It will be appreciated th a t there are
other m atters o f safety, ap art from fire. But having regard to w hat happened at B radford, I believe there
is urgent necessity for dealing with the fire problem .

" 3.141 There is clear evidence th a t the risk o f a lighted m atch rem aining alight after being dropped is
 quite high. T he risk thereafter, to wooden stands, from th a t lighted m atch setting fire to debris which has
 not been cleared is also quite high. I recommend that no sm oking should take place in combustible stands,
 that this should be a condition o f entry to the ground and that signs to that effect should be prominently
 displayed.

   3.142 I recommend that the Fire Authorities should identify and visit all sports grounds in their areas and
should prohibit or restrict the use o f any stands, which in their view constitute a risk to spectators, because o f
the inadequacy o f the fire precautions. I am sure clubs will behave responsibly and voluntarily agree to the
recom m endations o f the Fire Authorities. If they do not it m ay be necessary for additional powers to be
provided. It is w orth noting th a t in the years 1977 to 1983 in the U K alone there were no fewer than 8 6
fires in grandstands and in 1983 there were 200 fires elsewhere in sports grounds.

    3.143 I recognise th a t there may be some clubs to whom this will be a death knell. However, in the light
o f the events at Bradford, I m ust p u t the safety o f the public above the interests o f the clubs. I do recognise
the p a rt th at local clubs play in the affairs o f the com m unity. Over 180,000 people enjoyed watching
football at Valley Parade in the 1984-85 Season, but like o th er places, to which the public are admitted,
such as shops, offices, hotels, theatres and cinemas, a reasonable standard o f safety is necessary.

  3.144 W ooden stands are found not only at Association F o o tb all grounds but also at Cricket grounds,
Rugby League grounds, Rugby U nion grounds, at Speedway an d Athletics grounds and Race tracks and
courses. Y ou have indicated th a t you are to designate grounds in the T hird and Fo u rth Divisions of the
Football League. There is no logic in not designating all other sports grounds which are capable of holding
a num ber of spectators. There is, for instance, no reason to believe th a t a football ground o f a club outside
the League is any safer than one within the League. Indeed, it is likely to be much less safe. O ther sports
m ust be treated in the same way.

  3.145 T o th a t end I am minded to recommend that the designation in the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act
1975 should be amended in two ways. Firstly, that you should exercise your power to designate all sports
grounds, whatever their size. This will enable you to control simply the safety o f sports grounds. Secondly,
sports grounds should include indoor as well as outdoor activities.

  3.146 It will then be open to you to decide, having regard to the practical difficulties involved, how best
to set a tim etable for when, if ever, each club, or class o f club, is designated. I have in m ind to recommend
im mediate designation o f any ground capable o f holding over 5,000 spectators. This will cover all sorts o f
grounds, not merely football grounds. But this m ust be subject to further detailed consideration.


                                                         29
   3 147 Some idea of the extent o f the financial an d practical problems emerged in evidence at Bradford.
Iltfm n vh the H om e Office originally thought 17 days w ork would be sufficient to prep are a safety cer t ificate,
nractice has show n th a t it takes three or four times th a t figure. Both the local authority and the fire
authority expressed concern at the scale o f w ork involved if we recom m end designation at 5,000.

   3.148 M r F A Sims, who is a C hief Officer o f West Y orkshire M etropolitan C ounty Council, has
estimated that, “ for 50 additional clubs to be designated it would take 3,500 m an days, 10 m an years work;
so we are talking about an additional staff o f ten m en” . M r K arran, the C hief Fire Officer o f West
Y orkshire, said he would need up to 12 additional officers o f sufficient experience and training to cope with
another 50 clubs. While I accept this evidence was given in good faith, I cannot be sure it necessarily reflects
the position elsewhere..

  3.149 I recognise the problem o f finance and m anpow er, but the num bers o f those who attend sports
grounds each week is probably over a million people. JTiey are entitled to reasonable degress o f safety ang
are entitled to look to those w ho m anage sports grounds to ensure their safety an d to central an d local
G overnm ent to enforce compliance w ith safety standards.

   3.150 In order to ensure a complete record o f sports grounds (as defined in the Sa fety o f Sports Grounds
A c t 1975) is available, I recommend a local registation system be set up.

   3.151 Fears have also been expressed ab o u t tem porary stands and m arquees, which are equally capable
o f giving rise to dangerous situations. As far as I can ascertain, there seems to be n o provision preventing
their use at non-designated grounds. I recommend that consideration be given as how best to deal with them.

   3 152 A num ber o f certificates w hich I have seen issued by local authorities are very detailed and cover
all the so rt o f points raised in the G reen G uide. I have considered w hether a statutory obligation should
be cast upon those responsible for m anaging sports grounds, similar to the Shops and Offices A ct or by
m aking the G reen G uide statutory.

    3 153 However, I consider the supervisory role, which the local authority exercises at present, is a m ore
 practical way o f ensuring safety. It has the positive effect th a t a sports ground has to operate under a safety
 certificate. Sporting authorities need help and advice, particularly on the fire aspect, and especially in
 relation to good housekeeping. Some o f the grounds I visited, for instance, contained petrol, paint, fertiliser ,
 gas cylinders and chemicals all stored together u nder w hat appeared to be fire-proof stands. It is practical
 measures which need to be taken an d applied to individual grounds.

   3.154 There seems to be a general view th a t the G reen G uide has no application unless the ground is
 designated. N othing could be m ore misconceived. I recommend that the next edition o f the Green Guide
 should m ake it clear that it applies to all sports grounds, not simply those designated. It contains so m uch
 good advice th a t it should be com pulsory reading for all those who run sports grounds. I shall be giving
 further detailed consideration to the provisions o f the G reen Guide.

   3   155 Finally I cannot finish this section o f the report w ithout paying tribute to the enorm ous heroism
 shown by a very large num ber o f people at B radford. I t would be invidious to single out any individual or
 group o f individuals. They came from all walks o f life. They all played their p art in saving lives.

vork;          4.1 On 11 M ay 1985, Birmingham City Football Club played Leeds United Football Club at St A ndrew ’s
 West       Birmingham. It was the final fixture o f the 1984/85 Season. Birmingham City had already secured prom otion
: with      to the First Division in the posititon o f runners-up. If they defeated Leeds United, and Oxford U nited lost

 local
               4.3 There was good liaison between Birmingham City Football Club and the police and with United
            Football C lub. The Secretary o f Birmingham Football Club described the planning for the match as, “ along
•ounds      the lines o f a military operation” . The num ber o f policemen was fixed at 207, with the ability to increase
            th at num ber to some 400.

ipable        4.4 On 1 M ay 1985, club officials met with senior police officers and a num ber o f decisions were made:
enting        1. Alcohol would not be available to the public in the ground; the only alcohol available would be in
 them.           the executive suite and the private members boxes.
              2. Seating in the Paddock Area o f the G randstand would only be available to season ticket holders and

                 not to the general public.

 or by
                 and 12.00 noon on the day o f the jnatch, so as to eliminate sales to the Leeds United supporters.
              4. Strict segregation was to be enforced so that the Leeds United supporters were at the Tilton R oad

               4.6 In Birmingham on that day there were also a num ber o f other activities which had a potential for
            disorder and required a substantial police presence. There was a m arch organised by the “Troops Out of
            Ireland M ovem ent” which was scheduled to arrive in the City Centre at 4pm. Arsenal- supporters were
'und is
            travelling to West Bromwich Albion and some were likely to come by way o f Birmingham. Chelsea were

 giving
              4.7 The police considered altering the kick-off time to the morning, but, having regard to the other
            activities, it was felt there might be a real problem if troublesome supporters after the game came into
eroism      confrontation with the other supporters or with the marchers.
lual or
              4.8 It was anticipated that approximately 10,000 Leeds U nited supporters would arrive by various
            means. M any came by train, many came by coaches but a large num ber came in hired mini-buses. It has
            been the practice, in most clubs in England and Wales, for the police to escort visiting fans from a railway
            station to the ground and to escort them back again. Thus they are unable to confront the home supporters.
            Likewise coaches carrying visiting supporters are driven to an area where they can be segregated from
            hom e supporters and the visiting supporters moved directly into their accom m odation.

              4.9 It has, however, also become the practice over a num ber o f years, for many who seek to cause
            trouble at grounds, to avoid anything like official transport where they can be more easily controlled and
            segregated. O n trains it is now the practice for alcohol not to be available. Official supporters’ buses are
            usually controlled by officials o f the visiting club. N orm ally drink is unavailable. Ordinary hire coaches
            going to football matches are not usually allowed to have drink on them as a condition o f their licence.
            But in practice this is almost impossible to enforce. The luckless bus driver, when surrounded by 30 drunken
            hooligans, has little or no control.

              4.10    Before the visiting supporters had even reached the ground, 150 had become involved in street
            brawls at Birmingham New Street. There were problems in public houses. In one public house, the visiting
supporters threw everything they could lay their’hands on o ut o f the windows, all o f which were broken.
T here was serious trouble, due to football coaches a t B urton-on-Trent, in N ottingham shire and a t Leicester.

The Ground
   4.11 A t the W est end is the Railway Stand (also known as the City End) which will seat some 4,000
supporters. T he hom e supporters occupied it. It was unfenced. A t the N o rth end is the m ain stand. It has
a num ber o f private boxes. There is a large seating area which was kept empty. This is called the Paddock
seating. A t the E ast end are terraces divided into tiers w ith double com partm ent fences and perimeter
fencing. This is the T ilton R oad end occupied by visiting supporters. O n the South side is Spion K op which
is a long terrace for hom e supporters surrounded by a perim eter fence. A plan is at Appendix 6 .

Arrival at the Ground
   4.12 The arrival o f the visiting supporters an d their behaviour outside the ground gives some small idea
o f the problem s o f hooliganism at football matches. One coach, with Leeds supporters in, was directed to
a coach park. It w ould have m eant th at supporters would have had to walk some 300 yards back to the
stadium . Finding this to be an unacceptable im position, and perhaps w anting to husband their energies
fo r later violence, they just kicked out the side windows and left the coach th at way.

 -4.13 N aturally, supporters have to pass through turnstiles. A num ber however found th at the pace a t
which spectators ahead o f them were moving was too slow for their liking. They simply scaled the w a f
an d fences, climbing over barbed wire barriers into the ground.

     4.14     Those w ho were unwilling or unable to negotiate th a t obstacle course, then turned their attention
, to breaking in in some other wav. They started to storm the m ain gate. Those inside sought to assist them .
  M eanwhile they had bom barded police with missiles o f all sorts. Eventually, in order to reduce the missile
  attacks an d relieve severe public disorder on the highway outside the ground, a decision was taken to open
  the large gate, so th at a substantial num ber o f fans entered w ithout paying.

   4.15 Police Superintendent Fow ler described the attack on one gate in this way: “ M y attention was
draw n to loud banging behind m e a t the exit gates ‘F ’ and ‘G ’. I investigated this noise by looking through
the centre gaps o f these double gates, which were o f solid construction o f m etal bars and rods with an
external m etal sheet cladding. They were secured by flat m etal bars and securely padlocked. I could see
large groups o f fans launching themselves against these two gates and kicking them outw ards. W ith each
assault on these gates, the bolts on the bases were dragging outw ards and were eventually no further use
in securing the gates. The gates were then only secured by the central securing bolts carrying the padlocks.
I then became aw are o f a group o f six fans using a battering ram against these gates. They were using a
piece o f concrete with steel reinforcing rods which was approxim ately seven feet in length and three to four
inches square.”

     4.16 Superintendent Fowler then radioed for some assistance, his description o f events continues:
  “ M om ents later gates ‘F ’ and ‘G ’ burst open and the fans in T ilton R oad surged forw ard, hurling bricl
  and o ther missiles at myself and PC Waleczek. I was hit on the left wrist by a brick and received an inch
  long cut and heavy bruising. PC Waleczek was hit by several missiles and sustained-broken bones in his
  foot. A pproxim ately 150 fans pushed us aside and ran through the breached gates into the Tilton R oad
. stan d and disappeared into the crowds inside the ground.”

  4.17 One group o f supporters, w ho were not prepared to wait, smashed dow n 40 o r 50ft o f metal railings
and w ooden doors, together with part o f a small brick wall. They then used the bricks as missiles. There
was no d o u b t th a t a large num ber o f these supporters had taken drink.

 First H alf
   4.18 Once inside the ground, the Leeds U nited supporters were contained in two com partm ents o f the
T ilton R oad end. They were flanked by a sterile area, separating them from Birm ingham supporters. On
entering the ground a num ber o f supporters continued to throw missiles, including cans, bricks and £ 1
coins.

    4.19 The terraces on which they stood were made o f concrete. Some supporters m anaged to dislodge
 p a rt o f the concrete terracing. One used a pick axe. They thus found themselves in possession o f lengths
 o f reinforced concrete which they subsequently used as missiles and as battering rams.

                   4.21 A refreshment hut, at the top o f the terrace, provided for the convenience o f the fans, was broken
                into and was ransacked. About 20 or 30 spectators had climbed onto the roof. The h ut was left in complete
    : 4,000     disorder. The staff managed to escape. A large wooden shutter, which had been covering the serving hatches

                first half.

 x to four      the ground. The invasion by Birmingham City supporters was greater in num ber than Leeds, but Leeds
                supporters made greater use o f missiles. Police were ready for this invasion and formed a double cordon
                across the pitch to keep the factions apart. Missiles thrown at the police included concrete, bricks, coins:
  jntinues:     boards and advertising hoardings.”

                  4.27 Inspector Turner, who was in charge of the West Midlands Police M ounted Branch, was asked to

                bring his mounted officers onto the pitch to assist with clearing supporters. They, together with officers
                deployed by Chief Inspector Allen, prevented a violent clash in the middle of the pitch between fans.

                   4.28 It is a matter of congratulation that in the face o f the violence shown to them, the police were able

                 Spion K op and joined their associates in the seated area, behing the City End goal. They also gained access
                 to the Paddock seating at the City End side of the central runnel. Leeds United supporters gained access
  o dislodge     to the Paddock seating at the Tilton Road side of the central tunnel. Thus both lots of supporters were
  of lenaths     close to each other in seating without fencing. Missiles discharging smoke were thrown at each end of the
                 ground.                      ~                                ’

  4.30 A num ber o f Leeds Unfited “supporters went onto the pitch, purporting to clear the Tilton R oad
end by removing missiles. This was not quite the philanthropic exercise it m ight appear: a num ber o f the
supporters simply used what they had picked up to replenish their ammunition.

   4.31 In addition to the physical clearing o f spectators from the pitch by the police, officials sought to
encourage spectators to return to their proper place. M r G ray, the Leeds United M anager, came onto the
pitch to seek to placate the Leeds fans. All he got for his pains was a stoning.

   4.32 A num ber o f police officers were caught in the narrow gangways between the two com partm ents
o f the terraces at the Tilton Road end. They had to run the gauntlet and suffer violent assault by large
num bers o f visiting supporters. Rocks, sticks and advertising hoardings were am ong the weapons used on
them . The police on the pitch had to m ake repeated efforts to rescue their colleagues.

  4.33 One particular group seized hold o f a large piece o f concrete and used it as a battering ram inside
the pen in order to force the gate. In this they were unsuccessful.

Second H a lf
  4.34 The game recommenced at 4.32pm and was uninterrupted. T hroughout the second half, the police
continued to be the subject of missile attacks and spitting.

   4.35 A t the final whistle, the pitch was invaded by both the Leeds and Birmingham supporters. C ;
again the police m anaged to keep the fans apart, but they were subjected to a considerable bom bardm ent.
The Birmingham supporters began throwing boardings and broken seats. The Leeds supporters were also
ripping up seats and throwing them. As a variation they also dug up the concrete terracing and started
using pieces to pelt the executive boxes. Some began tearing the goal netting down. Yet another group
tried to set fire to the refreshment hut on top o f the Tilton R oad terraces. The w ooden poles o f the
advertising hoardings were used as missiles at the m ounted police.

   4.36 Inspector Turner described it in this way. “As the barrage o f missiles increased I ordered the
m ounted officers to draw their batons to defend themselves and drive the supporters back into the seating
area and back over the fence. A fter a pitched battle, which lasted some 20 minutes, the Birmingham
supporters were forced out o f the ground, through the Emmeline Street entrance and away from the ground
itself. The Leeds supporters were contained behind the wire fence and they began to leave the ground by
the Tilton R o ad exit” .

   4.37 A num ber o f the m ounted officers had N A T O style helmets— it did not prevent Sergeant Fitzm aurice
from having his nose broken by a lump o f flying concrete and his clothes were drenched with blood. W PC
Nagle described how she was hit by a missile and received wounds necessitating six stitches. The three male
policemen alongside her became stretcher cases.

  4.38 Inspector T urner’s description o f the events as a pitched battle is accurate and succinct. It does not
begin to convey the frightening and terrifying scene depicted on the video film which m ore clearly reseml
the Battle o f A gincourt than a football m atch. Still photos o f some o f the missiles and dam age appear m
Appendix 7.

   4.39 A lthough the Birmingham supporters started to leave, they were unwilling to give up the battle
easily and they continued to throw large stones and other materials, including advertising hoardings, seats
and pieces o f wood. The police had to equip themselves with defensive sheilds to disperse a large group of
several hundred strong in a play area outside the ground. Y ouths were pulling up a children’s slide from
the concrete, taking swings down and removing the chains from swing seats. Eventually they were p u t to
flight.

  4.40 There were m any subsequent confrontations between rival fans and between fans and the police.
Vehicles and property were indiscriminately damaged. A party o f Asians returning from a wedding, in a
coach, were stoned and injured. The vehicle was severely damaged.

  4.41 Finally, ab o ut 7pm, a s o n o f peace descended on St Andrews.

  4.42 Only the timely and courageous intervention o f the police between the rival supporters prevented
a disaster o f Brussels proportion. A part from the dam age o f property, which is estimated at some £85,000,
the casualties known to the police are as follows:

                   Collapse of the Wall
                      4.43 The game finished at 5.17 pm. Some 35 minutes later, a wall which ran between the Tilton Road
      inside
                   terrace and the car park collapsed. Tragically, a 15 year old boy, Ian George Hambridge, received fatal
                   injuries. There were injuries sustained by 17 other members of the public, three police officers, as well as
                   damage to vehicles.

    ie police        4.44 Between the end o f the game and the collapse o f the wall there were still a number of supprters in
                   the Tilton Road terraces. Missiles were being thrown at the executive accommodation in the main stand.
                   A loudhailer warning given by the police had little effect. The police entered the enclosure in order to
     •s.'   ^      disperse missile throwers and those surrounding the refreshment hut. As a number o f people were leaving
     rdmcnt.       the enclosure, going towards the car park, the wall collapsed.
     ere also
      started        4.45 There are differing explanations o f how that came about. First that spectators were climbing over
    ;r group       the wall; second, that it was deliberately pushed; third, that the collapse was caused by the crush of
    :s of the      spectators who were leaning on it or were being pursued by police officers; and, finally, that it simply
                   collapsed without any intervention.

    lered the         4.46 A number o f spectators and police officers at the game described their experiences. M r Hudson
    e seating      described being on the terrace and going out through a door at the exit end o f the stand. He said: “There
    ningham        were a few people going through the door just in front o f me. there wasn’t a rush to get through, but I
    e ground       had moved forward in the queue to get through the door. Just as I got to the door I looked back behind
    round by       me into the terrace and I could see the Leeds fans running up the terrace. I couldn’t see any police at that
                   stage. I walked through the door.” Then he described the wall falling on him.

    :zmaunce         4.47 M r Pugh described seeing police on the terracing who were coming up towards the refreshment hat
    iod. WPC       and the wall. He described bricks being thrown over the wall from inside the ground and he was between
      ree male     a couple o f cars when the wall fell on him.

                      4.48 M r Garfield described being in the car park, he saw the wall come out, it struck him. It appeared
   does not        to him that some supporters had come over with the wall. He said that when he had walked down the
ires<   led        steps and out o f the door leading into the car park, there was just a steady trickle of people leaving and
1 appear in
                   there was no pushing or shoving.

                     4.49 Miss Kathy Dwan was also in the car park. She saw the wall coming slowly down towards her.
      the battle
                   She said: “I don't know what caused the wall to collapse but I remember seeing some fans sitting on top
    jings, seats
                   of the wall before it came down.”
     e group of
     slide from
     rere put to      4.50 Mr Thomas Phillips said “ I heard someone call that the police were coming. At this time I was
                   right up against the wall pressed against it. I heard the wall creaking and saw it split away and come out
                   from its joints. I pushed Maria away from the wall and tried to steady myself but I fell with the wall down
    the police,    quite a drop . . . I think it was pressure on the wall with all the fans coming down which made it collapse."
    ddina. in a
                       4.51 Mr Matthews said that after the game he drifted with the crowd across the terraces tow ards a point
                    below the refreshment hut. “ I ran down the wide steps to a wa l l . . . . . . There was a crowd about four or
                    five deep trying to get through the door. I joined the crowd and quite physically forced my way into the
                    side of this crowd. There was about another three deep behind me. Suddenly many more joined on behind
    5 prevented     the crowd as the police arrived. I was trying to get out because I didn't want to get batonned. I was
    ne £85,000,     catapulted through by the pressure of the crowd and shot across the car park. I think the wall collapsed
                    purely by the pressure of the crowd trying to get away from the police. People were literally terrified.”
   4.52 M r Pearce ’described it in this way. “ I was standing by my car with my friend Brian when I saw
the fans inside the ground rocking the wall. There was ab o u t a couple o f hundred o f them and a general
melee behind them . They were rocking the wall backwards and forw ards an d chanting. This went o n for
som e m inutes and I said to my friend Brian th a t I thought the wall was going to go any minute. I could
see the heads and shoulders o f the fans over the top o f the wall and the wall went. It came away from the
stand end first. It all seemed in slow m otion . . . . W hen the wall collapsed there were only a few, about
ten, who came dow n with the wall. There were others who just jum ped dow n on to p o f the fallen bricks
an d ran off. There was no crush behind where the wall collapsed.”

   4.53 M r Broadhead said he saw people lined up along the pathw ay alongside the wall and they were
trying to leave the terraces through the gate: “ It was only a small gate and there were plenty o f people
trying to get through. I didn’t see any people trying to climb over the wall. Then ab o u t four o r five
policemen came across the terrace. I first saw them a t the end o f the stand an d continued tow ards the gate
also a t the end o f the stand. W hen the police reached the crowd by the gate they started to panic and
began to ru n alongside the wall from the direction o f the gate tow ards the end o f the terrace. It was then
th a t the pressue o f people against the wall caused it to collapse. I didn’t see anybody kicking the wall there
were too many crushed up for them to have enough room for them to swing their legs. I didn’t see anybody
trying to climb over the wall. I saw the wall collapse out away from the terraces.”

   4.54 PC C laydon described a mass o f persons trying to get through a small doorw ay alongside the brick
wall when it suddenly collapsed over a length o f some 60 feet. PC Suter was in the car park with o t b ^
officers. H e said: “ I saw ano th er group o f youths had gathered near the parked cars beside the gro
perim eter wall . . . . . . . As we approached and were ab o u t 30 feet away from the wall I saw people
clim bing over the to p from inside the ground. I then saw the wall begin to bulge and slowly fall forw ard
tow ards the cars.”

   4.55 C hief Inspector Allen described the clearing o f the Tilton R oad terraces in this way: “ O nce my
officers had reached the perim eter fencing a t the front o f the Tilton R oad terrace. I instructed them to
enter the terraces and to form a cordon from the bottom to the top. This they did. Missiles continued to
be throw n at us, particularly by those fans who had been throw ing at the directors’ boxes. I instructed my
officers to move across the terraces. T he cordon moved across the terraces tow ards the exit gates by the
refreshm ent hut. I saw Sergeant D unkin and his officers m ake their way across the bottom o f the terraces,
in advance o f the cordon in pusuit o f the missile throwers who continued to bom bard the officers. As they
did so I could see th a t missiles were still being throw n into the ground from the directors’ car park. A t
this point I would estimate th a t only ab o u t 400 fans were left in the g r o u n d .................. The police advance
across the terraces had been a controlled exercise with the intention o f clearing the terraces, it was n o t a
“charge” ; the purpose was to “ shepherd” the remaining fans from the gro u n d.” C hief Inspector Allen
heard the collapse and estimated there were no m ore than 30 fans standing on the concrete landing when
he emerged into the car park, which was only seconds after it had collapsed.

   4.56 C hief Inspector M acD onald said th a t at no time did officers under his com m and charge u p the
terrace tow ards the Leeds fans as it was a controlled advance designed to push them o u t o f the ground via
the large double gates a t the rear which were open for th at purpose. H e described ab o u t 40 feet o f the v
collapsing for no apparent reason. H e said th a t he had policed m ost o f the m atches a t St A ndrew ’s this
year. On a t least four occasions he had seen m ore people either against the wall o r sitting on it. In particular
during the O xford United and M anchester City matches visiting supporters climbed onto and pressed
against the wall in order to ta u n t hom e supporters in the directors’ car park.

   4.57 PC G ran t was on the terrace. H e saw a num ber o f police officers directing supporters o u t o f the
large gateway. H e could also see some o f the Leeds supporters jum ping against the wall in front o f him in
a n effort to see over it. W hen he was a t the wall there were ab o u t 90 youths milling aro u n d on the terracing
in front o f the wall when suddenly a large section o f the wall collapsed an d the fans who had been standing
next to it fell over the edge. PC G rant was only a m atter o f feet away at the time the wall collapsed and
could see n o apparent reason for the collapse. There did n o t seem to be any undue pressure as m ost o f the
supporters appeared to be m oving to the right tow ards the exits. H e said th a t he saw no crush or undue
pressure on the wall and there was no panic am ong the crowd who were m oving in a reasonably orderly
way to the exit.

   4.58 Sergeant Biddle was in front o f the refreshm ent hut. H e saw there ab o u t 100 fans alongside the
wall adjacent to the directors’s car park and a num ber o f them were looking over the wall into the car
park. H e shouted to the fans to move away tow ards the exit gates an d as the nearest ones began to move
to his right, the wall, suddenly w ithout warning, collapsed onto the directors'’ car park.


                                                            36
        4.59 Sergeant D unkin was at the top o f the terrace. He saw the police officers directing people towards
  • xthe gates at the rear o f the Tilton R oad end. In front o f him there were approximately 80 to 100 supporters
      milling around on the level by a high brick wall. He said some were scrambling onto the wall just getting
1 their head over it and peering over it into the directors’ car park. He described the wall collapsing in one
t.-section of about 30 feet. H e said th at there appeared to be no undue pressure on the wall. Most o f the
“-3 . supporters appeared to be moving towards his right to the exits.

     4.60 PC Jarratt was at the rear o f the refreshment hut and could see a group throwing missiles down
   the terracing. One youth was sitting on top o f the wall and three others were trying to climb onto it.

     4.61 PC Lewis approached the top o f the terracing. He could see th at the refreshment hut was burning.
   As he neared the rear o f the refreshment hut he could see approximately 40 supporters, some of whom
 ’ were throwing missiles down onto the terraces. His attention was then drawn to a youth sitting on the
   perimeter wall and three others trying to climb onto it. I t was at this stage, he said, that he saw the wall
   collapse and a number o f people fall with it. He added th a t as far as he could see, there was no excessive
   pushing and people were moving in an orderly fashion.

     4.62 PC W ood, who was in the car park, said that stones were throw n and fans climbing out o f the
   ground over the perimeter wall. It suddenly bulged and came down and a num ber o f fans fell on top of
   the wall from inside the ground.

     4.63 PC Brindley was in the car park when he saw fans inside the ground begin to climb over the
   perimeter wall into the car park. The wall slowly collapsed in one piece.

     4.64 PC Scrimgeour was about 50 or 60 yards from the wall. He said there were a large num ber o f fans
   on the top o f the wall visible from the waist upwards. He thought there seemed to be a surge o f fans from
   inside the ground pushing up against the wall when it suddenly, w ithout any warning, moved outwards.
   Neither he nor PC Suthers, who was with him, saw anyone climbing over the wall prior to its falling.

     4.65 PC Nichols saw a large num ber o f people by the wall and some on it. He thought the fall-was
   caused by people pushing against it.

     4.66 Superintendent Fowler was aware o f six or seven youths who ran out o f a small door; he saw two
   policemen run out through the same door and follow them. He was not aware o f a large number o f people
   being pressed against the door or o f large numbers o f people falling with the wall.

     4.67 There is some evidence that coping'on the top o f the wall had been removed by a number of
   supporters earlier in the match.

     4.68 PC Tipping, was close by the wall. H e saw fans on the terrace surge down the side o f the terrace
   towards the side wall, presumably heading towards the exit gate, when it collapsed outwards.

     4.69 PC Lovell was manning a barrier in the car park. He could see Leeds supporters on the terraces
   gathering together in a large crowd and police officers moving up the terraces in order to disperse the
   supporters. They were not making any threatening manoeuvres. As they did so, the Leeds supporters
   massed together in a crush and were still throwing missiles. He saw the whole length and height o f the
   brick wall lean outwards and then break up into large lumps o f brick and concrete and he said the
   supporters has also been standing on top o f the wall. They jumped off and those behind it fell onto the
   collapsed wall.

     4.70 PC Belcher and PC Davies described fans leaving by a gate to the East o f the stand. PC Davies
   says there was a tremendous surge o f people waiting to leave and he had difficulty assisting them through
   the doorway when he was suddenly aware o f shouts and the wall collapsing.

     4.71 Inspector Turner was in the car park; he saw people climbing over the top o f the wall from inside
   the ground. He then saw the wall begin to bulge and fall slowly forwards.

      4.72 The wall itself has been the subject o f a report by the County Surveyor for the West Midlands
   C ounty Council. 1 he report states that it was 30 years old and had been increased in height by 2 feet about
   eight years ago. It was one brick thick and it was free standing. The materials from which the wall was
   constructed were in a satisfactory condition, although the m ortar used appears to have been a weak mix.
 /-The collapse appeared to be due either to sustained pressure by a large num ber o f people from the side,
   o r to people shaking the wall. It is n o t thought th at people climbing over o r on it would have caused the
, collapse.               4 -


    4.73 It is n o t possible for me to be sure how the brick wall came to fall but in my judgem ent the m ost
 likely explanation is the surge o f people. The collapse o f the wall caused injuries to members o f the public
 and three police officers. It also caused the death o f Ian George H am bridge aged 15.

    4.74 This was his first visit to a football m atch. H e came from a respectable family. He went with three
 friends to the game and becam e separated from them. There is nothing to indicate th a t he was involved in
 any violence o r was other th an the innocent victim o f the collapse o f the wall.
                                                 CHAPTER 5

                                             Why did the riot start?
                                                                                                               *

  5.1 I have described what happened and how it happened and the next question is why? A number of
reasons have been suggested to me.

Drink
   5.2 There is no doubt but that drink was a substantial contributor to the violence that took place. The
 visiting supporters had opportunities to purchase and consume quantities of liquor outside the ground.”
 One of the difficulties facing police, when a large number ot spectators'present themselves outside football
"grounds in T sfa te o f inebriation, is how best to deal with them. T he police find it easier to_control them if
 they are inside a ground, penned, than TTnievlTreTurned away with all the aggravation that involves and
 are let loose on a comparatively unprolectH Tow n or city. It is also equally certain that a number of the
 fans remained sober, so as to organise and co-ordinate the troubles which took place.

    5.3 In the ground there were two areas only where drink could be obtained. One was at the Birmingham
 City Supporters Club and the other at "D " Club— a licensed m em bers’ club. Membership was essential
 before drink could be obtained there. No problems arose from there being drink available at those parts
 of the ground. Thus there was no drink available to the general public on the ground on the day of the
 riot. Ironically it was the only match of the season when it was not available.

    5.4 There is no doubt that the late entry o f fans into the ground had an adverse effect on crowd
 behaviour. One of the unintended consequences of making drink unavailable inside grounds, is that there
 is a tendency for fans to hang about in public houses until the last possible minute and for them then to
 become frustrated and angry when they have to queue to gain entry to the match. One of the factors
 causing the crowd outside to break into the ground at Birmingham was their belief that they would not be
 able to enter the ground in the proper way before the football match commenced.

 Political Activity
    5.5 There is a good deal of evidence from responsible witnesses th a t political activists are involved in
 troubles at football grounds in England, although it seems not to be a problem in Scotland. To some extent
 grounds are used for recruiting for these political activists. There were found on the Birmingham ground
 a number of leaflets belonging to the National Front. One fan— who for obvious reasons shall be
 nameless—said: “Quite early on in the game I heard a rum pus behind me in the seats and turned to see
 two policemen escorting a teenage Pakistani youth from the stand onto the back of the stand. As this was
 going on I could hear about 50 o f the Leeds fans chanting “Sieg Heil, Sieg Heil.” They were standing up
 with a Nazi salute aimed towards the police. I could see that several people near me were wearing Nazi
 arm-bands, mainly teenagers, there were a few skin-heads among them. The arm-bands were with a red
 background, white circle and a black swastika in the middle.”

    5.6 A transit van returning to Leeds after the Birmingham incident was seen to be carrying Leeds
 supporters, sporting swastika arm-bands. Sociological research on the activities of the politically far right
 at football matches suggests that many young fans who espouse racist views, or who join in racist chants,
 have little real idea of the politics of groups like the N ational F ro n t and the British Movement. I shall
 need to inquire more deeply in the due course into this aspect.

    5-7 So far as Birmingham City Football Club is concerned, Chief Superintendent Gilbert, who carried
 out a detailed inquiry into what happened on this day, said: “ D uring the season just concluded. I have not
 detected any political lobbying adjacent to the ground on match days. I have not detected political activists
 recruiting or provoking problems.” He accepted that activities in political dem onstrations which attract an
 j ement of youngsters prone to disorderly conduct are also present in activities surrounding league football,
  t must be anticipated that some would be active in both spheres o f public disorder.

   5.8 He concluded “ Obviously I am mindful o f the reported development of political incitement but if
   ere are trends they have not overtly manifested at St. Andrew’s.” H e went on to say “ It is worthy of
 n°te that the troublesome Birmingham supporters comprise assorted ethnic groups.” Certainly those who
      part in the riot, and were visible on the video, comprised spectators of different colours and race.
The Club
    5.9 Birmingham City has quite a good record so far as crowd violence is concerned. The Railway Stand,
which is all seating in two tiers, has no perimeter fence in front o f it. It was designed to encourage families
to occupy it and to make them feel that they were not being treated as violent spectators. It is the aim of
the club to encourage the development o f a family area there, though that has not fully succeeded. Because
the spectators in the Railway Stand were able to get out, and were joined by home supporters who got out
o f the Spion Kop, the police take the view, and rightly, that the blame, so far as supporters were concerned,
was equally divided.

   5.10 It is fair to say that the club had had little or no trouble from the Railway Stand before, that it
m ust be good policy to seek to trust supporters, and that it was the continual bom bardm ent by Leeds fans
o f the police which initially started the trouble.

   5 .11 The police and the Football Club correctly anticipated the num ber o f visiting supporters. They
deployed sufficient police to cope with the number. They adopted the proper tactics for segregating fans.
It may be said that if the Birmingham fans in the Railway Stand" hacfbeeri behind 'a p en m eterlen ce there
would have been less trouble. This is true. It is one m a tte r ^ f cntrcism wRrcIi can be made, in my view,
about the arrangements for the match. The other is that spectators were able to climb oyer the fence at
the Tilton R oad end and the Spion Kop.

   5.12 Some criticism has been voiced to me that, if the police had taken more robust steps to clear the
Leeds supporters from the refreshment hut at the top the terrace at Tilton R oad end and had not urged
fans by means o f a loud-speaker to get off the roof, considerable trouble might have been avoided. Having
regard to the numbers and behaviour o f the fans who were in the terraces at Tilton R oad end, I do not
think there is anything m ore th a t the police could reasonably have done to prevent violence occurring.

    5.13 It has also been said th a t the involvement of Birmingham fans in these incidents was to a considerable
extent a consequence o f the visit o f a large Leeds contingent at a particularly sensitive stage o f the season,
an d that it was the largely Leeds inspired disorders which began the build up to the seriously violent scenes
inside St. Andrew ’s involving bo th sets o f supporters. It was the disorderly behaviour in the beginning of
a small num ber of Leeds fans, which around half-time provoked a disruptive response from young
Birmingham city followers. A t the end o f the game these roles were to an extent reversed, with the actions
o f local fans arguably fanning the flames o f disturbance.

5 .14 Criticism was m ade of the fact that there were no, or insufficient, police officers inside the pens housing
visiting supporters. This, it was said, provided a greater feeEng o f imm unity Trom arrest am ong the fans,
and enabled supporters more easily to a tta ck the police when earlier an d firmer control might have
prevented it. Having seen the film and heard h5^T^ ^ o E w ’w e re llq p Io y e O rtB irT in 6 n ~ R o « l end7T~do
not myself subscribe to this view.

The Turnstiles
   5.15 The turnstiles at the Tilton R oad end were antiquated and poorly sited. Only five out o f eight were
in use because oTthe failure o f their operators to appear. A lthough some visiting supporters arrived in very
good time, there were a large num ber o f visitors who appeared simultaneously shortly alter l pm; this
caused considerable problems a t trie turnstiles.                 '

  5.16 The truculence and inebriation o f a num ber o f fans m ade entry even m ore difficult. Some simply
vaulted the turnstiles, others got into the ground in o tfierw ays. I t Is unlikely, even if there had been more
turnstiles, "that trouble would have been avoided.

Conclusion
  5.17    The reason why there was disorder was that a substantial num ber o f visiting supporters, full of
drink, came to Birmingham deliberately to cause trouble, and thereby sparked off the Birmingham
supporters whose subsequent behaviour was bad as, if not worse than, that o f the visitors.

   6 .1 I have made it clear throughout this inquiry, both at Bradford and Birmingham, that I am not going
to apportion blame. I wish to identify what lessons are to be learned so that they may be applied in the
future.

  6.2 There seem to me to be four ways, apart from abolishing football altogether, in which hooliganism
can be prevented at football grounds. They are:
   1. Physically to prevent hooligans who are in the ground from disturbing football matches.
   2. If that is not possible, to prevent them attending football matches.
   3. When they do behave like hooligans, to identify them.
   4. When they are identified, to app rehend and punish them severely.

 Preventing hooligans who are in the ground from disturbing football matches
   6.3 So far as preventing spectators from behaving like hooligans at a football ground is concerned, most
 reputable clubs now follow the m em orandum to Football League Clubs in England and Wales regarding
 crowd control written by the Football Association and dated 17 August 1983. A copy is at Appendix 8 . It
 will be seen that it is m andatory for clubs to make arrangements for segregation of rival supporters; to
 make detailed prior planning in conjunction with the police, the opposing ciubs, rail and coach operators
"and supporters travel clubs, at least ten days before a match; to ensure that terraces are kept free of objects
 That can be used as missiles; and to liaise with the police tor the escorting of visiting supporters to and
 from the ground. There are several other recommendations in the documenT

    6.4 Criticisms have been made of particular clubs th at their preparations for reception of visiting
 supporters have not been very good. Those to whom I have talked seem to me to show a high degree of
 efficiency and conscientiousness and to cooperate with all the other authorities over segregation problems.
 There is a great sense o f responsibility among the club officials and a desire to tackle the problem
 energetically.

    6.5 Most football grounds in England and Wales are now built like medieval fortresses, with pens at
 each end, with barriers designed to prevent spectators climbing over; with gates, fences and protective wire
J o prevent. ri-v.al fans bombarding each other: and with the use of what is called a sterile area—a no m an ’s
 land. The pens-are built so as to ensure that the rival fans are, for practical purposes, locked in during the
 course of the game, so that they are not able to get at the opposition. —                                  ......

   6 . 6 These arrangements have evolved over the years. Their use is deplored in some circles. They enable
 fans to identify with other supporters. They create a sense of camaraderie and immunity from attack. They
 polarise the respective factions. They may create a worse standard o f behaviour because the fans feel they
 are being treated as violent people. F or practical reasons, however, it is not now possible to allow rival
 fans to be present at a ground unless they are both segregated and penned in.

    6-1 Some time before a match is played, the police and the club will normally liaise', and like members
-?ij h e generarstafi preparinFTor battle, discuss the str a te g y jb r jh e particular match. Police forces now
ha\e a member o f their staff whose job it is to deal with football problems in the area. Intelligence about
 supporters is gathered by police football liaison officers. Consideration is given to the history and past
conduct of both home and away supporters; the estimated size of the crowd; the estimated number of away
 supporters and the mode of travel; the history of the previous encounters; the importance of the result; the
 absence of close proximity of other matches in the area; and the press and other media reports.

    6 -8 Naturally, police have to take into account other functions which may need their attention, as
 ?-C?Urre<^ at Birmingham on the day of the match. The clubs have to consider whether to make it an all-
  ic -et game; whether to sell tickets at an earlier date; and whether to have it in the morning or afternoon.
     e railway authorities have to arrange special trains. M otor vehicles are hired in large numbers for
 and S^ ° n       suPPorters- The clubs have to arrange for their supporters clubs to be taken to the ground
 e      t 0 k.e rew arded. Thus, long before the game is actually played, a very large number of people are
    caged in trying to devise a safe way of ensuring that a game of football takes place. The expenditure of
     . and resources is enormous.


                                                       41
  6.9 When the game actually takes place, the num ber o f police deployed at football matches, both inside
and outside the club, is very great. It is an enormous drain on the resources o f the police, and on rate­
payers and tax-payers who eventually pay the greater part o f the cost. A t Birmingham on 11 May, 207
police officers were designated to cover the fixture but it was arranged that there should be the facility to
increase the presence to approximately 400. A t Norwich City in 1984/85 at a low priority game (ie one
where no troubles were expected) there were between 135 and 194 officers involved, for a medium priority
game 225, and, for a high priority game, as many as 353 police officers were required.

   6.10 The figures for the number o f police officers deployed at league matches in England and Wales on
23 M arch 1985 averaged 216 in the First Division with as many as 330 at Leicester City. In the Second
Division there were as many as 280 at Sheffield United. In the Third Division there were 106 at Derby
County and in the Fourth Division there were as many as 90 at Darlington. Officers deployed at Luton
Town represented nearly 23 per cent of the local police force. A t Norwich on one occasion it represented
nearly 33 per cent. At Chelsea normally about 500 officers are on duty whenever they have a home game.
On 23 M arch 1985, in all 4,457 officers were deployed to deal with some 329,000 spectators. This was about
1 officer for every 75 spectators.

   6 .11 The number o f arrests does not necessarily give a true picture o f what happens at a football ground.
If there is a n o t the police officers may be so engaged in defending themselves, or protecting opposing fans,
that they may have little or no opportunity to make arrests. There may also be cases where, because o f
the very substantial num ber o f police, there may be no trouble at all. Thus at Birmingham on 11 M ay
1985, there were 63 people arrested prior to the match and outside the ground, 38 at the ground and sor
2 2 after the m atch outside the ground.


  6.12 The figures for league games in England and Wales played on 23 M arch 1985 show th a t there were
38 arrests in the First Division, 65 in the Second Division, 10 in the Third Division and 10 in the F ourth
Division. The num ber o f arrests on 23 M arch was thus 123 out o f 329,000 spectators, which represents
roughly one arrest for every 3,000 spectators. The figures provided by Leeds U nited show that in the
1984/85 season, with a total attendance o f some 372,000, the num ber o f arrests was 148. In the 1970/71
season the num ber o f arrests was not substantially m ore (a total o f 174) but the attendance was over one
million, ie three times the present number.

   6.13 These figures tend to support the view which has been expressed to me that notwithstanding the
ever increasing police presence, the number o f arrests and the level o f violence has increased. In 1969, the
figure o f one policeman for every 1,000 spectators was regarded as the norm. It is now one policeman to
75 spectators.

   6.14 It is also im portant not to exaggerage the am ount o f trouble at football grounds. M any clubs go
through a season with little or no trouble; others have trouble only infrequently, m any are trouble-free
even when visited by supporters who have acquired a reputation for violence.

   6 .15 Responsible football clubs have, over the last ten or fifteen years, done all they reasonably can t
prevent trouble. They prepare with the police a battle plan. They construct the ground with pens, concrete,
terraces, iron gates, grills, bars and fences. They instruct their stewards, they arrange for the presence of
large numbers o f police officers. But what is quite clear, and it emerges with startling clarity from what
Tiappened at Birmingham, is that notwithstanding all the precautions which are taken, wiuch include
preventing drink being sold in the ground, policing to and from the station, the provision o f special trains
and the segregation o f fans, trouble still continues.

Seating

   6 .16 One o f the ideas for controUing violence was to introduce “ all seating” . T h at appeared on the face
o f it to be a sensible idea. It failed however to take account of the idiosyncracies o f football fans. A lot of
them it seems do not wish to sit down; they wish to stand. They wish to stand, apparently, because there
is for them a special atmosphere in being on the terraces. If seating is provided for them, they may well
tip back the seats and stand in front o f them; then stand on the seats; and finally rip up the seats and use
them as weapons. Coventry City, between 1981 and 1984, tried an all-seater football ground. It was not a
success for a variety o f reasons and it may be the experiment should be pursued. Certainly at Aberdeen
and Ibrox P ark it has proved a success. But all the evidence from the football authorities is that it is by
no means a complete answer to the problem.
de
;e-                 6 17 One view expressed to me was that if bars inside grounds were opened before matches for a short
07      t p f ; -period (because it is not always possible to obtain a drink in a ground very quickly) the am ount of drinking
to      • S |? § |r would thereby be cut down; people would enter the ground in proper time and the problems of drink and
ne      T- ; S jate arrival would be avoided. Since I started this Inquiry you have taken steps to deal with the drink
ity                 problem by means o f the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Bill. It is therefore no longer a problem
                    for me to consider.

on      ' j j ; ' 6.18 It is worth observing that a similar provision in Scotland (the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980)
nd      -kv.'.'.- had a quite outstanding effect in some cases. The num ber of police at Celtic for instance was reduced by
by        -vj       5 0 per cent after the introduction of the Act. Missiles in the form of bottles and cans have substantially
on       ::7.;      disappeared and whereas in the Celtic/Rangers game of 1980 (before the Act) there were 219 arrests, in
:ed      1            1983 there were 38. Experience this last football season, however, does not give any grounds for complacency.
ne.
>Ut             Violence
                ■" 6.19 It is said that these are hooligans who use violence at football matches; that they are not football’s
                hooligans and that if only a cure were found for violence then football hooliganism could be cured
ad.             overnight. There is much force in this argument. A football ground is a magnet which draws violence
ns,             towards it. T hat is not, in my view, the fault o f the football authorities. These hooligans could easily go to
 of             a rugby league ground or a cricket ground or a race track. There has always been violence in society. It
[ay             seems to me impossible to prevent people being violent anymore than it is possible to prevent people being
me              dishonest. There are those who link violence and dishonesty to the social state of the nation. It is beyond
                the scope of this interim report to offer suggestions for preventing violence in general anymore than it is
                possible to suggest answers to dishonesty in general. N o r does preventing hooligans from being violent at
ere             football matches stop them being violent elsewhere.
rth
nts                6.20 It is because football regularly attracts groups in large numbers, ready to confront each other, that
the             it is substantially different from other activities. It is the scale o f violence when it occurs which is so
                worrying. Ideally one should seek the underlying causes o f violence and deal with them if that is possible.
/71
jne             But I believe that there will always be people who are violent, no m atter what their condition in life, or
                the economic circumstances of the environment in which they live. They will never alter their ways. Even
                if the causes were known, to remedy them is likely to be a very long term process. W hat is needed
                immediately is relief for ordinary people both inside and outside the football ground from being victims
the             of attack.

                  6.21 Given that football clubs in general terms have done all they can to physically prevent hooligans
                who are in the ground from disturbing football matches, and have not succeeded, what other precautions
                can now be taken?
; go
free            Preventing hooligans entering the ground
                  6.22 Hooliganism at football matches is nothing new. There are records o f incidents in the 1880s and
                1890s. It is a m atter which has been the subject of alm ost annual inquiries by many knowledgeable and
i to            diverse bodies.
rete
e of               6.23 The English, Scottish and Welsh football authorities are equally anxious to find a solution; so are
/hat            the police, the Government (responsible for law and order), the ordinary spectator who wants only to enjoy
tide            an afternoon’s harmless entertainment, and the householder or shop-keeper who lives close by a football
ains            ground and simply wants to be left in peace. I have to say, therefore, th at if there were a simple solution
                to the problem it would have been found years ago.

                  6.24 It is im portant to recognise that I am asked to deal with the problems o f hooliganism inside the
                ground. There is a danger in thinking that if holliganism inside the ground can be prevented it will vanish
face            outside the ground. N othing can be further from the truth. Those who live in the cities or towns where
>t of           football takes place know only too well what a Saturday afternoon can be like when fans go on the
here            rampage. There is damage to shops, houses and m otor cars. There is violence threatened or violence offered.
well            There is vulgar abuse from fans, who leave in their wake destruction, frustration, anger and resentment.
 use            There are many instances reported to me of groups waiting outside the ground or at the railway station to
ot a            ambush the opposition.
ieen
s by              6-25 It is im portant too to recognise that the hooligan is not always a football supporter, nor is he
                necessarily interested in the results o f the particular match or in football in general. A n outing to a football


                                                                        43
match is for him an opportunity to display fighting ability and to take part as a gang in an attack on an
opposing gang. There are, o f course, large num ber o f people at a football match who may rush onto the
field or behave contrary to their natural inclination because of the excitement of the moment. It is not with
those that I am concerned. It is im portant to recognise that hooligans form a tiny minority of the spectators
and that m ost supporters are keen to enjoy the game they love. They are law abiding and responsible.
Those genuinely interested in football form a substantial proportion o f the population.

   6.26 There is clear evidence that there are am ong groups, particularly of visiting supporters, organised
gangs whose object on a particular occasion is to engage in tribal warfare with the rival supporters and
Tdditionally with the police. They are drawn to football grounds like bees to honey. They find the use o f a
Tootball ground particularly attractive, firstly, because the date, time and place are fixed; secondly, because
they know there will be an opposing gang there; thirdly, they know there will be police there who can be
attacked; fourthly, they will be supported by those who surround them who otherwise would not be
involved; and, finally, they will get the marvellous publicity which attends any form o f public violence.

   6.27 If they were not at a football ground behaving in this way at least some of them would be involved
in gang warfare on the street corner or running amok in the city centre.

   6.28 One of the statistics which emerges is that visiting fans are more likely to be arrested than home
fans. This could be due to the enthusiasm of the “ home” police. But more likely it supports the view
generally expressed by football management that it is the presence o f visiting supporters which generally
leads to trouble at football grounds. At Chelsea, for instance, the breakdown of arrests both inside and
outside the grounds shows that Chelsea supporters arrested represented one in every 1,500 spectators, while
visitors represented one in every 300. In 1976, when Glasgow Celtic played away, there were a total o f 185
arrests out o f a total crowd o f 330,000 which w'as roughly one in every 2,000; when they played at home
there were 232 arrests with attendances o f 750,000, that is one is every 3,000.

  6.29 The position was even more marked with Glasgow Rangers. In 1976, when Rangers played away,
there were 233 arrests with a total attendance o f 432,000 which again represents one in every 2,000 attending,
whereas at home there were 102 arrests in 736,000 which is one for every 7,000 spectators. The figures for
Leeds United in 1970-71 show that there were eight matches in which there were no arrests and four o f
them were at games where overseas clubs were playing.

   6.30 It is impossible for a club fully to control their supporters when they play away. It can get the
supporters to join the supporters’ club, send them away in supporters’ coaches or supporters’ trains with
their stewards, and, so far as they represent the club, exercise some control over their behaviour. If they
do not behave when they are at an away ground their membership o f the supporters’ club can no doubt
be withdrawn. But that fails to take account of those who call themselves supporters o f a particular d u b ,
but whose affiliation with that club is tenous, and who seek to avoid travelling officially in order to escape
the sort o f discipline which a club can exercise.

  6.31 Instead o f going on the supervised train or the supervised coach they will travel in hired minibuses,
they will have acquired a considerable am ount o f drink on the way, they represent no-one but themselves,
and the object o f some o f them at any rate is simply to enjoy the battle. Hooligans no longer necessarily
dress the part. They are well organised and take care to keep out o f the limelight before the battle starts.

  6.32 While a num ber o f clubs have a very bad reputation because o f their so-called fans there is really
very little that they can do to control them. It is because o f them th at the substantial trouble arises.

   6.33 Thus it is now quite clear that away supporters cannot be controlled by the club whom they purport
to represent. The only control which can be exercised over them is th at by the police, inside the ground.
The num ber o f police who have to be deployed is increasing; it is now an immense burden on them and
on the community. It is quite wrong that the police should be subjected to the violence which occurs at
football matches, o r that the public should continue so to be subjected. The football authorities in England
and Scotland have suggested that police presence should be increased. It would, I suppose, theoretically be
possible so to increase the size o f the police force, that ’violence could be totally controlled. One officer to
1,000 spectators was the norm in 1969. It is now one officer to 75. By 1995 will it be 1 to 1? Alternatively,
it is suggested a m ore repressive style of policing could be introduced even though th at would be totally
alien to our way o f life. N either course seems particularly attractive.

   6.34 It is not therefore unreasonable to ask why, if a function such as a football m atch acts as a magnet
to violence, the public should have to put up with it, or why the police and the public should be required


                                                       44
    ■3 $ "


             to spend so much money and time in controlling it, or why the damage to property and life and limb
             should be allowed to continue.

                6.35. In Europe, the problem has been solved by banning English supporters. The time has not yet come
             in Great Britain when it would be right to say that if football continues to attract violence then football
             must cease. But given that it is not possible to control determined violence without injury and damage,
             even when all precautions have been taken, other steps must now be taken to prevent the situation
             continuing.

               6.36 If it be a correct analysis that substantial violence at football matches arises by reason o f the
             confrontation o f rival fans, then one solution would be to ensure th at rival fans were not present at the
             same game. Attempts have already been made to prevent this by having all-ticket matches. This is done
             by various means, either by selling the tickets during the week (which opposing fans cannot readily buy),
             by having vouchers in programmes, and by other means. It may also be decided to play a game early in
             the day to discourage rival fans from travelling. All-ticket games in Scotland are used not to prevent visiting
             fans getting into the ground, but solely to control numbers.

               6.37 Unfortunately while these attem pts have in some cases been successful they have not been universally
             so. Thus, while it may be possible to prevent Chelsea fans from getting tickets at Newcastle, it is not
             possible to prevent Everton fans getting tickets at Liverpool, or N ew port at Cardiff, o r Arsenal at
             Tottenham. Likewise, starting a game a t 11 am, while sometimes successful, has on occasion resulted in
             fans arriving overnight with nowhere to go and nothing to do, save to drink, with chaos and violence
             ensuing in that particular town.

                6.38 There has been an additional problem, which is that even when it has been announced that a game
             is all-ticket, fans have arrived without tickets at a ground and demanded entrance. F o r reasons ol security,"
             the police would rather have the fans inside the ground and accordingly they have been let in. This has
             become such common knowledge that all-ticket games are not regarded now as being the complete solution
             to the problem.

               6.39 However, all-ticket games are, in England and Wales, one o f the ways, to try to ensure that only
             home supporters are admitted to the ground. Chelsea contemplated introducing a sophisticated scheme,
             with the use o f computers, for membership o f its ground. Membership would have entitled a fan to sit in
             the best parts o f the ground. It was not, however, intended to exclude other fans, who would have been
             admitted only to less favourable parts o f the ground.

                6.40 It was, however, a limited type o f membership scheme. Going one step further, there is no reason
             why each club should not introduce a system, so as to ensure that only their own supporters are able to
             visit their own club.

                6.41 Quite clearly, nothing o f th at sort could possibly be introduced in the immediate future at all 92
             League clubs. However, it seems to me that membership o f a club, and o f that club only, as the condition
             o f entry may go someway to reducing the level and quantity of violence at a football ground. One suggestion
             made is that each club should be a registered membership and that adm ittance to the ground would be
             forbidden to non members. If the only people allowed into the ground o f club A had to be registered
             members o f club A, there is evidence that the am ount of violence at club A is likely to be reduced. That
             scheme envisages no visiting fans at all and membership restricted to one club.

                6.42 It has, o f course, obvious disadvantages for the club. Firstly all gates are made up to some extent
             o f visiting supporters; numbers vary from match to match and club to club, but on average they amount
             to some 10 per cent o f the gate. M ost clubs, I suspect, would be willing to lose the revenue from that 10
             per cent if they could have a violence-free game.

                6.43 Membership o f a club will also effectively prevent the man or woman who on the spur o f the
             moment wishes to go along to a m atch, the “casual" visitor from so doing. That, in my view, is a price
             which the public and the club have to pay to try and reduce football violence. It will also prevent a fan
             from belonging to more than one club.

                6.44 Alternatively, if club A were willing, when playing club B, to allow registered members of club B
             to enter the ground that would be up to club A, but it would force club B to take responsibility for their
             °Wn members and ensure that those to whom they issued membership cards were responsible.


                                                                   45

                    6.45 At the present time the visiting club has no knowledge o f the so called supporters, or control over
                 them, and quite rightly disclaims responsibility. If a club is to be made responsible for its members it m ust
                 take steps to ensure th a t it knows who they are and that they are people whom they are prepared to have
                 in their ground.

                    6.46 Then, it is pointed out, that it may be an interference with the liberty o f the subject to have to have
                 some form o f membership or identity card with a photograph. But nobody objects if they have to show a
                 season ticket on the railway o r have their photograph on a rail-card. Clubs already have season ticket
                 holders— a num ber have supporters’ clubs which, in some cases, is a form o f membership. It is an everyday
                 occurrence to prove identity in some form, either at w ork, to obtain credit, or in the use o f a m o to r vehicle.
                 N o d oubt there will be difficulties at the turnstiles, if someone is challenged. There is, as always, room for
                 abuse, each club will have to be alert to ensure that a particular fan does no t join m ore than one club.
                 Additionally, there will be problems which arise when a non-League club plays a League club in a cup
                 game. Thus it may be necessary for non-league clubs to have membership cards.

                   6.47 But these are problem s which can, with goodwill and effort, be overcome. Unless urgent steps are
                taken to produce some m ore efficient m ethod o f excluding hooligans, football may not be able to continue
                in its present form m uch longer.

                   6.48 The English and Scottish football authorities are against the introduction o f a membership scheme,
                although the Football League in England has set up a w orking party to examine the problem. I am aw;
                o f the difficulties. It may be that straightforw ard membership o f one club is not the only answer to the
                problem. But that is the easiest to administer and it is simple. Experience will no doubt show w hat in
                practice is the best scheme to retain the desirable supporters and exclude the undesirable. I therefore
                recommend that urgent consideration be given by football clubs in England and Wales to introducing a
                membership system so as to exclude visiting fa ns. Such a scheme does not appear on the evidence so far
                before me to be necessary in Scotland.
                  6.49 I do not pretend that this is the perfect solution, because hom e fans can be troublesom e (as they
                were as Birmingham) and decent fans may be kept away. N o r can I guarantee that it will cure football
                hooliganism. It is not, however, possible for the present situation any longer to continue.

                   6.50 F o r some reason crowd control does not appear to be such a serious problem with other forms o f
                sport in this country. T h at is not to say th at there are not unhappy signs in o ther sports o f too much drink
                being consumed, rowdiness, unpleasant racial overtones and a degree o f violence. It is not necessary yet
                to recommend the application o f a membership rule to other sports b u t the m atter should be kept under
                review.

                Identification
                   6.51 The third way in which the problem o f football hooliganism can be dealt with is by identifying the
                hooligans in the ground when they behave like hooligans. A t some grounds I have visited, because a loc ° 1
                police force is involved, the same officers are able to be present at the ground a t each home fixture, th
                regularly go to the same p art o f the ground and they are able to identify the trouble makers. However, a t
                a ground like Chelsea, because a large num ber o f officers are draw n from a wide area o f the M etropolis,
                this is not possible.

                    6.52 Closed-circuit television o f one sort or another has been introduced at a num ber o f grounds and it
                 is clear th at it has two very great advantages. Firstly, it may deter a hooligan to know that his acts are
                "Being recorded and secondly, it enables the police, even when a game is over and an arrest has not
                 immediately been m ade, subsequently to identify a hooligan, to charge him and to prove to the m agistrates,
                 by clear evidence, the identity o f the hooligan.

                   6.53 The introduction o f closed-circuit television cameras at grounds will, in my view, have a m arked
                effect on the incidence o f hooliganism and the apprehension o f offenders. One o f the difficulties the police
                have in identification an d apprehension is that they may be too busy defending themselves o r preventing
                rival fans from attacking each other so that they do not have the time or the ability to pick out an offender.
                N o r are they able, subsequently in court, to give a clear picture o f w hat happened. This the cam era does
                in the most graphic way.

                  6.54 I therefore recommend the introduction o f closed-circuit television at League fo o tb all grounds. It may
                well be that because o f cost and location this should only apply in the 1st and 2nd Divisions in England


                                                                        46
                     i^and Wales and at those clubs in the 3rd and 4th Divisions where there is some history o f violence. In
               fogssuf'Scotland I recommend their use in the Premier Division. When and where must be matters for both the
                     > football authorities to decide.          »

                       Punishment
                         6.55 A constant criticism which I have received from the football authorities and the public is that the
                       police do not prefer sufficiently serious charges and th at magistrates do not impose sufficiently strong
                       penalties. I believe there is a good deal of justification for this view.

                         6.56 It is important to recognise that the offences that the hooligans commit are offences recognised at
                       law, the maximum penalties for which are not insubstantial. They include the offences o f riot, affray,
                       assaults o f various sorts, offences against public order and breach o f the peace. There is, however, one
                       matter which may well escape the criminal law in England and Wales and that is throwing missiles. (Ia
                       Scotland it may constitute the common law offence o f breach o f the peace.)

                         6.57 Throwing missiles in a sports stadium is easy to do, difficult to detect, and dangerous in its result.
                       I recommend that there should be a specific offence o f throwing a missile (and anything thrown will constitute
                       a missile) at sports grounds.

                          6.58 While the independence o f the judiciary o f the executive is an im portant feature o f our constitution
                       and courts must feel free to impose in a particular case a sentence which they consider appropriate, it is
                       worth repeating the trenchant words o f Lord Justice Lawton giving his judgm ent in the case o f Regina
                       against W ood in the Court o f Appeal (Criminal Division) in January 1984: “ Before we leave this matter,
    ng a               however, we want to make a few observations about violence at o r near football grounds. The kind o f
      far              conduct which was revealed by the evidence in this case has become common in football grounds all over
                       the British Isles. It is conduct which is causing disquiet. From time to time arrests are made. Sometimes
                       there are as many arrests as were made m this case. The courts during the period since this kind o f violence
     they              at football grounds has become common have tried to deal with it in various ways. In the past they have
    >tball             usually not imposed custodial sentences unless serious injury was caused. The most usual penalty has been
                       a fine. But violence at or near football grounds continues. We infer that those who have a propensity to
                       use violence are not deterred by fines or by orders imposing only a limited restriction on liberty. It follows,
    ms of              so it seems to us, that the time has come for the courts to impose sentences which may deter those
    drink              who are minded to use violence at or near football grounds. Unless there are exceptional mitigating
    ry yet             circumstances—and it is not easy to see what they could be—youths between the ages o f 17 and 2 1 who
    under              are convicted o f any offence involving violence towards police officers or others trying to maintain order
                       or to spectators who are not themselves involved in the violence should receive a custodial sentence. In
                       most cases a short detention centre order should be adequate; but if any weapon has been used or a
                       disabling injury was caused or there is evidence that the convicted youth is addicted to the use o f violence,
                        a youth custody order would be appropriate. If the injury should be such to am ount to grievous bodily
                        harm, as is likely to arise from stabbing, a longer sentence may be necessary. In general, however, there
fe, t h r ­             will be a need to ensure a deterrent element in all sentences.”
ive:
 opolis.                  6.59 A number o f other suggestions have been made to me as to the cause o f football violence.

                        Attitudes towards the police
 i and it
 icts are                 6.60 When people in responsible positions in public life fail to condemn violence against the police
lias not                whenever it happens or worse still actually condone it. it does little to lead the young to believe that
I strates.              throwing pieces of concrete or other missiles at the police is other than a pretty harmless exercise. One
                        young policeman at Birmingham said: “I didn't join the police force to be dressed up in protective arm our
                        and to be a target for rocks and stones from hooligans at football matches on a Saturday afternoon.”

    :venting
                          6.61 The evidence tends to show that immediately after the war there was very little football violence as
    ffender.
                        We recognise it today, and that it started again in the 1960‘s at a time when there was full employment.
    :ra does
                        The cost of travelling to a ground, of buying drink, of hiring conveyance, of buying a ticket does not tend
                        to suggest that those who go to football grounds are particularly poor. Missiles at Birmingham consisted
     It may             ln part of one pound coins. Some who have been fined £500 were apparently able to pav with rolls o f £5
                        notes.

I                                                                             47
Turnstiles
   6.62 A lot o f grounds are old. The turnstiles were perfectly adequate to adm it fans into the ground at a
time when it mattered not on which terrace they stood. Now th at there is segregation, the siting o f a
number of turnstiles I have seen leaves much to be desired. Likewise they are often manned by elderly
friends o f the club who may decide, because they are volunteers, or at best part-tim e employees, not to
appear at the match. The inability o f fans speedily to go through the turnstiles is a cause o f considerable
a ggravation. I recommend that football clubs review their arrangements fo r entry and the organisation o f
their turnstiles.

Perimeter Fences
   6.63 In Scotland they are uncommon. A t Birmingham they proved no obstacle. There is no doubt a
limit to the am ount of fortification which a club can reasonably introduce. But a standard, efficient perimeter
fence with proper exits should not be difficult to design and provide. I therefore recommend that consideration
be given to the design o f a standard, efficient perimeter fence with proper exits.

Why violence at football grounds and not generally elsewhere?
   6.64 This has baffled inquiries and sociologists. It is said that football is a working man’s game and that
accounts for the violence. But the same violence is happily not present (certainly to the same degree) at,
for example, rugby league grounds nor at race tracks or courses. A t Halifax Town, for instance, there are
ten times as many police on a Saturday looking after 1,500 spectators as there are on the same ground
a Sunday w-hen speedway takes place with some three times as many spectators. N o one who has submitted
evidence, or to whom I have talked, has so far been able to throw much light on this question. I hope that
when further evidence is forthcoming and the m atter more fully discussed an answer may appear.

Other Matters
   6.65 I have also considered the position o f those who run on to the pitch and whether that ought to be
a separate criminal offence in England and Wales. There are conflicting views. One is that running on to
the pitch, while very tiresome and tedious, w'ould be the least serious o f offences committed, that it would
be much better th at the police should arrest those who are plainly guilty o f serious violence and charge
them with as serious an offence as is possible. In Scotland it may constitute the common law offence of
breach o f the peace. Additionally, it is said that a number o f spectators come onto the pitch in order to
avoid being squashed in pens, being attacked in the pens, or simply because they want to leave and cannot
get out elsewhere. T he contrary argument is that if it is an offence, people will be deterred from coming
on to the pitch and therefore trouble will be avoided before it gets out o f hand. I shall need to consider
this later at further length.

   6 . 6 6 One o f the advantages of close circuit television is that it enables hooligans to be detected at a
subsequent time. It appears, however, doubtful whether the powers o f arrest under Section 5 o f the Public
O rder Act 1936 will enable the police to arrest a hooligan subsequent to the offence. I am minded, therefore,
to recommend that consideration be given to providing the police with this power.

  6.67 One o f the disagreeable features o f the behaviour of spectators is the chanting o f obscene and
racialist abuse. It appears that this is not treated presently as a criminal offence in England and Wales. I
am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to creating a specific offence at a sports ground.

                                                  Postscript
  6 . 6 8 Finally may I repeat that this is an interim report only. I am grateful for all the material which I
have received so far. I look forward to receiving further detailed evidence from any responsible person or
organisation and to discussing any relevant m atter with them before I make a final report.

  6.69 I have raised a num ber of issues in this report and highlighted problems and suggested answers
where there appears to be urgency because o f the approach of the next football season. I shall need to give
further consideration and report in more detail when I have had time to consider those representations.

   6.70 It is, I hope, apparent that there is no single clear-cut or instant answer to the problem o f crowd
control. I shall however continue to pursue my task with vigour, remembering the words o f Anton Chekov,
“ It seemed that the next minute they would find a solution. Yet it was clear to both o f them that the end
was still far, far off, and that the hardest and most complicated part was only ju st beginning.”

Provisional Recommendations (To be reviewed in the Final Report)
    1 . I am minded to recommend that in England and Wales the police should be given the unfettered right
o f search before efltry to football grounds by statute. (Paragraph 3.41)

   2. I am minded to recommend that Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 should be amended with
a view to giving the Fire A uthority power in cases other than those which are regarded as wholly exceptional.
(Paragraph 3.61)

   3. Linked with the above, I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to introducing
legislation giving powers fo r the Fire Authority to apply to the High Court fo r an injunction ( or to the Court
o f Session fo r an interdict in Scotland) under Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions A ct 1971. (Paragraph 3.61)

  4 . I am minded to recommend th at Section 10 o f the Safety at Sports Grounds A ct 1975 should be
amended in like manner to Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971 (see Provisional Recommendations
2 and 3) and an application to the High C ourt for an injunction (or to the C ourt o f Session for an interdict
in Scotland) should be an alternative remedy. (Paragraph 3.76)

  5 „ I am minded to recommend that the Secretary o f State should exercise his powers to designate all
spdrts grounds, whatever their size, to include indoor as well as outdoor activities. (Paragraphs 3.145)

  6 . I am minded to recommend immediate designation o f any ground capable o f holding over 5,000
spectators, to cover all sports grounds, not merely football grounds. (Paragraph 3.146)

  1. I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to providing the police with additional
powers o f arrest under the Public Order A ct 1936. (Paragraph 6.66)

  8 . I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to creating a specific offence o f chanting
obscene or racialist abuse at a sports grdund. ( Paragraph 6.67)

FIR E A T VALLEY PA RAD E, BRA D FO RD, 11 MAY 1985

Summary
Technical assessments have been carried ou t on different aspects o f the Bradford, Valley Parade, fire. These
assessments show th a t the overall m echanism is complex, involving a num ber o f interm ediate steps o f fire
developm ent. C onditions appear to have existed by way o f building construction, m aterials and design
such th a t fire development on each step was severe and near the upper limit o f w hat m ight be expected
from research knowledge and experience o f fires.
This applies to the grow th o f fire in the rubbish (aided by adequate ventilation through the gaps etc in the
stand) to give sufficient intensities to ignite tim bers beneath the floor, the emergence o f flames (again aided
by the gaps) to give a growing fire beneath and above the floor, the spread o f flames to the ceiling and
subsequent spread beneath the com bustible roof.
These features coupled with the reluctance o f persons present to evacuate quickly, the design o f escape
routes (leading persons upw ards to a corridor incapable o f dealing with the necessary flow under emergency
conditions), the rapid deterioration in visibility and increase in toxic gases in the corridor, and rapid flame
spread beaneath the ro o f (with very high levels o f downw ard radiation) produced the tragic situation.
The attached table summarises the sequence and times o f events as projected from those feasible from
research experience, in com parison with actual times and events.

Ignition of W aste M aterial

Types o f waste material

Waste m aterials discarded a t football m atches are likely to cover a wide spectrum o f types. It is reasonable
to assume th at these will include:
 (a) S m o kers’ materials: cigarette stubs, spent matches, cigarette packets (including shrink wraps and foil),
     m atch boxes etc.
 (b) Food packaging: crisp packets, confectionery wrappings, plastics and paper cups, bags, metal cans
     etc.
 (c) Cleaning equipment: tissues, paper napkins.
 (d) Reading and related material: program m es, magazines, newspapers, tickets etc.
 't ) O ther materials: toilet rolls, etc.

Ignition of waste by smokers’ materials
M atches                             -
Based on research experience, m ost o f the above items (excluding m etal cans), would be expected to ignite
readily from flaming m atches held deliberately in contract with the material. It is less easy to ignite materials
with discarded flaming m atches since they tend to extinguish during a fall. N orm ally the m atch head is
allowed to b u m before a m atch is used. If then discarded, whilst still burning, from norm al hand height
(about 1.2m above the floor) a test has shown th a t o u t o f 48 matches, 35 self-extinguished during the fall,
12 were still burning on the floor and capable o f igniting waste m aterial. It was n o t always apparent that
the m atch was still burning w ithout close exam ination. One m atch illustrated an im portant point in that it
fractured during striking such th a t the head was still burning during the fall.
Discarded m atches (flaming) therefore represent a potential source o f ignition to waste m aterial. The
ignition potential is increased m arkedly when the head is still burning during a fall, following accidental
breakage, because o f mishandling during striking o r purposeful action.

Cigarettes
Full cigarettes can sm oulder for periods between ab o u t 15 and 40 m inutes depending upon their environment;
discarded stubs considerably less. M ost lighted cigarettes do not extinguish during a fall. F urther, it is not
always easy to recognise th at a cigarette has not been fully extinguished and therefore still smouldering
when discarded.
W aste m aterials vary m arkedly in their propensity to sm oulder when in contact w ith a lighted cigarette.
Sm ouldering is usually associated with natural rath er th an synthetic m aterials.
F o r sm ouldering to take place, the cigarette needs to be in good contact with the material. This can be
assisted when the sm ouldering zone o f the cigarette reaches an optim um position for local material
involvement. W ith some m aterials (cotton, tissues) transfer o f smouldering m ay be rapid. Local smouldering
o f the item m ay persist with the possibility o f subsequent transfer to flames, particularly if assisted by a
draught. W hen flaming occurs grow th is likely to be the same as that from direct flaming ignition. It is
unlikely th a t the mixture o f rubbish would show signs o f bulk smouldering for long periods. The effect is
m ore likely to be a local effect.

Pipe m aterial
Sm ouldering tobacco from a pipe will exhibit similar effects to those given for cigarettes above. There is
the possibility th a t since the glowing zone may be larger th an with cigarettes the effect, particularly inducing
m aterials to sm oulder locally and flame, will be greater.

Conclusion
Research experience supported by recent tests shows th a t waste materials can be ignited by lighted matches
including those discarded whilst still burning. It w ould seem quite feasible for a lighted m atch dropped
through a gap in the flooring o f the stand to ignite rubbish beneath. Ignition would be alm ost immediate.
The possibility o f ignition by a lighted cigarette discarded into the cavity is also feasible but the cigarette
would have to fall into a critical position against critical materials. A delay would be involved before
flaming occurred.

Fires in concealed spaces
T he concealed space beneath the wooden floor o f the m ain stand varied in depth from about 50mm to
some 0.5m as formed by the steps on the hillside. Various sizes o f tim bers were present in the cavity
including “ sleeper size” tim bers set into the hillsides to provide wooden foundations. Support timbers for
the bench seats and walkways would be expected to be a t least 4inch x 2inch timbers finished w ith finch
o r linch jo o sely fitted planks. There is evidence th a t other cellulosic boarding had been used vertically to
seal the cavity and fo r repair work. G aps in the w oodw ork, holes etc capable o f collecting rubbish, also
form routes by which air could gain access to a cavity fire. Assuming that the cavity was undivided for
long lengths then air access would not be unduly restricted.


                                                        61
 Flam es originating from a small source in the rubbish w ithin such a cavity would fee expected to grow
 quickly particularly if sufficient rubbish existed to form a layer (not unreasonable at the bottom o f a slope
 w ithin the cavity). In the open air a 10cm deep layer o f rubbish, 0.5m x 0.5m in area was ignited in a test
 a t F R S by a dropped m atch a t the fifth attem pt (others extinguished in the fall) giving flames 0.5m high
 over the whole area in 90 seconds. Such a fire would n o t be unrealistic within the stand cavity without
 jp-owth being restricted unduly by inadequate ventilation. Such a fire would be h o t and likely to be noticed
 by a person above, even during the early stages. Smoke would develop progressively over this period and
 pl&stics waste in the rubbish would <idd distinctive odours.

 The 90 seconds example quoted above relates to a defined configuration o f rubbish; the speed o f development
 could vary in other practical situations depending on the packing density and on the proximity o f the
 spread C3Vlty            ’ and a Wlder area o f rubbish would provide the opportunity for m ore extensive


 Such a rubbish fire (about lOOkW requiring some 0.03m3/s air) would be expected to give a local heat flux
 onto the surface o f adjacent timber sheeting o f ab o u t 20-40kW /m 2. U nder these conditions ignition o f the
 tim ber w ould occur in less than 30 seconds with the subsequent burning o f the tim ber surface generating
 some 100k W /m . Early spread onto the underside o f the tim ber planking (particularly on vertical surfaces)
 would then have accelerated due to cross radiation, provided adequate air was available under the platform .

 I t is n o t unreasonable to suppose th a t flames would now rapidly emerge over several square m etres o f
 flooring through the gaps. A t this stage the fire below the platform would generate abou t 300kW per square
 m etre provided the air requirem ent o f a b o u t 0.1m 3/s were met. The flow o f air to the fire area could well
 have been supplem ented a t this stage by the failure o f thin sheets o f plywood o r hardboard; this would
 have significantly increased the rate o f fire growth.

 Ignition o f the upper face o f the planking over a wide area would then have further accelerated spread
 w ith large areas o f tim ber burning, and w ith virtually no restriction o f air supply a merging o f the flames
 would have occurred above the platform in addition to that below. These conditions would have represented
 a fire generating some 0.5 to IM W /m 2 o f floor; involvement at this stage o f an area o f a bo ut 4m 2 would
 have represented a fire o utpu t o f some 2-4M W .

Smoke w ould have increased throughout the burning period; during the early stages o f the rubbish fire,
adequate venti ation would have tended to produce clean flames and, provided the plastics content o f the
rubbish was relatively 1° w'   smoke w ould have been grey. Nevertheless, significant am ounts o f smoke
would have been emitted in the vicinity o f the fire before flaming was apparent above the timbers.

Conclusions

The developm ent o f fire m a layer o f rubbish beneath the floor could have been rapid since gaps in
w oodw ork large enough to allow rubbish to collect would also have provided access o f air. Such a fire
could have been intense locally in the cavity. A substantial rubbish fire m ay have developed within 90
seconds, capable o f igniting adjacent tim bers within abo ut 30 seconds.

Flames are likely to have spread in the cavity beneath the floor aided by local failure o f timbers, with
emergence o f flames to upper surfaces through the gaps. This is an effective means for rapid flame spread

about two o r three m inutes from exposure o f the timbers to the rubbish fire.

TECHNICAL ASSESSM ENT 3

Early growth of fire above the stadium wooden flooring components
Once fire had broken through the stadium flooring o r lining under the benches then conditions w ithin the
stadium would have begun to be significantly affected. The video recording o f the early stages o f fire shows
flame appearing at points away from the earliest established flames and rapidly joining up with them. Thus
the initial increase in fire size above the “flooring” was m uch faster than would have been expected from
a small ignition source spreading over w ooden flooring and benches w ithout the reinforcement from below.
H eating from below and above would in any cask give fast decom position o f thin wood boarding o r
hardboard. Spread up the slope would be expected to be faster than sideways both because the fire in the
cavity would naturally have burned upw ards and because the fuel (benches) on the tiers o f seats above the
fire would have been m ore strongly heated by the flames than benches to the side o f (or lower than) the
fire.
A plum e o f hot smoke-laden com bustion gases would have risen above the fire tow ards the roof. W ith a
sideways wind this would have been deflected sideways som ewhat but as the fire increased in size the gases
would soon be reaching the ro o f cavity over the fire in some quantity. Here because they would have been
hot and therefore buoyant, they would form a stable layer which would flow in both directions along the
channel created by the ro o f geometry. The fire occurred near one end o f the stadium and when the layer
travelling tow ards this end reached the vertical screen filling in the end o f the ro o f channel, it would become
relatively stagnant, gradually deepening and the flow o f gases would then be essentially in only one
direction— tow ards the other end o f the stand.
A strong side wind could not have prevented the form ation o f a smoke layer from a sizeable fire n or its
flow in the shelter o f the ro o f channel, but could have interfered somewhat with it.

Conclusion
The fire in accum ulated rubbish beneath the stadium caused a very rapid increase in fire size once it had
appeared above the stadium flooring. The fire would very soon be producing large quantities o f hot smoky
gases which would rise and flow along the channels in the roof, probably with some interference from the
wind.


TECHNICAL ASSESSM ENT 4

Fire growth to stage where flames were reaching roof
W hilst a plausible explanation for the initial very rapid increase in fire size exists, it could be difficult to
predict this from basic relationships. Therefore in order to assess the resulting fire conditions occurring in
the stadium it has been necessary to use the video recording to provide inform ation on the fire size at
various times for use in established engineering calculations.
Three times (from the W est Y orks TV timed recording) have been selected to illustrate the further processes
occurring, viz. 15.44.4, when the fire appeared to be involving an area about three seats wide and four tiers
o f seating deep, 15.45.0, when the fire appeared to be involving an area about five seats wide and six tiers
o f seating deep, and 15.45.5, when the area o f the fire appeared to correspond to the whole o f the G-block
o n the one side o f the gangway dow n the tiers, ie a block of 11 seats x nine tiers. A t this latter time flame
can clearly be seen in the video recording to run rapidly some distance along the top o f the wooden fence
ju st in front o f the w ooden seating area, forming a good time m arker, and an indication o f the fire severity
a t th at time.
W ith a rapidly growing fire such as this, complex calculations would be required to predict the flow rate,
tem perature, depth etc. o f the hot gases produced and time has not perm itted such sophistication.
C alculations have accordingly been m ade for a num ber o f fire sizes, each calculation obtaining the flow
conditions as though the fire were constant in size. The calculations are admittedly in this way approxim ate
b u t are nevertheless revealing in terms o f flame and smoke spread.
F o r each o f these fires the mass and volume rate o f sm oky gases reaching the layer in the ro o f channel,
th e initial depth o f the layer flowing in the ro o f channel, the flame height, the initial tem perature o f the
gases in the layer and hence the radiation from the layer, have been obtained. F o r this, relationships
developed at the Fire Research Station and elsewhere have been used; these are summarised in BRE C urrent
Paper 66/78 “ Studies o f fire and smoke behaviour relevant to tunnels” . Flame height has been derived
from the correlation o f Cox and Chitty (Combustion and Flame 39, p. 191, 1980).
The precise heat release rate o f the fire is n o t know n but probably lay between 0.5 an d lM W /m 2 o f
horizontal floor area, and therefore the calculations have been m ade from b o th values. F o r the present
purpose it has been necessary to imagine each ro o f section replaced by a rectangular section channel o f
the same w idth, springing from the same height a t eaves level and o f cross-sectional area equal to the actual
roof. T he dimensions o f the ro o f are only know n approxim ately a t present b u t with a height from eaves
to ridge taken as 2.2m, this gives an equivalent depth fo r the rectangular channel o f 1. lm . T he centre o f
all the fires is assumed to be 4m below th e eaves.
The results o f the calculations are shown in Table 1. R unning dow n the first colum n, this fire would have
given a flow o f 11.5kg/s (14.5m3/s) o f smoky gas into the layer. W ith an ou tp u t o f 0.5M W /m 2 the
tem peratures o f the gases entering the layer would be 150 deg C above am bient and if they flowed into
one section o f the ro o f they would travel along the section a t ab o u t 1 .8 m /s (assuming one-directional flow),
and w ould take up a depth o f abo ut 1.25m. T he predicted flame height is 3.9m, so th a t flame does not
reach r o o f level. I f we assume the smoky layer is a black body rad iato r the irradiance immediately above
the layer (ie th a t to which the ro o f m aterial is exposed), and also immediately below the layer is only
2kW /m 2.
The first significant result o f the values ju st quoted is th a t with the fire feeding smoky gases into only one
ro o f channel, the gases cannot be wholly contained within that channel, since the calculated layer depth o f
1.25m is larger than th a t o f the equivalent rectangular channel (1.1m). T hus even at this stage smoke should
have been flowing into the rear “ corridor” section o f roof. W hilst it should have tended to rem ain largely
in a layer, where it cam e into contact w ith the outside wall some downflow due to cooling by the wail
could be expected. F urtherm ore the actual ro o f shape w ith sloping sides would have been less effective in
containing the layer in the region where the gases were rising u p from the fire and there was a horizontal
velocity com ponent across the ro o f channel in the gases first form ing a layer. Finally, wind turbulence at
stanchions o r any other similar projecting objects could locally disturb the layer and cause some smoke to
be bro u g h t to lower levels o f the corridor.
The flames from the 3 x 4 fire would n o t have reached the ro o f and the heating caused by the h o t gas layer
(2kW /m 2) was insufficient to ignite the ro o f m aterial. The dow nw ard radiation from the layer, which in
other circum stances w ould have been very noticeable to any one underneath, here would have been m asked
by direct radiation from the prim ary fire.
C ontinuing with Table 1, it can be seen th a t assuming an ou tp u t o f IM W /m 2 gives higher tem peratures
b u t th a t the heating from the layer is still much too low for ignition o f the ro o f m aterial. F o r example,
pilot ignition (ie ignition o f a heated m aterial in the presence o f a pilot flame) occurs for w ood at an
irradiance o f ab ou t 25kW /m 2 in 25 seconds. In the absence o f direct experimental d ata this has to be
assum ed as applying to w ood in a roof, even though this might be exposed in an atm osphere which was
vitiated to some extent. It is in any case a m easure o f the rate o f decomposition— even pyrolysis— o f wood.
This discounts convection transfer to the roof, which w ould be likely to be appreciably less th an radiation
transfer fo r these tem peratures.
A velocity o f the layer in the region o f 2m /s m eans th a t the sm oky gases could have travelled half-way
down the length o f the stadium (50m) in some 25 seconds, even had the fire n o t been growing rapidly in
size.
Examining the d ata in Table 1 for the 5 x 6 fire it is seen th a t the initial depth in one ro o f channel calculated
as 1,6 m m eans th at smoky gases would have flowed in bulk into all channels. Therefore the calculation for
this and for the larger fires has taken the w idth o f the effective ro o f channel to be 15m, the full w idth o f
the roof.

Conclusions
In order to illustrate the fire phenom ena occurring, three fire sizes have been selected over a period judged
to be crucial in terms o f fire grow th, and estimates m ade o f a num ber o f quantities using established
engineering relationships. A num ber o f simplifying assum ptions have had to be made.
These estimates show that with a fire occupying an area three seat widths by four tiers the smoky gases
produced could no t have been contained w ithin one section o f the ro o f and therefore the corridor area at
the rear o f the stand could have been affected. Smoky gases from this fire could have travelled half-way
along the stand in less than 25 seconds, but they would no t have ignited the m aterial in the roof.
F o r a larger fire (five seats x six tiers) smoky gases would have flowed in bulk into all ro o f channels.

 Spread of smoke and flame beneath roof
 T he stage at which the flames from a growing fire in a com partm ent reach the ceiling usually m arks a
 change, often dram atically sudden, in the speed o f fire growth.
 Flam es impinging on the underside o f a ceiling o r roof, even o f non-com bustible m aterial, will “ m ushroom ” ,
 ie elongate very considerably, because it then becomes m ore difficult for them to entrain air an d they have
 to elongate to entrain enough air for com bustion. These elongated flames will radiate strongly downw ards
 over increasing distances so th a t the spread o f fire at low level accelerates, resulting in still greater flames
 under the ceiling and hence even faster fire spread.
 Very soon the dow nw ard radiation from the flames, together with that from the ceiling which they have
 heated, can give spontaneous ignition o f flammable objects away from the prim ary fire, and “ fiashover”
 in the com partm ent.
 W ith com bustible ceiling or ro o f linings, the lining can itself b u m and hasten the process, but it is im p ortant
 to realise th at the phenom enon can occur w ith non-com bustible ceiling linings, given a prim ary fire large
 enough for large flames to impinge on the ceiling.


                                                                65
  Experim ents by P L Hinkley (Fire Research N ote 712) show ed-that flames channelled to travel in one
  direction u nd er a ceiling could be ab o u t five times longer than the height they would rise to above the
  ceiling height, if the ceiling were rem oved. F o r example, 10m high flames from a fire in the open could give
  flames 2 5m long if the flames were constrained to flow in one direction along a channel 5 m above the base
  oi th e lire.

  F o r illustrative purposes nom inal flame lengths under the ro o f have been included in T able 1 It is more
  reasonable now in terms o f flame impingement on the ro o f to consider the height to ridge, ie abo ut 6 m. A
  conservative value for flame extension by a factor o f five has been assumed. Thus in the fifth colum n, the
  flame length o f 7m is arrived a t by subtracting 6 m from the flame height o f 7.4m and m ultiplying by five.

 ] J f w f U2ltY n T a b le , l [ ° r thue five seat. x six tier fire show that   ^ e higher rate o f heat release o f
 IM W /m , flames could have been reaching the ro o f and flowing along several metres under it. Ignition o f
 the ro o f m aterial would be expected soon under these conditions, at least locally where the flame was
                   n *?a r tf r o m the flaming under the ro o f the layer near the fire would have been hot enough
 (4 /0 <_ above am bient) to give very severe radiation exposure to people underneath it.
 T he layer o f sm oky gases would a t this time be expected to be extending over the whole width o f the
 stadium ro o f and should have travelled at least halfway along the length o f the roof.

                          Ua T    X 9 .llCr,fire We see that the Predicted !ength o f flames under the ro o f is
 substantial (15-30m ) and the quantity o f sm oky gases reaching the ro o f and the speed o f their travel under
  he ro o f a re high. The flames would likely to be mainly travelling along the central ro o f channel though
 there m ight have been som e spill over into the “corridor” section o f the roof, if the sloping seating tended
 to give flame nsing m ore tow ards the rear o f the seating block. The difficulties o f the precise prediction o f
 the rad iation from the layer near the fire are illustrated in the last line.

 If a n o u tp u t o f 0.5M W /m* is assumed for the prim ary fire, the tem perature o f the layer close to the fire
 (but outside the flame zone itself) would have been 440°C above am bient, high enough to be a very severe

 n n n if w f S v, vf otherA and t,he assum ption o f lM W /m * leads to a level o f radiation from the layer
 (100kW /m2) high enough for pilot ignition w ithin a few seconds.

 In view o f the rapid spread o f flame along the top o f the wooden fence which occurred a t this time this
 suggests th a t the higher value for heat release rate would be m ore appropriate at this tim e (though not
 necessarily a t the earlier times).                                                             1    s

approxim ation fo r the conditions which would have prevailed in practice. Nevertheless the tendency for

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

   1. It is important to know all the provisions o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975, which are
relevant to premises within its scope. These are explained, without legal force, in the booklet “Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds— Football”, obtainable from Her Majesty’s Stationery Office. The following
points are particularly important but reference should be made to the Act itself for authoritative information.

Offences and penalties
  2. For the following offences, that is to say:
 (a) Contravening any term or condition o f this certificate, admitting spectators to the Stadium at a time
     when a safety certificate is not in force or in contravention o f a Court Order, the penalty is, on summary
     conviction, a fine not exceeding £2,000 or, on conviction on indictment, a fine or imprisonment for
     a term not exceeding two years, or both.
 (b) Failing to give notice o f an alteration or extension to the Stadium or obstructing an authorised officer,
     the penalty is on summary conviction, a fine not exceeding £2,000.

Changes of conditions
  3. In accordance with Section 11 o f the Act authorised officers have power to inspect premises to which
the Act applies to see whether conditions therein have changed to the extent that the safety measures for
spectators are diminished.
  4. Regardless o f this, however, you must inform the Local Authority in advance if you are proposing
to make alterations or extensions to the Stadium or any o f its installations other than by way o f routine
maintenance works.

Rights of Appeal
   5. The Act gives rights o f appeal against decisions o f the Local Authority or the inclusion o f any o f the
terms or conditions in this Certificate. The periods within which appeals must be lodged and the procedures
to be followed are laid down in the Safety o f Sports Grounds Regulations 1976.

                 FINAL REPORT OF THE COM M ITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD
                        SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPO RTS GROUNDS

                                                  Introduction

Sirs,
   1. On 13 M ay 1985 I was appointed to undertake an Inquiry with the following terms o f reference:
        “To inquire, with particular reference to the events at Bradford City and Birmingham football grounds
        on 11 M ay, into the operation of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975; and to recommend what if
        any further steps should be taken, including any that may be necessary under additional powers, to
        improve both crowd safety and crowd control at sports grounds.”

  2. The Assessors appointed to assist me were M r Alan G oodson OBE, Q PM , Chief Constable of
Leicestershire and M r M artin Killoran Q FSM , formerly C hief Fire Officer o f G reater Manchester. They
have been o f the greatest assistance. Their professional expertise and advice has been invaluable to my
Inquiry. W ithout their help my task could scarcely have been completed with such expedition.

   3. Neil M organ was Secretary to the Committee. H e has contributed enormously to the sm ooth running
o f the Inquiry by his constant good hum our and efficiency. M ark de Pulford and Jill Hales have both
shown the twin virtues o f the Civil Service, intelligence and hard work, and they have been ably assisted
by Jane O sborn. N athalie Austrie has been o u r efficient personal secretary.

   4. A t an early stage o f my Inquiry I decided to prepare an interim report giving the results o f my
investigations into the events at Bradford and Birmingham , together with some preliminary recommenda­
tions on safety m atters and crowd control. This was done so that safety levels could be improved quickly,
before the start o f the new football season in the middle o f A ugust 1985. In a list o f provisional
recom m endations I also gave a tentative view on a num ber of longer-term issues which I proposed to
follow up in this my Final Report. My Interim R eport was submitted to the two Secretaries of State and
subsequently presented to Parliam ent on 24 July 1985 (Cm nd 9585). I am grateful for the G overnm ent’s
quick and positive response to my Recom m endations and to local authorities and sports m anagem ent for
their subsequent action to improve safety.

  5. Since my Interim R eport was published I have considered the written evidence submitted by a wide
range o f organisations and individuals on the remaining aspects of my Inquiry. I have also heard oral
evidence from m any o f them. A full list o f those who submitted evidence to the Inquiry is given in Appendix
A to this R eport. I am grateful to all o f them.

  6. During the course o f the Inquiry the two Assessors and I have, between us, visited 31 soccer grounds
in England, W ales and Scotland. They are listed in Appendix B. We have also visited sports grounds
devoted to Rugby Union, Rugby League, cricket, horse racing, greyhound racing, athletics, tennis, m otor
racing, stock car racing and speedway. In addition, we have visited indoor stadia.

   7. In this, my final report, I deal with five main subjects. The first, in Chapter 1, is the disaster at the
H eysel Stadium in Brussels on 29 May 1985. It was agreed th at I should take account of any lessons arising
from this tragic event, although the official investigation was, of course, a m atter for the Belgian authorities.
I visited Brussels, together with my Assessors, and met the chairm an o f the Belgian Parliamentary
Comm ission which investigated the disaster and M adam e Coppieters’t Wallant, the investigating judge,
together with representatives of the police, gendarmerie and fire service. All were extremely helpful, and I
am grateful to them, and also to the British A m bassador and his staff in Brussels for their assistance and
advice.

     8.      In Chapter 2 I review previous inquiries over the last sixty years into crowd safety and hooliganism
at sports grounds and conciude th at there is still need for action.
     9. Chapter 3 deals with the working o f the S a fe ty o f Sports Grounds A ct 1975, and the need for further
  regulation to protect the public who attend sporting events, from fire and the hazards o f faulty construction.
  Unfortunately, these are not the only hazards to spectators at sporting events nowadays, and in Chapter 4
  I turn to the serious problem o f violence.
                                                                                                              .
      10. In my Interim R eport I said th at your G uide to Safety at Sports G rounds (the '[Green G uide”)
  contained so much good advice th at it should be com pulsory reading for all sports ground mariagemenC
  T hat opinion holds good, but as the last edition o f the Guide was published in 1976, and as it is so
  im portant a source o f advice, I decided to follow your suggestion and look afresh at the whole document
  to see if it should be revised, o r if it could be im proved. The Inquiry commissioned research from three
  consultants— Professor Canter, Professor o f Applied Psychology at the University o f Surrey (on hum an
  behaviour in emergency situtations' and its implications for the design and dissemination o f information);
  Professor H appold, Professor o f Civil Engineering at the University o f Bath (on technical building aspects);
  and D r W oolley o f the Fire Research Station, B oreham w ood (on fire precautions m atters). The material
  they produced was extremely useful and practical, and I am indebted to them. This inform ation greatly
  assisted a special w orking group which I set up under M r K illoran’s chairm anship to consider the Green
  Guide. A record o f the G ro u p ’s deliberations and m em bership is given elsewhere in this Report (Appendix
  E).

   ) 11. Chapter 4 deals with crowd control. In this chapter I look at the problem as it exists now, and make
y k num ber o f recom m endations for new offences and for some increased powers for the police in relation
   to sports grounds and hooliganism. In the light o f my m any visits to football grounds, and evidence from
  a variety o f football authorities and othei bodies, I give my further thoughts on control o f alcohol and on
  membership cards. I also deal with the role which football clubs themselves should play in improving crowd
  behaviour.

   12. In Chapter 5 I look at the extent o f football hooliganism and several theories abo ut its causes. I have
 been much assisted in this task no t only by academic research and evidence, but also by observing for
 myself the behaviour o f fans on the terraces and by listening to them when they came to give evidence
 before me. But I have to confess to a certain lack o f success in this part o f my Inquiry.

   13. Finally, I believe that the p a ram o u n t need is to protect the public by improving safety standards,
 and thereby restoring confidence am ong those who attend sporting events. This means th at effective steps
 should be taken quickly. In this belL f I com m end my findings and Recom m endations for your consideration.




                                                                                             Oliver Popplewell

                                       >         Tragedy at Brussels

    1.1 A t ab out 7.30 pm on 29 M ay 1985, English fans charged into Block Z o f the terrace at the Heysel
 Stadium, Brussels, shortly before the E uropean C up Final between Liverpool and Juventus was due to
 take place. T here was a panic am ong the spectators in Block Z; as a result 38 people died and some 400
 people were injured.

   1.2 It was agreed th at I should take into account any lessons arising from the events at Brussels. In
 doing this I do no t intend to apportion blame. N either do I propose to make any com m ents which might
 prejudice any possible criminal proceedings.

       1.3 T he official investigation into these events has already been carried out by a Commission of Enquiry
    set up by the Belgian Parliam ent, which reported on 9 July 1985. At the present time M adam e Coppieters’t
    W allant is carrying out an inquiry into the circumstances. She will be producing a confidential report,
    which will be used purely to consider the prosecution o f those alleged to have com m itted criminal offences.

       1.4 T he death and injury o f so m any people m ust be the main subject o f my investigation. However, it
    is clear from all the evidence available to me that the behaviour o f the crowds, both inside and outside the. ^         j
    ground, an d before the match, as well as during it. needs also to be considered. So do the precautio n ! - ^        /
    which the various authorities sought to take to prevent outbreaks o f violence.

       1.5 I have had the opportunity, together with m y Assessors, o f visiting the Heysel Stadium and discussing
    the m atter with the Belgian and British authorities and with Liverpool Football Club. I have been provided
    with a very large num ber o f statements by those who were present, together with reports from Belgium
    and a variety o f official documents. I have also talked to M adam e Coppieters’t W allant. It will be obvious
    th at in the absence of a thorough and prolonged public enquiry the evidence available to me is somewhat
    limited. It is bound to be fragmentary, and while it gives generally the broad picture it will not necessarily
    coincide with the individual observations of everyone w ho was present. Indeed there are acutely differing
    views ab o u t some m atters. The lessons to be draw n are, however, reasonably clear.

    The Heysel Stadium
      1.6 It was opened in 1930. It has been regularly used for football matches, including an international
    football m atch a few weeks before the 29 May, between Belgium and France, at which the attendance was
    about the same as at the Liverpool/1Juventus game.

       1.7 The Stadium is owned by the City of Brussels and leased to the Belgian Football Association. There
    had been no criticism by the Belgian Football Association nor by U EFA , who are the bod} controlling
    E uropean football, o f the facilities at the ground or of the structure.

       1.8 A plan o f the Stadium is at Appendix C. There are two open terraces at each e n i of the ground
    m arked “ X ” , “ Y ” and “ Z” and “ O ” , “N ” and “ M ” respectively. Between the two sets o f terraces are two
    stands. The stand m arked Tribune 2 was built in ah o u t 1980. A part from that, the Stadium is as it was
    constructed in 1930. It is the largest of its kind in Belgium and provides facilities no t only for football
    matches but for athletics.

       1.9 The terraces at “ X ” , “ Y ” and “ Z ” were formed o f a slope of approximately 1 in 10 at the shallowest
    and ab o u t 1 in 6 at the steepest. The surface o f the terraces was earth with only the nosing of the steps
    being form ed in concrete. Over the years the concrete nosing has deteriorated, and rusted re-inforcing bars
    have been exposed. The edges were uneven and jagged where pieces of concrete had broken off. The generalv.
    condition of the terracing may be described as poor. T he crush barriers showed signs o f deterioration toM
    both the concrete uprights and the re-inforcement. On the day of the match the perimeter fence consisted
    basically of two barriers. One was aJfcd ck ^m ictu i^ 4 B C S tB q 7 o a the terrace side, was wire fencing about
    two metres high.

J    1.10 There was a barrier dividing Block “ Y” from Block “ Z ” . It consisted o f two lines o f tubular steel
 I hand rail fixed bv m etal straps to the top of the existing concrete crush barrier uprights. It thus formed a
I  passageway from top to bottom of the terrace. To one of the continuous hand rails were fixed fairly
I lightweight steel posts approximately 2.5-3 metres high. Tied to the steel posts was plastic coated wire

   mesh fencing. This com posite construction, whilst form ing a physical barrier, was not o f sufficient strength

      1.11 The flank wall where the disaster occurred was about three metres high at its maximum, reducing
   to just under two metres adjacent to the terrace. The brickwork wall did not appear to have been bedded
   m m ortar n o r fixed m any other way to the concrete wall. The buttresses of the wall were such th at they
   would not assist m restraining the wall from m ovem ent when subjected to crowd pressure. It was not
   constructed as a crush barrier. N o t surprisingly, it was not adequate to act as such. The wall and perimeter
   fence m fro nt o f the terrace were of fairly light construction which readily collapsed under the forward
   pressure or the crowd.                                                              —-

     1.12 There were three places of entry and exit at the back o f Blocks “ X ” , “ Y ” and “Z ” and three single
  a<5 > l ^ S ^ £ ro m ^ t ^ c ^ -QPtP. thejMifih. There were no turnstile controlled access points! but s o m e '
  control was exercis'ed'by gatemen. It was thus impossible to know the num bers going into each block or t
  to prevent overcrowding m one block. In addition there were gaps in the boundary walls through which
  entry was effected by a num ber o f spectators into Blocks “ X ” and “ Y ” .

 _ J .- 13 H aving regard to the state of the crush barriers and fences, and the general condition of the terraces
  it seems uqlikejy, had it been located m this country, that a certificate would have been issued u nd er the
— Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 for this part of the ground. However, the poo r state o f the terraces
  played no p a rt in the tragedy.

  The Arrangements for the Game

     1.14 By 24 April 1985 the finalists were known. A m eeting was held by the Belgian Football Association
  at its own H eadquarters. There were present M. Roosens, the Secretary of the Belgian Football Association,
  a num ber o f police officers, a m em ber o f the gendarm erie and representatives o f Liverpool Football Club.

     1.15 In Belgium the policing is carried out by both the local police force and by the gendarmerie who

  c 1- !6 11 was a greed that the distribution and the positioning o f spectators should be organised so that
    nghsh fans would be positioned m Blocks “X ” and “Y ” o f the terraces, in “ U ” , “ V ” and “ W ” (in Tribune
  “x r"          ’ " F” ’        r ? ” fin Tribune I)- Juventus were to be accom m odated in Blocks “ O ” and
    N of the terraces, m Q , ‘ P ” and “ W ” (in Tribune 2) and in “ G ” , “ L ” , “ I” and “ K ” (in Tribune 1)
  It was agreed that each side would be issued with some 14,500 tickets o f which 11,000 were for the terraces.

    1.17 It was arranged by the Belgian Football Association that Block “Z ” and Block “ M ” would be
 allocated to neutral spectators, and Liverpool F ootball Club officials were told th at a maximum of five
 tickets per person would be sold to spectators. There was agreement that there should be a barrier p u t up
 between Block Y and Block “ Z ’ , and another barrier between Block “ N ” and Block “ M ” The Belgian
 Football Association had agreed with the authorities that there should be at least one eendarme on each
 of the steps o f the segregation gangway between Block “Z ” and the English fans in Block ” Y '\ These and
 other matters were discussed, including the times of opening the ground and how English fans should
                 Wt rC K k     ™eetIngs d u n n g M ay in Belgium and England. One m atter which was agreed
 was that there should be a ban on the sale of alcohol aro u n d the ground.


 t J t ' U ThUS MW>?S hu ped t,fat the English fans a n d Juventus supporters would be properly sesregated and
 th at they would be physically prevented from being able to get at or to throw missiles at each other They
           f contained within their own areas. However, the officer-in-charge o f the gendarmerie at the ground
 did not fully understand w hat his instructions were, n o r unfortunately had he attended any o f the meetings
 B l o c l t “Y ”              reI ult' f0r a number o f different reasons, the gendarmerie presence between
 c lo c k s Y and   Z   was insufficient.

    1.19      The advance intelligence was, broadly, that the English fans would present little or no trouble. This
 had a m arked effect on the precautions which were taken. Liverpool have a good record, so far as European
 com petitions, m which they have played for some 22 years, are concerned. Their m anaeem ent has long
 experience and they sought to take the norm al precautions to prevent the unauthorised acquisition of
 tickets, to co-ordinate travel arrangem ents and to liaise with the Belgian authorities.
   1.20 So far as the sponsored travel arrangem ents were concerned, supporters were accom panied by
officers o f the British T ran sp o rt Police. T h at generally seems to have gone off w ithout difficulty. However,
one group o f unsponsored supporters were refused passage by a Belgian vessel and there was a further
group of 400 unsponsored coach travellers w ho h ad apparently had a great deal too much to drink.

The Sale o f Tickets for Block “ Z ”
   1.21 T here were various alarm s ab o u t the sale o f black m arket tickets and forged tickets. One o f the
m atters of concern for the Liverpool Club was tne sale o f tickets for Block Z . By the U E F A instructions,
no blocks o f tickets were to be sold at the venue of the m atch except in small quotas. W hat happened to
the sale o f some o f the tickets for Block “ Z ” was described by M . Roosens. He said that there were some
3,000 tickets available for sale on the first day and they were put in the hands o f a M. D esm ent who had
been selling tickets for the last twenty years. The sale took place at the Heysel Stadium , and a notice was
put up saying th at they were available for 300 Belgian francs each and that the m axim um which could be
purchased was five per person. W hen the staff arrived there was already a massive queue before sales had
started. M . D esm ent later walked through the crowds and noticed th at there'W&e*moTrtlcRets being sold
to foreigners than to Belgians. He enquired from M. Roosens w hether the sale should be stopped. T he sale
was in fact stopped. By then they had sold 2,000 to 3,000 tickets.

   1.22 Because tickets were being sold from five different windows it was impossible to control who bought
them. It was quite clear from all the evidence th a t some organisations had been buying large quantities of
tickets. They did this by using a large num ber c f their employees to take it in turns to go to the ticket
windows. M . Roosens agreed in evidence th at people had left the Stadium with whole rolls o f tickets.
A dditionally, M. Roosens allowed 1,000 tickets to be sold to a director of a sports club committee who
apparently sold them to an insurance com pany which sponsored the club. One witness spoke o f a travel
agent from Sicily with 60 tickets for Block “ Z ” which he was selling outside the ground at 100 times the
official price.

  1.23 It is quite clear that whether the tickets found their way onto the black m arket or not, a large
num ber o f tickets for Block “ Z ” came into the hands o f Juventus supporters. The effect was, therefore,
that all the careful preparations for the segregation o f the English and Italian fans were rendered u se le ss./^ /

The events of 29 M ay
   1.24 It is n o t surprising that there is a great deal o f conflicting evidence about the events o f this day even
from experienced witnesses such as police officers. C ontradictions about the behaviour o f the English fans
before the game abound. I set out here as best I can some of the evidence presented to me.

    1.25 E laborate arrangem ents were made within the Belgian authorities for meeting and escorting the
 English supporters after their arrival in Belgium and on the train. U nfortunately, because o f the timetable
 which the shipping com panies operated, large num bers o f English fans arrived in Brussels well before kick-
 off.

     1.26 T he behaviour of the English fans in the centre o f Brussels gave a foretaste of what was to happen
 later in the day. It is only necessary to refer to one or two incidents so as to give an idea o f how some,
 albeit a small m inority of the English supporters, were behaving. It is said that about 2.000 supporters had ^
  taken over the G ra n d ’ Place and the surrounding area. They were throwing beer bottles at the Belgian P:
  Police, they were spitting, they were hurling beer at cars. One witness described the Grand" Place as looking ];}
  like a broken glass factory. One supporter, who had drunk too much and was wearing a toy British police
  helmet, stood at a nearby cross-roads directing traffic, thereby causing severe dislocation o f traffic. A
 jeweller's shop was robbed by English fans. O ther fans were bathing in the fountains. A witness described
  a grocer's shop being pillaged. The steps o f the Stock Exchange were invaded. A num ber of English fans
  arrived at Jette from the train. They already had drink with them, although a good deal o f it was
  confiscated. They tried to get into the buses provided for them w ithout paying. In this they were unsuccessful
\ because the bus driver simply refused to drive them. A very experienced senior British police officer
: described the conduct o f the English fans as the worst he had ever seen.

     1.27 O ther witnesses, however, gave a totally different picture. Some supporters have written to say that
 while there was some noise, the general behaviour was good, the atm osphere friendly and relaxed, and that,
 far from the police standing by while something akin to a riot was taking place, the police were heavy
 handed, interfering with people who were merely singing and enjoying themselves and treating both sets
 o f supporters to an excessive display o f authority.


                                                           5
    1.28 Yet other witnesses talk o f a carnival atm osphere with British and Italian fans fraternising freely
 w ith each other, taking photographs an d exchanging mementoes a n d favours. This view was supported by
 a senior police officer to w hom I spoke when I was in Belgium.

 Events at the Stadium

     1.29 The first incident recorded in the Brussels Police R eport took place at 3.55 pm when some o f the
 tem porary fencing, which had been erected all roun d the Stadium , was knocked down by Juventus
 supporters. It was erected to enable the Police m ore easily to search fans. It was ab out a kilom etre long,
 comprising fifty sections. By abou t 4 pm ab out thirty o r m ore sections had already been knocked down.
 This was not, apparently, considered serious by the police, because it was only intended to provide a buffer
 between the supporters and the ticket barrier. The police and gendarmes intended to search fans near the
 outside fence with a view to confiscating sticks or other weaponry. It is perfectly clear from all the evidence
 th at there were insufficient police or gendarmes to search all spectators. Additionally it was wholly
 impossible to search people and at the same time to m ake sure th at they did not retrieve w eapons that had
 been confiscated.

     1.30 There is a great body o f evidence that the searching was perfunctory; that because o f the absence
 o f turnstiles an d the presence o f holes in the perim eter wall, a large num ber o f people got into the Stadium
 w ithout tickets; th at those who had tickets inside were able to pass them back to those outside who did
 not. W eapons which were confiscated earlier were retrieved. The weapons varied. There were sticks used
 to carry flags, pieces of tree trunks, bottles and stones. Additionally, it is clear that a num ber of spectators
 had had too m uch to drink and a ban on the sale o f alcohol outside the ground was not enforced. Bottles
 o f drink were on sale at a num ber of stalls, thus providing more am m unition for the fans.

   1.31 At 5.15 pm there was a police rep o rt that some of the perim eter fence in Block “ N ” , occupied by
Juventus supporters, had been cut. At 5.46 pm there was a report that Italian supporters were beginning
to vent their anger on the police. At 5.55 pm there was a report that there was general disorder in Block
“ O ” , that supporters were becoming agitated and th a t 200 of them were beginning to get worked up,
hurling insults at the police in the segregation gangway. A few m inutes later there was a mass invasion of
Block “ M ” by supporters because Blocks “ O ” and “N ” were full.

    1.32 Com m issioner M eura of the Brussels City Police said that some o f his officers inside the stadium
were pelted with missiles by the Italians, who were attem pting to use riot tactics, surging forw ard en m as'e
a n d retreating. He decided that what he m ust do was to protect the pitch and, although some of ti e
perimeter fencing intended to protect the pitch was knocked over, he succeeded in preventing a pitch
invasion. However, some 27 police were injured as a result of concrete and metal objects being thrown at
the Juventus end of the ground.

   1.33 The Police report records a request at 7.06 pm for re-inforcements in the gangway o f Blocks “N ”
an d “ M ” , where the situation suddenly took a turn for the worse. A nd the report continues:
      “It should be noted that the relative calm in the upper parts o f sections “N ”, “M ” and “O ” only served
      to camouflage the jeers and provocation which a few hundred Juventus fanatics were directing at the
      police lower down. They began to cause trouble between 5.55 pm and 7.25 pm; initially in a fairly
      moderate way, there was a %hour during which insults were being hurled at the police and the supporters
      were trying to break through the fencing (Heras fencing shaken several times). The police in the gangway
      could not prevent 5 to 6 metres of fencing from being torn down at about 7 pm. Then 30 metres were
      forced and trampled down so as to give direct access to the track. All this despite the use of shields and
      truncheons by the police, several of whom were injured. It should also be noted that stones and/or lumps
      of concrete and some beer bottles, 20 in all, were raining down onto the track. Some hooligans from
      amongst the supporters were even running up to the police with sticks and iron bars.”

    1.34 The report describes one hooligan at the Juventus end getting through the fencing and onto the
pitch itself and sprinkling salt between the goal-posts; and there is a report o f another incident when a pair
o f hand-cuffs were taken from a police officer by a hooligan who got onto the pitch; subsequently they
w ere retu rn ed A lthough it had been arranged that Juventus supporters should have Blocks “ O ” and “N ”
a n d that “ M ” should be allocated to neutral supporters, it is clear that Block “ M ” was occupied by
Juventus supporters. Both the police an d the gendarmerie described to me the behaviour of the Italian fans
u p to this stage as worse than that o f the English fans.

    1.35 W hat meanwhile was happening at the other end o f the ground, in Blocks “ X ” , “ Y ” and “ Z ” ? The
first signs o f unrest am ong the English fans appeared during the youth match which had been organised


                                                        6
to keep the spectators occupied; this occurred somewhere between 6.15 pm an d 6.30 pm. The English fans
fired flares and rockets and threw stones into Block “ Z” , which was beginning to be occupied by what
were clearly Italian supporters. T here was also a num ber o f English fans in Block “Z ” who sought to
escape into Block “ Y ” . According to C aptain M ahieu, who was in charge o f the gendarmerie responsible
for patrolling the area between Block “ Y ” and Block “ Z ” , everything was calm between 6.15 pm and 7
pm. Accordingly he had gone out o f the Stadium ; so too had L ieutenant Bonnet who was his second-in-
com m and, to investigate a criminal com plaint and to see about closing Block “X ” . It appears there were
about 15,000 spectators in Blocks “ X ” and “ Y ” and ab o u t 5,000 in Block “ Z ” .

   1.36 There is no do ubt but th at somewhere between 7.15 pm and 7.30 pm English fans charged Block
“ Z” . Preceding this there had been an exchange o f missiles between Blocks “ Z ” and “Y ” . There were three
charges by English fans. The first two seemed to have been repulsed; the third resulted in the Italian
supporters in Block “ Z ” , who were seeking to escape tow ards the perimeter, being squashed and suffocated
by the press o f large numbers.

Extreme Political Parties
   1.37 There was evidence abo ut the presence o f supporters from the extreme right. The M ay or gave
evidence at the Inquiry th at he had seen British and Italian spectators wearing the political insignia of
parties o f the extreme right and carrying flags. One British supporter, himself a referee, said th at the ground
outside the Stadium was littered with British N ational F ro n t leaflets, some overprinted by the British
N ational Party with their address. One witness spoke o f passengers on the boat crossing the Channel with
N ational F ro n t insignia singing songs o f hatred and exhibiting violence.

    1.38 M r John Smith, Chairm an o f Liverpool Football Club, spoke of how six members o f Chelsea
N ational F ro n t had boasted to him o f their part in provoking the violence and said th a t they seemed proud
o f their handiw ork. M r Bob Paisley, a form er m anager of Liverpool Football Club, said that he was forced
to leave the D irectors’ Box at the start o f the game as dozens o f fans poured over the dividing wall and
th at the person next to him claimed th a t he was a Chelsea supporter and was wearing a N ational Front
badge. A num ber o f banners decorated with swastikas were recovered after the match, including one
m arked “ Liverpool Edgehill” . There was also evidence th at the flag o f a right wing organisation, “New
O rder” , was being flown by a small group o f Juventus fans. A banner with “ England for the English” and
“ Europe for the English” was observed and a contingent o f the N ational F ron t were clearly seen in Blocks
“ X ” and “ Y ” . One party leaving Brussels main station was observed to be Londoners wearing Liverpool
colours, carrying U nion Flags and having N ational F ro n t and swastika tattoos.

  1.39 A part from their presence, there is very little hard evidence that they caused any of the violence.
Commissioner M eura said that he had not seen anyone from any extreme right wing organisation wearing
any insigna. On 5 July a press statem ent was issued by the Merseyside Police which said:
      ‘ There is no evidence to suggest that any National Front members were involved in the riot at the Heysel
      Stadium in Brussels.”

W hat lessons are to be learned?
1.40 A Parliam entary Commission of Enquiry was set up in Belgium on 12 June 1985. It reported on 9
July 1985.

   1.41 The Commission concluded in this way:
      “ It should be emphasised from the outset that it was the British supporters who mounted the disastrous
      charge into Section “ Z ” . They bear the main responsibility for the terrible events that followed and this
      must remain the case for whatever blame might be attributed to others as having aggravated the m atter.”

  An extract from their conclusions appears in Appendix D.

  1.42 W hen I spoke with M. Collignon, the C hairm an o f the Parliamentary Commission o f Enquiry in
Brussels in N ovem ber, he t d d me that the only m atter in his report that on reflection he might like to alter
was to m ake rather m ore criticism o f the Belgian and European football authorities and less of the individual
members o f the gendarmerie.

   1.43 In his principal statement to Parliam ent about the Heysel disaster, the Belgian M inister of the
Interior said:                                             «

  1.45 In A ugust 1985 “T he E uropean C onvention on Spectator Violence and M isbehaviour at Sports
Events and in Particular at F ootball M atches” was agreed. It has at the m om ent been signed by ten of the
parties. It has been ratified by four.
  1.46 T he key points are th at the C ontracting Parties shall:
        1. co-ordinate the policies and actions of Government Departments and other public agencies against
    '   spectator violence and misbehaviour (Article 2);
        2. secure that adequate public order resources are employed to counter outbreaks of violence and
        misbehaviour near and inside grounds and along transit routes used by spectators; and facilitate co­
        operation and exchange of information between police forces of different localities (Article 3.1);
        3. seek to ensure that offenders (especially visiting supporters) are identified, prosecuted and that they
        receive appropriate penalties (Articles 5 and 3.1(c));
        4. encourage the co-ordination of travel arrangements to inhibit potential troublemakers from leaving to
        attend matches (Article 3.3);
        5. introduce procedures to identify problem matches in advance and for effective co-operation between
        authorities and clubs on precautions and measures to be taken (Article 4);
        6. encourage the use of stewards in supporters’ clubs for crowd control and information (Article 3.2);
        7. press football and local authorities and stadium owners and clubs to take the necessary practical
        measures for problem matches, eg in the design, improvement and selection of stadia, segregation, alcohol
        control, ticket sales, the exclusion of drunks and troublemakers etc (Article 3.4);
        8. encourage football authorities to review their regulations continuously (Article 6.3);
        9. looking further ahead, take social and educational measures to promote the more positive side of
        sport, eg fair play and active participation (Article 3.5); and
        10. establish a standing committee to police the operation of the Convention and to propose improvements
        (Article 8).

   2.1 W hen my Interim Report was published, it might have been thought by some th a t the suggestions
 which I set out had only recently been considered. It was said to be unfair to expect tlie football clubs to
 have taken earlier steps to arrange their affairs. It was urged that they should now be entitled to more tune
 and more money in order to deal with the problem s o f crowd control ftfid safety i t ihetr grounds. The
 problem o f crowd control and safety had. so it was said, suddenly arisen. ! have to say that alm ost all the
 matters into which I have been asked to inquire and alm ost all the solutions ! have proposed, have been
 previously considered in detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period of sixty years.

 The Shortt Report
    2.2 On 11 J une 1923, the then Secretary o f State for the H om e D epartm ent asked the Rt H on Edward
  Shortt K'CTto form a C om mittee to "Inquire, am ongst other things, into arrangem ents m ade to deaLm tt
. the abnorm ally large attendances on special occasions, especially attendances at athletic grounds. This
  arose from disorder which occurred at Wembley Stadium on the occasion o f the first Cup Final on 28
  April 1923. The Com m ittee reported on 13 M arch 1924. The R eport was presented to Parliam ent and
  published as C om m and Paper 2088 at the princely sum o f 6d.
                                                                                         «
     2.3 A b out responsibility ib r control inside grounds the R eport had this to say:
       “ As regards the general question of the apportionment of responsibility inside the ground as between the
       police and the ground authority, the principle to be followed should, in our judgment, be th at the police
       should be responsible for all matters appertaining to the preservation o f law and order and th at for
       arrangements for the convenience of the public the ground authority should be responsible. It is, however,
       most im portant not only that the police arrangements should be under the control of a single officer, but
       also that the duties for which the ground authority is responsible should be assigned to a definite
       individual, who should be competent to give instructions and to deal with any incident which arises. If
       responsibility is definitely allocated in this manner it appears to us that, in ordinary circumstances, there
       need be no difficulty in this division of duties and th a t no disadvantage need result from the existence of
       dual control so long as the closest co-operation is maintained between the two authorities at all times.
       We are of the opinion, however, that if any emergency arises or there appears to be the slightest
       probability of a disturbance, it is essential that control should pass into the hands of one individual, and
       we recommend that, in the case of grounds providing accommodation for more than 10,000 persons, on
       all occasions when specially large attendances are anticipated or for other reasons unusual excitement
       is to be expected, arrangements should be concerted beforehand by which one individual can a t any
        moment take control of the situation.”

    2.4 T hat paragraph o f the report continued:
       “The question ‘»i such circumstances would have become one of the preservation of law and order and
       we therefore have no doubt that the control should then pass into the hands of the senior police officer
       present, and we consider that such officer would be justified in any circumstances, whether in accordance
       with a pre-arranged scheme or not, in assuming control if he considered it necessary for the purpose of
       the restoration of order. As part o f the arrangem ents for this purpose we think that, in the very large
       grounds, there should be a central control box in telephonic communication with all parts of the ground
       and th at the principal police and ground officials should be stationed there so th at they may be in constant
       touch with the situation.” . . . (Paragraph 22).

     2.5 A bout stewards the R eport said:
        “ W e understand th at there is no uniform practice with regard to the employment of stewards at sports
        grounds, that in some cases they are only used to show spectators into the seating accommodation, and
        that, in cases where stewards are employed for packing of the standing room, they are only employed
        when there are specially large crowds. We consider it desirable in the interests of safety that^ for the
        purpose of handling a crowd, stewards should be employed in any case where the crowd is likely to
        approach the capacity o f the ground. For seating accommodation stewards should always be employed.
        It is in the highest degree important th at any such stewards should be properly trained in their work and
        intimately acquainted with the part of the ground placed under their charge. We doubt whether it is
        practicable to secure suitable men for this purpose unless they are given continual experience in the
      work, and we therefore recommend that every ground with a capacity exceeding 10,000 which provides
      terraced accommodation for its spectators should maintain, or have a call upon, an adequate staff of
      efficient stewards, and should ensure that they keep proficient by requiring them to perform duty at
      frequent intervals. Stewards should be organised as a disciplined body and should act under the control
      and supervision of their own officers. They should wear a distinctive badge o f authority, which they
      should not be able easily to discard.” (Paragraph 27).

   2.6 The R ep ort had this to say ab o u t precautions against fire:
      “ W e have been somewhat surprised to find that in many cases little or no precaution is taken against
      the risk of fire in stands. We do not suppose that either the risk or the consequences of fire would be so
      serious in an open stand as in a closed building, but we consider it most important that adequate
      arrangements should be made to deal with any outbreak which might occur.” (Paragraph 40),

      but concluded generally:
      “ W e are assured that these governing bodies are only too anxious to secure that their sport is carried
      on under conditions which will promote the public safety, and we feel that at this stage it is safe to leave
      the m atter to them.” (Paragraph 47).

The Moelwyn Hughes Report
     2.7 The next rep ort (published as Cm nd 6846) arose out of the disaster at Boltcn W anderers’ Football^
  G ro und on 9 M arch 1946. M r R Moelwyn Hughes K.C was appointed by the then H om e Secretary to
  conduct an enquiry into the circumstances of the disaster which arose by the presence of some 85,OQO~
  spectators. 50,000 had been expected. Because of the press o f people in an enclosure two barriers collapsed'
' and 33 people were killed.

   2.8 It is interesting to observe that the previous best attendance at Bolton in the 1945—46 season had
 been 43,000 and it was amply policed by a force of 60. On this occasion there were 103 police to control
 85,000 spectators, which is about 1/10th of the present ratio of police to spectators at football grounds,
 both inside and outside the ground.

   2.9 M r Hughes m ade a num ber of recom m endations. He said:
       “ Burnden P a rk is typical of most home grounds o f the leading football teams in the country. They have
       grown stage by stage from humble beginnings on sites acquired when the large gates of these days were
       not anticipated, or when the clubs had not achieved eminence. It would be idle to suggest th at the grounds,
       or large sections of them, should be rebuilt, but if they are to be made reasonably safe and if the risk of
       repeating the tragedy of Burnden P ark is to be avoided, then, 1 have formed the clear view that the
       following steps must be taken . . .” (Page 10).

   2.10 The recom m endations included inspections of the enclosures, scientific calculation o f the maximum
 num ber to be allowed entry, counting those entering the ground by mech .nical means and central co­
 ordination o f the system, all to ensure the admission o f a safe num ber of spectators.

   2.11 So far as future regulation was concerned the R eport said:
       “ The preceding safety measures cannot be secured without legislation. A Departmental Committee
       reporting on Crowds to a previous Home Secretary in 1924 (Cd 2088) anaemically recommended that
       adequate provision for safety be left to the pressure of the governing bodies in sport. The most
       im portant of these was, of course, the Football Association, which had not deigned to appear before the
       Committee . . .
       The legislation should empower the Home Secretary to issue general regulations for different kinds of
       grounds and the broad conditions necessary for safety.
       No ground of any considerable size should be opened to the public until it has been licenced by, I s u r e s t
       as an appropriate licensing authority, the local authority. The issue of the licence would depend upon
       satisfying the authority as to the construction and equipment of the ground, its compliance with regulations
       and the proposed maximum figures o f admission to the different parts.”

    2.12 M r Hughes went on to say:


                                                          11
      “Compliance with the recommendations of this Report will cost money. They will involve grounds in a
      loss of gate money on popular days . . . The insurance for greater safety for the public demands a
      premium.”          *
M r H ughes ended his report by saying:
      “ I earnestly hope that, if the proposals I have made in this Report, or similar suggestions, commend
      themselves to you, Parliam ent will not be slow in granting you the necessary powers.” (Pages 11-12).

The Chester Report
2.13 M r H ughes’ words fell on d eaf ears. It was another 22 years before there was a further repo rt
com missioned by the G overnm ent on the problem s o f football. In June 1966, the then Secretary o f State
for Education and Science appointed M r N orm an Chester CBE, as he then was (W arden o f Nuffield
College, Oxford), to chair an Enquiry. His terms of reference were:
      “ To enquire into the state o f Association Football at all levels, including the organisation, management,
      finance and administration, and the means by which the game may be developed for the public good; and
      to make recommendations.”

2.14 M r Chester m ade this observation ab o u t crow d behaviour:
      “ In recent years there has been an increase in disorderly behaviour by spectators. During the period
      1946-1960 there were 195 cases brought to the attention o f the FA, an average o f 13 per season. In the
      following six seasons 148 cases were reported, an average of 25 per season. The m atter was discussed
      some time ago a t a meeting between representatives of a number of police forces (including the British
      Transport Police), the Football Association and the Football League. Both these governing bodies have
      been very concerned at this development.”

2.15 The R eport continued:
      “ We have not been able to devote the time and resources to the study o f this problem which its complexity
      deserves. W e very much welcome the initiative of the Birmingham Research Group, of which D r J A
      H arrington is Research Director and have been fortunate enough to see the Group’s preliminary report.
      W e are sure th at its findings will be o f value to all concerned.” (Page 97).

The Harrington Report
2.16 This was m ade to the then M inister o f S p o rt.1 It observed:
      “ Some spectators carry knives, hammers, sticks and spikes, choppers, and other offensive weapons like
      powdered pepper which are not necessarily used for violent purposes but may be used in threatening
      displays. There is also the problem of singing or chanting bawdy or obscene songs and phrases some of
      which are also threatening and provocative.” (Page 8).

2.17 A b o u t riots the Report said:
      “ While such riots must be regarded as almost unknown accompaniments of football in this country, their
      potential seriousness and danger were exemplified recently by football riots in Turkey, where many
      people were reported killed. While comparable riots seem unlikely here, it would be foolish to rule out
      the possibility of much more serious crowd disturbances at football matches than we have yet experienced.”
      (Page 9).

2.18 The R eport regretted inactivity thus far:
      “ The question of public safety and crowd control at football matches was dealt with by a departmental
      committee report published in 1924 (Cmd. 2088) and the inquiry into the disaster at the Bolton W anderers
      Football Ground in 1946 (Cmd. 6946) . . . Unfortunately the most helpful suggestions in these reports
      have often been ignored, though the committee’s recommendations do carry some weight with boards of
      football clubs.”

  2.19 The R eport went on:
      “ The absence of national legislation outlining minimum standards of safety and amenity at football
      grounds means that some club managements do not feel obliged to put their grounds into a state
      considered by the police to be necessary for crowd control.” (Page 33).
' “ Soccer Hooliganism: A Preliminary Report.” Bristol: John Wright and Sons Ltd 1968.
 2.20 A nd continued:
    “ W e feel that improved ground facilities would not only help to deal with the hooligan problem b a t d*
    something towards its prevention. Chibs often seem keener to spend money on the purchase of players
    than to undertake any major spending on ground improvement which would increase safety and make
    hooligan control easier. The loss of revenue which a club may suffer from alterations may be the
    determining factor. There is of course no obligation on a club to convert a ground which can accommodate
    50,000 to one which takes a smaller number in conditions of greater safety and comfort. Letters from
    members of the public suggest that already some are staying away because of their dislike of poor
    facilities, overcrowding, and disturbances, so that the neglect of ground improvement may ultimately be
    self defeating.” (Page 34).

 2.21 So far as responsibility is concerned, the R epo rt said:
     “ W e think that those responsible for club management and the governing bodies of football should accept
     far more responsibility for keeping their crowds in order. This applies not only within the stadium itself
     but to club supporters travelling in groups to and from matches. One gets the impression that some clubs
     disclaim any responsibility for the behaviour of their supporters and if the atmosphere of a Roman
     holiday is not deliberately fostered it is looked on with considerable tolerance. Football matches are
     commercial enterprises conducted for profit on private premises and clubs have therefore a heavy
     responsibility for keeping order and safety for the public on their premises.’ (Pages 35-36).

  2.22 In its sum m ary the R epo rt concluded:
     “The solution of the problem of hooliganism in the football stadium is ultimately the responsibility of
     individual clubs who must each deal with it in the light of local circumstances. While a few clubs are
     exemplary in their attitude to the problem others are laissez-faire and need persuasion to take a more
     active role in trying to control hooliganism in their own grounds. This laissez-faire attitude does not help
     the police in their attempts to deal with the m atter.” (Page 56).

The Lang Report
  2.23 Shortly thereafter, a W orking Party under the chairm anship of Sir John Lang G CB and including
a num ber o f distinguished members, was appointed by the then M inister with special responsibility for
Sport to examine the problems involved in football crowd behaviour to which attention had been called a
few m onths previously by the H arrington R eport. Sir Jo h n s R eport was presented on 21 N ovem ber 1969.

  2.24 By way o f introduction it said:
     “ The W orking P arty was dealinp. with a subject which has been discussed almost ad nauseam during
     recent years. N ot unexpectedly the W orking P a rty has not found a single simple solution for a problem
     which is often due to a combination o f factors . . .” (Page 3).

  2.25 T he members o f the Inquiry witnessed the dem onstration o f CCTV equipm ent and reported:
      “ . . . the view was formed that closed circuit television could be of value in the general subject of crowd
      control and . . . would be an im portant factor in preventing misbehaviour by spectators at grounds. It
      was a refinement which most of the top class clubs could be expected eventually to have as a m atter of
      course.” (Page 9).

  2.26 A b out alcohol the R eport said:
      “There can be no doubt that consumption of alcohol is an im portant factor in crowd misbehaviour, both
      because it stimulates quarrelsomeness and because empty bottles are dangerous missiles. There would
      be no advantage in refusing licence facilities to football club grounds this would merely stimulate
      spectators to bring their supplies from outside.” (Page 14).

The Wheatley Report
   2.27 On 4 February 1971 the R t H on Lord W heatley was asked by the then Secretary o f State for the
H om e D epartm ent and the then Secretary o f State for Scotland to m ake an independent ap p raisal of the
effectiveness o f existing arran gements for crowd safety at sports grounds in G rea t Bntain. and o f the
im provem ents which could be brought ab o u t within the present framework o f the law, and to consider the
natu re of any alterations in the law which appeared to be needed. This arose from the disaster at Ibrox
P ark where 66 spectators died.
  2.28 O n 16 M arch 1972 Lord W heatley completed his R eport and it was presented to Parliam ent and
published by H M SO as Cmnd. 4952.

   2.29 T he R eport contained a technical Appendix. Following the Report, the Safety o f Sports G rounds
Act 1975 was passed. A licensing system involving the issue o f a safety certificate for designated grounds
was introduced and supporting guidance (the G reen G uide) was published. In his R eport Lord Wheatley
said:                           , .
     “ I recognise that a decision to introduce a licensing system for grounds along the lines I have recommended
     may cause anxiety to some football clubs and football administrators. As I see it, their misgivings are
     associated with a fear that such stringent conditions might be attached to the granting of a licence that
     many clubs may not be able to afford the cost and some may have to go out of business.” (Paragraph
     66).

  2.30 “ M y answer to that is this. M y task was to consider the problem of crowd safety at the grounds. Clubs
     which charge the public for admission have a duty to see that their grounds are reasonably safe for
     spectators. That is a primary consideration. It is accordingly necessary that some standards should be
     imposed and observed. This has been recognised by the football authorities themselves . . . I have
     canvassed all the alternatives that have been proposed or which I personally thought were reasonable to
     consider, and the one which I decided was best to meet the situation in the interest of the public is the
     licensing system by a local authority. There is nothing new in this proposal. It has been mooted for
      almost fifty years. It can come as no surprise to the football world, and in the light of happenings over
      the years the demand for an independent appraisal and determination of the safety of grounds becomes
      almost irresistible. I certainly cannot resist it.” (Paragraph 67).

  2.31 L ord W heatley ended his R eport by saying:
      “ I trust that this Report may be of assistance to you in deciding what should be done to solve this
      im portant question of crowd safety in football grounds. One thing is certain. The public demand for
      something to be done has been growing over the years. I am sure I am reflecting public opinion when I
      say th at something must be done now. The evidence certainly supports that view.”

The M cElhone Report
  2.32 In O ctober 1976 the then Secretary of State for Scotland asked M r Frank M cElhone M P to chair
a W orking G ro up on Football Crowd Behaviour
      “ to consider the problems caused by some Scottish football supporters and to make recommendations
      to the Scottish Football Association and other organisations concerned.”

Among the membership o f the W orking G roup were representatives from the football autho'ities, from
the football clubs and the Strathclyde Police.

   2.33 In the introduction to the R e p o rt1, M r M cElhone said:
      “There is no simple solution to the problem; it is but one of the manifestations of anti-social behaviour
      besetting society in general today. We have however in our findings arrived at a number of conclusions
      and recommendations which we hope, given a commitment to implement them on the part of all those
      most closely concerned, will go some way towards reducing the problem of hooliganism at football
      matches and by so doing turn football grounds once again into places of entertainment where parents
      can take their children to enjoy, in relative comfort and safety, the pleasures of our national game.”

   2.34 The Report observed that:
      “ A hooligan is a hooligan no m atter where he operates and the fact that his behaviour is conspicuous at
      a football match has very often nothing to do with the game itself.” (Paragraph 4).
 M r M cElhone saw the problem as one of trying to reduce, or at least contain, the incidence o f hooliganism
 at football matches w ithout restricting the pleasure o f the majority o f supporters.

    2.35 So far as drink was concerned, the Report recommended that it should be an offence for a spectator
 to carry or attem pt to carry alcohol into a football ground; that it should be an offence to be in possession

more people w ho were physically capable o f carrying o ut the duties o f enforcement would have to be
recruited an d suggested that, in their recruitm ent o f stewards, clubs should look to their supporters’ clubs
to assist in providing the kind o f men required for the job. So far as transport was concerned, the Report
recommended th at it should be an offence for anyone to be in possession of alcoholic liquor on a vehicle
hired specifically for the purpose o f carrying passengers bound for a football match; o r to allow any
alcoholic liquor to be carried on a public service vehicle being used for the purpose o f carrying passengers
to football matches; o r to allow the carriage o f any drunken person on such a vehicle bound for a football
match.

  2.36 So far as the separation o f supporters was concerned the R eport recommended:
      “T hat in the interests of crowd control and safety, separation of rival supporters at turnstiles should t e
    ' carried out if the police, in consultation with the club, consider such a step to be necessary; that for~
      matches where larger than average attendances are expected, sufficient turnstiles should be opened
      timeously in order to achieve speedy admission:” (Recomm endation 13).
       In order to protect the players, match officials and the pitch, access to the playing area should be made
       as difficult as possible. To prevent an invasion of the playing area by spectators . . . the erection o f a
     t physical barrier in the form of a fence not less than 1.8 metres in height with access points to allow the
       pitch to be used if necessary for the evacuation of spectators in an emergency.” (Paragraph 53).

  2.37 A further recom m endation was that:
      “ the Courts should m ake full use of the higher fining powers under the Criminal Law Act 1977 in respect
      of common law offences which include malicious mischief, breach of the peace and assault, these being
      the most common offences associated with football hooliganism, and in respect of persistent offenders,
      should normally impose imprisonment without option.” (Recom m endation 19).

   2.38 The R eport recom mended that:
      “The police should have statutory powers to search for any containers . . . in the possession of any
      person entering or attempting to enter football grounds.” (Recom m endation 24).
bu t went on to point out that the clubs must bear their share o f the responsibility for the behaviour and
conduct o f their staff at all levels:

   2.39 A m ong other observations the R eport says this:
      “ W e recognise that many football grounds in Scotland are very old; some could even be described as
      primitive in that not only do they lack any kind of comfort for spectators but they also lack basic
      amenities including adequate toilet accommodation. This primitive environment encourages some people
      to react in a primitive manner. Moreover there is a strong case for more seating accommodation. In our
      view it would go a considerable way towards reducing hooliganism; potential trouble spots could be more
      quickly recognised and identification of troublemakers by police would be made that much easier.”
The R eport therefore recommended:
      “that clubs should consider the provision of additional seating accomodation. In addition clubs must
      provide adequate toilet facilities for men and women and generally improve amenities for spectators.”
      (Paragraph 88).

   2.40 This R eport also recommended that:
      “ players should be encouraged by the clubs to extend their voluntary public relations work in the
      community including personal appearances at youth clubs etc and coaching sessions in schools with the
      objects of promoting the game and the concept of good sportsmanship.” (Recommendation 37),
CCTV was recom mended and supporters’ clubs encouraged. The Scottish Football Association -was
recommended t j take appropriately firm action against clubs.

 Department of the Environment Working Group
   2.41 The m ost recent G overnm ent publication on the subject o f football is the R eport o f an Official
 W orking G ro u p on Football Spectator Violence set up by the D epartm ent o f the Environment, which was
 published by H M SO in 1984. The W orking G roup was set up following serious incidents of violence


                                                         15
involving British supporters a t England’s soccer matches in Luxem bourg and France in N ovem ber 1983
and F eb ru ary 1984 respectively. It dealt partly with problems arising out o f international football.

  2.42 H owever, as regards domestic football the R ep ort said:
     “ the Group reaffirmed the importance o f consistent planning, preparation and co-ordination; of building
     on experience; and of the need to consider afresh all possible measures, including those previously thought
     to be impractical or unnecessary.” (Paragraph 5.1).
     “W e recommend therefore th at the FA reviews and better defines its powers and procedures and the
     responsibilities o f the clubs. I f their powers prove to be inadequate, the Association should consider
     enhancing them.”
The R eport went on:
     “This would better equip the FA to implement some of the recommendations.” (Paragraph 5.5).

  2.43 T he F ootball Association h a d issued a “ blueprint” detailing the precautions which league clubs
should take against violence, which was circulated to clubs at the beginning o f the 1983-84 season. The
W orking P arty R ep o rt said that it:
        . . has not been rigorously adopted by all clubs. Since it represents the collective wisdom of football
     clubs, many of whom have successfully countered serious threats of violence, its implementation should
     have prevented some of the violence in grounds last season.” (Paragraph 5.7).

   2.44 T he R eport observed that the enforcement by the Football Association o f its “ blueprint” occurs
after the event when the deficiencies in a club’s planning has become apparent. The R eport recommended
that:
     “ improved means should be found for ensuring that clubs adopt the provisions of the “ blueprint” in a
     way appropriate to their own grounds and matches.” (Paragraph 5.7).

  ■The R epo rt went on to recom mend th at each club should produce a detailed set o f plans to be
subm itted to the football authorities for endorsem ent. This would prevent some clubs from avoiding their
responsibilities and might ensure also a more co-operative and com mitted response.

   2.45 The R eport recommended th at matches between high risk clubs should be program m ed so th at the
risk or threat of violence could be reduced. The R epo rt said:
      “ I t is more likely to take place a t the beginning and end c f the season and at holiday periods, particularly
      a t seaside fixtures when other groups of young people sometimes also clash with football supporters.”
      (Paragraph 5.13).

  2.46 The R eport went on to recommend the introduction o f club membership, the introduction of CCTV
and closer links with the community. It did n ot recom m end that alcohol should be banned in grounds and
concluded that in the absence o f clear evidence th a t the introduction of legislation along the lines o f the
Crim inal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 w ould reduce violence at English soccer matches, it could not
recom m end such action. Furtherm ore, said the Report:
      “legislation o f this kind would be unwelcome to many; the majority of football clubs are untroubled by
      violence and would unnecessarily be penalised financially and the vast majority of non-violent spectators
      would suffer for the actions of the few.” (Paragraph 5.34):

  The W orking G ro u p did not recommend additional measures for banning alcohol on trains or on football
coaches.

Conclusion
  2.47 A study o f all these reports (and there are num erous reports an a discussion papers by other bodies)
shows th at the following are measures which have been frequently recommended:
      1. Closed Circuit Television
      2. M em bership Cards
      3. Segregation
     4. M o re seating a t football grounds ^
     5. E ncooragem ent of supporters’ clabs
     6. A ban on alcohol
     7. Involvem ent o f the clubs with the com m unity
     8. H eavier penalties.

I too shall argue for these and related measures. It is to be hoped they will be m ore vigorously pursued by
the appropriate bodies than in the past.

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

    3.1 T he terms o f reference o f my Inquiry require me to com m ent upon the working o f the Safety of
 Sports G ro und s Act 1975. The Act was introduced in 1975 to give effect to the recom m endations o f an
 Inquiry into C row d Safety at Sports G rounds. This Inquiry, under the chairm anship of L ord Wheatley,
 was set up in February 1971 following the tragedy a t Ibrox Park in January 1971 when 66 people died as
 a result o f pressure from massive crowd surges on a gangway tow ards the end o f the match.

  3.2 The m ain concern o f the W heatley R eport was, understandably, with crow d safety in the context of
the hazards of uncontrolled crowd m ovem ent, with the measures appropriate for mitigating such risks and
with the provisions o f a regulatory system to ensure that necessary safety measures were taken.

  3.3 The statutory fram ew ork o f the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975, providing for local authority
certification o f designated stadia, follows broadly the pattern outlined in the W heatley Report.

   3.4 M y enquiries into the w orking o f the Act have shown th a t in the designated stadia it has proved
effective in securing im provements in safety. U ntil A ugust 1985, however, the only stadia designated were
those with accom m odation for over 10,000 in Divisions One and Two o f the Football League, the Premier
League in Scotland and certain international football and Rugby League stadia. In A ugust of this year,
following the tragedies at Bradford, Birm ingham and Brussels, designation was extended to Divisions Three
and F o u r o f the Football League and to Divisions O ne and Two o f the Rugby League.

   3.5 The provisions o f the Act have no t been applied to the rem ainder o f stadia and grounds in England
and W ales and Scotland. I find that neither it, n o r the Home Office/Scottish H om e and H ealth D epartm ent
Guide associated with it (the G reen G uide) have been successful in raising the levels of safety at the no n ­
designated grounds. I have the clear impression from my various enquiries that until the tragic events at
Bradford, Birmingham and Brussels, the Green G uide was disregarded by the non-designated clubs. There
has, however, been an upsurge of interest since these events took place an d there have, o f course, been the
fur. aer designations referred to above. These developments do not themselves, in my view, yet assure a
proper standard o f safety for the public at sports stadia and grounds. They do, however, provide a climate
in which, if prom pt action is taken, a proper stan d ard can be set and m aintained. It is to be hoped that
this opp ortunity will not be missed.

   3.6 Li his Report L ord W heatley identified the various problems in the grounds relating to crowd
pressures an d gradients in covered stands as well as the more acute risks th at such factors presented on
the standing terraces. H e also drew attention to the dangers peculiar to stands, such as the risk o f fire,
which norm ally do not arise on open terraces. Lord W heatley went on to say: “ M any of the stands used at
present were built years ago. The materials o f which they are built, their design and the use to which the
accommodation underneath is put, may constitute fire risks. Thus while events in recent times have highlighted
the dangers in the terracing and its exits, the potential dangers in stands are self-evident.”

   3.7 The level of spectator accom m odation currently required before a stadium can be designated is not
an indicator of all the risks identified by Lord W heatley as being present in sports grounds and stadia.
Whilst it is acknowledged that a designated ground will have all safety m atters attended to. there are
present, on many non-designated grounds, stands capable o f accom m odating large num bers o f spectators.
If these grounds do no t qualify for designation, the risks, in particular those associatd with fire, will not
receive the systematic attention that they should.

  3.8 There is, therefore, a need to reconsider the application o f the safety controls at sports grounds. To
ensure the safety o f persons attending it will be necessary to provide a wider m easure of control in future
over sports grounds, sports st"dia and indoor sports arena than currently.

  3.9 There is no wish on my part to add unnecessarily to the burdens which those who organise and
manage the various sporting activities carry. There is, however, a real responsibility to ensure th at those
people who attend sporting events can feel confident th at all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure
their safety in case of emergency.
Future ^ g n a tin n and certification policy of grounds with accommodation of over 10,000
(i) "Sta d ia”!"G rounds" distinction
  3 10 The pow er under Section' 1 of the 1975 Act to designate stadia as requiring safety certificates has
been applied only to the grounds o f the four Divisions o f the Football League in Eng and and Wales, to
the two Divisions of Rugby League, to the Premier League in Scotland, and to a small num ber o f major
international grounds where football is played. Three o f the m ajor grounds where Rugby U nion is played
are also covered, Twickenham, Murrayfield and the N ational Stadium at C ardiff Arms Park.

  3 11 In my Interim R eport, I provisionally recom m ended th at there should be designation o f those
grounds capable of holding over 5,000 sp ectators1 and that indoor sports premises should also be
designated2. I have now had an opportunity o f reconsidering the position on further designation after
hearing extensive evidence on the m atter. I have had to take into account, for example, the financial
position of the smaller clubs and balance that against the general safety o f the public.

  3 12 By Section 1(1) o f the Safety o f Sports G ro und s Act 1975, the Secretary o f State m ay by order
designate as a stadium requiring a safety certificate any sports stadium which, in his opinion, has
accom m odation for more than 10,000 spectators. By Section 17, sports stadium is given a particular
meaning, namely “ a sports ground where the accommodation provided for spectators wholly or substantially
surrounds the area used for activities taking place on the ground.”

    3.13 According to Section 17 o f the Act, sports ground means “ any p'.ace where sports or other competitive
 activities take place in the open air and where accommodation has been provided for specators consisting of
 artificial structures or of natural structures artificially modified for the purpose.”

    3.14 There is, in my view, no logic in m aking a distinction for safety purposes between a sports ground
 and a sports stadium , simply according to w hether the accom m odation surrounds, say, three or two sides
 of the ground. F or instance, a Bradford-type stand is just as dangerous to the occupants in a stadium as
 in a ground. In my view, the limitation on the interpretation of sports stadium, namely that the structure
 has wholly or substantially to surround the area used for activities, is a limitation which should now be
 removed and the Safety of Sports G rounds A ct 1975 should apply to any sports ground as defined in
 Section 17 o f the Act. / recommend that the distinction between sports grounds and sports stadia be abolished.

 (ii) Extension o f designation under Section 1 o f the 1975 Act
    *    15 Given the present structure of the Act. I first have to consider those grounds and stadia with a
 capacity for accom m odation in excess o f 10.000 spectators but which are presently undesignated Should
 they all be desienated? O r should the full procedure under the Safety of Sp-orts G rounds Act 1975 be
 limited to those sports where in addition to a fire hazard there is a general proolem o f crowd control.

     3.16 It has to be recognised that at any sports grounds or stadia there may be three potential hazards— the
  fire risk structural failure and problems o f crowd control. But it does not follow that all grounds with
  accom m odation for over 10.000 spectators have all three problems. There are sports stadia and grounds
  where by reason of the activity and the atm osphere there is no crowd control problem F o r them see no
  purpose in imposing the full certification process under the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975.

     3.17 Lord W heatley, in his R eport, recommended (paragraph 56) that the licensing system should be
  phased as follows:
  Category 1 (a) All International G rounds, ie H am pden Park. N inian Park, Wembley Stadium. Cardiff
              Arms Park, Murrayfield and Twickenham.
                 (b) All English 1st and 2nd Division Football League grounds and all Scottish 1st Division
                 Football League grounds.
  Category 2 (a) All English 3rd and 4th Division Football League grounds and all Scottish 2nd Division
             Football League grounds (unless in Category 1).
                 (b) Rugby League grounds.
  Category 3 G rounds of other Soccer Clubs and Rugby Clubs of either code with a capacity of more than
             10.000 spectators.____________                                                    ...----------

- 3 27 In paragraphs 3.57 to 3.63 o f my Interim R epo rt, I dealt with the position o f the fire authority at
law u n d er the Fire Precautions A ct 1971. Two m atters in the Consultative D ocum ent, which are o f
StiS?        iS v a n ” t o ^ n y considerations, are these. Because o f the adm im s,ra„ve w orkload o f
certification under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, and the failure o f the Act to discriminate between the
                                                                                                                     to
degrees of risk it is suggested in the Consultative D ocum ent th at w hat is needed is a m ore flexible and
discriminating system of fire precautions control under which premises which pose the greatest n sk to the
safety o f occupants in the event o f fire can be identified. Secondly, the system should enable resources to
 be devoted to im proving fire safety in premises which pose unsatisfactory fire nsks, w ithout having
 devote equivalent attention to premises where standards are acceptable.

  3 28 A t present, hotels, boarding houses, factories, offices, shops and railway premises are designated
under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Fire authorities inspect these premises and issue a fire certificate with
which t^e ow ner or occupier m ust comply. Sports grounds and sports stadia as such are n o t currently
designated under the Act.

   3 29 P u t shortly, the proposal in the Consultative D ocum ent is th at the Secretary o f State should have
power to designate premises by class o f use similar to th at contained in the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
Those which are designated would first have to be registered; then an obligation would be imposed upon
the person responsible for the premises to achieve and m aintain reasonable standards of _fire: s a fe ty .F
this purpose he would be provided with advice in the form o f an approved code o f guidance Thus the
p r e s e n c e certification process would be replaced by a system requinng the occupier to comply w ith th e
requirem ents o f the Act by a specified date. The fire authority would have a duty to inspect and re-mspect
after the said date to ensure th at the occupier had in fact complied with the requirements o f the Act.

    3 30 This type o f ap proach to compliance w ith the requirem ents of safety legislation (which for ease of
 reference I call self compliance) has no t received universal approval am ong those to w hom I have talked.
 H o w v e r , for the purpose o f application o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 this approach m ay have
 some significance.

    3 31 The Chief Fire Officers in England and W ales and the Firem asters in Scotland have already carried
 o u t a detailed survey o f a large num ber o f sports grounds and stadia which were no t designated unde
 Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975.

   3 32 The returns .'rom the Chief Fire Officers in England and W ales about the extent of restrictions or
 prohibitions they had imposed on the use o f o u td o o r sporting venues o f all kinds, show that by ^ A u g u s t
 1985 there were restrictions or prohibitions applying in some 106 grounds. In. some cases| ^ tion 10 °f
 Fire Precautions A ct 1971 had been used. In others, Section 77 o f the Building Act 1984 (which 0ives
 district councils certain powers in respect o f dangerous buildings) had evidently been used and no doubt
 Section 10 of the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 h ad also been invoked.

     3 33 A total o f 228 non-designated sports grounds were inspected by Firemasters in Scotland. In August
  1985 it was found th at in a b o u t half o f the grounds the fire precautions arrangements were unsatisfactory.
  A t n o ^ \ t d u b s m the 1st and 2nd Divisions o f the Scottish Football League were the fire precaunons
  found to be satisfactory. Six out o f twenty needed significant work done to improve fire safety levels.

     3 34 H avine reeard to the lack of safety precautions at sports grounds disclosed in evidence to me it
  would in t^ y View he.a mistake to leay&.ttLSPQrts grounds' m ana S?ffleqt th?
  I th e r e f o r e r e c o m m e n d that all sports grounds and sports stadia not designated under the Sajety^ oj Sports
  Grounds A ct 1975 and having a capacity in a stand o f over j 00 should be designated under the Fire Precautions
  A c t 1971 as p r e m i s e s requiring a fire certificate.

    3 35 The thresholds o f 10.000 or o f 500 are bound to be arbitrary and this is no more than an empirical
  approach I have to exercise my judgm ent as best I can. It is an attem pt to balance the expense o f inspection
  against a reasonable degree o f safety. It has to be remembered that the fire authority already have some
  control over non-designated sports grounds by virtue o f Section 10(l)a of the Fire Precautions A ct 197 .
  Similarly, local authorities have some co n trc ’. under Section 10(1) o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Ac
   1975.
    3 36 Some anxiety has been expressed about the additional expense which would be incurred by further
  designation and questions were raised about resource implications. However, the authorities have already
  done the inspections necessary to ascertain the problem s in many o f the grounds and substantially to


                                                              21
remedy them. A lthough further expense and time will be required if there is to be certification o f all sports
grounds with accom m odation for over 500 spectators in a stand, nevertheless some o f the ground work
has already been done. T he speed, and efficiency w ith which the Fire A uthorities have acted in carrying out
the inspections is m uch to be com m ended and should allow for the early im plem entation o f further
designation.

   3.37 I have given consideration to the possibility o f using the provisions o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds
Act 1975 in relation to non-designated sports grounds and sports stadia. As I have said, it may be argued
that it is more appropriate to use, if possible, the 1975 Act and have all sports ground and sports stadia
under one Act rather than to apply the provisions o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971 or in relation to
structural safety, the Building Act 1984 o r the H ealth an d Safety at W ork etc Act 1974.

  3.38 A n additional difficulty may arise if the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is am ended in the near future
as a result of the proposals contained in the Consultative D ocum ent. Then the issue o f a fire certificate
under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 could create an anom alous situation in respect of other sports grounds
or stadia which m ight be inspected after, any changes in the legislation. It would, o f course, be for
consideration, as and when the suggestions in the Consultative D ocum ent are implemented, w hether the
self compliance scheme (as I have called it) would be sufficient to deal with the risk o f fire at a sports
ground o r stadium. I do not com m ent on that. It is not, o f course, possible for me to anticipate when
legislation would be introduced or how the Act m ight emerge after debate. If, however, after debate it
appeared th at the fire certification process could properly be replaced by the self compliance scheme in
relation to sports grounds or stadia, then no d o u b t you would be advised that th at v/as the proper course
to take.

  3.39 However, I have to deal with the position in relation to the non-designated grounds and stadia
now. I have to take account that at grounds o r stadia not designated under the Safety o f Sports G rounds
Act 1975 there may still be stands o f the Bradford type; unless they are subject to adequate statutory
control in the immediate future unacceptable risks may remain. Thus it seems to me that, until the legislation
governing fire precautions has been am ended or consolidated, my recommendation ab out designation under
the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 o f sports grounds and stadia should be implemented.

, 3.40 However, if it were possible under the provisions o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 to
introduce some form o f certification for those grounds and stadia not designated, it would be logical thaT
all sports grounds and stadia should be under the um brella o f th a t Act.

  3.41 By Section 15 o f the 1975 Act, you “ may by order direct th at any of the provisions of this Act which
are not expressed to apply to sports grounds other than sports stadia, shall, subject to such exceptions,
adaptations and modifications as may be specified in the Order, extend to classes of such sports grounds” .
The effect o f th at is th a t you may apply to sports grounds, the provisions o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds
Act 1975. In particular, you may apply those provisions relating to a safety certificate subject to such
exceptions, adaptations and modifications as you may specify in the Order. Thus, so far as non-designated
sports grounds are concerned, it would be possible for you, by Order, to introduce a modified safety
procedure for those grounds relating to structural safety, crowd control and f r s risk. This would have the
advantage o f covering the risks inherent at a sports ground.

  3.42 However, there is a difficulty in that Section 15 may not govern non-designated sports stadia. So
that, if you were to proceed by an O rder under Section 15, it might still leave the problem o f sports stadia
which are not designated, because Section 15 only applies to sports grounds which are not sports stadia.

   3.43 It may, o f course, be possible for the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975 to be so amended so as
to have all sports grounds and stadia under the umbrella o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975. That
would m ake some sense.

   3.44 Additionally, it may be argued th at by am ending Section 1 o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act
1975, all stadia which are presently no t designated (by reason of having accom m odation for fewer than
10,000 spectators) could be subject to a certification process under the Act. However, this certification
process would have to be the full safety certification under the Act. There is no provision for a modified
certification procedure for stadia under the Act as appears possible for sports grounds under Section 1 5 .1
have to consider the immediate problem , until the A ct is amended, if it is. If it is thought th a t in the long
term an am endm ent is the most sensible m ethod o f approach, I have to say however that a designation
order under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 seems the only immediate step which can be taken to deal with
the fire risk now.                                                                          .. -. w ’
    3.45 Thus, while there are alternatives to the recom m endations which I m ade in paragraph 3.34, they
  require am endm ent to Acts o f Parliam ent, and until those am endm ents have been m ade, I am firmly of
  the view th at m y recom m endation-should obtain.

    3.46 M uch the same point may be m ade ab o u t in d o o r sports facilities, as I shall explain below (see
  paragraphs 3.53— 3.59).

  Structural safety of undesignated sports grounds and stadia
     3.47 I return to the question how best to ensure the structural safety o f those grounds and stadia not
  designated under the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975. It might be done by am ending Section 15 o f the
  Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 as I have already indicated. Unless and until th at is done, w hat are the
  alternatives? It appears th at there are three authorities who have the power to deal with breaches of
  structural safety at undesignated sports grounds: the H ealth and Safety Executive (under Section 3 of the
  H ealth and Safety at W o rk etc A ct 1974); a county council (under section 10 o f the Safety o f Sports
  G rounds A ct 1975); and a district council (under Section 77 o f the Building Act 1984).

     3.48 It is also clear that while these authorities have the pow er to enforce provisions of their respective
  Acts, they have no duty to inspect the premises to ascertain w hether there have been any breaches. This
  difficulty was highlighted by the events at Bradford referred to in my Interim Report.
  £•••                                *
    3.49 It is in my view essential th a t one authority, and only one authority, should have the responsibility
  for the structural safety of undesignated sports grounds and stadia. If not, there will not only be a
  duplication o f effort and waste o f resources, but also a risk th at no-one will in fact inspect these grounds
  and stadia.

“ SI 3.50 The necessary inspection m ust depend on the perception of risk, particularly having regard to other
 '.buildings within the jurisdiction o f the particular authority. But a duty to inspect and ensure compliance
  'with reasonable standards o f safety is necessary.
  4»*■
       3.51 The next question is on w hom this duty is to be imposed. The Health and Safety Executive are
   reluctant to intervene where there is already specific legislation (in this case the Safety o f Sports G rounds
   Act 1975). They do not have the resources. N o r m ay they have quite the same expertise such as is readily
   available to a county council.

     3.52 Alternatively, the duty could be imposed on a county council o r district council. This is a m atter
  upon which I do not have the evidence to judge, except to observe only that the county council already
  have a team w ho are expert in structural safety at sports grounds. On the other hand, I note th at many of
  the powers o f the M etropolitan Counties will shortly be transferred to M etropolitan District Councils.
  Additionally, it is suggested in a C onsultative D ocum ent published by the Health and Safety Commission
  - “D raft proposals for revising the H ealth and Safety (Enforcing Authority) Regulations 1977,” that some
  o f the powers o f the H ealth and Safety Executive should be transferred to the district council. In the result,
  this must be a m atter for M inisterial decision but I recommend that one authority m ust be given the
  responsibility fo r securing structural safety at undesignated sports grounds and stadia. The potential conse­
  quences o f long term neglect in this area do not need to be highlighted by me.

  (iv) Indoor facilities in England and Wales
      3.53 In my Interim R eport I was m inded to recom mend that designation should be extended to cover
    indoor facilities in England and W ales.1 A survey has been undertaken by Chief Fire Officers o f 289 such
    premises (in Scotland 26-premises were surveyed) with an overall spectator capacity over 1.000. Most of
    the premises are used for more than one sporting activity, of which the following are some examples:
  : boxing, wrestling, judo, karate, gymnastics, athletics, football, tennis, basketball, netball, volleyball,
  ^ badm inton, hockey, squash, weightlifting, billiards, snooker, darts, table tennis, golf, archery, fencing and
. * bowls as well as water, ice and equestrian sports.

    3.54 In England and Wales over 80% o f the premises are licensed under the Local G overnm ent
    '::::!!an eo u s Provisions) Act 1982 o r equivalent G L C legislation because one or more of the activities
  Acquires licensing. N um bers o f sporting activities within these premises will not, however, be covered by
  their licence against fire risk.

   3.57 These figures reveal that there is a fire risk a t indoor stadia. There is no evidence to suggest that
 there is a crow d problem , n o r th at there is a problem o f structural safety. Accordingly, it seems to me that
 what is necessary for all in doo r sports facilities with accom m odation for more than 500 spectators is a fire

   3.59 Fire precautions at indoor facilities in Scotland are governed by a num ber o f different Acts It is
by no means clear to me that all activities at ind oor stadia in Scotland are presently covered by fire
regulations .A ccordingly I recommend an urgent review o f the existing legislation and i f there is such a gap

Section 10 and prohibition notices

   3.60 As I have indicated, I do not regard the proposals in the Consultative D ocum ent for w hat I call
self compliance as appropriate for premises covered by the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975. There is
 owever, an im portant proposal in the Consultative D ocum ent about prohibition notices which is highly
relevant to the application of the Safety 0f Sporty G rounds Act 1975.                               8 y


                        “ c y IntCrim ACPC^ (paragraph 3-6°)>t0 m ake some observations about the effect
  Section 10 o f the Fire Precautions Act 1971. This section seemed to me to be available only when there
was an immediate risk of a fire taking place. The C onsultative Docum ent deals with this in this way:

      * 2 5 C« CUmS! ! nC!! Wl!er! j “ inSpection revealed the existence of abnormally serious risk it is important
       : l H he.fire. aUt"0r7             P° Wer t0 prohibit or restrict the use of the Premises until the necessary
      remedial action has been taken. So far as England and Wales are concerned the power currently available
      Section llT anT       ^ SeCti° n 10 ° f the 1971 Act has not been who,,y effective. Some of the defects of

        (a) because o f pressure on Magistrates Courts there are sometimes delays in obtaining the hearing of
        applications and some Courts insist on prima facie evidence before granting a summons;
        (b) considerable documentation is involved in cases where there are a number of occupants since they
        must each be summoned;                                                              H              y

        (c) it must be demonstrated that the dangerous condition exists at the time of the court hearing.
        Consequently Section 10 procedures are not easily applied to situations which can be manipulated by
        the occupier to frustrate proceedings. Examples are the storage of inflammable material in exit ways
        and dangerous overcrowding at night;                                                              y

        (d) in the event of failure to comply with the court order the only sanction is to proceed under the

  i 3.62 I m ade a provisional recom m endation a t p arag rap h 3.61 of my Interim R ep o rt th a t Section 10 o f
 the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 should be am ended so th at the fire authority could go to court, n o t w hen
 the risk was so serious, but when the risk was a n ordinary one. I hoped that the pow er would be exercised
 in cases other than those which were regarded as exceptional. Additionally, I was m inded to recom mend
 that there should be pow er u nder Section 10 to apply for an injunction to the H igh C ourt o r for an interdict
 to the C ourt o f Session in Scotland.1

   3.63   The C onsultative D ocum ent (P aragraph 33) recom m ends a simpler m ethod o f approach and one
 which seems to me to be sensible. It says:
        “33 It is therefore proposed that provision should be made for authorised officers of the fire authorities
        to have a power similar to that accorded to Health and Safety inspectors under Section 22 of The H ealth
        and S a fe ty at W ork E tc A c t 1974 to issue a Prohibition Notice. The 1974 Act procedures have the
        advantage o f being simple to operate and, because no court hearing is involved, of achieving the aim of
        restricting the use of premises with the least possible delay. Once issued, a prohibition notice has more
        impact than action under Section 10, and is evidence o f the situation, which if continued or ,repeated,
        could lead to immediate prosecution for failure to comply with the notice. As in the case of improvement
        notices, there would need to be suitable appeal provisions. Like Section 10 of the 1971 Act, the power
        to issue restriction or prohibition orders extend to any premises falling within the general class o f use
        from which a particular use could be designated.”

    js3.64 Accordingly, I recommend that provision be made in the Fire Precautions A ct 1971 fo r authorised
 '• officers o f a fir e authority to have power to issue a prohibition notice.

              A similar difficulty also arises in the application o f Section 10 o f the Safety of Sports G rounds Act
& j l 5. As I explained in my Interim R eport, under the term s o f this provision a court has to be satisfied
 f f f ia t the danger is so great th at immediate action has to be taken. There are thus difficulties for the local
.iflbthorities w ho are responsible for enforcem ent in ensuring th at some safety precaution is taken by a club
  • -where there is no im m ediate risk o f danger. It may be th at the threat o f Section 10 has, and will continue
  J t o persuade clubs to do w hat is needed. However, it is clear that recently some local authorities h iv e been,
^ re q u irin g clubs to carry ou t certain expensive precautions which the club, on professional advice, do not
     themselves regard as either being a problem , or as being an immediate problem. T hus there may be a
     conflict between local authorities and clubs, which m ay have an adverse effect on the safety of sports
     grounds. In my Interim R eport, at paragraph 3.76, I was minded to m ake a recom m endation in relation
     to Section 10 similar to my recom m endation on Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971.2 It seems to
     me, however, that the introduction of the pow er to issue a prohibition notice similar to that proposed in
     the Consultative D ocum ent on the 1971 Act would be a sensible provision an d I recommend that provision
     be made in the Sa fety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 for authorised officers o f the local authority to have power
     to issue a prohibition notice in relation to sports grounds and stadia.

  Revocation o f certificates; reinspections
     3.66 Once a safety certificate under the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 has been issued there is no
  power for the local authority to revoke it. By Section 4(1) “the local authority may, in any case in which it
  appears appropriate to them to do so - (a) amend the safety certificate by notice in writing to its holder; or
  (b) replace a safety certificate.” It would be possible for the local authority, if a club did not comply with
  an instruction, to amend the certificate so th a t the particular area o f the ground would have its numbers
  limited. I do no t believe that this section was intended to act like a prohibition order, though it may have
  that effect. It seems not, however, to have been used in th at w av. In addition to a prohibition notice,
  powers should be given to the local authority to revoke the safety certificate. The ability for a local authority
  to am end a certificate to reduce the capacity, could have the same effect as the power of revocation. But
  this is a device. The right to revoke a certificate should be available to the local authority and a right o f
  appeal should be available to the holder o f a certificate.

  ; 3.67 A nother possibility would be to require that the safety certificate shall be re-issued annually; this
  would have two effects. It would ensure that there is an annual inspection: secondly it would give the local
  authority added pow er if a club were dragging its feet in carrying out some work which is required by the
■ local authority. Some local authorities have complained to me that w ork which they require is often not
  d on e as quickly o r as efficiently as it should be, and th at the effective sanctions are somewhat limited.
  ’Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 3.
  i n t e r i m Report: Provisional Recommendation 4.
      3.68 N o r is there any duty, under the Act, on the local authority to m ake a regular inspection. As a
   m atter o f practice it appears th at some local authorities do m ake regular inspections. Representations have
j been m ade to me th at in order to ensure that the provisions o f the certificate are being carried out there
[. should be a statutory obligation to have an annual re-inspection. I therefore recommend (1) an annual
   renewal o f the certificate (2) a duty on the local authority annually to inspect the premises prior to re-issuing
   the certificate and (3) the power to revoke.

  Composition of local authority team
    3.69 I have been generally impressed with how well the 1975 Act has operated in designated grounds.
 There have been some criticisms by the various members who m ake up the certificating team th at their
 particular expertise has not been given the full recognition th at it should. In any organisation, let alone
 several organisations, some difficulties are inevitable due to the personalities o f those involved. But the
 teams for the m ost p art have worked together well.

    3.70 The fire service have made representations to me about their position in the “ team ” . They rightly
 say th at it is the local authority who issue the certificate. When the local authority receives a copy o f an
 application for a safety certificate, it is to the chief officer o f police and the building authority for the area
 in which it is situated that a copy o f the application is sent. The local authority are obliged to consult them
 about the conditions to be included in the certificate. There is no express requirement that the fire service
 shall be similary consulted. They also point out that on the hearing o f an appeal relative to the term s o f
 the certificate, the local authority can be a party; so too can the chief officer o f police and the building
 authority an d any other person who may be concerned in ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions
 o f the safety certificate. But not the fire service as such. If there is an appeal against a court order made
 under Section 10, under the Safety at Sports G rounds Act 1975, the local authority, the club, the chief
 officer o f police and the building authority may be parties but again not the fire service as such.

   3.71 T he powers o f entry and inspection are given to persons authorised by the local authority, to the
 chief officer o f police and to the building authority. Again the fire service do not have the same power
 unless it is delegated to them by the local authority.

    3.72 T he fire service point out that though fire is one o f the m ajor risks at a sports ground, the fire
 service is not identified as having any particular role in the issue o f the safety certificate or its enforcement.
 (I am dealing now with the position before the abolition o f the M etropolitan Authorities). They complain
 th at even if changes are m ade to permit a local au thority to issue a prohibition notice under the provisions
 o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975, they will be unable to do it on the spot. They suggest that it
 will be necessary for the solicitor to the local authority to be contacted, and that there are times when he
 m ay not be readily available to give the necessary authorisation for the prohibition notice to be issued.

    3.73 I am unconvinced by this argum ent, particularly so since the fire officers produced no evidence to
 me as to any real problem during the years since the introduction o f the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act
 1975. In the event that problems should arise in future because o f the non-availability o f the authorised
 local authority official, the m atter can be speedily remedied by the local authority giving delegated powers
 to the chief fire officer.

    3.74 It was further pointed out when district councils are given the local authorities’ responsibilities in
 the M etropolitan C ounty Council areas in 1986 there m ay be even more difficulties. I hope this is a needless
 anxiety. The elected local authority is, in the end, the body responsible not only under the Act but to local
 people. It would be possible for the local authority to delegate to each discipline the power to issue a
 prohibition notice - that must be a decision of each local authority. At the moment I do no t accept that
 there is any problem in practice.

    3.75 The fact that the Chief Fire Officer is not named as a party to the Act is said, albeit by only a
 m inority am ong fire officers who spoke to me, to give rise to difficulties. It is argued that bccause o f their
 expertise the fire service should be in charge o f issuing the certificate and in enforcing the provisions.

    3.76 It has to be pointed out that the fire service, im portant as it is, is but one arm of the local authority,
 which includes the surveyor’s, architect’s, engineering and building and legal departments o f the local
 authority. The reason that the Chief Officer o f Police gets a special mention, and the Chief Ftre Officer
 does not, is due to the constitutional position of Chief Constables and for no other reason. 1 find it difficult
 to believe that simply because the fire service does not get specific mention in the Act it should not be able

   to work harm oniously with other sections o f the local authority; n o r do I believe th a t if it were mentioned,
   greater harm ony would result. I do n ot believe th at it should be given the leading role in the team.^ The
   certification procedure is essentially a team exercise in which all the disciplines have to be consulted and
 . in which all have an equal p a rt to play. I do not in any way underestim ate the immense value ot the tire
   service but in my view the present system should continuet It would be a very unwise local authority which
   did not obtain and take full account of the views o f the fire service.

     3.77 T he Society o f Chief Building Regulation Officers also subm itted evidence to me that its members
   should be responsible for the operation o f the Act and that they are not, in fact, being consulted, on some
   occasions, as the Act requires.


     3.78 There is no dou bt th at the chief building regulation officers do have a very im portant role to play.
  Their duties include linked statutory controls over existing buildings in relation to the safety o f users. They
  have responsibility for the enforcement o f other legislation controlling safety in buildings which are licensed
  as places o f public entertainm ent or for public exhibitions or certain sporting contests. It is obvious that
  they, individually and collectively, have a large a m o u rt o f expertise relevant to safety at sports grounds.
  They may well have as much expertise, or indeed more, than those who are part o f the team at county
  level. They are physically closer to the actual grounds with which they are dealing.

  •■gjV*■
        3.79 F o r reasons which no d oubt appeared valid a t th^ time they were not, however, given the task of
   • leading the team, when the A ct was passed. F o r my purpose it m atters not w hat the reason was. The fact
        that the present situation has now obtained for ten years and has been working satisfactorily. It is,
..^-ifierefore, quite impossible now to start again, n o r right for me to suggest that the chief building regulation
 - .officer o f a district council should take over this function o f the county council. O f course the district
  .4 council in the m etropolitan areas will, from early 1986, be exercising the powers of the local authorities in
     respect o f this Act previously exercised by county councils.

      3.80 The Society o f Chief Building Regulation Officers has also suggested to me that the consultation,
   imposed upon the local authority under Section 3(3) o f the Safety of Sports G rounds Act 1975 with the
   building authority, has n o t in all circumstances been complied with. One o f the difficulties that has been
   pointed out to me is that because o f the geographical distance between the building authority and the local
   authority, the level o f consultation with the building authority may be less good than with the other
   interested parties. I should be unhappy to think that was so. I have no firm evidence that building authorities
   are not fully consulted: but if it is necessary to emphasise the necessity for consultation, I am happy so to
   do.

   A model safety certificate

      3.81 I have seen a num ber o f safety certificates. They vary enormously as to their detail. It would be
  .useful if the local authorities could draw up a docui.ient which contains the conditions which most generally
   need to be included. They will have to avoid the danger o f their model being treated as containing only
   minimal conditions o r o f a local authority treating the model as o f universal application; each ground has
   different problem s and a flexible approach is necessary. But guidance is needed, and I hope that the
   Association of M etropolitan Authorities, Association of C ounty Councils and the Convention o f Scottish
   Local A uthorities will be able to draw up a suitable model.

   The Green Guide

      3.82 I have been asked to review this docum ent. I have had many representations as to what should go
   into it. It has to be u docum ent which is sufficiently detailed not to be merely a bland exposition o f general
   precautions and at the same time it has to be flexible. Accordingly, I set up a technical working party with
   distinguished members under the chairm anship o f M r K illoran, my Fire Assessor, to examine w hat additions
   or alterations are needed to be made.

     3.83 Their recom m endations, which I accept an d commend to you, are contained in Appendix E, as are
   their names. I am grateful to them for giving up so much o f their valuable time and for the speed and
   expertise which they brought to the task. I add below my own comments and emphasis on one or two
   im portant m atters connected with the Green Guide.
(i) S ta tu s   of the Green Guide
   3.84 I am satisfied th a t the G uide should continue to be voluntary an d no t form a statutory code: but it
is im p o rta n t th a t all those concerned with sports grounds should read and understand the contents, and
apply the lessons relevant to their own sports grounds.

    3.85 A num ber o f officials o f sports grounds I have visited have pointed ou t th at the G reen Guide has
in some cases little relevance to their particular sport. F o r instance, questions o f a perim eter fence at a dog
o r horse race are largely irrelevant. The G uide needs to be applied in a common-sense way.

(ii) The Use o f Timber in Stands
   3.86 In my Interim R eport, paragraph 3.132, I said I would like totally to prohibit perm anent wooden
stands, including those m ade from combustible material. I recommended that the building o f new perm anent
stands o f combustible m aterial should be prohibited as a general ru le1 and I pointed o u t th a t treatment
with fire retardant m aterials may n o t be effective. T h a t recom m endation was m ade on the advice of the
fire authorities to w hom I had then spoken. I had n o t then consulted the tim ber trades. N o t unnaturally,
such a recom m endation caused a certain degree o f consternation in the tim ber trades, and representations
have been m ade to me that this sweeping recom m endation should be reconsidered. In particular my
recom m endation was taken to m ean th a t no w ood should be used in new stands.

   3.87 I have now had the op portunity to have a full discussion with the trade. I had, and have, no
intention o f banning all combustible m aterials from a stand. I was, however, anxious to reduce the fire risk
as far as possible an d it seemed evident that, the less combustible m aterial in a stand, the less the fire
hazard.

  3.88 It was urged on me that if p roper exits were provided then the danger from combusitible cladding
could be ignored. I believe it is im portant to deal w ith the risk o f an outbreak o f fire occurring by the
provision o f proper structural fire precautions, as well as providing an adequate num ber o f exits for use in
an emergency.

   3.89 O n 11 N ovem ber 1985 new Building Regulations came into force which covered, inter alia, stands
at sports grounds. It was suggested th at if a new stand were to be built in accordance with the Regulations,
there could be no criticism.

   3.90 U nhappily, I have been advised that under the guidance issued in support o f the new Building
Regulations it would be possible, in certain circumstances, legally to build a Bradford-type stand. The
D epartm ent o f the Environm ent recognise the problem and are to give urgent consideration to altering the
guidance on how to comply with the requirements. I recommend that they do so without delay.

   3.91 W hat then is to be done in the meanwhile? It is obviously possible to build a stand in combustible
material which, because o f its construction, will have a fire retarding effect, thus providing sufficient length
o f time to allow spectators to escape. H aving regard to the general level o f safety at sports grounds which
has been revealed since the Bradford fire I am not optimistic that anything more than minimum standards
will be adopted by some clubs because o f financial problems.

   3.92 I am anxious, therefore, abou t the possibility that some new single-storey stands lacking adequate
structural fire precautions might be built prior to any necessary am endm ents to the Building Regulations
G uidance Codes. W hen they have been so revised conforming with them should be sufficient. Until then, I
have to say that construction of a new stand with inadequate structural fire precautions constitutes a fire
risk to which m embers o f the public should not be exposed.

(iii) Artificial Pitches

   3.93 Some concern has been expressed to me, in the light o f greater use o f artificial pitches, that there
may be, in the circumstances of a fire such as occurred at Bradford, danger to the public from toxic fumes
if the artificial pitch is exposed to too great a heat. I have not sufficient evidence upon which to pass any
judgem ent. It is, however, a m atter, which those who are concerned, namely the fire and football authorities,
need to examine in close co-operation, to see whether there is, in fact, a problem, and if so to devise means
by which such problem can be avoided. T he Sports Council, I understand, have set up a W orking Party
1Interim Report: Recommendation 13.


                                                        28
with the assistance o f the Fire Research Station to investigate the problem and hope to be able to report
in 1986.

(iv) Temporary Stands and M arquees
  3.94 In England and Wales and in Scotland there appears to be no general legislation governing the use
of tem porary stands and m arquees if they are only in existence for less than 28 days. Fears have been
expressed to me th at the increasing use o f these stands at golf matches and elsewhere gives some cause for
concern, both from the safety of the structure in the case o f stands and the fire hazard in the case of
marquees and stands.

   3.95 H ospitality tents which involve cooking facilities are now com m onplace at sports grounds. Control
of their use needs, in my view, to be considerably stricter. Fire authorities to whom I have spoken are
concerned that, even when they are notified, it is sometimes not possible to be sure th at a tem porary stand
is safe because it may be erected in the m orning for use in the afternoon. It is not then possible for them
physically to check their condition before the public are adm itted.

   3.96 I therefore repeat the Recom m endation in my Interim R eport th at consideration should be urgently
given to how best the question o f tem porary stands and m arquees can be dealth w ith;1 at present they
undoubtedly constitute a risk to the public. I un derstand that there are plans for you to publish national
guidance for fire precautions in places o f public entertainm ent including tem porary structures and marquees,
I hope th at this can be done quickly.

Variety of legislation
   3.97 It has already been noted that there is a variety o f laws governing sports grounds an d indoor sports
facilities and therefore there are different bodies with legal responsibilities. This is not likely to lead to
efficiency of enforcement. One anom aly appeared during the course o f my Inquiry. If W embley arena is
used for boxing it needs to be licensed because it is “ entertainm ent” under the L ondon Governm ent Act
1963 but the same stadium used for the “ H orse of the Y ear Show” does not. The result is th at tw o quite
different standards o f safety can be applied to the events in the same building.

  3 *?8 It is not possible always to eliminate anom alies in legislation which have grown up through a
piecemeal approach to a particular problem . The anomalies apply to both outdoor and indoor sports
grounds and stadia. In the long term they need consideration by the appropriate Governm ent departments.




'Interim Report: Recommendation 18,
                                                CH A PTER 4

                                   ’            Crowd control

Who is to deal with the problem?
  4.1 Everyone is agreed th at there is no single answer to the problem o f hooliganism at football grounds;
there are, however, a num ber o f steps which can be taken by various bodies interested in football which
together m ay result in better control o f the problem.

   4.2 Thus Parliam ent needs to ensure th a t the police have the necessary powers. The police need to ensure
th at they identify and apprehend the law breaker and provide the proper evidence to secure a conviction.
Courts need to pass the appropriate sentences and w ithout undue delay. Clubs need to ensure th at their
grounds are physically safe, with reasonable facilities an d staff properly trained to control those who are
invited into the grounds and to deal with any emergency. They should involve themselves in community
affairs. M anagers need to ensure their players, by their behaviour on the field, do not incite the spectators.
Parents to o are involved. They have a general responsibility for where their children go and w hat they do.

  4.3 The genuine law-abiding supporters, who are the vast majority, have an interest in ensuring the
peaceful result of a football game by helping to su pport those enforcing law and order. The football
authorities need to take a positive ap proach to football problems.

  4.4 Persons in authority cannot stop violence by condem ning it: but one thing is certain, th at failure to
condemn violence undoubtedly encourages it. Those w ho hold responsible positions, who encourage others
to commit violence by failing to condem n or worse by praising violence, have much to answer for.

  4.5 There is no typical football club. Am ong the league clubs in England, W ales and Scotland there are
wide differences in quality o f m anagem ent and in attitudes. They range from the very good to the indifferent.

   4.6 Every club has different problems. Each problem may need a different approach. Some clubs are
virtually trouble-free, bo th in relation to their own supporters and supporters from other clubs. Some clubs
may be trouble-free when they play at hom e b u t their supporters m ay cause trouble elsewhere. Some, a
very small minority, have troublesom e supporters generally. N o one m ethod to com bat hooliganism will
be successful on its own. W h at is needed is a recognition by all concerned, and particularly by football
clubs and the football authorities, th at nothing less than a determined and imaginative attack on the
problem will save football.

   4.7 While football is the national game and enjoyed by millions, it has no natural entitlement to survival.
It is but one form o f entertainm ent in a highly competitive world o f entertainm ent. The public are voting
with their feet. Gates in the English League were dow n from 28 million ten years ago to 17 million last
year. This year, except in the Fourth Division, figures are again down. Those clubs who are currently at
the top o f the League do no t need rem inding o f other great names who once wr^e regarded as the “ greatest”
and who now languish in lower Divisions with large grounds, small crowds, large debts and faded memories.

   4.8 W ith 92 League clubs in England and Wales, it is not surprising th at agreement on almost any
proposal for action is difficult to reach, or th at the football authorities are regarded by some clubs as quite
ineffective. I do n o t see my role as laying down a blueprint for the survival o f football. I am concerned
with safety only. But if football falters then safety will suffer. Like others before me I can only point a
way. I can guarantee no success. But one thing is clear— those clubs which are unimaginative, weakly led
or determined to live in the past will certainly go the way of the D odo and the Brontosaurus.

4.9 Finally, it may be o f interest to note the attitude of some football clubs in England and Wales. After
the fire at Bradford and the riot at Birmingham a general invitation was issued by me to all those interested
in football to give me the benefit of their advice. This m any did, and I was able to write my Interim Report
with the advantage o f their views. I was also able to visit a num ber o f clubs myself and I had useful
discussions with them.

   4.10    In the Interim R eport I again invited those interested in the very difficult problems in football to
let me have their views. To m ake sure th a t I did, indeed, have the considered views o f those m ost closely
affected by the problems and m ost experienced in the game, I wrote a personal letter in the following terms
to all 92 football clubs in the English League:

hooliganism.

legal responsibility resting u pon the police) It can n o t be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club,
o r the occupier o f the ground w ho is putting on the function, th a t the prim ary an d continuing obligatioe
rests.

    (i) Stewards and Policing
      4.20 A n um ber o f clubs have been impressed by the presence o f stewards from visiting clubs who look
    after their own supporters. This is a practice which has m uch to com m end it. One witness reported that at
    O stend a serious confrontation between the Belgian police an d Liverpool supporters was defused by the
    presence o f Liverpool stewards.

      4.21 In some police forces it has been possible for one or two officers to travel with fans when they go
    aw ay and thus assist the “ hom e police” in identifying trouble-m akers. In other cases hom e stewards have
    been able, a t aw ay matches, to stand a t the home turnstile and ensure th a t their own supporters do not
    infiltrate the opposition terraces.

    4.22 A num ber o f clubs have show n m e the handbooks which have been issued to their stewards. I have
 seen also cards issued to police officers with instructions as to their duties in the ground. The handbook
 for Bristol Rovers, for instance, was written pu rsu an t to the conditions o f their Safety Certificate and was
 approved bv the police. It is a thoroughly comprehensive and sensible docum ent dealing both with general
 m atters o f stew arding and with the question o f evacuation in the event o f an emergency. It is to be hoped
.th at all other clubs will have done the same

       4.23 In m y Interim R eport I recom m ended th at the G reen G uide should be am ended to read: “All exit

(      gates should be manned at all times while the ground is used by the public and be capable of being opened
       immediately from inside by anyone in an emergency.” 1 Leicester City Football Club have a system o f exit
    do o rs w orked o n a m agnet system which are autom atically controlled from a central office. Ipswich have
    a similar sort o f system. U nderstandably there is concern th a t if my Recom m endation were applied to
    them they w ould be required to have a stew ard at each gate an d th at this would vitiate the whole scheme.
    It w as not my intention that this Recom m endation should apply to exits which are autom atically controlled,
    if these types o f mechanisms are acceptable to the responsible local authorities.

    (ii) Powers o f Search
       4.24 In my Interim R eport I saia th at I was m inded to recommend that, in England and Wales, the
    police be given the unfettered right o f search before entry into football grounds, by sta tu te .2 I there set
    o u t the problem s relating to police pow ers of search which are contained in the Police and Criminal
    Evidence Act 1984 which comes into effect on 1 January 1986.

   4.25 The disquiet arose because, by Section 1(3) o f the Act, a constable only has power to search a
 person or a vehicle, or anything in or on a vehicle, i f he has reasonable grounds fo r suspecting that he will
fin d stolen or prohibited articles. A prohibited article includes an offensive weapon.

       4.26 The passage of the Bill through Parliam ent gave rise to considerable controversy ab out the extent
    a n d nature o f police powers. On the one h and there were those who expressed disquiet ab out what were
    called colloquially the “ sus laws” and those who wanted to give the police a more effective weapon against
    crime. It is no t p a rt of my function to com m ent on the argum ents nor on the result. N o r do I wish to
    m ake any observation ab o u t the Act, save in relation to sports grounds (and particularly football grounds)
    w ith which I am concerned. The wider im plications are n o t for me to consider.

       4.27 Football grounds are in their way unique in that they are a regular place for very large num bers of
    people to meet. Some o f those who attend football do so intending to cause trouble. Every Saturday, for
    ab o u t three-quarters o f the year, about h a lf a million people go to football matches. Thus football is
    different in kind, nature and purpose from any other activity o f the community.

       4.28 The “ reasonable ground for suspicion” safeguard in the Act, which is there for the general protection
    o f citizens as they go a bou t their ordinary business, needs to ue reconsidered in the light o f what actually
    happens at football grounds.

       4.29 The effect of the “ reasonable ground for suspicion” clause is th at anyone can go into a football
    g roun d carrying a weapon w ithout fear o f detection or search by simply carrying it in his pocket. There is
    'Interim Report: Recommendation 11.
    2 Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 1.
nothing thereby to give a constable reasonable ground for suspecting that he will find an offensive weapon.
N o one wishes to see a situation in which it is possible for a large num ber of people to be at a football
ground in possession o f offensive weapons. If there is, as I believe there is, a determ ination by all responsible
mem bers o f the public to seek ways to remove violence at football grounds, any measures which assist in
th at task need to be considered.

   4.30 The difficulty which arises at present is this: 5,000 fans seek to enter a football ground. Experience
shows th at some will be carrying an offensive w eapon. A police officer has no special m ethod of detecting
which o f those 5,000 is carrying an offensive w eapon. H e m ay reasonably suspect th at some, or many, will
be doing so. He can not individually identify those persons. Thus he is not empowered by the Act to search
th a t person, either before or after entry.

   4.31 I have observed police searching visiting fans on a num ber of occasions. They were light-hearted
affairs to which no one appeared to take objection. They were speedily done. N o one was asked for their
consent. It has been put to me th at if there is a general search there is less likely to be trouble than if a
single person is picked out and w ants to know why he has been individually selected.

  4.32 W hat then is to be done? I believe a football ground should be treated as a special case. So far as
searching people entering the ground is concerned, it has been suggested th at it can be m ade a condition
of entry that they agree to be searched. Thus, it is said th at anyone who is inside the ground is deemed to
consent. Therefore the search by a police officer is no t a search under the provisions o f the Police an d
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 but is contractually agreed to by reason o f an arrangem ent m ade between the
football club and the spectator. This is an arrangem ent which can be properly m ade. It takes it outside the
Police an d Criminal Evidence A ct 1984. O f course it only applies after the spectator enters the ground,
because the contract is m ade as he enters the ground. But at m any grounds there are physical problems
ab o u t searching within the ground. Thus that solution is not really a practical one.

   4.33 W hat then ab o u t searching a spectator before he enters the ground? It is suggested that the limitations
of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 d o not apply if a policeman says, in effect, to a spectator:
“ I propose to search you” . If the spectator says nothing, o r agrees, then because it is a voluntary search
the policeman need no t have reasonable grounds for suspicion under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984. If the spectator does object, then the police officer says to him: “ I cannot therefore search you, but
you will not be allowed into the ground” . H e then will go and report that fact to fhe operator of the
turnstile, who will decline to adm it the spectator.

  4.34 This allows a police officer to search by a m ethod outside the provisions o f the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984.

  4.35 Unless a search is m ade lawfully by agreem ent or under the provisions of the Polic; and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984 it constitutes an assault. But if a spectator agrees to be searched, a police officer is not
guilty o f an assault. There are, however, a num ber of problems. Firstly, the police, on the occasions I have
witnessed, invariably search w ithout any sort o f discussion. Is silence by the specta'or consent? If the
consent is obtained by the threat of refusal o f entry, is it consent? A nd finally, at w hat age can consent be
given by a spectator? If it is not until 16 or 18 years o f age then the proposed system is of little value.

   4.36 It is not my task to give a definitive ruling on these matters; bu t the disquiet which has been
expressed by the police leads me to suggest th at if the present practice of searching those who enter a
football ground is to be allowed to continue, it should be carried on in circumstances where the practice is
clearly legally based.

   4.37 It has, I think, to be recognised that a football m atch is an occasion outside the ordinary run o f
norm al activity o f the community. Accordingly, there is no reason why there should n ot be specific
provisions relating to activities at football matches. This is the case with the Sporting Events (Control of
Alcohol etc) Act 1985. It has been recognised to be wrong to give the police a general power of search in
all circumstances. But I am absolutely satisfied th a t the control o f hooliganism at a football ground could
be seriously ham pered by the inability of the police lawfully to search at random those entering the ground.

   4.38 I recommend, therefore, that in England and Wales the unfettered right to search those who are either
entering or trying to enter a foo tba ll ground should be conferred by statute. In Scotland there are divided
views. Consideration should be given as to w hether this Recom m endation should be extended to Scotland.
The Scottish police do n o t as a m atter o f practice search before entry as the police in E ngland and W ales
do. It may be th at because o f their “ breach o f the peace” offence (see Paragraphs 4.68-4.70 below) they
have found that fans dum p weapons and other undesirable items, including alcohol, outside the stadium
before they enter w ithout the necessity for searching. There is no dou bt that the knowledge th at there is
to be a search has proved to be a deterrent to bringing into the ground these undesirable items.

  4.39 A similar problem arises out of the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985. T hat Act
was designed, am ong other things, to prevent those entering sports grounds from taking alcohol in with
them. By Section 7(2) “ a constable may search a person he has reasonable grounds to suspect is committing
or has com m itted an offence under this Act and may arrest such a person.” While the police officer obviously
has reasonable suspicion for looking inside a bag which plainly contains bottles, or bears the nam e o f some
well known superm arket, those whose ingenuity is greater will not be subject to suspicion if they bring a
bottle or cans in an inside pocket o f a heavy overcoat. T hus the clear intention of Parliam ent is flouted.

  4.40 An additional problem has been draw n to my attention in relation to the searching o f vehicles on
suspicion o f carrying alcohol. By Section 7(3) the police have pow er to search vehicles being used for the
principal purpose o f carrying passengers for the whole or p a rt o f a journey to o r from a designated sporting
event on reasonable suspicion. The Act, however, does not cover all vehicles but only public service vehicles
or railway passenger vehicles.

  4.41 The problem o f control, which has arisen, is th a t a large num ber o f trouble-m akers now no longer
go by public transport. They do not wish to be organised or disciplined, and choose to go in their own or
hired vehicles. Minibuses are favoured but they are by no means the only type of vehicle used. In some
cases, the trouble-m akers carry with them a large quantity o f drink which they consume before they get to
the ground. They m ay even intend to smuggle drink into the ground. There is presently no power to search
such vehicles for alcohol, w hether or not there is reasonable suspicion. The right to search these vehicles
gives rise to a num ber o f very difficult questions, but you should be aw are of the problem.

(iii) Offences
  4.42 There is general agreem ent am ong the police officers to w hom I have spoken th at their powers to
deal with the m ore serious specific criminal offences are adequate. These include assault, wounding, actual
bodily harm , assault on the police, obstructing the police, criminal damage and possessing offensive
weapons. In addition, the Law Commission has recently m ade a num ber o f recom m endations abou t offences
relating to public order (Law Commission 123) which ap p ear in your Review o f Public O rder Law (Cmnd
9510)."

   4.43 The recom m endations o f the Law Com m ission do not, however, deal specifically with other
unacceptable forms of behaviour at sports grounds which have come to my notice, namely the throwing
of missiles, running onto the pitch and obscene and racialist chanting. They are less serious in the sense
 ^hat throw ing a missile is not as im portant as an offence o f riot. On the other hand, it is quite obvious that
throw ing a missile at a football m atch often triggers disorder. It is the inability to prevent or check that
trigger which leads to greater disorder. Just as a bucket of w ater might extinguish a fire, if detected in time,
so the ability to deal with the first sign of trouble on the terraces is likely to have a beneficial effect. It is
no com fort to be able eventually to punish those who engage in a full-scale riot, if the riot could be
prevented at a much earlier stage, by stopping those guilty o f missile throwing o r other disorderly conduct
ju st as soon as they begin. Should they be specific offences or can they be dealt with by an offence of breach
o f the peace or disorderly conduct?

   4.44 It is acknowledged th at the m ood o f a football crowd can be very volatile because o f the nature of
the game, the excitement the game engenders and the behaviour o f the spectators. The margin between
o rd e r and disorder at a football m atch is very narrow and it does not require very much to turn an exciting
but peaceful afternoon into a scene of grave disorder. The balance is a fine one and can be upset by what
w ould be regarded elsewhere as a trivial incident. Thus disorderly conduct which would pass as unremarkable
in everyday life takes on a new significance in the context of a football match.

(a) Throwing o f M issih s and Running on to the Pitch
   4.45 The first question to be asked is whether either should be an offence at all. Nearly everyone is agreed
th a t throwing a missile at a football ground should constitute an offence. So far as running onto the pitch
is concerned there are divided views.. Those who are against it say, quite rightly, th at a properly organised
stadium will have perimeter fences which will prevent people from running onto the pitch; therefore those
w ho run onto the pitch may only do so because they w ant to escape from danger on the terraces. They
may also run onto the pitch at the end o f play in excitement, but do no harm to anybody. If there is a
specific offence and it is no t enforced, this brings the law into disrepute. Indeed, it may be very difficult to
enforce if a substantial num ber o f people run o n to the pitch. There is also the difficulty o f drafting an
offence so as to exclude the person who legitimately comes onto the pitch.

   4.46 The contrary argum ent is that if there is an offence o f running onto the pitch people will not do it.
In Scotland, where the breach o f the peace offence seems to me to be effective, large football grounds do
not have pitch perim eter fences as a general rule. The fact that it m ay be difficult to arrest all those who
come onto the pitch does not mean th at those w ho do and can be arrested should not be arrested. Those
who come onto the pitch for a proper reason are unlikely to be arrested. The offence canvassed would give
the police power immediately to deal with an offence and thus prevent more serious trouble. Sometimes
running on the pitch is done specifically to stop the game, sometimes to m ake a protest, sometimes to
exchange pleasantries with the referee or um pire o r to congratulate a player on scoring a hundred runs. In
all cases it is likely to lead to further disorder.

  4.47 I am clearly o f the view that running onto the pitch w ithout good reason and missile throwing
should constitute offences. The police should have the power to arrest such offenders. It is often the start
of disorder. It should be stopped at the earliest possible moment. I shall need to consider whether these
should be specific offences or can be dealt with by an offence o f disorderly conduct or breach of the peace.

(b) Chanting Obscene or Racialist Abuse at a Sports Ground
   4.48 O ne o f the Provisional Recom m endations in my Interim R eport was th at consideration should be
given to creating a specific offence o f chanting obscene or racialist abuse at a sports g ro u n d .1 Nearly
everyone who has given oral evidence or subm itted written evidence is equally of the view that this is a
very disagreeable feature o f crowd behaviour a t some football matches and indeed at other sports grounds.
I can support that view from my own observations on the terraces. The terraces are certainly no place for
the prudish o r fainthearted. There are, however, divided views as to the practicability or otherwise o f
enforcing this as an offence.

  4.49 T he contrary view is that if a very large crow d chooses to make disagreeable observations ab out a
player such an offence would be difficult for the police to enforce. If it is not enforced the law is brought
into disrepute. It upsets those against whom tue chants are aimed if it is an offence which is no t enforced.
There is the further view that bad language has always been p art of the football scene. It is a m an’s game
and thus language which would be objectionable in more polite society is the norm on the football terraces.
Finally, it is said th at it really is not possible to legislate for every disagreeable piece of behaviour.

   4.50 Those who favour some legislation, point o u t that a lot of people who attend sports grounds have
what would be a pleasant and agreeable afternoon totally ruined by constant foul language from those
around them. But while it may not always be possible to detect all those who behave in this way, if it is
occurring, a police officer should have the power to stop it. The very fact that there is legislation may of
itself persuade people to refrain from indulging in action which may not only upset other spectators but
may also encourage potential hooligans to act in a disorderly way.

   4.51 There are, o f course, immense difficulties in drafting suitable legislation. Booing a player because
of the colour o f his skin is disagreeable and distressing; however, it would be quite impossible to make it a
criminal offence to boo the referee, or a player on the opposing side simply because he was on the opposing
side. T hat is not to say that it is a habit which contributes anything to the well-being o f the game, any
more than the booing of the opposition’s national anthem at an international match or the kicker of a
penalty at a rugby union match. However, it is not possible always to legislate for bad manners. Additionally,
there is the very real difficulty o f enforcement.

  4.52 The fact that there is some legislation governing foul language and racialist abuse at football matches
may have the effect o f reducing the incidence and effect of it. On balance I believe that consideration should
be given to drafting some appropriate legislation in order to prevent it, either as a specific offence or
included in the offences of disorderly conduct or breach of the peace.

  4.53 I note that a num ber o f clubs have as part of their ground regulations provision             for precisely this
type of offence. F or instance, Bristol Rovers’ Football Club Regulations read:
'Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 8


                                                       35
        “The Club reserves the right to prosecute or to eject or cause to be ejected any person who within the
        Club premises is considered by the Club, its employees or agents (hereinafter called ‘the Club’) to their
        absolute discretion to be or have been behaving in any o f the following ways;
            (i) entering upon the field of play during the course o f a game
           (ii) using obscene language or swearing
          (iii) making vulgar gestures
          (iv) using terms o f racial abuse
           (v) taunting opposing team supporters
          (vi) entering areas o f the terraces designed for use by opposing team supporters.

       I i eAD*cb may’     kS absolute discretion, bar from entry to the Ground, for any period up to FIVE
       . .      ’ anJ Penion prosecuted or ejected in accordance with this Regulation and may take such steps
       including informing the parents or guardians o f the person concerned, necessary or desirable for tiie
       implementation of this bar.”


                              Wh‘Ch ansesj s whether the Present legislation or am endm ents to the legislation
  proposed by the Law Commission or by the Review o f Public O rder Law are sufficient to cover either of
  ih n ^ T n            °kTen^el    fis s ile throw ing, ™ nning onto the pitch or chanting obscene o r racialist
  fh        u cl       u £ 0 r l erJAct was enacted. It was introduced following the public disorders involving
  the Black Shirts in the East End of London. Section 5 o f the Act reads as follows: “ Any person who in any
  public place .   uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of
    e peace or whereby a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned; shall be guilty of an offence.” Thus it
 js not enough to use threatening abusive or insulting words o r behaviour— an intent to cause a breach of
 the peace or the likelihood o f a breach o f the peace occurring has to be proved.

     4.55    So far as missile throwing is concerned, if it can be proved that a missile hit somebody, then the
 offence of assault is committed. But throwing a missile in a football ground is conduct which ought to be
 stopped. It is the trigger for disorder. It is difficult to think o f a legitimate reason for throwing a missile at
 a sports ground. It is often impossible to show where the missile landed, particularly when some o f the
 missiles which are commonly used are coins o f the realm. Section 5 is often inapplicable because it may
 n o t be possible to show that the behaviour was intended to provoke a breach of the peace. It is even more
 difficult to show th at a breach o f the peace is likely to be occasioned when it may be impossible to
 dem onstrate where a missile fell. The offence o f possessing an offensive weapon may not cover this problem.

• 4 -5,6, Likew*fe- runnin i onto the pitch o r chanting obscene or racialist abuse at a sports ground o f itself
is unlikely to be covered by the provisions o f Section 5. The Law Commission points out th at Section 5
m ay not cover intim idatory conduct if the victim is, for example, a policeman or an old lady because they
are not likely to be provoked into violence by the defendant’s behaviour.

    4.57     The limit o f Section 5 is further shown by the case o f Cozens against Brutus 1973 A C 854: during
an international tennis m atch the appellant went onto the court and disrupted the game. He was charged
Un! r « I eCl.IOn 1 U was held that his c°n d u c t did not come within the terms o f the Section. Lord Reed
sai      Parliament had to solve the difficult question o f how far freedom of speech or behaviour must be limited
in the general public interest. It would be going much too far to prohibit all speech or conduct likely to occasion
a breach o f the peace because determined opponents may not shrink from at least threatening a breach o f the
peace in order to silence a speaker whose views they detest. Therefore vigorous and it mav be distasteful or
unmannerly speech or behaviour is permitted so long as it does not go bevond any one of the three limits It
must not be threatening, it must not be abusive, it must not be insulting. I see no reason whv any o f these
should be construed as having a specially wide or specially narrow meaning. They are all limits easily
recognisable by the ordinary man. Free speech is not impaired by ruling them out. Before a man can be
convicted it must be cieariy shown that one or more o f them have been disregarded.”

   4   58 It is also clear that on occasions magistrates have taken the view that, having regard to the
background o f the Public O rder Act, Section 5 is inappropriate for m inor acts of hooliganism. In your
Review of Public O rder Law, at paragraph 3.24, there appears: “The police have sometimes been reluctant
to use section 5 o f the 1936 Act to deal with minor acts of hooliganism. Thev do not wish to over-react to
such incidents by charging too serious an offence with a disproportionately high maximum penalty and the
courts have on occasion deprecated the use of section 5 in cases where it was doubtful whether the conduct in
question amounted to “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour”. ”


                                                       36
   4.59 Accordingly, your Review o f Public O rder Law proposes an am endm ent to Section 5 o f the Public
O rder A ct 1936 so that it reads: “Any person who whether in a pubUc or private place, uses threatening,
abusive or insulting words or behaviour which is intended or likely— (a) to cause another person to fear
unlawful violence or (b) to provoke the use of unlawful violence by another shall be guilty of an offence.”
(paragraph 3.7).

   4.60 This revised offence clearly will no t cover running onto the pitch nor chanting obscene or racialist
abuse. It was, however, hoped that it would cover missile throwing. Y our Review says, at paragraph 3.12:
‘•‘Missile throwing: Under the Law Commission’s proposals, unlawful violence will include violent conduct
towards property as well as towards persons, and will not be restricted to conduct causing or intending to
cause injury or damage” . . . In one respect the Law Com m ission s definition o f unlawful violence m ay prove
particularly useful: the police have suggested th at at football matches and on similar occasions, it can
 sometimes be difficult to find app ropriate offences with which to charge those picking up and throwing
missiles in circumstances where the injury or dam age caused by particular missiles cannot be identified.
The Law Com m ission gives as an example o f unlawful violence: “throwing at or towards a person a missile
 of a kind capable of causing injury which does not hit or fall short” .

  4.61 This, says the Review, should remove evidential difficulties related to intent or recklessness; and in
cases o f group violence the police should be able to charge missile throwers with violent disorder, thus
exposing them to a m axim um penalty on indictm ent o f five years imprisonment.

  4.62 This proposed am endm ent in my view m ay still leave a gap in the legislation. Somebody who throws
a missile m ay no t intend to cause an o th er person to fear unlawful violence; he may be seen simply to be
throwing a missile and it m ay not be possible to say where it went or w hat it was aimed at. It will often
not be possible to show that it is likely to cause another person to fear unlawful violence because i t is not
known where it lands. It m ay also require the evidence of another person to say that he feared unlawful
violence. It seems to me that there is very real difficulty in applying Section 5 of the Public O rder Act 1936,
even as am ended, to a missile throw er at a football ground where the evidence is merely o f a fan throwing
something.

   4.63 If, as I believe, there is a gap in the legislation and missile throwing, running onto the pitch and
 chanting obscene or racialist abuse at sports grounds are no t covered by the present or by the proposed
 leg'slation. w hat then is to be done?

    4.64 The Review of Public O rder Law, paragraph 3.25, recognizes the problem of dealing with those
 who create a disturbance. It reads as follows: “ Even if it amounts to threatening, abusive or insulting
 behaviour, disorderly conduct of this sort may not be caught by section 5 at present because it may not be
 intended or likely to occasion a breach of the peace; or when the section is amended, because it may not be
 likely tc cause fear of violence to people or property. This may be because the fear engendered is not directed
 to any specific result likely to follow from the conduct but instead consists of a more general state of anxiety
 or alarm. Alternatively the apprehension may be directed at a consequence of this behaviour, such as a
 stav .pede by a crowd or an accident being caused by the articles used to blockade an entrance, which is not in
 itself unlawful violence. But behaviour of this kind does constitute a real nuisance to the public which would
 seem to justify invoking the protection of the criminal law.” In order to deal with it the Review suggests a
 new offence. At paragraph 3.26 it says: “The main elements of a new offence intended to cover disorderly
 conduct which falls outside the scope of section 5 as amended might be as follows: (a) threatening, abusive,
  insulting or disorderly words or behaviour in or within view of a public place; (b) which causes substantial
  alarm, harassment or distress.

   4.65 The addition o f the clause “which causes substantial alarm, harassment or distress” has apparently
 been inserted in order to provide a safeguard so th at merely to be annoyed or disturbed will not suffice.
 The legislation is designed, according to the Review, to protect the weak and vulnerable, and therefore the
 proposed definition requires evidence th at the victim suffered substantial alarm, harassment, or distress.

  *>.. 4.66 N o one would w ant to criticise th at as a proposal covering the sort o f behaviour which your Review
   had in mind; namely groups of youths persistently shouting abuse and obscenities, or pestering people
   waiting to catch public transport, or to enter a hall or cinema, or rowdy behaviour in the streets late at
;■ night which alarm s local residents.

'•M 4.67 U nfortunately it is insufficient for the unacceptable behaviour with which I am concerned at football
s matches. Somebody running onto the pitch does not substantially alarm, harass or distress anyone, but it
   often the, trigger for disorder. Som ebody throw ing a missile o r chanting obscenities does not necessarily
   u se substantial a ia n n ,h a ra ssn ic h t or distress. Spectators on occasions start shaking a perim eter fence in
 concert as a prelim inary to breaking it down. But under the proposals o f the W hite Paper, because this
 would not cause substantial alarm, harassm ent or distress it would n o t am ount to an offence.

   4.68 The m atter is dealt with efficiently in Scotland by the com m on law offence o f “ breach o f the peace” .
 This covers a very wide range of circumstances. Originally constituted to cover the situation when one or
 m ore persons conducted themselves in riotous or disorderly m anner to the alarm and annoyance or
 disturbance o f the lieges, it has now been extended to cover those who provoke a disturbance. The offence
 m ay be com m itted in a public o r private place and although evidence o f alarm is normally produced such
 evidence is n o t essential.

   4.69 There is a wide interpretation placed on the type and nature of disorder which m ay am ount to a
 breach o f the peace. It has been com m on practice for the police in Scotland to use the offence for such
 behaviour as chanting obscene o r abusive slogans, running onto the pitch, throw ing objects at spectators
 or onto the pitch, climbing flood-light pylons and assaulting or attem pting to assault spectators o r players.

   4.70 The list is not exhaustive and police bring a charge o f breach o f the peace in circum stances of
disorder at a football match. The use o f this charge has been o f great value in Scotland in dealing with a
wide range o f unacceptable conduct at a football m atch. Actual violence or disorder does not need to have
occurred, n o r is it necessary for a com plaint to be received about the actions o f the individuals before the
police can intervene. Pow er o f arrest is w ithout w arran t an d the offences are normally dealt with within
the m inor courts although in very serious cases they can become an indictable offence triable in the Sheriff
court or the High Court.

   4.71 I have paid three visits to Scotland an d have spoken to the football and police authorities. I have
also observed, for example, how well the crowd behaved at a Celtic/Rangers m atch where there was no 1 1
perim eter fencing. The offence of breach o f the peace is widely regarded as a very successful preventive
measure. It is a com m on law power. It is n ot difficult to recognise at a football ground somebody w ho is
disturbing the peace at th a t football ground.

   4.72 A t present there is statutory provision in England and Wales for binding over a person for breach
o f the peace pu rsu ant to the Justice o f the Peace Act 1361. He is orought before the court and bound ever
to keep the peace or to be o f good behaviour, but the preventive nature o f the bind over means that no
im m ediate penalty can be imposed. T hus in England an d W ales binding over for breach o f the peace which
is appropriate for “ peeping to m ” cases is wholly inappropriate for football-related offences.

   4.73 As an alternative to the introduction o f an offence o f breach o f the peace in England and Wales,
similar to the Scottish offence, the offence of disorderly conduct w h'ch the Review o f Public O rder Law
proposes should be considered applicable in the context o f a football ground, but w ithout the clause “ which
causes substantial alarm, harassment or distress.” It is argued that disorderly conduct ought to be defined.
But nobody finds it necessary to define it in the well-known offence o f being drunk and disorderly. There
is no reason why somebody who is sober but disorderly should not be equally guilty o f an offence. In
p arag raph 3.24 o f your Review o f Public O rder Law there appears “ If a person who causes this type of
disturbance is drunk, he may be charged with the offence of being drunk and disorderly; but there is no
corresponding offence to cover similar conduct by a person who is not drunk even though the nuisance caused
is no less, and may be thought more culpable in someone who is sober.”

    4.74 Q uite clearly a new offence in England and Wales o f disorderly conduct or breach o f the peace on
th e lines o f the Scottish com m on law offence, would be o f substantial assistance in dealing with hooliganism.
It would avoid the problem o f trying to define all the different types o f behaviour which give rise to disorder
a t football matches and would undoubtedly enable the police to take action much earlier than they can
under the present law. This offence should be confined to sports grounds where the disorderly conduct is
likely to have such a devastating effect on crowd safety. Disorderly conduct would clearly include throwing
a missile, running onto the pitch, seeking to climb over or to pull down a perimeter fence, shining a mirror
tow ards a batsm an, throw ing bottles or cans onto the field of play, or interfering with a greyhound or
horse race. I suggest that it should be triable summarily and there should be a power o f arrest. I recommend,
there fore, that consideration should be given to creating an offence o f disorderly conduct at a sports ground.

   4.75 I m ake these suggestions ab out legislation with some diffidence, because I am conscious th a t it is
fo r the Legislature to make the laws and for the Judiciary to interpret them. I am naturally anxious not to

              (iv) Powers o f Arrest
               " 4 76 I m ade a Provisional Recom m endation in my Interim R eport that the police should be given the
              power to arrest a hooligan subsequent to the offence under Section 5 o f the Public O rder Act 1936. A t
              present he can only arrest when the hooligan is actually com m itting the offence. If he is subsequently
              identified on Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) there is no pow er under the Public O rder Act 1936 to arrest
              him. I do not believe that Section 24(5) and Section 25(1) o f the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
              cover the m atter. W ith the proposed future use o f CCTV it is im portant that this gap in police power
    s®#       should be closed and the power to arrest be given even in am ended legislation. I recommend that the power
              to arrest under Section 5 o f the Public Order A ct 1936 should be widened.

              (v) Alcohol
             - >' 4.77 Alcohol plays a p a rt in some o f the outbreaks o f violence which occur at sports grounds. Even if
             r it does n o t give rise to violence, it gives rise to disorderly behaviour; if fans could be prevented from coming
             ‘ into the ground w ithout having drun k excessive quantities o f alcohol, there can be no doubt but th at the
                standards o f behaviour would improve. T o ban a fan from physically bringing drink into the ground, and
             f from obtaining a d rin k when in the ground, does not unfortunately prevent him from coming into the
              ' ground with drink inside him.

             % 4.78 The introduction o f the Sporting Events (C ontrol o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985 has been generally
              Ivelcomed, subject to two reservations; firstly, w hether d rin k should be available at all in the ground and
              secondly whether there should be an autom atic exclusion o f alcohol from boxes within view o f the ground.
              a S & W .:’ .                                                                         .
              : y 4 . 7 9 in my Interim R eport I observed (paragraph 6.17) th a t by reason o f the introduction o f the Sporting
              ^Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985, the question o f spectators being able to obtain d n n k in the
                ground was no longer a problem for me to consider. Nevertheless there was, and still is, a considerable
                divergence o f opinion ab o u t the question o f spectators being able to obtain drink in the ground and of the
             k extent, if any, to which it should be available. Considerable feeling also has been expressed to me ab out
             r preventing people in private boxes, who have paid substantial sums o f money for the privilege (and who
                contribute nothing to hooliganism) from obtaining drink in those boxes, while drink may be available to
-               those w ho go onto the terraces, albeit not in the sight o f the field o f play.

                  4.80 The effect o f the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985 is to allow the M agistrates on
                application by a club, and after hearing evidence from any objectors (usually the police) to decide w hether
                any p a rt o f the premises shall be licensed to sell drink. By Section 3(3) “ an order under this section shall
                not apply to any p art of the premises from which designated sporting events, at the designated sports ground,
     '‘tv"      may be directly viewed.”

                  4.81 Thus a bar beneath a terrace, at which a notional hooligan can obtain drink, may be licensed; but
                the D irectors’ Box which is so placed that the event may be directly viewed from it, may not.

              -- 4.82 Each Licensing Bench is perfectly entitled to ado pt whatever view it feels in its judicial wisdom is
                proper in respect o f a particular licence sought. The Act was intended to bestow upon the Licensing Justices
                a com plete discretion. Some criticism has been m ade th at in some way the exercise o f th at discretion makes
                a loop-hole through the Act. It does not, because it was always intended that magistrates should have the
                discretion.

                T 4.83 There is a division o f views as to whether drink available in the ground contributes in any way to
                hooliganism. Those who contend th at it does point out th a t if it is not available, however much has been
                drunk before the game starts, there will be at least a l i h o ur period o f drying out; nor will there have been
                an opportunity to top up; the peak mom ent o f potential violence is often when the opposing fans meet
                after the game, by which time it may well be two hours since the potential hooligan last had his drink.
                Thus there is some measure o f protection by forbidding it in the ground altogether.

    i i l l i l L , 4 . 8 4 Those who favour allowing drink to be sold on the g r o u n d , . certainly before the game starts, point
            '~r to the fact that if there is no drink available in the ground, those who want to drink simply go into the

(vi) Closed Circuit Television
   4.92 The introduction o f C C T V as a w eapon against hooliganism seems to have m et with universal
approval. It is essential that the equipm ent which is installed is o f a high quality. This is a m atter for the
Individual choice o f the police authority and the football management. But nothing could be worse than
to waste a considerable am ount o f money on equipm ent, if it is o f no practical value in identifying hooligans
so that they can be prosecuted and convicted. It is im portant too to recognise th at the operator needs to
be properly trained and that maintenance of th at equipm ent is vital to the success of its operation.

   4.93 Its use at Huddersfield T ow n Football Club, for instance, has proved its value. D uring 1984 there
was a total o f 253 arrests for offences o f assault, dam age and threatening behaviour committed by supporters
attending the Huddersfield T ow n ground. There were 26 m atches played in the season. 113 arrests were at
games against one particular team and 75 against another. It was decided that the next visit o f one o f these
teams was a suitable occasion to assess the potential o f video-recording incidents o f disorder. Following
the recording o f incidents in the ground, two officers were selected to examine the recording, to effect the
arrest of the parties involved in th e violent incidents. Identification of offenders was achieved by the officers
repeatedly visiting Huddersfield Tow n’s ground and the ground o f the visiting club on subsequent home
games, and attem pting to identify those caught on cam era in the crowd. Extensive briefings were also given
to other officers and more routine inquiries including the visiting o f railway and bus termini were undertaken.

   4.94 The results to date, which are by no means final, are that eight persons have appeared before the
C ourts, where the m ain evidence has been the video-recording of themselves committingH. ffences o f assault
on police, threatening behaviour, criminal dam age and assault.

   4.95 It is clear that the m ost beneficial factors are firstly, the effect on offenders who have been identified
from the video; secondly, the knock-on effect on their similar minded friends and thirdly, there is the
opportunity presented to M agistrates to exercise their sentencing powers to the full, in the confident
knowledge o f having seen the undisputed violence involved in the incident. They have been able to witness
the scene which cannot be set in w ords alone.

   4.96 One o f the accused charged with an offence at Huddersfield said that he had not been at that
particular game, but he was then shown the video and said; “ I can’t get away from that; you are doing a
good jo b .” A nother o f the accused, who had tried to pull dow n a safety fence, said "hat he had been playing
a local soccer game on the day o f the offence but adm itted the offence after having been shown the video­
film with him on it.

  4.97 At the end o f the 1984-85 season another club visited Huddersfield. There were a num ber o f arrests
based on video evidence. The fact was given considerable publicity in the area o f the ether club. W hen the
sam e club next visited Huddersfield in a fixture in the current season, there was no trouble at all. The
football clubs themselves have little doubt but that the publicity given to the arrests o f their visiting
supporters as a result o f the video-film had a very strong and m arked deterrent effect on the behaviour of
their supporters when they re-visited Huddersfield.

   4.98 A further use for CCTV is for crowd control before a game starts or after the match. This was
vividly illustrated when I visited M anchester United during their match against Liverpool. Some 4,000
Liverpool supporters arrived; they needed to be brought from their transport to the ground and at the end~
o f the match to be safely removed. It was possible for the Operational Com m ander in the control room
on the ground, with the aid of five television m onitors, to have a complete view o f the area inside the
ground which contained the Liverpool supporters and the area outside the ground which included the route
by which it was intended they should leave.

  4.99 At the end o f the game the Liverpool supporters were asked to remain on their terrace. They were
held there for some fifteen minutes. D uring that time the M anchester United supporters left. The police
outside the ground, at the end where the Liverpool supporters were, cleared the concourse o f other
spectators; and when they were ready to receive the Liverpool supporters and it was clear to the Commanding
Officer that this was the right moment, he was able to give the instruction that the Liverpool supporters
should leave.

   4.100 He was also able to see that along the route which they were intending to take, there were a
num ber of M anchester United supporters still about. Thus he was able to direct police officers from his
position inside the stadium control room to advise the M anchester United supporters to move on, so that
th e Liverpool supporters could be escorted to their transport, which is in fact what happened.
    4.101 The F ootball T rust has m ade a substantial contribution tow ards the purchase o f this equipm ent
  as they and the Football G rounds Im provem ent T rust have done in respect o f other facilities a t football
  grounds. This is much to be commended and they play a very im portant p a rt in ensuring the welfare o f
  the game,

  (vii) Radios
    4.102 I had occasion in my Interim R eport, to m ake some observations abou t the way th a t the police
  radios had operated at Bradford (paragraphs 3.27-3.33). I recommended th at early attention should be
  given by the H om e Office D irectorate o f Telecom m unications to consider the practicality o f producing a
  m ore suitable personal radio for the police . 1

  . 4.103 Subsequently, at one ground I went to I was able to observe the relative efficiency o f the police
 "radio operated by a police officer and a commercial type of radio o f similar construction and appearance,
 "operated by a steward employed by the club. Messages from both were received in the police control room-
  situated in the ground, by an experienced controller. T he reception from the stew ard’s commercial radio
  was markedly better than from the police radio.

     4.104 One police force expressed confidence in their equipment. They had been able to purchase their
  equipm ent on the commercial m arket and had found no operational difficulty in its use. However, I
  observed at one ground a Police Sergeant being asked by a Chief Superintendent to send a message on his
  police radio. H e was unable to do so, to general em barrassm ent, apparently due to the batteries having
  w orn out. The point has also been m ade by the Fire Brigades’ U nion th at their radios are n o t as good as
  they would like because the batteries, if used for any length o f time, tend to w ear out. I see no reason,
  therefore, to alter my view that the quality o f both the police and the fire service radios (though each are
  different) still needs to be reviewed and the importance o f regular m aintenance emphasised. I am pleased
. to learn th at a detailed study is being commissioned by the Home Office D irectorate o f Telecommunications
_ into the problem o f personal radios.

 (viii) Police M anpower
    4.105 In my Interim R eport (paragraphs 6.9 and 6.10) I drew attention to the large num ber o f police
 officers it is necessary to deploy for the purpose o f controlling crowds at a football match. It is a m atter
 o f some concern th at such a large proportion o f police resources should be devoted to the task o f controlling
 a football crowd, when there are so m any oth er aspects o f law and order to which they ought to be devoting
 their time. The police are the first to recognise this.

     4.106 At a recent Mill w all/Portsm outh m atch over 500 police officers were required to be deployed in
 a n d outside the ground (and properly so required) to control a crowd o f under 7,000 spectators. A ny steps
 which can be taken to reduce the necessity for a police presence at a football ground are to be encouraged.
 A successful membership scheme may well have this effect.

 B. The Clubs


 (i) Membership Cards and the Football League Scheme
    4.107 I recommended in my Interim R eport th at urgent consideration be given by football clubs in
 England and Wales to introducing a membership system . 2 N o other Recom m endation has given rise to
 such discussion o r indeed criticism. There were three criticisms of the idea of a m embership system. Firstly,
 th a t 1 was advocating an identity card system. I was not, nor did I so suggest in my Report. Secondly, that
 a m em bership pass was the equivalent of an identity card. It is not any more than a driving licence, work
 pass, season ticket, credit card, bus pass, library ticket or the many thousands o f membership cards o f
 different clubs, both football and others, which presently exist. Thirdly, there was the suggestion that to
 require a card o r pass at a football ground was interfering in some way with the liberty o f the subject. This
 I have to say is simply em otional nonsense.

 . 4.108 There are, however, two much m ore serious objections which have real validity. Firstly, th at any
 system o f m em bership cards is likely to prove impractical at the turnstiles because there would not~be f"
 enough time to check the card presented, given the tendency of football spectators to arrive at the very
 last moment.
 •Interim Report: Recommendation 3.
 ^Interim Report: Recommendation 20.
  A ', ? ?      figures for T ottenham H otspu r F ootball Club, for instance, su pport this objection. On 17
  A ugust. 1985 when they played W atford, the final attendance figure was 29,884. A t 2.45 pm there were
  19,217 in the ground, at 3 pm there were 27,785^ The figures for Liverpool this season for five games show
  tfrat on average only 65 per cent o f total attendance were in the ground 15 minutes before kick-off and 92
                       ThUSl ° n' a7 .erage’ SOme 9 ' ° ° 0 .spgct&tors were, still trying to get into the grmmd IS
j minutes before kick-off and 2,500 were still outside when play began.

    4.110 The second objection is that it would prevent a casual spectator, who wanted to go and visit his
 own club on occasions, from so doing; and also that the spectator, who supported a num ber o f clubs would
 be preven ed from attending matches. It was also pointed out th at if away supporters were banned some
 clubs would lose large revenues. In the lower Divisions, except for local derbies, away fans are only a small
 proportion o f the crowd, but in the F irjt and Second Divisions they may be very substantial.

    4.11   i 1 These were, and still remain, very strong argum ents, more particularly as they come from a large
 num ber o f the more responsible and reputable clubs. They have been repeated m any times to me both
 orally and in writing, since my Interim R eport. On the other hand, the Football Association, the Football
 League, the Professional Footballers’ Association and the Sports Council all favour some form o f
 mem bership scheme. So too do many supporters’ clubs, and a num ber o f clubs who are introducing their
 already           part    membershlP scheme has m uch to com m end it and, in fact, exists*at m any clubs


   4.112 A num ber o f matches this season have shown th at the casual supporter cannot, in fact, just go to
 any game as he pleases. One example is w hat happened in the W atford versus Chelsea game in September
   was played at 12 noon. It was all-ticket. I w anted to go on to the terraces. As a W atford supporter I
 needed to be in possession o f a voucher from a previous programme. As a Chelsea supporter I needed to
                      *?■,Supp° rte^ ’ C lub and t 0 g ° and get a ticket from Chelsea during the week. W atford,
 '             14? 0 0 tickets for Chelsea supporters available at the ground on the day, though this was not
 made public. Thus, if on the Saturday m orning I had as a casual decided I would like to go to the game I
 would n o t have got in and thus I was no better off than I would have been under a m embership scheme.’

   4.1 1 3 All-ticket games in England and W ales involve a severe limitation of those who can attend A
num ber o f big games are all-ticket. .h e usual m ethod of distribution o f the tickets to the away team is to
channel them to members o f their supporters’ club o r to season ticket holders. In those cases it is clear
that the casual supporter will not get a ticket. This year all Leeds United matches, when they play away
from home, have been designated by the Football Association to be all-ticket games; thus the casual
supporter o f Leeds United is unlikely to be able to get a ticket to see his team when they are playing away.

        P h Y StT Mhi0h VeedS U nitf d has a d °P ted is t 0 allocate their away tickets first to season ticket

       “ 14 M any football clubs have in recent years carefully considered how to attract desirable groups of
       spectators, such as families and children, to attend their matches .

                                       haS bee" Set aside for these SrouPs' and often admission to them is
       controlled by the use of membership cards . . .

       16.     In addition numerous clubs have established supporters’ membership schemes, open to individuals of
       holders                       ” *    el' glble ^   men,bership of fami,y or chi|dren’s schemes and for season ticket

                 ° / Sp° rts Grounds Act regulations lay down strict guidelines for segregation of rival supporters,
       and these structures greatly facilitate the creation of reserved areas for members of particular schemes.
At many clubs, facilities have been specially improved to cater for these groups particularly refreshmeat
kiosks, lavatories, additional seating and so os.
18. A particular benefit o f schemes of this sort is that the club and its supporters can be confident that
in those areas of the ground where admission is controlled by membership, the likelihood of disorder is
minimal. If offences do occur, membership is withdrawn and the individual banned from the ground.
23. It is thus necessary to consider how a membership system could help solve the away travel problem.
The answer clearly lies in building on the success of the individual club schemes and extending the
privileges, which membership confers at home matches to away games. To achieve this will require a
high degree of compatability between one club’s scheme and another’s.
24. The first step, therefore will be for all clubs to have a membership scheme the basic principles of
which will be common to all. In our view these should cover:
   (a) the categories of membership (eg the season ticket holders, families, young people and/or children,
   accredited supporters, etc).
   (b) The specification of the membership card.

   (c) A photograph on the card and a duplicate held by the club (except for season ticket holders for
   whom this may not be necessary).
   (d) The length of time for which a card is valid. We recommend that they should be renewed each
   season.

   (e) The information about the applicant to be supplied on the form requesting membership (eg, full
   name, address, date of birth).
   (f) Agreement with the clubs on the proportion of ground capacity to be covered by membership
   arrangements. We recommend that this should normally be not less than 50 per cent.
   (g) In view of the fact that some clubs are contemplating the introduction of electronic readers at
   turnstiles, it will be important to see that the electronic data on cards (presumably in the form of a
   magnetic strip) also conforms to a common standard.

25. To ensure that these criteria are complied with, we recommend that the Football League issue
guidelines to all clubs to be included in the arrangements, thus establishing the concept of a “Football
League approved membership scheme.” Clubs should be encouraged to provide reserved and safe
accommodaton at their ground for away supporters who are members o f approved schemes.
26. Whilst we do not recommend that every match should be ‘members only* for reasons we explain
below, we believe it would be possible through the use o f reciprocal membership arrangements to reduce
the likelihood of crowd disorder at difficult games by insisting that not only are these ‘all ticket’ but also
that tickets are to be sold to members only. We envisage that in due course, as membership schemes
gain increasing acceptance, more and more areas in football grounds become reserved enclosures, to
which only ‘home’ members or ‘away’ members are admitted.
28. . . . We hope, however, that it will never be necessary to refuse admission to persons of good
character, who for whatever reason, are not members o f the home or away team’s scheme (the so called
‘casual’ supporter, who perhaps only attends a handful of games in a season, or likes to visit a number
of clubs or who has a conscientious objection to being in a membership scheme).
37. The Working Party concludes that it is possible to establish a national membership card scheme for
Football League clubs which does not require extremely expensive computer-based electronic equipment
at each ground, or which totally excludes away supporters or decent football fans who are not members
of schemes from the great majority of matches which are expected to be trouble free.
38. We recommend that the Football League urgently draws up guidelines for ‘inclusive’ membership
schemes (following the advice given in paragraph 24 of this report) with a view to ensuring their
compatability with one another and at the same time providing guidance with the help of the Central
Computer and Telecommunications Agency to clubs wishing to install electronic equipment to check
cards.
39. We recommend that the Football League, in full, introduce regulations requiring clubs to establish
areas of their grounds for the use of members, with normally at least 50 per cent of the ground’s capacity
reserved for this purpose.


                                                  44
     40. We recommend that the Government includes in its proposed Public Order Bill a provision for
     exclusion orders on football offenders, to back up membership schemes, and for clubs and police te
     double their efforts to prevent undesirable non-members from entering their grounds, including the
     circulation by clubs of black lists of banned persons.
     41. The Working Party believe that if these recommendations are followed the system introduced tvill
     comply with the agreement reached between the Government, the Football Association and the Football
     League at the Downing Street meeting on 30 July. The national membership card scheme should impose
     little financial burden on clubs, and indeed provide some commercial opportunities for them as a result
     of their obtaining more information about their customers. The successful operation of the scheme will,
     in addition, provide a measure of security and reassurance for the decent supporters who continue t« be
     the backbone of English professional football, as well as a demonstration to UEFA and FIFA that
     English football is determined to put its house in order.”

   4.116 Reading propose to introduce a computerised system, with cards, which would exclude n o n ­
members. It has not yet been implemented. It is, however, one type o f scheme. So too have Brentford.
U nder their scheme they issue a form which asks for nam e and address and employer. A person is issued
with a card with the type o f membership he requires. It costs £1. The cost o f producing the card was
substantially covered by advertising. Arm ed with this card, which the m em ber presents at the turnstile, he
is adm itted to that p a rt of the ground where his ticket allows him to go. Those w ithout tickets go through
the non-m em bers’ turnstiles thus allowing the casual in, but he pays more for his ticket. Police need only
patrol the non-m em bers’ areas.

   4.117 So far this season Brentford have sold ab o u t 5,000 membership cards. They find th at the list of
m embers has im portant commercial potential and are optimistic that there will be considerable spin-offs
from the scheme.

  4.118 In the 1984—85 season Crystal Palace operated a limited membership card system in which 25 per
cent o f the ground had been for “ members only” . In April 1985 they announced that 50 per cent o f the
ground would be so organised. There was an initial fee o f £3, but members paid 50 pence less for standing
accom m odation and £1 less for a seat. There were some 3,800 members. The membership scheme led to a
reduction o f one third in the level o f police manning at the ground.

  4.119 Leicester City have introduced a similar scheme. They have 3.000 members, nearly 5,000 season
and family ticket holders and 1,000 members of the Supporters’ Club. Because o f the success o f the scheme,
which has led to improved behaviour, they have been able to reduce the am ount of perimeter fencing and
hope, as membership rises, to reduce the fencing further. Millwall have an away travel club. Applications
require :he name and address, date o f birth and description o f the applicant and require the applicant to
say w hether he has been convicted o f any football-related offence. The card contains a photograph o f the
applicant. A num ber o f other football clubs have supporters’ associations or clubs which require a
membership card including a photograph.

  4.120 An example o f a match containing substantially only home spectators was the Milwall versus
Portsm outh game on 26 O ctober 1985. Because o f previous troubles, it was an all-ticket game. Portsm outh
Football Club did not accept any tickets and dissuaded their supporters from going to the game. In the
result only about thirty Portsm outh supporters watched the m atch which was trouble-free.

   4.121 A nother proposal, which has found favour with some witnesses, is that admission for away
supporters should be limited to a person holding membership of the visiting club's supporters’ club. Thus
it is hoped that a football club would be made responsible for the behaviour o f its supporters when they
are visiting another ground.

  4.122 It has to be remembered that all clubs at present have a structure for membership in the shape o f
season ticket holders, family membership and so on. There is no reason why these types o f membership
should not be encouraged at the expense o f the potential hooligan. Thus, by improving the facilities for
members, by ofTenng discounts on away travel, by offering tickets at preferential prices and by involving
members in the general well-being o f the club, there will be two particular benefits.

4.123 Firstly, the club will gain from all the commercial benefits of a membership scheme and the reduction
in the cost o f m aintaining law and order in the ground. Secondly, the members will benefit from reduced
contact with the hooligan. Thus, gradually, a club with a membership scheme may start to win back; the
families and children as well as other supporters who now stay away.
    4.124    The Football T ru st and the D epartm ent o f the Environm ent recently commissioned the Sociology
  D epartm ent a t the University o f Leicester (who are very experienced in investigation o f football problems)
  to examine an d report on Leicester City’s m em bership scheme.

  4.125 The Leicester sociologists conclude that the m ost practical strategy would be to encourage the co­
 ordinated introduction o f club-based schemes. “Such an approach” , they say, “ would enable each club to
 become familiar with the operation of its own scheme and, following that, it might be possible to establish and
 to monitor a pilot project involving reciprocal arrangements.”

    4.126 In my Interim R eport I set out the various problem s of a membership scheme and said that despite
 the problems, these could be overcome with goodwill and effort. I did not pretend that any membership
 scheme would necessarily be successful, or that I could guarantee that it would cure football hooliganism.
 I suggested th at clubs could keep away fans away if they were so minded. I did not then recom mend this
 as the only scheme, nor do I do so now. It is to be hoped that a partial membership scheme which still
 allows casuals to enter the ground will be the first step in trying to secure greater peace and harm ony at a
 football match. In the end, it m ust be for the football clubs to take whatever steps they think necessary to
 ensure crowd control at football matches. M em bership schemes are one, but certainly not the only step.
 The Football League have taken an im portant step in this direction and their efforts are much to be
 commended.

     4.127 Clubs in the Football League have reacted to the Football League’s-proposal with varying degrees
  o f enthusiasm ranging from dow nright opposition to w arm acceptance. Given the history o f the Football
  League clubs no one should be surprised that there is no agreement on this suggestion anymore than on
  any other suggestion.

    4.128 The fact that this season, as I write, trouble on the terraces has been appreciably less than last
 season, is no ground for complacency. I recognise th a t the great m ajority of football matches are trouble-
 free, but any practical step which can be taken to lessen the risk is to be applauded. The W orking Party’s
 R eport is but a first step. So too are the experiments which I have recorded. N o d o ubt there are other
 promising schemes elsewhere. It will have to be seen how successful they are and adjusted in the light o f
 experience. F or my part, I recommend that consideration should continue to be given to some form o f
 membership scheme fo r Football League clubs in England and Wales.

 (ii) Stewards
      4.129 I have already expressed my view about the responsibility o f the clubs, as private organisations
   inviting spectators into their grounds for profit, to bear the responsibility for ensuring the reasonable safety
   o f those spectators. To that end, I have already recommended that stewards should be properly selected
   and properly trained. The days when all they are required to do is to act like an usherette at a cinema to
   show people to their seats should have gone. They have a very im portant public responsibility to ensure
.. the safety o f the spectators, as do the cabin staff o f an aeroplane. I have been impressed at a number of
   grounds which I have visited, by the steps which have now been taken (albeit belatedly) to ensure that
   there are com petent stewards w ho are properly briefeu. N o doubt the presence o f a large num ber o f police,
.. which is now the accepted practice on a ground, had led some clubs to be less energetic than they otherwise
   would be in looking after their own property and the safety of spectators.

 (iii) Community Affairs
    4.130 Clubs like Aberdeen and W atford (no d oub t there are other shining examples) have involved
 themselves in community affairs. They have provided a place were families and children can attend. They
 have encouraged a relationship between the club and the local community which can only result in greater
 harm ony at the ground. The current financial problems affecting a number of clubs will no doubt result in
 a rethink as to whether a football ground, often used only for football once a fortnight, is being put to its
 best practical use. Some 40 hours use in a year scarcely seems an economic use o f an expensive ground.
 O n the Continent, the sharing of grounds and their facilities, not only for spectators and players, but for
 members of the public, has much to commend it. This, of course, cannot happen overnight. A number of
 forward looking clubs already involve the community. M any do not and there can be no doubt that it is
 to everyone’s advantage th a t they should.

 (iv) Behaviour O f Players
   4.131 The behaviour of some players on the field o f play undoubtedly contributes on occasion to bad
 behaviour on the terraces. This is not confined to football. Indeed some o f the antics of cricketers and


                                                         46
tennis players are substantially worse than those o f football players. The public conduct o f professional
golfers and snooker players, who are subject to pressures and tension, certainly no less than o th er sports
players, has m uch to com m end it. A num ber o f foo tballclu bs take a much firmer view a bo ut the behaviour
o f their players th a n some o f the other sporting authorities. It is a fact, however, that in some cases the
play-acting when a player goes down, the childish kicking away o f the ball when a free-kick is aw arded to
the opposition, an d the throw ing away o f the ball when it is the opposition’s throw-in, all cause upset on
the terraces, and play a p a rt in contributing to disorder. W orse still is the so-called professional foul which
in ordinary language is plain cheating. In some games it m ight call for a ban for life. It seriously increases
tension am ong the crowd.

(v) Supporters’ Clubs
  4.132 It might be thought th at with falling attendances supporters’ clubs would be positively encouraged
and welcomed by football clubs. F a r from it. Some football clubs have no supporters’ clubs. Some who
do treat them as if they were a rival organisation. The result is that instead of harnessing the goodwill of
those who provide some of the livelihood to the club (and are often their keenest supporters) some clubs
take active steps to discourage them. In some football clubs “ the customer knows best” has a hollow ring.

(vi) Facilities at Football Grounds
   4.133 I have little doubt but th at the provision o f good facilities at football grounds is likely to result in
better behaviour from the fans. A num ber o f clubs do provide first-class facilities. At others the facilities
can at best be described as woeful, at worst non-existent. There is a tradition of standing on the terraces
an d even a m odern ground like Ibrox Park has one side o f the stadium which has all standing. But it is
possible to provide com fortable facilities. There is a strong view that while better facilities will not necessarily
prevent people from behaving like hooligans, they are likely to lessen the chance. There is no reason why
clubs should continue to provide facilities no better then were available a hundred years ago. Clubs must
be encouraged to improve their facilities.

  4.134 Professor C anter of Surrey University was invited to carry out some research for me into the
problems o f crowd behaviour. He interviewed a selected num ber o f people living near grounds as diverse
as Celtic and Millwall; Coventry and Preston N orth End. They were asked a general open question about
the reason why people do not go regularly to football matches and what would encourage people to go
m ore frequently. The largest percentage (29% ) said th at im proved com fort would encourage people to go
m ore frequently. T h at figure varied from as little as 8 % at Coventry to 44% at Southam pton.

 4.135 This view is not wholly supported by the findings o f the Dunfermline College of Physical Education,
who carried out a survey of crowd behaviour at football matches in Scotland. In particular they looked at
Rangers, Aberdeen and H ibernian Football Clubs. Their conclusion was:
      “Fans rated the quality of the football and the trouble-free crowd as being more important than the
      quality of facilities. Further, entertaining football was valued more highly than a winning team. However
      the relative importance placed on the importance of facilities appeared to depend on the experience of
      the fans. For example at Easter Road (the Hibernian Football Club Ground) a predominantly terraced
      ground, where there have been few ground improvements, concern was centred on improvements to the
      stadia such as covering the terracing and more seating. However, at Ibrox (Rangers Football Ground)
      and Pittodrie (Aberdeen Football Club Ground) where the fans feel there is little room for improvement
      of the facilities, the concern was focussed on the quality of the football and additional types of
      entertainment.”

 -4.136 It would be splendid if perimeter fencing and segregation barriers could be removed. They are in
England and Wales, ot comparatively recent origin. In the past we looked with superior am usem ent at
countries elsewhere where it was thought necessary to introduce them. It is. however, quite clear th at in
England and Wales, at any rate, a very great deal o f trouble would exist w ithout them, although they are
not universal. In Scotland they are alm ost non-existent. The grounds at Pittodrie and Ibrox are a model.
One advantage o f introducing successful membership schemes could be to reduce the num ber o f perimeter
fences.

   4.137    In mv Interim R eport I recom m ended 1 th at consideration be given to the design o f a standard
efficient perimeter fence with proner exits. T hat was understood in some quarters to mean that I had
recom m ended th a t perimeter fences should be installed as a m atter of routine at all grounds. T hat was not

   tny intention. W hat I was saying was th a t if perim eter fencing was to be installed a t a particular ground,
. it would be sensible th a t the design o f it should be standardised. I have seen a num ber o f perim eter fences
   in various p a rts o f the country. They varied in quality and design enormously and I suspect also in cost.
S Some were efficient, some not particularly so. A t one ground there was a perim eter fence which could not
   possibly be criticised on grounds o f efficiency. H owever, because o f the nature o f its construction, those
   inside the stand had very great difficulty in watching the football. Thus while they were physically controlled,
 .th e ir enjoym ent was exceedingly limited. N o r are perim eter fences the only m ethod o f preventing spectators
...from getting on to the pitch. There are very efficient methods adopted at some Continental srounds like
   double fencing and dry m oats.

      4.138         It would, in my view, be o f immense help to those clubs who are intending to put perimeter fencing
  .in, or are m inded to alter their existing fences, to have a standard specification, so th at an efficient perimeter
_ fen ce, if one is required, can be installed. I would like to have persuaded the Football Association to set
   up a small w orking party to help the clubs develop a standard design. They declined the invitation pointing
   o u t that if their design was unsuccessful and the fence surm ounted, this would underm ine their disciplinary
. power. I still think they are the proper organisation to look at this problem.                        '

                                      *          Hooliganism

  5.1 I do not believe that my R eport would be complete w ithout an exam ination o f some o f the current
theories about hooliganism.

  5.2 There are three p opu lar fallacies about hooliganism. Firstly, that it is something comparatively new.
Secondly, that it is only found at soccer matches and thirdly, that it is an English disease.

(i) Hooliganism is not a new phenomenon
   5.3 Seneca (who died in AD. 65) devoted the last three years o f his life to philosophy and to writing
letters to Lucilius a native o f Pompeii. In one o f them he wrote (Penguin Classics translation): “You asked
me to say what you should consider it particularly important to avoid. My answer is this: the mass crowd. It
is something to which you cannot entrust yourself yet without risk . . . Associating with people in large numbers
is actually harmful. There is not one of them that will not make some vice or other attractive to us or leave
us carrying the imprint of it or be daubed all unawares with it. And inevitably enough, the larger the size of
the crowd we mingle with the greater the danger.”

  5.4 . . . “I happened to go to one of these shows at the time of the lunch hour interlude, expecting there to
be some light and witty entertainment then, some respite for the purpose of affording people’s eyes a rest from
human blood. Far from it. All the earlier contests were charity in comparison . . . What we have now is murder
pure and simple . . . In the morning men are thrown to the lions and the bears but it is the spectators they are
thrown to in the lunch hour. The spectators insist that each, on killing his man should be thrown against
another, to be killed in his turn; and the eventual victor is reserved by them for some other form of butchery;
the only exit for the contestants is death. Fire and steel keep the slaughter going. And all this happens whilst
the Arena is virtually empty. . . . And when there is an interval in the show there is a cry ‘let’s have some
throats cut in the mean-time so that there is something happening’.”

   5.5 W riting in 1788 from Downing Street, Edw ard G ibbon described in his History o f the Decline and
Fall of the R om an Em pire the factions o f the circus in Rom e in AD. 548 thus: “The race in its first
institution was a simple contest of two chariots whose drivers were distinguished by white and red liveries; two
additional colours, a light green and cerulean blue were afterwards introduced; and as the races were repeated
25 times, 100 chariots contributed in the same day to the pomp of the circus . . . The bloody and tumultuous
contest continued to disturb the public festivity till the last age of the spectacles of Rome” . . .

  5.6 “Constantinople adopted the follies though not the virtues of ancient Rt me; and the same factions which
had agitated the circus, raged with redoubled fury in the hippodrome. Un^er the reign of Anastasius, this
popular frenzy was inflamed by religious zeal; and the greens who had treacherously concealed stones and
daggers under baskets of fruit massacred at a solemn festival 3,000 of their blue adversaries” . . .

   5.7 “The blues affected to strike terror by a peculiar and barbaric dress, the long hair of the Huns, their
close sleeves and ample garments, a lofted step and a sonorous voice. In the day they concealed their two-
edged poinards but in the night they boldly assembled in arms and in numerous bands, prepared for every act
of violence and rapine. Their adversaries of the green faction or even inoffensive citizens were stripped and
often murdered by these nocturnal robbers, and it became dangerous to wear any gold buttons or girdles or to
appear at a late hour in the street of the peaceful capital.”

   5.8 Gibbon then describes the sedition which occurred and continued: “It is computed that about 30,000
persons were slain in the merciless and promiscuous carnage of the day . . . the Hippodrome itself was
condemned during several years to a mournful silence; with the restoration of the games, the same disorders
revived and the blue and green factions continued to afflict the reign of Justinian and to disturb the tranquility
of the eastern empire.”

   5.9 A ntonia Fraser reports in her book "Cromwell O ur Chief o f M en” that in 1655 in the M idlands, in
o rd e r to preserve the Peace it was considered necessary to ban football matches and race meetings.

   5.10 The Leicester Daily Mercury records a disgraceful scene at the match between Burnley and Blackburn
in 1890 when: “the Referee was mobbed at the close, the official had to be protected by the Committee and
so demonstrative were the spectators that the Police could not clear the field. He had to take refuge under the
grandstand and subsequently in a neighbouring house. The police force was increased and eventually the
Referee was hurried into a cab and driven away followed by a howling stone-throwing mote.”

   5.11 There are more recent examples o f football hooliganism. In 1909 at H am pden Park some 6,000
spectators pulled up goalposts, fences and pay-boxes, set fire to them and danced round them in the middle
o f the pitch. Police, firemen and am bulancem en were stoned, fire engines dam aged and hoses slashed.
Police, after throw ing the stones back at the rioters, finally cleared the ground at seven o ’clock at a cost
of fifty-four Constables injured and the destruction o f virtually every street ro und H am pden. Sixty other
people were also injured.

   5.12 N either of the New Y ear’s D ay m atches at P arkhead in 1898 or Ibrox in 1905, between Rangers
and Celtic, were finished because o f pitch invasions. There were serious outbreaks o f disorder in Scottish
Football in 1941, 1949, 1953, 1955, 1957, 1958 and on into the 1960s. The disorder consisted of fighting,
bottle-throw ing and pitch invasions in addition to ritual chanting, obscenities and jeering. The Glasgow
H erald wrote in 1952: “ This hooliganism on the sports field cannot be allowed to go on. The sport of football
must be cleared up.”

(ii) Hooliganism is only a fo o tb a ll problem
   5.13 This is no t wholly true. 1954 saw the M C C in the West Indies playing the third Test M atch a t
G eorgetow n, British G uyana. The W est Indians were ab o u t to put on 100 when one of their batsm en was
run-out. Scuffling broke out in the stand behind square-leg. Dozens o f bottles were hurled tow ards the
square-leg um pire who had given the batsm an out and m ounted police had to be moved onto the scene o f
disorder.

   5.14 Six years later in the second Test at Queens Park, P o rt o f Spain, there was a similar occurrence.
Again a West Indian was run-out. Again bottles were throw n onto the field by the crowd. Beer cans, fruit
an d anything else which came to h and was also throw n. T hen the crowd came onto the field of play; finally
the game had to be abandoned for the day.

   5.15 In N ovem ber 1963 there was a riot at a horse race track in the New Y ork area. There were fifteen
arrests and fifteen taken to hospital. Booths were set on fire and cars damaged.

  5.16 In 1955 a t an ice hockey m atch between M ontreal C anadians and D etroit Redskins there was a
m ajor riot. A smoke bom b was throw n. Cars were overturned, stores were looted and there were one
hundred arrests.

(iii) Football hooliganism only occurs in this country
    5.17 This is not the case. In Brazil, in September 1950. one person was shot dead and several others
injured, four seriously, when an angry crow d tried to drag a football referee from inside a police car at
Rio de Janeiro. In Italy, in M arch 1951, police used tear gas to disperse thousands o f angry football
spectators who broke into a visiting football team ’s dressing room a t Bari, Southern Italy, injured a player
a n d the trainer and chased the referee four miles to a farm house.

   5.18 The official com m unist newspaper. Bauber, described a game near Belgrade in 1955 in this way:
“Fans rushed on to the field carrying knives, knocked down the Referee and put him out of action for a t least
six months.”

   5.19 The St Louis Post D espatch, in Decem ber 1976, described a football game in this way: “ At a
National Football League game a t Foxborough, M assachusetts between the New York Jets and the New
England Patriots, rowdy fans continually ran out onto the field, stopping play a dozen times. By the time the
gam e ended two fans had died of heart attacks, 30 were taken to hospital with cuts and bruises, 49 were
arrested, a policeman’s jaw was broken and a spectator had been stabbed. In the parking lot a policeman was
giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a heart-attack victim when a drunken fan urinated on the officer’s
back.”

The extent of hooliganism
   5.20 There is then considerable evidence ab out the age and generality o f the problem. It is less easy
how ever to m easure its extent and development. One of the problems confronting anyone enquiring into
the problems o f hooliganism is the total lack o f any reliable statistics. It is possible to ascertain from the


                                                         50
police the num ber o f arrests during a season a t a particular ground. By com paring these figures with the
previous year or years, some sort of conclusion can be draw n, particularly if the num ber o f spectators is
also know n. Thus arrests as a percentage o f spectators can be calculated.

  5.21 U nfortunately this is an unreliable approach. Firstly, the d ata often do not distinguish between
those arrested inside and those arrested outside the ground. Secondly the offences are no t defined; they
may be, for example, pick-pocketing, drunkenness or violence. Thirdly, the num ber o f arrests may n ot
indicate the extent o f violence because when a riot takes place police m ay have to spend more time defending
themselves than arresting people; on other occasions which are less violent they may be more able to arrest
the trouble-m akers.

    5.22 It m ight have been thought th at this violence has been a problem for football clubs for many years
the first thing the football authorities would have done would have been to seek to establish the extent of
it. F a r from it.

   5.23 Presently at every Football League m atch in England and Wales there is an observer appointed by
the Football League to assess and report on the perform ance o f the referee. In European and International
matches there is an assessor who reports on the game, including crowd problems. W hen I suggested to the
Football League th at their observers at dom estic matches might also observe and report on any crowd
problems they were n ot enthusiastic. N o r it appears are there any official plans for the central collection
of statistics on this im portant subject. The result is that any student of the problem has to m ake do with
inadequate statistics and a good deal o f folklore because the authorities are unable to provide the assistance
so th at the necessary lessons may be learned.

   5.24 In July 1976, a panel established jointly by the Sports Council and the Social Science Research
Council reported on the problems o f anti-social behaviour at sporting events . 1 In its recommendations for
research the R eport said this: “ During its discussion the Panel was constantly hindered by a lack of basic
statistical information about hooligans and hooliganism. As a result it cannot be claimed that it has achieved
a thorough understanding of the nature of the problem or of its extent. It appears that much of the data needed
might already be available in police records, but not in a readily accessible or systematised form. While this
is not a recommendation for research as such, the Panel feels that a routine system of collecting information
from police forces in England and W ales about football hooliganism should be established.”

   5.25 A lthough th at recom m endation was m ade in 1977 no serious attention appears to have been paid
to it. Recently, however, the Football Association wrote to all Football League Clubs in England and
Wales: “ W e at The Football Association are monitoring the problems of various Clubs and trying to ensure
that where potential problems exist a Club is forewarned. Some form of information service is therefore
necessary to enable us to provide meaningful help to Clubs and, for this reason, we would ask you to give us
a report on your home matches equally with reference to the visiting supporters.” Albeit late in the day, this
is a helpful approach and to be encouraged. It is still vitally im portant th at the police and the clubs should
get together so that henceforth it is possible for the clubs to obtain statistics on the num ber o f arrests and
the nature of the offences which occur on their property.

  5.26 The figures of arrest at the twelve London clubs, over the last ten years are interesting. In 1975-76
there were just under three arrests per 10,000 spectators. They went up to four in 1976-77. down to three
again in 1978-79. up to five in 1980-81, down to four in 1982-83 and is now on the way up again. Professor
Canter, a consultant to my Inquiry says: “ The general trend is clearly upwards. Overall the ratio is increasing
but what is also noticeable is that there appears to be a 4 to 5 year cycle, the troughs of which do seem to
coincide with World Cup years.”

  5.27 Professor C anter has also looked at the casaulties at a ground to see whether their number is in
proportion to the arrests and ejections: he concludes th at there is a direct relationship between the num ber
of incidents and the num ber of casualties.

   5.28 H is conclusion is: “ Taken altogether, the figures show an increasing trend towards violence necessitating
arrest or ejection. They also show that the violence linked to these arrests appears to be linked to casualties.
Those Clubs, especially in the major cities th at attrac t larger followings, appear to have more violent incidents
associated with their matches and these appear to be typically, although not solely, at games that a ttract
larger crowds” .
 ’Public Disorder and Sporting Events: The Sports Council/Social Science Research Council 1978.


                                                               51
  5.29 “The thesis that some clubs and special matches are the prime focus of acts of violence is supported
by these figures. Discussions with police and other researchers argue this too. Our figures do corroborate these
generally held views to some extent.”

   5.30 “ But there is an im portant caveat. Few Clubs are without incident during a season, so to ‘blame’ a few
clubs is to ignore the widespread pattern. Further, whatever the threat of ‘away’ supporters, ‘home’ supporters
are not completely innocent.” Professor Canter says: “ Two other comments follow from these findings. The
first is that it is possible to identity patterns to incidents from available data provided that enough data is
collated together. Secondly, this being the case, the football authorities (as well as the Police) can tackle the
clubs directly whose supporters are frequently associated.”

   5.31 The point is made however that differences between clubs are enormous. Professor C anter says: “It
is clear that each club has its own ethos. The question is thus raised whether this might relate to aggressive
acts as indicated in arrests.” The arrest levels at the Tottenham Hotspur and M illw a ll grounds have
remained fairly constant over this time, at between three and four arrests per 10,000 spectators while at
Chelsea it has fluctuated from two or three per 10,000 from 1975-79 to between seven and eight per 10,000
today.

  5.32 A team o f sociologists at the University o f Leicester who have made a special study o f hooliganism,
say: “It is not our contention that, because hooliganism a t football matches can be shown to be deeply rooted
in the British past, it has therefore been entirely unchanging in its forms, contents and consequences. Among
the factors at work shaping the specific character of the ‘football hooligan phenomenon’ since the late 1950s
have been:
     1.    the structural changes that have occurred in the ‘rough’ and ‘respectable’ sections of the working class,
           and in relationships between them;
     2.    the rise o f a specifically teenage leisure market;
     3. the increased ability and desire of young fans to travel to away matches on a regular basis;
     4. changes in the structure of the game itself;
     5. specific attem pts by the Football Authorities to curb hooliganism and, above all, the involvement of
        central government in this process;
     6.    changes in the mass media, above all the advent of television and emergence of me tabloid’ press with
           its competition-generated and commercially-orientated concept of newsworthiness;
           and
     7. finally, the recent virtual collapse of the youth labour-m arket.”

   5.33 In our view, these features, which are all in some sense at least historically specific have made a
significant contribution to the form, content and extent o f football hooliganism since the 1950s.

  5.34 Almost everyone to whom I have spoken both in the football world, in the Dress and the media
generally, in the police and in the academic world, agrees that the amount o f violence which is related to
soccer, has increased; the statistics also tend to support this view. A distinction needs to be made, however,
between violence which occurs inside the ground and violence which occurs outside the ground. There is a
good deal o f evidence that as the art o f controlling a crowd within the ground increases and the physical
constraints are improved, so the problem is simply transported from inside to outside the ground.

   5.35 This may be a matter o f congratulation and pleasure to the football clubs and to those who have
inside the ground but it is not much consolation to spectators when going to or from the ground or to the
ordinary citizen going about his lawful business in the streets o f the town where the football match is being
played.

Characteristics of the hooligan
  5.36 W ho then are these hooligans and why do they behave as they do? A good deal o f w ork has been
done by sociologists and others in an attempt to answer this question. The Sports Council R e p o rt1 says:
“ There is a substantial body of literature describing and analysing the sub-culture of violence which is followed
by young men in the lower classes of many societies . . . It is a culture which values additional masculine
virtues of courage and skill in fighting, of heavy drinking and exploitative sex; of loyalty to other members of
'I b i d                                                              _ _ _ _ _ _ _



                                                                 52
the group and control over local territory. It would appear that the core members of fan groups are drawn
from communities where those values still hold and these values are reaffirmed and given a new location in
football hooliganism. These values have not only been challenged by alternative values held by other classes
in Britain but by the emergence of new youth cultures with which they come into conflict.”

  5.37 “The sub-cultural violence has found a new location in football. Football has created new heroes who
exemplify its values and extend its territories well beyond the local street, cafes and public houses.”

  5.38 The Report goes on: “ W hatever the experts are likely to say about the natural aggressivity of young
males and the way this is released in crowd situations, those who have to deal with the problem of football
hooliganism, whether the police or the management of the clubs, believe that in some way it reflects on the
breakdown of authority in modern Britain, and the ineffectiveness of home, school and churches in bringing
up children.”

  5.39 “They believe it is society’s problem and represents the consequences of a permissive society. There is
a sense in which it may be society’s problem but a different explanation might be offered. We have already
drawn attention to the nourishment which football hooliganism draws from certain elements in traditional
working class culture; the value it places on masculinity, violence and loyalty. These elements far from being
the result of social change are extremely resistant to it. There are however important changes taking place in
British society which may bear upon any long term solution to the problems of football hooliganism.”

   5.40 The Sports Council R eport points out that there is nothing new about violence in the young: “ Gangs
of young adolescents who are alienated or in direct revolt against society are not a new phenomenon. The
post-war years have seen the rock and roll riots of the Teddy Boys, the Mods and Rockers, the Skinheads
and the Bovver Boys. All seem to be seeking a distinct identity for themselves by special clothes, a feeling of
solidarity by concerted actions and a sense of being wanted through companionship. Football fans are in a
similar mould. They seek ‘male bonding’ because they are in a critical gap between the stage of detachment
from family dependence— if they ever enjoyed this fully— and the stage of marriage. This is a simpler
explanation than the claim that they retain vestigial traces of instinctive hunting behaviour from their
evolutionary forebears, although the latter is as difficult to falsify as it is to prove.

   5.41 “ They not only seek each other’s company, but are pressed into it by a society whose structure does
not offer them much in the way of alternative affiliations. So we see young males ‘moving around’ together in
varying degrees of mutual dependance from the occasional ‘meeting up’ to the closely knit gang. If masculinity
and aggression (let us not forget spontaneous wit and mutual loyalty) are values adopted by these groups, it
is the understandable consequence of a socialisation which shapes the need to acquire these qualities as a mark
of manhood.”

    5.42 “The football match turns out to be a natural arena for the rehearsal of these qualities and for the
 strengthening of bonds with each other. It offers an acknowledged meeting place, a carnival atmosphere and
 exciting contrast to the drabness of the workaday week. But principally it offers scope for belonging to a
 loosely constructed group, a gang or a clique; for assuming a role and taking part in the action. For a fan
 group has an explicit shared aim although it may not be held with the same degree of conviction by all
 members. It is that the team should win. The aim is victory. This objective, to support a team and in so doing
 help it to win, far from being reprehensible in our society is generally regarded as desirable.”

   5.43 One o f the Leeds United supporters to whom I spoke expressed it in this way. He said he would
 rather see his side win a boring game by 1-0 than see an exciting game which his team lost 5-4. W inning is
 everything. Losing is nothing.

 W hy football particularly?
    5.44 The report continues:
 “ W e still have to ask, however, why football support to a much greater degree than other sports provides a
 situation that is so primed that it sometimes erupts into disorder.”

    5.45 “ Some of the differences between football and other sports can be spelt out in greater detail. It is
 im portant to emphasise th at no single feature but only a combination will suffice to portray the football match
 as a situation with a potential for extreme behaviour.”

    5.46 “ 1. There is a very strong belief that the presence of large numbers of supporters spurs a team to
 g reater effort. It is also widely felt that if this presence can be made explicit by shouting and chanting the


                                                        53
effect will be th a t much greater. I t is partly for this reason that organised supporters and fan clubs are strongly
encouraged by management and why teams are expected te perform better on their home te rrito ry .. . . The
belief in clamourous support does not obtain in all games and the differences are not merely accidental. Football
is a continuous physical activity that proceeds so rapidly that each action seems almost a reflex. It does not
require the concentration or ‘cerebration’ of a chess match or a golf tournament, where the players’ moves are
invariably accompanied by a hush on the part of the spectators and not by shouting. It is in general accord
with research on social facilitation and ‘audiences’ that support can induce ‘arousal’ and hence more physical
effort but th at for tasks requiring careful thought at the time when the action is carried out, audiences are
distracting and counterproductive.”

        “ 2. There are only two parties to a football match, for the entire event. The competition is completely
polarised; if one team wins, the other loses and there is no fine gradation of awards. The same applies to the
supporters. They are in direct and simple opposition and this implies also that each side is united within itself
into a huge collectivity for the purposes of direct competition with the other side. This competition does not
end with the match - there are traditional enemies, old scores to settle and reputations to attack or defend and
the frequency of the meetings reinforces the partisanship.”

        “ 3. The game itself includes a fast moving series of direct physical confrontations as well as cooperative
movements between team members. The spectators can readily identify with these movements, both individually
and collectively because all the action can be seen by the whole of the audience at the same time. They can
follow and respond to the shifting fortunes and experience vicariously the often aggressive encounters. Quite
often the outcome is unpredictable up till the closing minutes.”

          “4. A strong sense of ‘involvement’ or identification with what is happening on the field of play, whether
it is a clash o f individuals or a team movement, arises from the fact (relatively unique to football) that a high
proportion of the spectators have played the game themselves through the early years of their lives or are still
playing.” I have to say that I question this view. I am by no means sure that such a high proportion o f
football supporters have in fact played the game to the extent suggested and I am equally doubtful that in
other games like rugby union and cricket the proportion o f spectators who themselves have played or are
playing is necessarily less than at football.

         “ 5. An additional factor to combine with the preceding ones to further delineate football is its strong
basis in working class culture. Football is still an institution that is distinctly working class. The terraces at
big matches have become obvious and prt ninent places for proudly displaying and emphasising class values
and this process is of course mutually re-inforcing. It is readily observed not only at the cultural but also at
the individual levels. Some social scientists say that aggression is more encouraged in the social upbringing of
working class children but more heavily punished when it is employed and that punishment further reinforces
its use because it is itself aggression and administered J>y a revered model ie the parent. In middle class
upbringing, physical forms of aggression are less encouraged as acceptable social behaviour and they also
receive less punishment when they are deployed.”

         “ 6 . The alignment of football teams is territorial . . . the large majority of supporters are drawn from
a fairly localised territory. Unlike middle J a s s people, whose attachment is more likely to be temporary and
whose lives are more mobile, working class youths and adults have a very strong attachment to place” . . .

   5.47 The report continues: “ It may be noted that we have not so far referred to the possibility of frustration
which in one of the main theories of aggression is regarded as a main instigator. In football hooliganism, it is
doubtful if it adds much strength to the explanation. If some young people are frustrated by unemployment
and the many social deprivations to which they are exposed, this is a chronic condition and not something that
is acutely experienced at football matches. Indeed, the reverse is more likely. It may, however, be argued that
the fan groups’ major aim is frustrated if its team is defeated or one of its members unfairly treated, and that
this frustration intensifies if the fans are prevented by the police and by the layout of the Ends from correcting
the injustice of humiliation.”

   5.48 Finally the Report says: “ It must be re-emphasised that none of the conditions we have outlined are
enough by themselves to distinguish football from similar spectator sports such as rugby union and league,
American baseball and football and ice hockey and so on. However, when taken in combination they amount
to a formidable set of predisposing characteristics. It must follow that if action is to be taken to minimise the
undesirable consequences of football, it must be taken at many points. There cannot be a single panacea.”

  5.49 The reference to Rugby League points a contrast between the atmosphere at that sport and at
association football. I was able to watch a Rugby League club game attended by 12,500 spectators. There


                                                          54
were no perim eter fences. There was no form o f segregation. There were no incidents. Only som e 20 police
officers were on hand. T here were large num bers o f women and children present; the afternoon was an
enjoyable d ay o u t for everyone. On the previous day when England played New Zealand, however,
policemen had h ad to go on to the pitch to so rt out players who were fighting am ong themselves.

  5.50 Professor C anter in his R eport to me said: “ The general concern with violence, at and around football
matches, has been the reason for a great many official and technical reports and a number of studies. From
these examinations some general explanations of violence at football matches have been put forward. These
explanations do carry implications for crowd safety and control.”

   5.51 “ The following hypotheses have been put forward to explain violence at and around football matches.
As will be apparent the different hypotheses are not necessarily competitive or mutually exclusive, although
they do carry differing implications for control.”

  5.52 T h e various explanations identified by Professor Canter are these:

 “ 1. Violence is a conscious deliberate activity sought after by particular organised groups.
   2. Particular football clubs have attracted a membership that contains small numbers of supporters groups
       that are especially prone to violent behaviour.
   3. W atching football can be an intensely rowdy activity. Under given physical or emotional circumstances
       notably on the terraces and at im portant major matches, this rowdyism will burst into violence.
   4. Violence is a direct product of uncontrolled confrontation between rival groups of fans.
   5. Football hooliganism is a quasi-political reaction by unemployed disaffected youth against an uncaring
       society and against Clubs more interested in their players than in their supporters.
   6 . M ost aggressive behaviour among football supporters is essentially ritual not intended to lead to actual
       acts of violence. It only evolves into violence when the ritual breaks down say due to misunderstanding
       by the supporters or the police.”

The “ new” hooligan
  5.53 M a n y responsible organisations and individuals I have spoken to in the course o f my Inquiry
expressed serious concern about the rise o f what they saw as a new breed o f football hooligan. The Leicester
sociologists say:1

“ In our research we have been particularly interested in what the football hooligans themselves and other
young fans call ‘fighting crews’ specially those of the ‘super hooligan groups’ which have evolved in recent
years at some of the larger clubs. . . . One of their main distinguishing marks is the fact that they do not
travel to matches on ‘football specials’ and official coaches but tend instead to use regular coach or rail services
or cars and hired vans. They also eschew the forms of dress, the scarves and favours (also the club banners)
that still tend to be widely associated with football hooligans in popular opinion. One of their main objectives
in attending matches is to confront and fight opposing fans and to ‘take their end’. Fans of this kind travel
without identifying colours in order to avoid advertising themselves too soon to rival fans and the police.”

   5.54 The way they operate was graphically described in a recent trial at the Old Bailey before Judge
H illiard.

  5.55 On the day o f the offence Chelsea were due to play Cambridge United Football Club at Cambridge.
A large police operation had been mounted involving over 400 officers. Chelsea supporters had. apparently,
on a previous visit to Cambridge caused damage to property and possibly to other persons. A number o f
Cambridge supporters, about 60-80 young men, gathered at a public house. There was no trouble in the
public house because police officers visited from time to time. It is clear, however, that look-outs had been
posted so that they could give warning not only of the approach o f Chelsea supporters but also o f the
police.

  5.56 The leader o f the group was known as the “ General". H e had been subject to a life ban from
Cambridge U nited Football Club from N ovem ber 1983.

  5.57 Some time about midday, a group o f about 50 youths were seen running from the direction o f the
public house. They were carrying weapons in the forms o f bottles or stones. A local resident realised they
'Dunning, M urphy and Williams: “ Spectator Violence at Football Matches: towards a sociological explanation". British Journal of
Sociology, forthcoming 1986.


                                                               55
were hunting or hounding Chelsea supporters. He could h e a r the sound o f bottles being broken and glasses
being tram pled into the ground. The Cam bridge supporters proceeded to am bush and then attack tfaae
Chelsea supporters.              •*

   5.58 One o f the accused was asked what he had against Chelsea supporters. H e said: “ They’re animals.”
A n d when asked what he got out o f it he said: “ It’s a bit of excitement. W hat is there in Cambridge for
young people. . . . The bastards give you a good hiding up there anyway. W hat Cambridge needs is something
like a M ecca.” One o f the other youths said: “ I have been depressed for some time now and I formed the
opinion that if I was going to take my aggression out on anybody I may as well have one with football
supporters. I knew the people in there— [the public house]— would be looking for trouble.”

  5.59 One o f the accused said: “ I knew there would be      trouble because other years when that many people
meet, it always leads to trouble, and it was obvious from     the talk in the pub that some people were intent on
getting Chelsea fans on their way to the ground.” A n d        another said: “ It was obvious what was going tc
happen . . . when those teams are in town a lot of kids go    out looking for trouble.”

    5.60 The Judge said this: “ Now in this case a group of youths and young adults at different times and
 varying, according to estimates, between 30 and 150 took part in attacks on Chelsea supporters between noon
 and 2 pm . . . The final exit from [th e public house], about 2 pm was a determined and cunning attack by
 about 80 people. At a nearby road junction the mob split into two parts and each part then approached the
 main Newmarket Road by separate side roads, thus trapping Chelsea supporters and ordinary members of the
 public going to the football ground. The site for this was carefully chosen to permit of no escape, the main
 road at that point having iron railings upon the entire length of the centre reservation. Sticks, pool cues, bottles
'and glasses were carried as weapons by some of those in both groups, and were used on those caught in the
 pincer movement. Some Chelsea fans escaped by jumping over the railings. One who failed to make it was hit
 over the head with a bottle and jabbed in the neck with a broken end, severing an artery, and might well have
 died but for skillful first-aid by a police officer and good medical attention. Another young man had his jaw
 broken in three places, merely for being in the way, and was kicked and beaten to the ground in front of
 ordinary men and women who were helpless to intervene.”

   5.61 “This was organised, pre-planned violence which endangered life. An experienced policeman said it was
the worst series of indicents he had seen in ten years, and there were a number of other incidents involving
groups of youths attacking single youths with feet and fists and weapons— too many to mention.”

   5.62 O f the leader, who was sentenced to five years imprisonment, the Judge said: “ An intelligent and
reasoned letter which I have read shows that you have some insight . . . It also shows that you are articulate,
fluent and persuasive in a high degree.”

   5.53    M a n y o f the accused did not fall into the so-called “ rough” working class category. One, who was
sentenced to ten months imprisonment, was described by the Judge as having a good work record and
attractive references. Another who had no previous convictions was described by a probation officer as
being a very decent young man. O f another it was said by his employers, that he had worked well for them
and that his behaviour was out o f character. Y e t another, was a computer engineer; he was buying his own
home and he was engaged to be married. Another had previous exemplary character and had glowing and
unsolicited testimonials from neighbours. Another was a hard-working apprentice from a secure home
background. Others were described as being well-employed with good references, coming from good homes;
yet another was described as having an exemplary lifestyle, a committed Christian.

  5.64 An example o f the ingenuity o f the modern hooligan was given to me by one police force. One
group o f hooligans in order to avoid detection by the police on a visit to an away-match, hired morning
suits and travelled by British R ail having persuaded the authorities that they were going to a wedding.

   5.65 The evidence given to me also shows that one characteristic o f today's hooligan is that often he
quite deliberately does not take alcohol in order better to carry out his part in the planned operation and
to keep his m ind clear.

T he Scottish experience
   5.66 A study, sponsored by the Football Trust on crowd behaviour at football matches, was carried out
by a research team from the Centre for Leisure Research, Dunfermline College o f Physical Education (then
p art o f Edinburgh University) between 1982 and 1984, and was published in January 1984.
   5.67 It is clear from that R eport, from my discussions with M r C oalter (who was a leader o f the research
team) and from evidence which I received, bo th from the Scottish police and the football authorities, that
there are a num ber of significant differences between w hat happens in Scotland and in England.

   5.68 The Dunferm line study investigated three football clubs, namely, Glasgow Rangers, Glasgow Celtic
and Aberdeen Football Club. Overall they drew a num ber o f conclusions. They found: “ Scottish Clubs and
their supporters [were] distinct from those south of the border and as such [merited] study in their own right.”
They concluded that both Aberdeen and Rangers retained m ore traditional com m unity links and further,
that: “The relatively low level of commercialism and the rather more traditional, even populist, links between
the Clubs and their supporters mean that the various theories developed largely on the basis of English evidence
to explain the meaning and significance of the game to supporters (and in particular the roots o f football
hooliganism) appear less applicable in Scotland.” The study continues: “ In addition, soccer related violence
in Scotland is also distinct from that in England in th at it tends to be fuelled by sectarian antagonism. Some
of the forces which tend to promote and encourage violence therefore are well outside professional football
and have long historical roots” .

   5.69 One o f the significant developments in Scottish football has been the emergence o f the so-called
“ Casuals” . They were originally so nam ed because o f their clothing. They originated in Aberdeen probably
from copying the style o f some English supporters and have now spread to a large num ber of clubs. They
attach themselves to a club and adop t its name. They are bent on fighting the opposition fans in order to
enhance their own prestige.

   5.70 W hen I talked to M r C oalter he was som ewhat sceptical abou t the significance o f the “ Casuals” .
M r C oalter’s view was that they were com paratively unim portant, that the label was simply attached to
them by the media and th at they represented no m ore than a very small m inority o f football supporters.
The Casuals are however, in the view o f the police, a very real problem. They are well organised, appear
to have m oney and cause a great deal of trouble, particularly outside the football grounds.

   5.71 O ther evidence I have received from responsible people tends to suggest th at under whatever nam e
they use, the Casuals are a greater problem than hit! erto. They travel m ore widely, are very m uch better
organised and tend to seek out their opponents in areas away from football grounds like city centres where
the police are less prepared for them.

   5.72 The Dunfermline report goes on: “ Surveys at the three Clubs demonstrate that the popular stereotype
of football supporters as male working class adults is only partly true. Although still predominantly male the
survey has revealed that the supporters at three Stadiums were predominantly in the younger age group (under
30) in the skilled occupational groups, whether white-collar or blue-collar but with a significant proportion
from the professional and intermediate white-collar occupations.” The R eport points out a difference befween
Rangers, which attracts a high p roportion o f the traditions! or working class supporters, while at Aberdeen
there is a significantly larger proportion o f white-collar workers.

   5.73 The R eport continues: “ The analysis of the da** on arrests for football related offences confirms the
conclusions of the McElhone Report that the number of arrested per thousand spectators is extremely low.
Moreover a small number of matches account for a large proportion of the total arrests and a large number
of the arrests occur at games in which tensions are heightened by sectarian rivalries. The majority of offenders
are arrested for forms of vocal aggression and the types of offences commonly associated in the public mind
with hooliganism - physical violence, damage to property, pitch invasions - form a relative small proportion
of the total. As such it is argued that much of the disorder which does occur might more aptly be labelled
rowdyism than hooliganism.” The R eport continues: “ Seating and segregation have in combination contributed
to the reduction in level of crowd disorder within stadiums. The segregation of opposing fans within the ground
is regarded by the police as perhaps the biggest single contribution in the reduction in crowd disorder.”

   5.74 The Dunfermline Study goes on to say that while the problem of crowd disorder within stadia is
largely contained, “if crowd disorder occurs it is more likely to occur outside the stadium after the game.
Furthermore the offences committed outside the stadiums are more likely to be violent in nature than those
inside. Ironically while solving crowd problems within stadiums, an unintended coi.iequence of the segregation
of large crowds may be to provide the potential conditions for disorder outside the grounds. Segregated and
coherent groups may provide the basis for the continuation of forms of behaviour which while tolerated inside
the ground, quickly become defined as unacceptable outside. M any of the officers interviewed saw the major
issue of football related crowd disorder as being the inconvenience to local residents and damage to property
outside stadiums; however there was a recognition that given the random nature and geographical spread of
many of these incidents they pose a difficult problem to combat” .
Experience elsewhere
   5.75 The experience in Am erica and elsewhere is n o t substantially different. D r Goldstein, o f the
D epartm ent o f Psychology of Temple University, Philadelphia, reviews (in “ Sports Violence” 1), a series of
articles by distinguished international experts, indicating th a t aggressive sports tend to increase no t only
the aggression of those who participate but of also some of those who watch. The argum ent is th at fans
who get caught u p in outright violence do n o t seem to be psychologically different from m ost other fans,
but the one difference is that they are alm ost universally young men, some o f whom come to sports events
in the hope of a battle.

   5.76 On the question of the relationship between aggression on the field and aggression off the field, the
emerging view was that the particularly brutal and angry aggression that is virtually an integral part of
some forms of competitive sport increases the likelihood o f imitative violence am ong crowds dom inated
by young adult males. One o f the articles suggests, for example, that anonymity and excitement allows fans
to pu t aside m ore readily the inhibitions th a t would keep them from being openly aggressive in other
situations. Violence on the playing field then holds out to them an example they are m ore likely to follow.
D rinking adds to th at likelihood.

  5.77 In the articles there is also a good deal o f support for the view th at “ perceived injustice” is an
im portant cause o f m uch violence am ong spectators. Put another way a spectator who thinks his team has
been unjustly treated will react violently and aggressively. Certainly, anyone who has been present at a
football m atch is well aware th at the referee’s decision can give rise to considerable controversy, n ot only
am ong players on the field, bu t am ong spectators in the stands and on the terraces. Bad refereeing has
always led to problem s on the field because players are only too ready to take advantage of any weakness
they perceive, or alternatively to redress the balance o f w hat they perceive was an injustice by taking the
law into their own hands.

  5.78 There are, o f course, a great num ber o f well-documented outbreaks of violence at sports grounds
which have resulted from a disputed decision by an official. F or example on 24 M ay 1964 there was a
soccer match between Peru and Argentina. W ith two minutes left in the contest, A rgentina was leading
1-0. Pern then scored. However, the goal was disallowed by the referee because o f rough play. Fans broke
on to the field, the match was suspended, m ore fans crashed onto the field, the police fired revolvers and
tear gas and the crowd panicked. As a result o f the riot, some 300 spectators were killed.

   5.79 The various types o f disorders are classified in “ Sports Violence” into five m ajor categories. They
are:
       1. Frustration disorders They occur when spectators’ expectations of access to the game and the way It
          will be played or adjudicated are thwarted. Included in this is “ perceived injustice” when a source of
          frustration occurs as when fans believe that an incompetent or biased official has cost their team
          victory.
       2. Outlawry disorders They occur when groups of violence-prone spectators use sports events to act out
          their anti-social activities by attacking officials, fighting with rival fans and destroying property. Such
          crowd violence is seen as the work of a delinquent or criminal element.
       3. Remonstrance disorders They occur when a section of a crowd uses a sports event as an arena for
          the expression of political grievances.
       4. Confrontation disorders They break out when spectators from rival religious, geographic, ethnic or
          national groups come into conflict. Given the appropriate circumstances, smouldering resentment can
          easily spark into open hostility, so th at local Derby games where regional supremacy is at stake are
          an ideal setting for confrontation riots.
       5. Finally, there is what is called an expressive riot, which is the intense emotional arousal which
          accompanies victory or defeat, particularly if it is exciting or unexpected and uninhibited behaviour
          is then triggered.

    W hat is apparent from the above categorisation, it is said, is that no single control measure could cope
 w ith all the triggers o f disorder and that action which might be suitable for one situation could be
 inappropriate in another.        ____________ ____ _____________________________________________ _______

                                                                58
    Extreme Political Activity
       <5 80 There is a substantial body o f evidence that political activists are present at football grounds in
    F n i n d a to o u e h iTseems no t to be a problem in Scotland. Football grounds are used in order to recruit
    n ew rn en^ers and leaflets are passed out. There is no d o u b t that at football grounds there are a num ber
    o f people who belong to extreme political parties and they are there often in a group. Equally it is eviden
    th at some o f them take p art in the disorders which occur.

      5 81 There is also widespread evidence of the presence of small groups o f N ational F ro n t and similar
    supporters at football matches, o f the giving of Nazi salutes, o f the distribution o f literature and o the
    chantina o f racist slogans. They boast in their publications of these activities. Further, a num ber of t h e r
    supporters have been convicted o f criminal offences arising from the use of vio ence at football grounds
    But th a t does n ot prove the assertion th at it is they who are responsible for violence on the terraces. T he
    evidence whTch is available to me, from football clubs generally and from the police in all parts o f the
    country is that while they constitute a presence at a num ber o f football grounds where they recruit a d
    cause Trouble by racist chanting, there is little to connect them with organised violence. The considered
    view o f the police who spoke to me seems to be that their im portance at footbal grounds is a self im portance
    and th a t they are not a significant factor in the problems with which I am dealing.

       5 82 T hat is no t to say th at anyone, particularly those with memories o f events since 1936, should take
     a c o m p la ce n t attitude tow ards their activities. N o r is it necessary to approve o f the contents o f their
     m a g S n e s However in the search for answers to trouble at football grounds, it is n g h t that too m uch
I   im portance should n o t be attached to their activities.

f       5 83 This view is confirmed by the statistics in the repo rt to my Inquiry prepared by Professor Canter
f   He s d d - W ^ terracing is seen as the physical basis of violence, political activities are seen as the social
1   cause^ As w i t h V r r a c i femoving political'activity would not solve the problem of football hooliganism
     However it is im portant to identify the extent of any conscious involvement by such groups as the N ational
     F ront in crowd violence. W e therefore asked a question carefully phrased to see if there were any irec
     evidence for the involvement of political groups as seen by our respondents a n d if there was any difference
     between the clubs in this. After a general question on people’s thoughts we asked for any concrete evidence
                                    their o w experience.’ In effect we were asking almost one thousand witnesses
     throughout the ountrv whether thev could give anv first hand evidence to support the view that political groups
     I r S - l d in                       The question w a i “Do , 0 . think that o r g a n ic political gn.ups such as the
     National Front are involved in crowd trouble?” The answers were:
                                                                 Yes          No

        5 84 Professor C anter continues: “ When it comes to actual evidence the picture becomes more: hazy.
      Aithm.oh 162 of our resDOndents said thev had direct evidence of National Front involvement, closer examination
      Kveate ^ a t a number of thoM based that on media report, All in all, about 10% of our respondents ap„e»,
      to have first hand knowledge of National Front activities.’

        5 85 It is interesting to see what this ‘-political” group was actually doing. Professor C an ters figures
      show that 194 respondents had witnessed involvement and that 34 incidents involved either starting a figh
      S fi t o     H o S r Professor Canter reports that most o f those who said they saw fights were in fact
      quotfng media reports. The evidence o f these respondent makes it clear that the majority o f those involved
      were dfstributing literature, chanting or making gestures or displaying or wearing signs or symbols.


         5.86 This sample accords with the other evidence which has been presented to me.


                                                                59
Unemployment
   5.87 There have been a n um ber o f suggestions that unem ploym ent is the cause o f people being violent
at football matches. One m ight certainly expect it to be so. Those who have nothing to do to absorb their
tim e and interest are those m ost likely to get up to mischief; they have not the dignity o f labour and the
discipline o f the workplace. Historically, however, there is little evidence to support that view, nor is the
statistical evidence clear. Surprisingly, such evidence as there is, is to the contrary— viz the absence o f any
obvious increase o f violence in the 1930s when there was widespread unemployment; the increase o f football
violence in the 1960s when there was little unem ploym ent; the ability o f large num bers o f troublemakers
to travel long distances at considerable expense; the recent use of £ 1 coins as weapons; the wearing of
fashionable and expensive clothing; and the evidence relating to the employment o f those convicted. Nor
do any o f the football clubs o r authorities, o r the police, or the fans to w hom I have spoken give support
to the theory. T h a t a num ber o f unemployed behave like hooligans is undeniable— that they are hooligans
simply because they are unem ployed is not by any m eans clear.

M y own conclusions
   5.88 I m ust have read some thirty o r forty reports, studies o r books, where an attem pt has been made
to analyse the problem . I am certainly m ore knowledgeable on the subject o f football hooliganism. W hether
I am any wiser I doubt.

    5.89 I have h a d the op portunity myself o f attending a num ber o f football matches incognito. I have
talked to fans on the terraces and observed their behaviour. I have discussed the problem with Professor
C anter, with M r C oalter, with the Leicester sociologists, with groups o f football supporters, with the police
a n d football authorities and m any other experienced observers.

  5.90 I am o f the view:
        I   (a) T h at there has always been a group, albeit a small group who find violence attractive; who
                currently find the football ground a convenient theatre for their violence and the football match
                the occasion for display of their aggressive tendencies which on other days and at other times
                they will be exhibiting in public houses, the city centre or elsewhere. Their main target at
                football grounds is opposing fans. They choose to exercise that violence a t a football match
                for a number of simple reasons. The date and place of a natch are fixed; the nature of the
                opposition is known; its presence is certain, so is that o_~ the police. Their own support is
                known. Its presence too is certain. The battle lines can be drawn. Thus plans can be made well
                in advance for the particular acts of violence that they intend to create.
            (b) And while there is a good deal o f academic support for the view that violence was at one time
                the prerogative of the so called “ rough” working class that is no longer the complete picture
                today. A majority of today’s hooligans no doubt do fit into th it category, but some do not.
                They come from a variety of backgrounds, many have reasonable jobs and earn a proper living,
            (c) W hether they are motivated by the same reasons as their predecessors can only be a m atter
                of conjecture; there seems little reason however to believe Otherwise.
       II   (a) A second group imitates the first element I have identified. Thus those not particularly given
                to violence witness violence in others and see it being exercised, without let or hinderance.
                People expect the spectators on the terraces to behave in an aggressive way and to use foul
                language. It then becomes accepted and the norm and thus becomes a part of the pattern of
                life which would not be tolerated elsewhere. This knock-on effect can be seen in violence in
                the streets of our cities, unconnected with football.
            (b) The feeling of anonymity in the crowd gives rise to a loss of inhibition and self-discipline. The
                association with those of similar disposition, the enthusiasm and the partisan support for the
                team, which itself causes an atmosphere, all create a situation which can readily give rise to
                violence.

      III       Then there is a third group (not always separate from the other two groups) who cause iolence
                for a reason, either real or supposed. It may be an inability quickly to get into the ground; it
                m ay be the presence of rival spectators in a part of the ground to which the fans think they
                have a claim.

      IV        Finally there are those, the vast majority of spectators, who abhor violence and wish only for
                an afternoon of pleasure at a football match.
  5.91 W hether it is ever possible, by altering in some w ay the structure o f society, so that there are not
people to w hom violence is o f itself attractive, has given rise to considerable debate. There are, o f coarse,
very m a n y factors which cause a person to have a n aggressive disposition. Heredity and environm ent are
such uncertain barom eters o f interaction that it is too simple to say, im prove the environm ent and violence
will disappear. N either o f course should be ignoredc

  5.92 I have therefore sadly to conclude th at there has always been violence in the world and that there
always will be violence; and th at however close social scientists get to determ ining the true cause o f violence
on the football terraces, no complete cure can be prescribed, even for the very long term.

   5.93 I t is clear however th at there are a considerable num ber o f preventive measures at sports grounds
which can properly and reasonably be taken. These I have set out in C hapter 4 o f this R eport. By taking
p ro p er preventive m easures it m ay be possible to stop violence inside a sports ground. So far as violence
generally is concerned, I would like to be able to say there is a simple cure. There is not. It would be doing
a grave disservice to suggest otherwise.

Postscript
  5.94 I do not pretend th at my R eport can be all em bracing or provide a simple solution to a complex
problem . There is no panacea. There is no one solution to the problem o f violence. M ore particularly it is
to be hoped th at if violence within the football ground is contained, it will not re-emerge elsewhere. I
confess I do no t feel sanguine abou t that.

  5.95 I trust th a t by publicly canvassing the problem s which affect the game, both in my R eports and
during the course of the Inquiry and also by stim ulating discussions, at all levels, both inside and outside
the game, it m ay be possible for solutions to emerge so th at the national game can regain some o f its
form er glory. N o r should we ever forget the tragic events which gave rise to my Reports.

   5.96 A lthough this is my Final R eport, the problem s o f football will continue long after I have returned
to the m ore fam iliar and less turbulent routine o f my judicial duties. I therefore leave my task adopting
the words o f M atthew Arnold:

                                 “Peace, Peace is what I seek and public calm;
                                    Endless extinction of unhappy hates.”

           to the Belgian House o f Representatives o f 9 July 1985 ( translatedfrom the House o f Representatives
           document)

           Terms o f reference:
           The causes, circumstances and lessons to be drawn from the tragic events occurring during the
           Liverpool/Juventus match on Wednesday 29 M ay 1985.


           A G R E E M E N T S BETW EEN T H E TW O FO O T B A LL A SSO CIATIO NS (U E FA -B E L G IA N
           FO O T B A L L U N IO N (RBFA))

page 73* It should be emphasised from the outset that it was the British supporters who m ounted the
         disastrous charge into Section Z. They bear the main responsibility for the terrible events that
         followed and this must remain the case w hatever blame might be attributed to others for having
         aggravated the matter.

           There is absolutely no doubt but that the organisers, the RBFA and U E F A were familiar with
           the usual behaviour o f the English supporters. This is all the more clear from the fact that people
           were sufficiently concerned for the Brussels Police to send a representative to Liverpool to assess
           the situation. The gendarmerie, w ho were also invited, did not consider it necessary to send a
           representative.

           The Board o f Liverpool FC has m ade known th a t it took a num ber of precautions . . . The Club
           m ade reassuring statements confirming that its supporters were amongst the m ost placid in G reat
           Britain and that, moreover, the Club could identify all the ticket holders.

           The British T ransport Police representatives gave the same kinr* of reassurance . . . Moreover,
           the R B FA the evening before the match m ade statements to the same effect and confirmed that
           the m atch had been perfectly well organised.

           It is nevertheless true that despite the reassuring statements made by U E FA , who should have
           been and perhaps were better informed o f the realities o f the m atter and despite the precautions
           taken . . . some English supporters or so called supporters (a limited number, it is true) became
           a m urderous rabble.


           T H E O R G A N IS E R S O F T H E M A T C H

            (a) Organisation o f the match
            It is im portant to recall that the duty placed on the RBFA and, beyond them UEFA , was to
            guarantee the safety of spectators and in this context it was their responsibility to take the
            necessary precautions and in particular apply the U E FA rules. However, both the RBFA
            and U E F A seemed more concerned with financial and commercial considerations than safety
            precautions.

page 74     The ticket sales . . . got completely out of hand. It has been established that a large num ber of
            tickets for Section Z (a neutral zone where there should under no circumstances have been any
            Italian supporters) were sold to Italians . . . large quantities o f tickets were sold to travel agents,
            football clubs and others without their having been asked to give any written guarantee whatever
            th at they would not sell tickets to Italians. The sale of tickets at Heysel Stadium (theoretically
            restricted to five tickets per person) was organised in such a way that anyone, including Italians,
            could get tickets for Section Z w ithout any problems at all. This is in contravention not only of
            U E F A directives but also contrary to the arrangem ents agreed before the match. Such a procedure
•References to pages are to pages in the House of Representative   document 1232 (1984—5)/1—2


                                                                   71
     was bound to create a black market.

     The next point is the requirement to separate opposing supporters within the stadium. There is
     a specific U E F A ruling on this.

     It is clear that natural animosity developed into altercations, fights and charges; the third o f these
     had tragic consequences and could no doubt have been avoided had there not been so many
     Italian supporters in Section Z. It is clear that the ticket sales organised by the R B FA were a
     decisive element in this and they are to blame in that respect.

     This, together with the absence o f an adequate buffer zone . . . as well as the weakness o f the
     fencing separating Sections Z and X -Y , m eant that the safety precautions were even less effective.

     It is amazing that knowing about the significance o f the black m arket, the organisers did not
     w arn the forces o f law and order o f the potential danger.

     . . . It was decided to create an enclosed area around the outside of the stadium using Heras
     fencing. T he idea was in fact to operate a kind o f filtering procedure which would allow spectators
     to be searched as soon as they went through into the enclosures. In fact the fencing proved totally
     inadequate and in so far as it could be considered as much a psychological as a physical barrier,
     the fact was th at it could not fulfill this function. It would have been m ore helpful to have
     passageways o r gangways which could have allowed spectators to be shepherded.

     The way in which the match was organised testifies to routine and a lack o f seriousness. A number
     o f ambiguous decisions were taken . . . the R FB A preparations for the match were too informal:
     no prior agenda for meetings; no regular membership; no minutes. Even if it was only some o f
     the decisions which were ambiguous, it remains the case that, for example, failure to decide clearly
     how the gangways between the sections should have been set up and m anned was one o f the
     causes of the tragedy.

     (b) Lessors and owners o f the stadium
75   . . . The condition o f the stadium appeared dilapidated on the occasion o f o ur v is it. . . structures
     were deteriorating, columns, crash-barriers and steps. It is also clear that the terracing itself had
     been neglected and had not been the subject o f the kind o f norm al maintenance work which is
     required in a stadium o f this size. This m ade it easy for the supporters to obtain missiles.
     M oreover, the narrowness of the gangways and of the few entrances at the top of the stadium,
     as well as the fact that there were only three exits at the bottom , caused problems when it came
     to evacuation.

     These problems were exacerbated by the fact th at the lower gates could only be opened from the
     pitch side. According to the organisers and the forces of law and order, the intention was to
     m ake it possible for evacuation to take place in the event o f trouble while allowing the forces of
     law and order to intervene as necessary. . . .

     It seems surprising that the general regulations relating to safety at work should not be applicable
     in this instance. If this is the case, then they should be applied . . . certain basic facilities were
     lacking. There were only a few fixed telephones, which is inexcusable. It is essential that if
     gatherings on this scale are to be organised there should be an on-the-spot com m and post where
     the organisers and forces of law and order can meet. . . .

     It is reasonable to emphasise the responsibilities o f U E FA in this respect. In February 1985, the
     organisation was content to devote less than an hour to the inspection of the stadium and did
     not com m ent on its condition.

     The Authorities
     A. The local police
     Precautions made
     It is p a rt o f the duty o f the police to implement the provisions o f the document “ Crowd Violence
          at Sports G round s” . . . . This document, draw n up at the suggestion o f the RB FA , in consultation
          with the police was issued by the M inistry o f the Interior in the form o f guidance on the 17th
          February 1974. It would not appear that the police took any measures to implement the provisions
          o f this document. . . .

page 77   Specific preparations
          The police took part in preparatory meetings. . . . O n the occasion of these meetings, those
          involved apparently discussed all the measures to be taken at the ground as well as transport,
          the arrival o f the supporters, the sale o f tickets, liaison and co-ordination of the activities o f the
          police and the gendarmerie, all organisation o f parking facilities, organisation of emergency
          services and sale o f alcoholic drinks.

          . . . the emergency services were not specifically invited to these meetings, nothing was said about
          the condition of the stadium and again no minutes were taken setting out the decisions which
          had been reached during the meetings.

          . . . the reports on these meetings were drawn up in retrospect: there is no way to be sure of the
          num ber o f participants, their rank, their precise identity or what they said . . .

          The day o f the 29th M ay 1985
page 78   . . . There was fighting in the streets from the m orning onwards. This fighting was caused by
          persons under the influence o f alcohol. The police decided to limit their interventions in order to
          avoid m ore serious trouble. . . . N othing was done to curb the consumption o f alcoholic drinks
          on the public highway o r the sale of the same.

          One is entitled to question whether everything necessary was done to prevent the troubles which
          occurred later.

          Heras fencing had been erected around the stadium but this perimeter fence was n ot sufficiently
          well supervised . . .

          The police arrived at the stadium in good time, they were nonetheless unable to carry out a
          complete search o f the spectators because o f a shortage of men (only forty available). Confiscated
          items could n ot be kept away from the supporters because o f a lack o f containers. Efforts were
          made to compensate for this by collecting confiscated items by van.

          Fifty men were placed between Sections M. N -O but they were forced to retreat at about 6.30
          pm because o f the agression of the Italian supporters. The gangways were so structured that it
          was not possible to keep officers on the steps.

          The police could not prevent supporters from invading the pitch. Lumps o f concrete torn from
          the structure of the stad irm and missiles caused enorm ous problems. (27 police were injured).

          The police communications system worked well. The police did what was necessary to maintain
          adequate liaison with the gendarmerie.

          B. The Burghermaster
          The Burghermaster has a general responsibility to maintain law and order in his area and he is
          also chief of the local police . . . This applied as much in the city on the 28 and 29 M ay as in the
          stadium when the events took place.

          As to the condition of the stadium, this being the property of Brussels City Council, it was tor
          the City Council to deal with its maintenance and also to ensure that all the fencing provided
          was strong enough to serve the required purpose.

           C. The Gendarmerie
           1. The so-called advance measures
page 79    . . . So far as the document entitled “ Crowd Violence at Sports G rounds” which the gendarmerie
           adapted as a General Order, it appears that three points were not dealt with:
           Exam ination o f the ground,


                                                         73
     Structural liaison with the organisers,
     Need for inform ation teams to be set up at the stadium.
                               *
     N onetheless, in certain respects the General O rder issued by the gendarmerie was m ore stringent
     than the original docum ent . . . The gendarmerie took part in six preparatory meetings. It has
     been emphasised in this respect that aside from errors in the way in which these meetings were
     conducted, the fact that the interested organisations were not always represented by the same
     people undoubtedly led to decisions being taken which were not clear and in some cases positively
     am biguous. Nonetheless, the representative o f the gendarmerie did make a written record o f the
     meetings for submission to his superior.

     Despite the absence of minutes recording decisions m ade at these meetings, it can be seen that
     such agreements that were reached were n o t always implemented.

     If ju st before the m atch all those concerned (ie the organisers and those responsible for law and
     order on the day) had met a t the ground, this would have been the first meeting they had together
     (actually on site). This is an im portant point and to avoid any difficulties the organisers as well
     as the forces o f law and order should have ensured that such a meeting took place.

     In organisational terms, the Commission finds that the gendarmerie had draw n up a plan which
     took account o f possible incidents outside the stadium before the match, in the stadium during
     the m atch and outside the stadium while the supporters were leaving.

     . . . Both the football authorities and the English police had given assurances to the effect that
     the Liverpool supporters did not have a bad reputation in England.

     . . . the opening o f the ground at 5 pm and the num ber o f spectators involved did m ake it more
     likely th a t trouble would occur. The immediate cause o f the tragedy was also due to the fact that
     there were English and Italian supporters in Sections X, Y -Z which was impossible to predict
     given that Section Z was to have been reserved for Belgians.

     The provisions m ade were based on inform ation which proved to be inaccurate. The error lay in
     the fact that the arrangem ents were not adapted quickly enough when they needed to be, and
     this is attributable to four factors: the com m and structure o f the gendarmerie; 1, ck o f precision
     in the orders given; lack of messengers for the dissemination o f information within the stadium
     and the element o f “ unpredictability” .

     Reference should also be m ade to the fact th a t a less than peaceful atmosphere prevailed in the
     city the previous evening and this should, o f itself, have caused the arrangements to be reviewed.

     2. Numbers o f men deployed

80   The num bers o f men originally to have been deployed were greater than usual for i a international
     football match.

     . . . sufficient men were provided b ut the way they were deployed, both inside and outside the
     stadium, was ineffective.

     . . . it appears that the A djutant com m anding the squadron assigned to Sections X -Z had too
     few men to enable him to undertake the onerous task placed upon him.

     3. Orders issued by M ajor Kensier, Commander o f the Brussels District
     The generally imprecise nature o f the orders is most regrettable. Moreover, it would have been
     helpful to have barred entry to the stadium to supporters whose state o f drunkenness presented
     a risk. In these circumstances, he should have deployed more men in the stadium to allow proper
     control o f the safety zone.

     By 5.30 to 6.30 pm it was already clear that Section Z was occupied by Italian supporters and
     that their proximity to their English counterparts posed an immediate threat.

     The preparatory meetings had been understood in such a way that Captain M ahieu thought his
     orders were to keep the gangway between Section X and Y -Z clear.
          It should be pointed ou t th at C aptain M ahieu h ad n o t been invited to any of the meetings in
          question.

          4, Action within the sta d iu m .
page 81   . . . no m em ber o f the gendarmerie who participated in the preparatory meeting was present at
          the Heysel Stadium on the day o f the m atch . . . the Commission considered whether it would
          be ap prop riate to establish a com m and post a t the stadium or even two, one inside one outside.
          Although the Commission did not feel qualified to form a judgm ent on this, it considers that the
          point should be made.

          5. Divisions o f tasks within the squadron
          The Commission regrets that within Alpha Squadron there was no precise division o f tasks
          between the C om m ander and his deputy. It was obvious that at certain times both officers were
          together inside the stadium and at other times they were together outside the stadium.

          This was all the m ore unacceptable because o f the inadequacy o f the radio communications.

          The provisions o f messengers seems to have m ade up in some degree for the radio communication
          problem s referred to below but according to the witness, these messengers could not in any event
          fulfill their purpose because o f the density o f the crowd, t




page 82   6, Communications arrangements and equipment
          . . . num erous means o f communicating inform ation were provided.

          There were com m unication links between the Special Branch and the com m and post, and between
          the police and the gendarmerie both inside and outside the stadium. In addition to these, radio
          contact between police and gendarmerie was assured by liaison officers at HQ, the com m and post
          and at the ground. In the end, this adds up to an unwieldy system. Perhaps this is the price to
          be paid for trying to ensure that two separate forces, the police and the gendarmerie, worked
          together w ithout losing their separate identities.

           Com m unications between the Special Branch an d the com m and post did not operate well . . .
           the poor condition o f the equipment was mainly to blame. But it is also probable that the Special
           Branch was not properly briefed.

           At the gendarmerie headquarters, messages are recorded by a shorthand writer, who typed the
           messages as they were received. It would appear that the messages were recorded only selectively.

           Com m unications between the platoons and their commanding officer did not take place under
           ideal conditions; the Captain com m anding in the stadium went outside. No communication was
           possible with him thereafter and this at the very time when the tragedy occurred.

           Even when the radios were working, their effectiveness was reduced by the ambient noise level.
           The gendarmerie m ust have known this would happen. One must ask why messengers were not
           used for these communications.

           It is clear from witness statements that communications between the com m and post and the
           stadium were not operating properly . . . this means that at a time when it would have been
           useful to call in reserves, the com m and post was not receiving sufficiently precise information
           from the stadium.

           T hen are several statements about the state o f the equipment. General Bernaert said that the
           sets were good quality ones but that there was trouble with the cadmium nickel batteries. The
           batteries were old and, moreover, were not properly used.

              . insufficient attention was paid to checking whether those using the equipment were doing so
           in the correct manner.



                                                       75
            7. Problems with the com m and structure
 page 83    The com m and structure within the gendarmerie is open to question.

            W h at is the relationship between H Q and the operational commander?
            The theory advanced by the gendarmerie is th a t the operational com m ander is expected to know
            w hat the situation is and that it is not for headquarters to intervene at this level. This assumes
            that the operational com m ander believes he has sufficient forces at his disposal to meet the
            situation and that, should things get out o f hand, he would take the initiative in requesting
            additional m anpow er (or resources in the bro ader sense o f the word). This is w hat should occur.

            Asked whether in this case headquarters should have informed the operational com m ander of
            the situation since they had m ore inform ation about it than he did, the gendarmerie replied in
            the negative. This on the basis that at certain m om ents o f crisis it is necessary to avoid disturbing
            the com m ander by m aking too m any telephone calls.

            T he Commission would question this strict limitation of relative responsibility. The Commission
            considered that in any event if headquarters is aware that the situation is deteriorating then it
            has a duty to contact the com m and post rather than to wait passively for the operational
            com m ander to m ake contact.

           The com m and structure within the gendarmerie is also open to question in terms of the relationship
           between an officer in com m and and his deputy on the ground: where serious incidents are
           imminent, as was the case in this incident, and contact cannot be m ade with the officer in
           com m and on the ground, should not the m ost senior officer present be permitted to go direct to
           the senior command?

           The Commission wonders whether such a rigidly hierarchial system does not compromise
           operational effectiveness.

           D. The emergency services
           It is im portant to emphasise the effectiveness of the emergency service such as the Red Cross
           Fire Service, 999 and medical servicej etc.

           The Commission was nevertheless surprised to learn o f the existence o f a “ Disaster Contingency
           Plan o f which the Fire Service were aware b u t was not known to the other authorities, notablv
           the police and gendarmerie.

           It would have been useful to invite the Fire Service and the Red Cross to the preparatory meetings
           officially, whereas in this instance, when tney were present, it was on their own initiatives.

           B®y°"d the Pnm e responsibility o f the English supporters, the Commission discovered a series
           ot tailings, deficiencies and omissions which have contributed to the tragedy.
page 86    The Commission unanimously agree that it is an error to organise a football match (which should
           be a sporting event and a pleasure for participants and host country alike) if that event
           subsequently proves to require three thousand men to m aintain law and order.

           If such an event is organised in future which seems likely to require such a force o f police and
           gendarmerie, then serious consideration should be given as to whether or not it should be allowed
           to proceed.

Chairm an

W O R K IN G G R O U P O N T H E G R E E N G U ID E
   E l. Shortly after publication of your Interim R eport you asked me to establish a W orking G roup of
appropriately qualified scientifical and technical persons who had practical experience o f safety at sports
grounds to assist the Inquiry in its task o f reviewing the H om e Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(the “ Green G uide” ). As you know, and with the kind cooperation o f the H om e Office, Scottish Office,
D epartm ent of Environment, local authority associations and technical consultants to the Inquiry, I was
able to form such a group and this met for a full week (23-28 September) under my Chairmanship.

  E2. O ur terms o f reference were: “T o review the H om e Office Guide to Safety at Sports G rounds
(Football) - “ the Green G uide” - and to m ake recom m endations to the Committee o f Inquiry on Crowd
Safety and C ontrol at Sports G rounds as to am endm ents or additions considered necessary to the Green
G uide published in 1976.” A record of the membership o f the G roup appears later in this appendix.

   E 3.1 am pleased to be able to report that the W orking G ro u p completed its work satisfactorily and that
it was found possible on the final day o f the G rou p’s week to reach general agreement on the various
recom m endations for changes which we wished to see m ade to the Guide. I have since prepared a self-
contained note o f these points and have put the G ro u p ’s deliberations into the form o f recommendations
for you. This note is set out below for your consideration. I support these recommendations.

   E4. As you will see there are, in total, some 63 recommendations. This should not be taken in any way,
however, as an adverse judgm ent upon the current Guide. The substantive advice in the Guide stood up
rem arkably well to a week o f detailed scrutiny by experts and fully justifies the high esteem and confidence
in which it is generally - and internationally - held.

   E5. It remains only for me to record my gratitude to the members o f the G roup who gave up so much
o f their valuable time to assist the Committee in its task; to my fellow Assessor, M r Alan Goodson, foi
his encouragement, support and practical advice throughout the week; and to M r M ark de Pulford for his
excellent work as Secretary.

                                                                                        M A R T IN K IL L O R A N
                                                                                    Fire Assessor to the Inquiry


                                         R E P O R T AND R E C O M M E N D A T IO N S

            S T R U C T U R E O F T H E G R E E N G U ID E
               E6. The W orking G roup was dissatisfied with the structure o f the current Guide and recom-
 Rec 1      mends that the Green Guide should be reorganised so as to reflect more closely the needs o f its
            target audience. (The G roup agreed that the target audience o f the Guide comprises: (a) sports
            ground management in designated a n d undesignated grounds; (b) engineers, designers and others
            engaged in the improvement, design appraisal or refurbishment of sports stadia to certificable
         ' standards: and (c) local authorities responsible for enforcing the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act
         ’ 1975.) The G roup considered that, following a general introduction which describes the scope of
          ' the Guide, sets the scene and briefly discusses the nature and extent o f risks to the public at
            sports grounds, the guidance should be re-arranged so as to deal first with general management
            responsibilities and m ajor planning an d design matters. (Guidance on these m atters should, where
            practicable, include m ethods for assessing the general safety condition o f a ground and the need
            for detailed drawings and plans.) The succeeding categories o f detailed guidance should each be
            preceded by a statement o f the general functional requirement or aim and should include as much
            appraisal, flow and other diagrams as may conveniently be arranged. The G roup considered that
            a possible scheme for the categories o f advice in the Green Guide was: Fire (to include a checklist
            and appraisal flow diagram and reference to the need for professional advice). Structural Appraisal
             (to include a method for appraising existing structures and reference to the need for professional
             advice). G roun d C ontrol and G round M anagem ent (to identify responsibilities and duties), and
             Inspections, Tests and M aintenance.


                                                             77
 Rec 2      E7. T he G ro u p also recom m ends th a t consideration should be given to the production by the
          H om e Office, or other appropriate body, o f summary documents, training aids and seminars fo r
          sports ground management explaining the provisions o f the Green Guide and their application.

          IN T R O D U C T IO N

            E8. The current G uide is aim ed at soccer and rugby grounds (G G (Green Guide, 1976 Edition,
          paragraph): 1:1).    - ■


             The G ro up decided that m any of the recommendations in the Green Guide are relevant to
 Rec 3   ou td o o r sports other than football and recommends that the Introduction should say that the
          Guide is applicable as a code o f good practice fo r all sports grounds. The Green G uide should
 Rec 4   m ake it clear, however, that it does not cover measures to ensure the safety o f spectators from
         hazards presented by the sport itself.

            E9. The G ro u p noted that the references in the Guide to the Building Regulations for England
         and Wales would need to be revised and brought up to date. It was further noted that in Scotland,
         the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations gave requirements for the construction, alteration,
         extension and change of use of buildings, and included standards in respect of means o f escape
         from fire including emergency lighting, access for fire-fighters as well as structural fire precautions.
         The G ro up recommends that full account should be taken of national Building Regulations in
         the G reen Guide.

         ID E N T IF IC A T IO N O F PR O B LEM S

              E10. The current G uide discerns three particular types of safety problem to be considered
         'w ithin a football ground and its immedTate surroundings (GG: 2.1 to 2.4): (a) those physical
          hazards which may cause individuals to trip, slip or fall; (b) crowd pressures which may be built
          up in norm al circumstances (particularly on terraces and exit routes); and (c) crowd pressures
          which may be built up under abnorm al conditions. The G roup considered that this analysis was
          correct. However, it felt that the need to tackle these problems should be covered in a new self-
          contained section defining, in general terms, good safety design in sports stadia and enumerating
          other im portant needs such as m anaging and controlling crowds, maintaining effective fire
          precautions, m aking proper provision for the disabled and achieving a reasonable standard of
Rec 5     com fort and convenience for spectators. Accordingly, the G roup recommends the incorporation
          o f a new self-contained section on good safety design in sports stadia.

         G E N E R A L C O N S T R U C T IO N
            E l l . The current Guide recommends th at all components and installations should be designed,
         constructed, installed and m aintained so as “ to perform safely their required functions” and that
         they should be in accordance with good engineering and building practice, especially as set out
         in all revelant British Standards and Codes o f Practice (GG: 3.1).

            The G roup approved this recom m endation but felt that the reference to British Standards
         might be improved so as to identify those parts of British Standards which are wholly applicable
Rec 6    in the circumstances of the case. The G roup recommends that references in the Guide to British
         Standards should be improved accordingly.

            E l 2. The current G uide recommends that all electrical installations should comply with the
         current edition o f the regulations o f the Institution of Electrical Engineers (GG: 3.2). The G roup
Rec 7    considered that it would be reasonable in some circumstances for the enforcing authority to accept
         a certificate o f satisfaction fro m a chartered electrical engineer in lieu o f fu ll compliance with current
         IE E Regulations and recommends that the Guide so advises. The G roup also recommends a
Rec 8    reference to B S 5266: P t 1 in respect o f emergency lighting.

           E l 3. The current Guide recommends that all parts o f the ground used by the general public
         should have a minimum headroom of 2.4 metres (GG: 3.5).

            The G roup could find no clear foundation for this advice and, accordingly, recommends that
Rec 9    in respect o f headroom the Guide should simply advise conformity to appropriate building regulations.

               (i) A detailed annual inspection to ensure compliance with the Green G uide (G G : 4.1),
              (ii) A general visual inspection following each event for damage which might create a potential
                    hazard (GG : 4.2); and,
              (iii) Testing o f crush barriers in accordance with the G uide on installation and subsequently,
                    normally, at intervals o f several years (G G: 4.3).

                 Safe capacity of terraces

                    E23. The Guide currently suggests that the exits from each areas o f spectator accommodation
                 should be so designed that the spectator can leave that area in eight minutes or less (GG: 6.51
                      G ro u p concluded that this so-called “eight minute rule" was concerned solely with the effect
              — ° f cr0wd turbulence (arising from delays in evacuating specator accom m odation) on the rate o f
                flow , it was not related to emergency evacuation time criteria (see p ara g ra p h J2 below) an3~t!TF
                 U roup recommends th at the Guide should m ake this clear.


                 Terrace packing densities

                    E24. The Guide recommends packing densities between the limits o f 27 and 54 persons per
                 10m depending on the condition o f the terrace o r slope and on the extent to which crush barriers
                 conform to the Green Guide guidelines on spacing (GG: 15.4). Recommended flow rates from
                 the terraces are given a t paragraph 16 of the Guide.

          , The G roup concluded that the flow rates and permissible spectator densities in the Guide were
           satisfactory an d reasonable when taken as a whole and that they accorded with experience
    - 5 However, the G ro up recommends that flo w rate and packing criteria and their relationship ( i f
          any) with those criteria given in respect o f emergency evacuation and crowd turbulences should be
         je j_ o u t and explained more clearly in the Guide and that further advice should be given as to how
_         interpolation between the wide limits suggested in respect o f terrace packing densities m ay properly
  c    .       carried out. The G ro u p further recommends that consideration be given to the possibility o f a

                Terrace steps and viewing slopes

D                . E25' The G rouP was content with the G uide’s recommendations in respect of terrace steps and
Rec _ /        viewing slopes (GG: 7.4). The G ro u p recommends, however, that the surfaces o f terrace steps and
  ec -«        viewing slopes should be even as well as non-slip and that the wav in which the m axim um desirable
                gradient is specified in the Guide should be improved.

                Terrace gangways

                  E26. The Guide states that the aim in respect of terrace gangways should be to ensure that
                every spectator on a terrace is within 12 metres of a gangway or of an exit. (GG: 7.5). The Guide
                further indicates that gangways should be sunk.

                  The G roup felt that although these recommendations were generally satisfactory reasons
d       -in    should be given for the basic aim stated in paragraph 7.5 of the Guide. Furthermore, it would
    t.c _9     be preferable to state the safety objective behind the current recommendation to sink gangways so
                that it could be met in other ways. The G roup recommends accordingly.

                Division of spectator accommodation

                      The Guide currently recommends the division o f a ground into sections to prevent major
               migrations by spectators, and into sub-sections to minimise the sway and surge of spectators
               (OU: 7.6). The G ro up recommends th at the Guide should limit the annlimtinn nt
               segregation to terraces at Jootball grounds (See recommendation 57 below).          ---------------

               Crush barriers and other physical restraints on movements
fecJIO,           E28. The G roup recommends that the Guide should should explain that brick walls and similar
        structures lacking mass or tensile strength are poorly suited to withstand horizontal pressures and
Rec 31 that the G uide should strongly recom m end regular structural appraisal by appropriately qualified
Rec 32 personnel. T he G ro u p also recom m ends th a t consideration should be given to mounting a more
        detailed review o f current literature on the strength o f crush barriers and the effects o f the various
        types o f loading that m ight be applied to them (see also paragraph 16 above).

Rec 33        The G ro u p further recom m ends th at the aim o f the guidance on migrations be restated as “to
            prevent potentially hazardous m igrations" rath er than mass migrations as currently indicated in
            the Guide. (See also p a rag raph 43 below).

            P IT C H P E R IM E T E R F E N C E S
              E29. The advice on pitch perim eter fences in the current Guide deals mainly with the crush
            barrier aspects (GG: 7.9). Access to playing pitches and the need for “ anti-hooligan” o r other
            protective devices is however, referred to in the section on crowd behaviour (GG: 18).

Rec 34      The G ro u p recommends that the Guide should explain more clearly, preferably by reference to
         standardised specifications, the different functions p e rim e te r Jencing may serve and that appropriate
         cross referencing is incorporated in any future edition o f the Guide. The G roup further recom-
 Rec 35 mends that the importance o f allowing fu ll access to the pitch where this is likely to be used us a
       ' place o f safety in emergency should be made plain. (It was noted that Scottish Building Regulations
         required th a t protected zones such as stairways led to a place o f safety, ie a unenclosed space in
         the open air at ground level or an enclosed space in the open air at ground level with access (of
          defined widths) to an unenclosed space. A pitch could be accepted as a place o f safety only if it
          met that requirement. If, however, it was subsequently fenced off, circumstances could arise,
          under Scottish Building Regulations, where a change of use would be deemed to have taken
          place.)

             STA IRW A Y S A N D RAM PS
 Rec 36        E30. The G roup recommends that the current guidance on stairways and ramps (GG : 9) should
             contain appropriate cross references to advice on egress from the ground (GG: 6). The G roup
 Rec 37      further recommends that the Guide should advise that, ideally, the rising and going o f steps should
             be uniform throughout an entire escape system . A minority of the G roup felt that the m ethod of
             calculation for access to stairways (G G : 9.4.5) of the Guide was anom alous and should be
             reviewed.

              F IR E PR E C A U T IO N S
                E31. Guidance on fire precautions is currently contained in section 10 of the Green Guide. It
              covers a variety o f im portant matters including fire resistance, emergency lighting and fire-fighting
              equipment.

                 The G roup was not wholly satisfied with the general advice on fire precautions offered by the
  Rec 38,     Guide. So far as existing structures were concerned, the G roup recommends that detailed advice
              should be given on means o f reducing the rate o f fire growth in existing stands. The G roup believes
               that consideration should be given to incorporating appropriate references to recent work in this
               area commissioned by the Inquiry from the Fire Research Station. In particular, the G roup
   Rec 39     recommends that the Guide should emphasise the hazards o f developed fires breaking into spectator
               accommodation and the consequent need fo r fire separation under stands to be imperforate. In
   Rec 40     addition, the dangers o f fire spread across adjoining stands should be emphasised and half-hour fire
               resistance might need to apply to vertical sections dividing spectator accom m odation from other
               areas.

               Evacuation times
                  E32. On notional emergency evacuation times, the Guide currently recommends interpolation
               between 2£ and 8 minutes, with the higher figure applying where a stand is of non-combustible
               fire resisting structure and presents generally a low fire risk (GG: 8.3).

                 The G roup was satisfied that there was no case for reducing the      minutes lower evacuation
               time as recommended in the Guide. The lesson o f Bradford was the need for adequate measures
               to inhibit the rate of fire development and spread and to improve the efficiency of fire procedures


                                                           81
         rath er than to stipulate m ore stringent criteria in respect o f notional values. However, represen-       |
         tatives of the Fire Research Station felt that the 2£ minutes should be regarded as a maximum;              1
         they believed that although individual circumstances might conceivably justify increasing the               |
         figure, it was n ot currently possible to assign quantitative values to active or passive fire protection    |
         measures with sufficient precision to enable specific relaxations to be advocated in the Guide with          I
         any degree of confidence, A majority o f the G ro u p believed that the notional 8 minutes upper             j
         limit indicated in the Guide, although lacking any very clear or relevant technical rationale, was           I
         reasonable and should be retained. Nevertheless, it was the firm view of a minority including M r             \
         Platt that 8 minutes is too long a period to allow for the evacuation o f any stand under emergency
         conditions and that, although relaxation o f the 2£ minutes figure might be reasonable in individual
         circumstances, it would be misleading to specify an upper limit in the Green Guide.


            The consensus was that the enforcing authority should decide on relaxations in the light o f
         professional experience and individual safety circumstances o f a particular ground, but that the
Rec 41   G reen Guide should offer more guidance as to what latitude was permissible on evacuation times
         and the circumstances to take into account. In particular, the Green Guide should emphasise that
         escape routes should be designed or chosen so that they provide progressive reduction in difficulty
         or danger to people using them and regard should be had to the likely accumulation o f sm oke and
Rec 42   combustion products in those routes. The G ro u p recommends that consideration should be given
         to devising a more scientific m ethod fo r assessing the evacuation o f a stand under emergency
         conditions.

         Fire protection and fire-fighting equipment

Rec 43      E33. The G roup considered that there was currently insufficient evidence as to the value fo r life
         safety o f automatic fire protection equipment fo r the Green Guide to encourage trade-offs between
         such equipment and structural fire protection measures. Any implications that such trade-offs
         were permissible should be removed from the current Guide (eg GG: 10.2). A majority o f the
         G ro u p rejected also the idea that the Green Guide should suggest similar relaxations where
         managem ent expertise and vigilance were at a high level.

Rec 44     O n fire detection and fire-fighting equipment, the G roup recom m tnds that reference should be
         made to relevant British Standards such as B S 5839: Part 1, B S 5306: Parts 1 and 3 and B S 5423.
         The G roup considered that it was an inefficient and undesirable use of resources for m anned fire
         appliances to attend all matches.

            E34. On roof venting, the G roup felt that with some stand ro of configurations, appropriate
         venting and curtaining arrangements might offer a means of reducing the spread o f fire. It was
         agreed however that the science of fire and smoke venting was highly complex and that it was
         not appropriate for the Guide to offer more than a general reference to the issue. However, the
Rec 45   G ro u p felt that some advice on roof venting should be offered in the Green Guide along the lines
         of that proposed by the Fire Research Station in work commissioned by the Inquiry. It was
         agreed that the priority in the Guide was to recommend effective fire precautions relating to the
         early stages of a fire.

         Access for emergency vehicles

           E35. The G roup agreed that the G uide's recommendations as to access for emergency vehicles
         (GG: 11.30) were soundly based. It was noted that the Interim Report recommendation that
         vehicular parking be banned within quarter o f a mile of a sports ground (when it was in use) had
Rec 46   been made on a "where practicable” basis. The G roup recommends that the qualification “where
         necessary" should be added to the current Guide's recommendations on access fo r emegency vehicles.

         Hazardous materials

            E36. The consensus was that it was not practicable for the Guide to offer detailed advice on
         fire spread hazards associated with particular materials. Nevertheless, the G roup recommends
Rec 47   that consultation with expert fire advisers should be indicated in the Guide where substantial use
         of, fo r example, polym er seating is contemplated or o f artificial pitches where forw ard escape onto
         the pitch m ight be necessary. (See also recommendation 35 above).


                                                       82
           CO M M U NIC ATIO N S
            E37. The G reen G uide currently recommends that precise requirements for communications
         within a particular ground be determined after consultation with the police (GG: 17). The Guide
         goes on to give examples of the arrangem ents likely to be needed at larger grounds. The Group
         considered that this advice and the way in which it was expressed was generally satisfactory.
Rec 48, However, the G ro u p recommends that the advice as to central control points should not be confined
Rec 49 l o the largest grounds and that the Guide should emphasise the need fo r ground management and
Rec 50 responsibility to be centralised accordingly. The G roup also believed that it would be desirable in
       ' larger grounds i f public address system s perm itted messages to be directed towards specific zones
         o f the ground. The G ro u p recommends accordingly.

              E38. On emergency audible alarms, the use o f coded messages found little support in the
           G roup. The need was rather to communicate essential information effectively to the crowd. For
Rec 51     that purpose, a clear system o f communications covering all the various conceivable crises, including
           the fa cility to stop the event, should be devised in consultation with the emergency services. The
           G roup recommends th at guidance to this effect should be incorporated in the Green Guide.
           F u rth er study was required before pre-set formulae messages could be recommended in the Guide.
           However, it was clear that such messages should be in the active mode, that they should be
           directed towards persons from whom a response is required, and that they should be delivered
Rec 52     authoritatively by trained controllers. The G ro u p considered that there was a need for standard
           guidance covering the use o f public address system s fo r emergency purposes. The Group recommends
           that consideration be given to this.

           E39. The G ro up considered th a t the development and operational experience of closed circuit
        television (CCTV) facilities was too little advanced to enable the Guide to be prescriptive as to
        particular systems. However, it was noted th a t CCTV appeared to have significant value in crime
        prevention and detection and th a t it had a considerable role to play in aiding emergency
      "evacuations, police m anagem ent inform ation and crowd control. The G roup therefore recom-
Rec 53 mends that the provision o f C C T V systems should be encouraged in the Guide.

             E40. Advice on crowd behaviour is currently set out in the Green Guide in the form o f
           recom m endations o f an earlier w orking party on crowd behaviour (GG: 18). The G rou p recom-
Rec 54     mends th at the advice fo r management currently presented at paragraph 18 o f the Guide should
           be re-organised and expanded so as to explain more fully the major problems and principles o f
           crowd control and then go on to elaborate the various methods available which may be relevant
           in certain situations at sports grounds and o f the circumstances under which these might be
           appropriate (see also recom m endation (1) above).

Rec 55         E41. The G roup also recommends that the Guide should emphasise the value o f effective planning
           "before events, debriefing exercises and full liaison with the police, in order to predict and prevent
            trouble. In particular, the Guide should stress the desirability of identifying in advance, against
            the local historical background and known travel arrangements, the likely size and nature of the
          * crowd.                               ■                                :                ’

Rec 56        E42. The G roup further recommends that the Guide makes it clear that the responsibility for
           pre-planning and liaison lies with club management subject only to the point that the disposition
           o f operational police'resources is the sole responsibility of individual chief constables.

              E43. There was considerable discussion in the G roup of the segregation issue which, it was
           agreed, had m ajor implications for planning. The consensus was that clear differentiation of
           opposing fans (with ancillary facilities) remained the only viable and prudent course so long as
           crowd violence remained at current levels; and that the best way to achieve such differentiation
           was by spatial separation and physical containm ent of opposing groups. The G roup was anxious,
           however, that segregation should not be encouraged other than where local circumstances made
Rec 57     it absolutely, necessary. In particular, at the present time segregation should not be advocated fo r
           sports'other than sqccer. The G roup recommends accordingly. (See also paragraph 27 above).

R ec 58       E44. The G roup agreed that certain fire precaution's measures, fo r example plasterboard fire .'



                                                        83
          separation and fire protection equipment, m ight be vulnerable to vandalism and that certificating
          authorities should be advised to take this into account where appropriate. The G ro u p recommends
          accordingly.               '

            E45. On ticketing, the G roup agreed that this was no t an effective means o f crowd control
Rec 59   unless clubs ensured that their arrangements fo r the issue and allocation o f tickets were as efficient
         and effective as possible. The G roup recommends that this latter point be strongly emphasised in
         the G reen Guide.

Rec 60       E46. O n alcohol, the G roup recommends that the guidance on alcohol (GG: 18.4) should be
         ' reworded to make clear that an im portant objective was to reduce potential missiles and also that
           the police should be consulted over arrangem ents for the sale o f alcohol at grounds. A reference
           to the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985 was also needed.

            E47. The G ro up were content with the m aterial on police facilities given in the Green Guide
Rec 61   (GG: 17.8) b u t considered that the Guide should advise adequate vehicular access fo r the unobrusive
          removal o f detainees and secure detention rooms at appropriate grounds. The G roup recommends
          accordingly.

          O T H E R M A N A G E M E N T RESPO N SIB IL ITIE S
Rec 62      E48. The G ro up was strongly in favour o f the creation o f a new section in the Green Guide on
          m anagement responsibilities and recommends th at consideration should be given to this. The
          G roup considered th at it would be helpful if such a section could incorporate a form o f
          checklist o f necessary tasks organised under bro ad headings such as: Pre-planning for Emergency
     a    Procedures, Training o f Stewards and First-aid Facilities/Other Medical Provisions. A reference
          to the need for management structure to reflect such responsibilities, preferably including the
          designation o f a named individual to take responsibility for the proper execution o f such duties,
          was also highly desirable.

           E49. On the question o f the relative responsibilities o f the police and stewards, the G roup felt
Rec 63 . that the Guide ought to make it plain that it was the club’s responsibility to control and manage
         spectators in normal circu.nsiances and that the police presence (if there was one) was to deal with
         the law and order problems and provide support and leadership in emergencies. The G roup
         recommends accordingly. It was noted that there now existed considerable material on the training
         and deployment of stewards and siaff likely to be involved in emergency situations.

1. INTRODUCTION

Scope and status of the Guide
1.   This booklet provides guidance to ground management, local
authorities and technical specialists such as engineers on
measures for improving spectator safety at existing sports
grounds. It is a voluntary code and has no leaal force.

Background to the Guide
2.     Guidelines on measures for improving the safety of
spectators at sports grounds first became available on a more or
less comprehensive scale when the Wheatley Report on Crowd
Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1972. The recommen­
dations in the appendix to that Report were extended to include
fire precautions and means of escape from an emergency situation
such as a fire, and then formed the basis of the Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds (which became known as the "Green Guide"). The
application of those guidelines to football grounds over the few
years which followed revealed a need for the advice to be
amended in certain respects. Furthermore, since the safety of
spectators can be affected when crowds are disturbed by hooligan
elements, the recommendations of the Working Party on Crowd
Behaviour were incorporated in a new version, published in 1976,
which was aimed specifically at football grounds. Following the
fire at Bradford City FC ground in 1985 in which 56 people died, a
working party, established under the aegis of Mr Justice
Popplewell's Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports
Grounds, reviewed the Guide and produced a series of recommen­
dations which have been taken into account together with
comments from others in producing this revised and expanded
version.

Historical context
3.    Serious accidents at sports grounds involving injuries on a
large scale to spectators are fortunately few. But as demonstrated
by those at Ibrox and Valley Parade, and before that at Burnden
Park, the potential scale of death and injury at a crowded sporting
event is such that it is essential for ground management to take

  grounds. This applies to all sports grounds irrespective of whether             spectators in existing sports grounds and as such it attempts to

 ease of maintenance. All parts of viewing areas should always
 have a clear unobstructed view of the playing area and designs
 should take account of the need for effective stewarding, which
 can play an important role in controlling crowd movement (see
 Chapter 13).

 21.      Although controlling crowd numbers may serve to reduce
  some risks to an acceptable level, remedial work is likely to be
  necessary to overcome others. Obvious defects such as trip
  hazards (especially at the head of stairs or steps), loose or weak
  handrails on stairs, and obstructed exits or exit routes, should be
  rectified as part of the general care and maintenance of a ground.
  Structures should be sound (see Chapter 3) and inspected by
  suitably qualified persons (see Chapter 4). Design, layout and
  signposting of exits and exit routes require particular attention to
  ensure that they can safely cope with the number of spectators
i who will use them at the end of an event or in an emergency (see
  Chapter 6). Similarly, the condition of terraces or viewing slopes
  (see Chapter 8) and presence or otherwise of crush barriers,
  correctly sited and meeting the strength tests of this Guide (see
  Chapter 9), are important factors. Broken, uneven terracing causes
  stumbling.. Barriers not only serve to break up crowd pressures but
  also assist in controlling movement off the terraces by regulating
  the rate of arrival at exits to suit their capacity, and encouraging
  the formation of queues so that spectators arrive at exits in an
  orderly fashion.

 22.   Proper precautions against the risk of fire are vital (see
 Chapter 11). Good ground management is crucial in reducing or
 eliminating the risk. Accumulation of litter is a prime potential
 source of fire but can be eliminated by regular and frequent
 inspections, good housekeeping, ground maintenance and by
 taking particular care over the storage of flammable materials. The
 nature and type of materials used in the construction of covered
 areas and stands will strongly influence the safety measures

                                                                                                               11

 installations such as crush barriers (see Chapter 9) and brick/block
walls (see Chapter 8 , paragraph 103).

31. When walls, including perimeter walls, and fences are to
withstand crowd pressures, they should be designed to withstand
such pressures safely and allowance should be made for forces
simultaneously and independently induced by other factors eg
wind forces or attached installations.

32. All parts of the ground used by the general public, and
especially the exit routes, should have minimum headroom of not
less than 2 metres. Exit routes should wherever possible have a
headroom of 2.4 metres.

33. Precautions should be taken to prevent people from climbing
on to roofs, pylons, hoardings and other structures. Where
possible such structures should be fitted with unclimbable
devices eg stout barriers or close-boarded enclosures. Spikes,
barbed wire etc should only be installed above the minimum
headroom specified in paragraph 32 above and preferably at a
minimum height of 2.4 metres from the base.

 Spectators should be admitted at a rate which is compatible
 with the dispersal arrangements for them inside the ground.

 44.   Where admission to a ground or parts of it is controlled by
 turnstiles, these, by their number and location, control not only the
 rate of admission but, to a large extent, the dispersal of spectators
 within a ground to their particular sections. Turnstiles should be of
 such numbers as to admit spectators at a rate whereby no unduly
 large crowds are kept waiting for admission and yet at no faster
 rate than the arrangements for distributing spectators within the
 ground permit.

 45.   Dangerous overcrowding can be caused if spectators are
 able to force their way into a ground already full to capacity by
 scaling or breaking through boundary walls or fences or the gates
 in them. To avoid this danger such walls, fences and gates should
 be of appropriate height and strength, and hand- or foot-holds
 which might assist climbing should be avoided. They should be
 regularly inspected.

 46.   Contingency plans should be made to deal with situations
 where the available entrances at a ground have proved insufficient
 to stop unduly large crowds from gathering outside. This may, for
 example, include opening additional entrances, but local knowledge
 of the ground, crowd patterns and advice from the police should be
 taken into account in drawing up contingency plans. Larger
 grounds should have intercommunication systems and metering
 systems at turnstiles (see Chapter 12), and installation of a
 centralised computer monitoring system may be of assistance to
 management in quickly identifying particular areas of difficulty.

. 47.  The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass
 through turnstiles will depend upon a variety of factors; for 1
 example, the design and age of the equipment, the ability of the
 operator and the ticketing arrangements. The admission rate will
 therefore depend greatly upon local circumstances but in general.

to the pitch which could be manned by the police or stewards. A
walkway between the boundary wall and the terraces, which would
be solely occupied by the police, first aid and official club personnel,
has been found to be effective as regards safety and security. In
order to achieve this it might be necessary to remove one or two
rows of terracing and to protect the walkway from the terrace by a
continuous line of barriers, so designed as to discourage access to
the walkway except at authorised points. The access points from
terrace to walkway should be directly linked with the access points
from the walkway to the pitch. Where a walkway system is in use,
sliding gates may be installed at the access points from the
walkway to the pitch, ie where there can be no crowd pressure
against them (see Chapter 6 , paragraph 65 regarding the use of
sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the pitch is usually
unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing area.

area from the spectator accommodation but may have to serve
as a crush barrier, or in some situations as a barrier to discourage
or prevent access to the playing area except in an emergency.

214. The type, strength and height of a pitch perimeter fence or
wall will vary according to its location and required function. At one
extreme, at a certain type of ground or small stadium used by very
few spectators, there may be no need for a perimeter fence or wall
at all; or if such a wall or fence exists it may need to consist of little
more than a rail to mark the playing area. At the other extreme, at
some major soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd movement
forms a necessary part of the safety measures, it may be necessary
to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
circumstances (see also Chapter 14, paragraph 209) but allows for
access in emergency. Even at these grounds however specification
of the pitch fence may vary for different parts of the ground.

215. For most major stadia, whether used for association football
or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence will be required either to
prevent access to the pitch as mentioned above, or at least to
discourage attempts by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates
or other access points (minimum width 1.1 metres) should
nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency and, at those
grounds where a perimeter track is used as part of the exit system,
for the departure of spectators at the end of an event. Provision of
such gates or access points is particularly important to allow full
access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a
place of safety in an emergency. Such gates or access points should
be properly stewarded and clearly marked so that immediate access
to the playing area or perimeter track can be ensured.


216. If spectators can lean on the perimeter fence it should be
deemed a crush barrier and fulfil the conditions of height and

          which would contravene the terms or
          conditions of a safety certificate for the
          ground or for any stand at the ground.

      (5) No prohibition notice shall include
          directions compliance with which would

   T hese R egulations also differ from th e 1976 R egulations (as am ended) and the 1976
Scottish R egulations in that they refer on ly to sports grounds and not to sports stadia in

     HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 7/1986

     SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975: LOCAL GOVERNMENT ACT 1985

     Introduction
     1.  HOC 5 4 / 8 5 and 5 / 1 9 8 6 were copied to Chief Executives of
     Metropolitan District Councils and London Boroughs in view of the
     forthcoming transfer to them of responsibility in the Metropolitan /
     counties and Greater London for the administration_of the Safety of
     Sports Grounds Act 1 9 7 5 (SSGA).        The purpose of this circular is to
     advise successor authorities of the changes to the SSGA brought
     about by the Local Government Act 1985 (LGA) and to give guidance
     on discharging these responsibilities.           It is not intended to affect
     any internal or locally agreed arrangements which may be in train to
     ensure that all those who have an interest in securing safety at
     sports grounds are fully consulted.

     SSG A         1975
     2. The SSGA gave effect to the main recommendations contained in
     the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds which
     was prepared by Lord Wftea tley following the seriou 3 accident at
     Ibrox Park Football Ground in 1 9 7 1 .
     3.      The main provisions of the Act are:

             a.      A power, exercisable by the Secretary of State, to
             designate sports stadia with a capacity for more than
             1 0 , 0 0 0 spectators. Once designated, a stadium will require                                                  v
             a safety certificate from the local authority.                                                                        -

             b.  An obligation on the local authority to issue such
             certificates.




                                                 n-i rr*** ~dvZ.A                                                         d
        c.  A discretion for the local authority to set terms
        and conditions under the certificate with the object
        of securing a reasonable degree of safety for spectators.
        Safety certificates are of 2 kinds - firstly, the general
        safety certificate (the main form of control) and,
        secondly, the special safety certificate (for_occasions
        or activities not covered by the general certificate).

        d.  A right of appeal to the Secretary of State, in
        relation to the issue of safety certificates and their
        contents, the procedure for which is set out in
        regulations made under s. 6 ( 1 ) of the Act.

         e.  Rights of various interested bodies (police, building
         authorities or, in the Metropolitan county areas after
         "abolition", fire authorities) to consultation, access to
         grounds and information and to the appeals procedure.

         f.  An emergency procedure for   restricting the admission
         of spectators to a wider range   of sports grounds than
         those to which the designation   provisions apply, if the
         risk to spectators is seen (by   the courts) as justifying
         this.

         g.  Powers of entry and inspection to sports grounds;
         and prescribed penalties for offences under the Act.

A sports ground is, broadly speaking, any place where sports or
other competitive activities take place in the open air and where
accommodation has been provided for spectators.     A sports stadium is
a sports ground where   accommodation for spectators wholly or^
substantially surrounds the area used for the activities taking
place therein.

LGA   1985

4 . The c o m b i n e d effect' of s. 16 and Schedule 8 paragraph 7 of the
LGA is to transfer to Metropolitan District Councils and London
Boroughs the functions, duties and powers as the local authority
responsible for administering the SSGA in place of the Metropolitan
County Councils and Greater London Council.           A summary check list of
these responsibilities is contained at Annex A for ease of reference.

5.  Paragraph 7(3) of     Schedule 8 of the LGA redefines "local
authority" in England     and W'ales for the purposes of the SSGA as
meaning:

         a.  in Greater London, the London Borough Council or
         the Common Council of the City of London;

         b.  in England, in the Metropolitan counties, the
         district council;

         c.  in England outside Greater London and the
         Metropolitan counties, or in Wales, the county council

6 . In order to avoid any anomaly or duplication arising out of the
Metropolitan District Councils' and London Boroughs' responsibilities

          Transitional A r r a n g e m e n t s
          8    Under article 2 of the Local Government Reorganisation (Transitional
          Provisions) Order 1985 (SI 1985 No 1781), London Borough Councils and
          Metropolitan District Councils will acquire certain anticipatory powers,
          including powers in respect of safety certificates for sports grounds.
          The provisions of SI 1985/1781 were explained in DOE c i r c u l a r LGA(L)
          (DOE) 13/LGA(MC)(DOE)16 of 26 November 1985. _The Secretary of State
          takes the view that M e t r o p o l i t a n County Councils and the GLC are not
          empowered to issue new safety certificates or a m e n d existing safety         i
          certificates to take effect on or after 1 April 1986: SI 1985/1781
          therefore allows successor authorities to consider, before 1 April,
          applications for certificates to come into effect on or after 1 April.
          Successor authorities will therefore wish to ensure that they are kept
           informed of the progress of safety certificate applications or amend­
          ments to existing certificates now under consideration by the Metro­
          politan County Councils or GLC. Much of this information will auto­
          matically have come to successor authorities in their present role as
           building authorities but they may nonetheless wish to establish
           early contact with the current 'certificating' authority to ensure_a
           smooth transfer of responsibility from 1 April 1 9 8 6 without impairing
           the safety cover afforded by the certification process. In this
           context successor authorities will no doubt wish to bear in mind
           that applications for special safety certificates f orevents on or
           after 1 April 1986 may require advance consideration if a certificate
           is to be issued in time. Similarly, successor authorities will doubtless
           wish to be acquainted with any other action or initiatives currently
           in hand by the present certificating authority in respect of sports
           grounds in their area.
                                                               1
Guidance to the SSGA procedures
9.    A copy of the SSGA and the Regulations (Statutory Instrument^
1263 1976) are enclosed with this circular.                A detailed description
of the Act and its provisions is contained at Annex B. The Regu­
lations set out the procedures and time limits associated with
sa fe ty certificate applications and appeals.              These same regulations
also empower l o c a l a u t h o r i t i e s to determine fees in respect of
applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates._A
guide to the procedure for* the issue of a general safety certificate
is at Annex C. Similarly,, the procedure for the issue of a special
safety certificate is at Annex D.
1 0 . The following points are highlighted as being of particular
potential interest to local authorities:

     a.  Procedure under s. 10. Paragraph 21 of Annex B refers.
     Authorities may wish to note that this procedure can be
     applied to all sports grounds within the meaning of the Act,
     not just to stadia.  It is hoped that authorities will not
     feel inhibited from invoking the procedure, as necessary,
     where they perceive the risks to be such that urgent action
     is required to provide reasonable safety for spectators.

     b.      The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) (The

Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds

11.  The Final Report of Mr Justice Popplewell's Committee of Inquiry
into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Grounds was published on
16 January 1986 (Command 9710).  A separate Home Office circular,^
number 5/1986, was sent to local authorities - including Metropolitan
District Councils and London Borough Councils - on 20 January 1 9 8 6 ,
giving details of the Government's response to the safety recommend­
ations contained in the Report, and next steps.

O ther

12.  A list of designated stadia for England and Wales is attached at
Annex E. Management of those stadia in Metropolitan counties and
Greater London have been informed of the change in responsibility_for
administration of the SSGA and have been advised to copy applications
for special safety certificates or amendments to existing general
certificates to successor authorities (see Annex F).

 13. This circular is copied to Chief Executives of County Councils,
  Secretaries of 'the successor authority coordinating committees, and
  to Chief Fire Officers for information.   Paragraph.10 is of
  particular relevance.

       FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987:-
       XMPLEMENTATION OF PART II (SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS)

        Introduction

        1.    As foreshadowed by HOC No 42/1987 the Secretary of State has
        now made a commencement order under section 50(2) of the Fire
        Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act)
        bringing in Part II of the 19 87 Act with effect from 1 January
        1988.
        2.   This circular, together with Annex A, introduces the
        provisions of Part II of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the
        effects and operation of them. Advice on those provisions of
        Part I of the 1987 Act (fire safety) which are to be brought into
        force by the first commencement order is the subject of Fire
        Precautions Act Circular, 14/1987.
                                              *
        Implementation of Part II (Safety of Sports Grounds)

        3.   Part II of the 1987 Act, consisting of sections 19 - 25,
        amends the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) in
        line with the Government's proposals contained in the
        Consultative Document published in June 1986 in response -to the
        safety recommendations of the Popplewell Inquiry set up following
        the fire tragedy at Valley Parade on 11 May 1985. The main
        changes effected by Part II are as follows

        Section 19:- removes the distinction between sports ".ground” and
        sports "stadium" with consequential modifications to section 2(2)
        of the 1975 Act dealing with the contents of safety certificates.


        Section 20:- empowers the Secretary of State to vary the'
        designation threshold of 10,000 under section 1 of the 1975 Act.
Section 21:- precludes conditions in safety certificates
relating to police presence unless the extent of the presence is
reserved for the Chief Officer of Police.


Section 22:-   directs appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act to
the courts.

sections 23 and 24:- replaces the existing emergency procedure
under section 10 by introducing prohibition notices in the case
of serious risks to spectators; and provision to appeal against
then.

Section 25:- places a duty on local authorities to enforce the
1975 Act and to arrange for annual inspections of designated
sports grounds in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of
State.
                                                               I
4.   Annexes A and B to Home Office circular No 7/1986 which
gives advice on the 1975 Act should be noted as necessary and
cross referenced to this circular. Particular attention is drawn
to the latest guidance on the new procedure for the issue of
prohibition notices to deal with serious risks to spectators.
Local authorities are asked to copy all such notices to the Home
Office for information until further notice. To assist local
authorities to draw up a prohibition notice a suggested format is
reproduced at Annex B to this circular.

Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1987

5.   A copy of the revised regulations is also enclosed with this
circular. The regulations reflect the changes brought about by
sections 22 and 24 of the 1987 Act and lay down time limits for
appeals. Provisions on procedures for applications for safety
certificates, their issue, amendment, transfer and replacement
are incorporated in the regulations which also authorise the
determination of fees to be charged in respect of applications (
for the issue, amendment, transfer and replacement of safety
certificates.

Transitional

6.   Under the provisions of Schedule 5 of the 1987 Act any
existing court order made under section 10 of the 1975 Act
remains in force. Similarly any appeal lodged prior to 1 January
1988 and still extant on that date will remain subject to the
appeal procedures of the Safety of Sportr. Grounds Regulations
1976 (SI 1976/1263).


Resource and manpower implications
T.   The contents of this circular do not result in any cost or
manpower implications other than those arising from the
inspections to be carried out on designated sports grounds under
section 10B(1) as introduced by section 25 of the 1987 Act.
Circulation of Statutory Guidance under section 10B(2) of the
1975 Act on these inspections together with any supplementary
advice is being done separately and will cover, as necessary, any
resource implications arising therefrom.


Supplementary

8.   The information and advice in this circular and in Annex A
on the 1987 Act are given in good faith but it should be
understood that ultimately only the courts can rule
authoritatively on points of law.

9.   Any enquiries about the contents of this circular should be
directed to Mr D Macnamara 01-213 7338.

                                           Yours faithfully

ANNEX A TO HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 71/1987

FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987
Advice note by the Home Office on Part II of The Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (The 1987 Act) amending The
Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 (The 1975 Act)

Introduction
1.   The general background to the 1975 Act together with a
summary of local authority powers and functions under that Act,
and procedures for the issue of safety certificates is set out in
Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986 issued 7 February
1986 (taken from earlier Home Office circulars 150/1975, 130/1976
and 187/1976). This guidance should therefore be read in
conjunction with Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986
which will need to be cross-referenced.
2.   The Popplewell Inquiry set up after the fire tragedy at
Valley Parade concluded that the 1975 Act had worked
satisfactorily at designated grounds but recommended changes to
improve its operation. The Government1s response was contained
in a consultative document published in June 1986._ Parts II and
III of the 1987 Act implement these proposals and.introduction of
Part II as from 1 January 1988 is the first phase of this
implementation.
3.   The main mechanism for securing safety at sports grounds
remains the safety certificate. Guidance on safety standards is
contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (The Green
Guide) revised in October 1986. Local authorities are reminded
of the advice contained in paragraph 5 of Annex B to Home Office
Circular 7/1986 highlighting the need to maintain flexibility in
order to take account of the different circumstances at
individual grounds.
 SUBSTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS EFFECTED BY PART II OF THE 1987 ACT
 Section 19: Application of the 1975 Act to all sports grounds

 4.   Section 19, together with the textual amendments of Schedule
 2 to the 1987 Act removes the distinction in the 1975 Act between
 a sports "ground" and a sports "stadium” . As amended the
 provisions of the 1975 Act apply to all sports grounds as defined
 in section 17(1) of that Act. The secretary of State may thus
 designate any category of sports groand witheut first having to
 make an order extending the provisions of the Act to that
 particular class of ground.
 5.   In consequence of this wider power, section 2 of the 1975
 Act (originally formulated with "stadia" in mind, particularly
 football stadia) has also had to be amended, by section 19 (2) of
 the 1987 Act, so that safety certificates are no longer required
 to contain certain obligatory terms and conditions. The
 Secretary of State is however empowered to stipulate by order the
 contents of a safety certificate for any class of sports ground.
 In this way those grounds of a particular type, or pounds used
 fora particular sport need not be subject to requiasaents which
 woT&d &>e inappropriate to them.

 6.   A s there are no present plans to extend designation to other
 classes of sports ground it is not envisaged that as order under
 thas r»ew power will be necessary. The discretion ga*en to local
 authorities under section 2(1) of the 1975 Act means that with
the possible exception of clauses in safety certificates relating
to police presence (see paragraph 9 below) the contests of safety
certificates will not automatically require amendmeilE as a result
of the removal of the obligatory terms of section 2 of the 1975
Act, Safety certificates should continue to specify maximum
spectators; include terms and conditions as to sizc^ situation
of entxances/exits to and from the ground and parts •£ it
 (including means of escape in the case of fire or otfter
emergency) plus means of access to any such entrances and exits;
tenss and conditions should continue to require thosa entrance^
exits and means of access to be properly maintained       kept free
frc® obstruction; and terms and conditions should continue to
deal with the number, strength and situation of any crush
barriers.

7.   Section 19(2) also widens the regulation powers given to
the Secretary of state by insertion of a new subsection (1A) to
              ^ke 1975 Act thereby enabling regulations to make
different provision for different classes of sports grounds.

Section 20:   Designation of grounds — variation in qa&lifying
              spectator capacity

8.   Section 20 inserts subsections (1A) and (IB) in section 1 of
the 1975 Act to give the Secretary of State power to vary by
order the numerical threshold above which grounds may be
designated as requiring a safety certificate. The threshold is
at present set at 10,000 by the Act.


Section 21:   Safety certificates - police presence

9.     Section 21 adds subsection  (2A) to section 2 of the 1975
Act.    Where the local authority  includes in a safety certificate
a provision which requires the presence of the police, the
subsection requires that determination of their number is to be
     to the Chief Officer of Police. This is already the usual
if not invariable practice and this provision does no more than
give statutory force to existing arrangements. Safety
certificate conditions which do noc comply with this provision
wxll however be void and local authorities are advised to ensure
that any such conditions comply with the new provisions.

Section 22:   Safety certificates - appeals
10.    Section 22 of the 1987 Act  directs appeals under section5
of the 1975 Act to the courts instead of to the Secretary pf
State as hitherto. Such an appeal is to the Magistrates Court by
way of making a complaint (new subsection (3A) of section 5).
There is also provision for an appeal to the Crown Court against
an order made by a Magistrates Court on determining a complaint.
Such an appeal may be made by the local authority or by any
"interested party" as defined in section 5 of the 1975 Act.

11. Subsections (4), (6), (7) and (8) of section 5 are repealed
in consequence of the removal of the Secretary of State's
functions in respect of appeals. However the Secretary of State
is given the power to prescribe by regulation the time within
which appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act are to be brought.
These regulations will also come into effect as from 1 January
1988. There is however transitional provision contained in
paragraph 6 of Schedule 5 to the 1987 Act to preserve the
existing appeal procedures/powers in respect of appeals made to
the Secretary of State before 1 January 1988 and which are still
extant on that date.
12. Section 22(8) of the 1987 Act makes a number of
consequential amendments to section 7 of the 1975 Act
(determinations and appeals/supplementary). Subsection (8)(a)
amends section 7(1) of the 1975 Act so that it provides for an
application to be deemed to be withdrawn if the local authority
serve a notice under section 5(1) that an applicant is not
qualified for the issue of a certificate, once the time limit for
an appeal has expired. It also removes from the 1975 Act section
7(1)(b) which misleadingly implies that the local authority can
determine without an application having been made that an
existing holder of a safety certificate no longer qualifies to
hold it.   Subsection (8)(b) amends section 7(2) to make
provision to suspend the effect of the local authority decision
that an applicant is not a qualified person if an appeal is made
in the prescribed time limits. This suspension has effect until
the appeal is either withdrawn or determined by the court in
favour of the authority. Subsection 8(c) amends section 7(3) of
the 1975 Act and subsection (8)(d) repeals the provision in
section 7 of the 1975 Act by which a court could, on the
application of the local authority, give immediate effect to a
term or condition of a safety certificate which had been
suspended as a result of an appeal.

Section 23: Special procedure in case of serious risk -
prohibition notices: and
Section 24: Prohibition Notices: appeals

13. Section 23 of the 1987 Act replaces the existing section 10
of the 1975 Act with provision for a system of prohibition
notices. Section 24 of the 1987 Act provides for appeals against
a prohibition notice.
14. A prohibition notice may be served in respect of any sports
ground as defined in section 17(1) of the 1975 Act or part of
such a sports ground. The criteria for issuing a prohibition
notice are set out in the new section 10(1) and local authorities
should not feel inhibited from using the new powers when
necessary. These powers are nonetheless potentially far reaching
(see also paragraph 20 below) and local authorities are therefore
asked to ensure that they are used with due discretion. In
practice, the considerations leading to the issuing of a
prohibition notice are likely to be comparable to those which now
  apply to seeking a court order, and prohibition notices shorn * a
  general be used as a last rath4r than a first?esort afSr

sectioi                            under new section 1 0 as inserted by
section 23 of the 1987 Act. The bringing of an appeal does not
suspend the operation of the notice or of any amendment to it
(section 10A(6)) so, particularly if the notice is to apply to a
"one-off" fixture, it is important that it is served, wherever
possible, well in advance so as to enable the recipient to
exercise effectively his right of appeal. The appeal procedure
is by way of complaint to a Magistrates Court. On appeal the
court may cancel the notice or affirm the notice, either in its
original form or as amended, or with such modifications as the
court thinks fit. There is provision for a further right of
appeal to the Crown Court against the decision of the Magistrates
Court. Persons entitled to make such an appeal are listed in new
section 10A(7). "An aggrieved person" referred to in sub-section
(7)(a) is defined in sub-section (9).

Section 25:   Enforcement : Inspections and offence of obstruction

21. Section 25(1) of the 1987 Act adds a new section 10B to the
1975 Act which provides for local authorities to enforce the
Act's provisions and, for that purpose, to arrange for the
inspection of designated grounds at least once every twelve
months in accordance with any guidance from the Secretary of
State.

22, Section 25(2) updates section 12(6)(d) of the 1975 Act by
amending the term "wilfully" to "intentionally".

                   Annual Inspection of Hillsborough Stadium as required
                                           by the Certificate of Ground Safety



                   On 18 July 1988, I made an inspection of the ground
during the time that this year's quota of crush barriers
were being tested by my firm;
                   The results of the crush barrier testing are given
in a separate report of today's date.
                       I made a visual inspection of all the main structural
features of the ground.                                                                 Particular attention was paid to
gates and entry and exit routes and to boundary walls and
fences.                           No significant defects were noted.
                   The roof of the South stand was inspected from the ground.
No deterioration in its condition was observed.
                       I certify that in my opinion the various structures on
the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for
the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down in
the Certificate of Ground Safety.

      nearest the north west         terrace had been raised at the previous           meeting of

      the Working Party and this was further explored at the meeting on 11th

      August.     In the second      paragraph, Dr. Eastwood (the Club's Consulting

      Engineer) gave details         of testing of the crush           barriers on the terrace and

      indicating that appropriate remedial action had been taken, where

      necessary and that the first five year cycle of the barrier testing had

      thus been completed.


20.   The County Council was occasionally made aware of various problems in

      connection with the use of the stadium.                  An example as to how these

      matters were dealt with can be seen by reference to a letter from the

      South Yorkshire County Fire Service to the Sheffield Wednesday Football

      Club regarding a test which the Fire Service did of the emergency

      procedures at a match on 4th October,                 1983.   (3.33).   There was particular

      concern that stewards could not hear the emergency procedure announcement

      on the public address system, which resulted in stewards failing to carry

      out their emergency procedure duties.                  Consultations then took place

      between the Club and the Fire Officer wjLthref erence to the County Council

      which resulted in the s a t i s f a c t o ^ ^ r e s u l t i o m o f the public address system

      problem.      The system itself was checked and found satisfactory by the

      County Fire Service 29th October, 1983, the test proved satisfactory.

Sheffield City Council as Certificating Authority (with effect from
1st April, 1986)

At the meeting of the General Purposes Panel (which is a Sub-Committee of

the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee of the

City Council) a report was considered from the Head of Administration and

Legal Department on Safety of Sports Grounds.       The Panel adopted the

recommendations contained in the report which were:-


(a)   All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports

      Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel.


(b)   The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be

      delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in

      consultation with the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of this Panel or of

      the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as

      appropriate.


(c)   The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be

      delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.         The

      Panel's decision was subsequently confirmed by a full meeting of the

      City Council which took place on

                                                t
The General Purposes Panel considered a more detailed report on the Act

and the administrative system used by the County Council at the Panel's

meeting on 6th May, 1986.   The full report is attached to this statement.

The following extracts of the report are worthy of note:-


Existing Administrative Arrangements

      The County Council system for administering the Act is based on two

      main components - (a) bi-annual inspections of the stadium and (b)

      meetings of an Officer Working Party.   The bi-annual inspections

      consist of representatives from all the interested authorities and

      involve thorough inspections of the stadia and the identifying of any
                                       -9-

    defects.   The defects are at the time of visit brought to the

    attention of the Certificate holder and its technical representative,

     if one is present.    Depending on the nature of the faults found (if

    any), steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate

    holder to rectify them or so arrange matters that no risk to the

     public occurs.   The Working Party consists of representatives from

     the Police, Fire Service, Building Surveyors and the County Council -

     it considers in detail various matters (such as the spion kop

     development at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground) and also any

     outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.                The Working Party

     is effectively a co-ordinating body, which attempts to ensure that a

     balanced and consistent approach is maintained to current issues at

     the sports grounds.    Any recommendations it makes are subject to

     approval by this Panel.


The Health and Safety Executive

     Recommendation 9 of the Popplewell Committee's Interim Report reads

     as follows:-


     "There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety

     Executive and the Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how

     best to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and reports".


     Bearing this in mind, the local office of the Health and Safety

     Executive was invited to participate in the administrative system for

     Safety of Sports Grounds.    This invitation was declined.                The
                                             i   •   •   •   i   in        _
     Executive would apparently take no direct part in the certification

     system.   In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and

     the position explained; it appears that negotiations are under way-

     between the Home Office and the H.S.E. about Popplewell's

     recommendation, but as yet there has been no useful outcome.                    In

     these circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety
    Executive informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite

     their comments on them.     It would then be the responsibility of the

    Executive to decide whether or not to respond.


Review of the Administrative System

At its meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel

considered a report on the future administration of the Council's

Certificating function.


The report accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority, will

act on the basis of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service), the

question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.     In this

respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the
   ~ 'i  ....
Department of Health and Consumer Services.     Both the Building Surveyor's

Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services are part of

existing Council structure.    It was envisaged that the Working Group would

function as a forum for d.iscussjL&n--b£tween Officers and its most regular

use would probably be the discussions of advice to the Council before they

were finally formulated by the appropriate Authority.


It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would be held at the

request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a

list of items to be discussed.     At the conclusion of the meeting a further

list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be

taken by each Authority would be noted.     It was then envisaged that

detailed written advise would be provided by each discipline and a c t e d .

upon as appropriate.
The report went on to suggest various areas of responsibility for each

Authority which follow.


Authority                         Area of Responsibility

The Building Surveyor,            All matters relating to the structure
(Sheffield City Council)          of stadia, including crush barriers,
                                  walls, etc.

South Yorkshire County            Fire precautions, fire alarms, means
Fire Service                      of escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                  capacity.

South Yorkshire Police             Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
                                   access of emergency vehicles and
                                   emergency planning.


It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

would have an input into the Advisory Group on:- aspects of general

safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items

such as first aid requirements.   These lists were of course not

exhausted and several of the functions overlapped.


The report considered the question of inspections and it was suggested

that one large scale inspection per stadium per annum should be carried

out per year.   It was noted that the proposal was in line with with the

Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other areas.


The Panel approved the revised administrative system and delegated all

routine matters in connection with that system to the Head of

Administration and Legal Department.


Role of the Administration and Legal Department
in the Certification System

The basic role of the Department is to co-ordinate the administration of

the Certification System and also to keep the records of it.


An example of an Agenda and notes of the meeting are attached, dated 28th

April, 1988, which shows the sort of items discussed at the Working Group.
Inspections of

Every year inspections of stadia are fixed by the Head of Administration

and Legal Department in consultation with the clubs and the interested

authorities.     Inspections take place annually.


Inspections are attended by persons representing:- the County Fire

Service, the Police, the Council's Director of Health and Consumer

Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.       Often, the Club is

represented at the inspection by a consultant engineer, together with

another representative, usually the Club Secretary or similar Officer.

The inspection is carried out on an informal basis by the various Officers

who meet at the ground and then dispurse to various areas in which their

particular interest lies.


Communication is maintained by the Officers throughout the inspection and

it is common for the Officers to draw points to each other's attention

when they think fit.     Officers of the Club are usually present and are

sometimes referred to by Officers by information.


If Officers discover a serious safety defect then the Head of

Administration and Legal Department is informed and immediate steps are

taken to secure its rectification.     If rectification is not possible prior

to spectators being admitted into the stadium, then steps would be taken

to issue a Prohibition Notice.


Officers at the conclusion of the inspection write to the Head of

Administration and Legal Department setting out their comments on matters

which ought to be raised with the Club, the stadium owners.      These are

then collated and discussed with the Officers (sometimes at a Working

Group) and finally formulated into a list which is sent to the Club for

action.
                                                                       7
The actual inspections of stadia take account for approximately-       '

hours of Officer time per inspection.       This time figure does not include

the subsequent administrative work or the consideration of proposals

submitted by stadium owners.    This figure is also to be contrasted with

the assertion in Home Office Circular 72/1987 that inspections are not

expected to take more than about two man days per ground on average.


The role of the Home Office

The Home Office is the Central Government Department which is responsible

for safety of sports grounds.     Its functions can be described in brief as

follows:


(a)   To advise Parliament on legislation;

(b)   To issue circulars informing interested persons about legislation
      and to offer guidance;

(c)   To issue Statutory guidance (for example, in relation to
      inspections); and

(d)   To issue the "Green Guide" which is an advisory document to assist
      the improvement of safety standards at sports grounds.


The Certificating Authority's response to the Bradford Disaster
and the Popplewell Report

The South Yorkshire County Council issued a press release on 10th May,

1985 outlining the certification system in operation throughout the

County.    The press release went on to say that the forthcoming "Summer"

inspections will take into account the lessons of the recent tragic event

at Bradford and any revised advise and requirements which may be issued by

the Home Office.   (3.89).   On 13th May,   1985 the South Yorkshire County

Council sent a letter to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday enclosing a

copy of the press release and stressing that it is vitally necessary for

safety stewards to be fully aware of and trained in their duties on the

manning and opening of doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of

fire fighting equipment. (3.90).
                                          -14-


32.   The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again to Sheffield Wednesday on

      9th August, 1985 which indicated that the Interim Report of the Popplewell

      Inquiry had been produced and advice had been received from the Home

      Office.   The letter drew attention to a review on the evacuation

      procedures in consultation with the Police and the Fire Service and also

      to the duties of safety stewards.   It was also indicated that the Police

      and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in training stewards.

      Detailed comments were also made about the first aid facilities at the

      stadium and the requirements of the Certificate in respect of them.     There

      was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

      materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently

      displayed. (3.112).   The Club responded to the County Council's letter of

      14th August and comments were made about steward training procedures which

      were to be reviewed before the next home match. (3.116).


33.   The Sheffield City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday on 15th October,

      1987 referring to the revised Green Guide which had been published by H.

      M. Government following the Popplewell Report drawing attention to the new

      Guide and particularly to Chapter 2, which is entitled "Management
i
      Responsibility".   The letter asks Sheffield Wednesday to confirm in

      writing that the Club intends to retain a copy of the revised Green Guide

      on the premises and that they should take immediate steps to appoint a

      safety officer as defined in Chapter 2.    (4.47).   The Club responded to

      that letter on 23rd October, 1987 confirming that a copy fo the Guide was

      held at the stadium and that Mr. Mackrell was now the Safety Officer.

                               There was felt to be no real problem with the north west corner
                               reinforced concrete terrace.

  30.3.79          1.238       On page 2 of the notes of the meeting reference is made to the crush
                               barriers on the west terrace, the cross-fall on the steps on the north
                               west corner exit and the height of the crush barriers.  It was agreed
                               that all those points must be drawn to the Club's attention.  As far as
                               the north west corner terrace was concerned, the Building Authority
                               indicated that it would require attention.

        I                      installation of additional barriers and a reduction in capacity were
                               agreed.  Further comments were also made as to the height of the
                               existing crush barriers, corrosion, etc.  There was also mention of the
                               north west corner terrace at the same meeting.

                               view of the cross-fall on the north west corner exit the steps should
                               be rebuilt.  There were also comments on crush barriers.  There were
                               also comments about the north west corner terrace.

12.11.79         1.196       Meeting of the Officer Working Party indicating that the work on the
                             west terrace had been carried out and that the north west terrace
                             sheeting should have a horizontal timber member fixed to the front of
                             it.

10.2.81          2.52a       An Officer Working Party visit to Hillsborough, in which it was noted
                             that the cracking of the concrete of the terracing at the north west
                             corner terrace had been the subject of quotations.  The Club also
                             outlined the consideration being given to the site of caravans outside
                             the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell
                             tickets.  It was hoped that if this took place increased entry flow
                             of spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the
                             turnstiles.

7.4.81           2.59        Mention is made that the cracking of the concrete at the north west

                           on the west terrace.  There was general agreement about the proposed

                           working satisfactorily, but there may be problems with fans 'being able
                           to climb over the radial fences using the crush barriers which run
                           through them.

20.1.82        2.108       Letter from South Yorkshire County Council to Eastwoods indicating that
                           the radial fences appear to be working satisfactorily, but outlining
                           the Police view on the possibility of fans climbing over them.

                           problem at the radial barriers.  The overall view appears to be that
                           the existing arrangement should be retained.

4.2.82         2.117       Officer Working Party meeting.  There is a comment about the west
                           terrace and the Police reiterated their view.  The Working Party
                           however agreed that it was preferable from a safety point of view not
                           to adjust the crush barriers.

24.8.82        2.147       Meeting of the Officer Working Party mentions cracks in the concrete
                           underneath the north west terrace and the apparently satisfactory
                           repairs of them.

27.8.82        2.148       Letter from Eastwoods indicating that as the repairs to the concrete
                           under the north west terrace will be quite expensive and possibly
                           difficult to effect, the Club did not propose to carry out works at
                           this stage, as there is apparently no risk to spectator safety. -

                  INVESTIGATION NOTES OF R.M. FORD - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER




        The following document will be divided date events and sub-divided into
        the hours of investigation.


15.4.89. Hillsborough Stadium had been selected by the Football Association to
         stage a F.A. Cup Semi Final football game between Liverpool and
         Nottingham Forest. Kick-off of the game was at 15.00 hours and at
         around 15.06 an incident occurred crushing spectators in the Leppings
         Lane terrace, hereafter known as the West Terrace.   The West Terrace
         had been designated for Liverpool spectators only and the crushing
         occurred in the two central enclosures of that terrace.

         At around 16.15 hours John Rice (Assistant Director) telephoned me at
         home to inform of multiple fatalities at the above football match.   From
         this conversation I ascertained that the disaster had happened on the
         West Terrace end of the ground, at this time I was requested to attend
         so as to provide a "field officer" to fully brief Mr.  Rice at home to
         arrange for such immediate emergency procedures that were necessary.

         I immediately contacted Hammerton Road Police Station to ascertain where
         the control point was for the event and asked for details of access into
         the ground and the traffic situation at that time.  I was informed that
         the spectators from the match were now leaving and there was choatic
         situations around the area.

         Immediately after this I attempted to contact Graham Smith and I also
         spoke to Shiva Prasad of the Health and Safety Section to try to attempt
         to get background information in recent visits made by officers of the
         Section in regard to the Safety in Sports Ground Act. Graham Smith was
         not at home and Shiva Prasad did not know any information.

         At 16.40 hours I arrived at Hillsborough.  I gained access into the
         ground and made my way to the Control Room where Inspector Murray was
         identified as the Officer in charge.   At this time I was unable to gain
         information as to the exact occurrence and I was told by another Senior
         Officer, who was not in uniform, that the information would be given at
         a briefing meeting open to the media in about half an hours time.   I
         asked if the Health and Safety Executive were present, but the two
         officers did not know.

         I made an immediate visit to the area of the incident.  I noted that
         there was a crush barrier completely demolished with a cross-member
         missing.  I quickly noted that that cross-member was located on the
         pitch and obviously been removed from the terracing.   Other barriers
         were bent and the pitch perimeter fence was bent inwards at various
         points back in towards the terracing, obviously in an attempt to extract
         people from the terrace area.   Advertising boards were scattered around
         and I spoke to several persons to try to get information regarding the
         incident.   Many people were obviously in a great state of shock and the
         indication I had at that time, that there had been a gate opened by the
         turnstiles and therefore there had been a large influx of spectators
         into already full areas of terracing.
                                      - 2 -



At 17.00 hours I telephoned John Rice to update on the situation at
H il ls b or ou g h and I explained how the situation was still confused with
the man y people in shock.        At that time I was unable to gain a telephone
line out of the ground and the telephone calls were made with the
permission of the owner of the corner shop on Leppings Lane.         John Rice
informed me that he had left messages for Paul Jackson to attend and he
would be arriving at the ground between 18.00 and 18.15 hours.

I returned into the ground and at 17.15 hours spoke to Mr. Mackrell,
Sheffield Wednesday's Club Secretary.   Mr. Mackrell was openly shocked
and the conversation took place on the pitch.    Very briefly he said
that he had thought that someone had opened a door at Leppings Lane end
of the ground and people were crushed in a fairly full area.   He said
that the actual electronic counts on the turnstiles indicated that the
whole of the Leppings Lane end was not at capacity.   He said Clive Betts
had bee n down onto the pitch and, at that time, he couldn't explain m u c h
more but would contact us on Monday or early in the week.   He had not
seen anybody from the Health and Safety Executive.

At 17.25 hours I updated John Rice and it was confirmed that Paul
Jackson was to attend with V od aphone and camera.  We were to rendezvous
at the gates at Leppings La n e close to the corner shop where my
telephone calls were made.

Duri ng my wait I talked to the shop owner and he said that around 15.05
thousands of supporters were crushing to get into turnstiles w i t h the
police horses trying to control them.    He suddenly noted that a gap had
appeared in the crowd just like a gate had opened to relieve the crowd
pressure.

A t 18.00 hours I examined the turnstile area external to the ground and
there was no obvious crush damage.       It was noted that at the top of the
t urnstiles a balustrade was loose.      I spoke to several Liverpool
supporters who had been at the game and they confirmed that a gate had
been opened and when I tried to locate which gate had opened, one
pointed to the large exit gate to the North Stand.       He said that police
had lined up inside the ground as to stop the crowd getting into the
N o r t h S tand and directed them to the Leppings Lane standing area.  The
other spectator confirmed this.

A t ar ound 18.30 hours, Paul Jackson arrived.        I briefed him on the
s i t uation and we entered into the ground and went onto the pitch.        A
police sergeant showed' us to the terracing and a sketch was m a d e of the
layout.         Paul Jackson returned to the car to ma ke a further briefing
t e l ep ho n e call to John Rice.    I left the pitch and proceeded to the
o ffice area of the stand.         I spoke to Mr.  Makrell whether any other
i n v e st i ga ti ng officers, including the Health and Safety Executive, had
a r r iv ed and he said that he had not seen anyone.      At this time access to

the terracing was refused by the South Yorkshire Police Scene           of
C rimes Officer, Mr.        Eggleston, until police evidence was gained.   This
w a s for the Coroners investigation.       We requested to vie w the video of
the close circuit cameras but we were told that these were already
sealed for evidence.
A further sketch of the terracing, showing barrier positions, was made,
fro m the front of the West Stand which overlooks the affected terracing.
B a r r i e r s with obvious damage were noted.  At around 19.00 hours, the
S c e n e of Crimes Officer, Mr.  Eggleston, allowed us access onto the
terracing.      We entered through the enclosure gate marked N o . 3 this being
the enclosure w he re a barrier had collapsed.
                                                  - 3 -

           Visually, the barrier that had collapsed and bent with no obvious
           failure of welds although it was obvious that a inspection would be
           required by Structural Engineers, probably of the Health and Safety
           Executive.  The length of barrier that was found on the pitch was placed
           back onto the terraced area by myself and Paul Jackson in the position
           of the barrier.

           At arou nd 20.00 hours Mr. Mackrell the Club Secretary was interviewed
           and was informed that we would require the names and addresses of the
           stewards on duty and also their positions and actual duties on that day.
           Mr. Makr el l said he was unable to supply that information at that time
           beca us e the staff were so shocked about the event but would attempt to
           get that information for Monday.        He said also that the Consulting
           E ng in e er for Sheffield Wednesday, Dr. Eastwood, would be attending the
           ground the next day, that is Sunday the 16th April, to test the
           barriers.      Shortly after David Bownes, the Chief Licensing Officer of
           the Council and Arthur Butler of the Building Surveyors Division
           attended.      Mr.   Ma ckrell was informed that he needed to secure the area
           so as to keep people out.        A re-examination of the Leppings Lane end,
           with D a v i d Bown es and Arthur Butler, took place with Arthur Butler
           taking photographs.

           At the rear of the West Stand a gate which divided turnstile areas was
           open.     David Bownes said that would be normally closed and it was found
           that the placing of a portacabin     for the selling of programmes on that
           day was obstructing the opening of the gate.      The portacabin had a sign
           on saying it was hired from M.P.H.     Hire with telephone numbers of
           offices in Sheffield and Mansfield.     It was noted that the tunnel that
           led from the rear of the West Stand to the terracing was noted to be
           dark and, at the time of a football m a t c h when the terracing would be
           occupied by people, there would be a substantial reduction in the light
           ent e ri ng the tunnel from the terraced area.

           John Rice was further briefed at 21.00 hours and it was agreed a
           de-b ri ef i ng m e e t i n g at Town Hall Chambers would be held next day at
           09.00 in the morning.

           O n leaving the ground we met David Purchon, the Director, and Stuart
           N a t t r as s of the Health and Safety Executive at the Lepping Lane's gates.
           Paul Jackson and myself briefed them on the current information to hand
           and Stuart N a ttrass was asked to consider the attendance of a engineer
           to m o ni to r any tests undertaken by Dr. Eastwood on behalf of Sheffield
           Wednesday.        Paul mentioned a Consultants name of B ri an Hibbs and Stuart
           N a t t r as s agreed that he would try to contact him.   We confirmed that
           there was a m e e t i n g next day at 09.00 a.m.

16.4.89.   I was informed by Paul Jackson that our brief for the Sunday was to
           carry out an investigation of the site of the incident.         This meant a
           deta il ed examination of the Enclosures 3 and 4 and also of the tunnel
           that gave access to the terracing.     B e f or e leaving to go to Hillsborough
           w i t h Paul Jackson, I attended a meeting at Town Hall Chambers.      The
           people present were -

                       David Purchon,           John Rice,  Paul Jackson and myself.
                       Pat O'Neil           - Safety Advisers Unit

Before I left this meeting I noted that Stuart Nattrass of the Health
and S a f et y E x e c u ti ve viewed that the Safety in Sports Ground Act was
primarily legislation and superceded the Health and Safety at Work A c t
and as such he did not view that the H e alth and Safety Executive would
be a lead i nvestigating Body.           He did, however, state that the Health
and Safet y E x e c u t i v e would give full support in the carrying out of a
investigation.           He said that he had been asked to report to the
Sec re t ar y of State for 10.00 a.m.         the next day, that is the 17th April,
1989 and viewed that an initial report from the Local Authority would be
required by that time also.            A d iscussion took place around the Safety
C e r ti fi c at e and a plan of the Leppings Lane end was circulated by D av id
Bownes.        It was acknowledged that the Coroner's investigation would take
o ve r-riding presidence over any other.           At this time it was quite openly
agreed that there would be an inquiry into this event.

At 09.40 myself    and Paul Jackson   left to go to Hillsborough,     the mee t in g
n ow ongoing.

At 09.55 I   arr i ve d at the ground. Paul Jackson and myself were delayed
in gaining   access into the ground until we have authorised entry by Mr.
Mackrell.    Once Mr. M ackrell had been contacted, to confirm our
authority,   there was no difficulty in gaining access.

On entering the ground myself and Paul Jackson started taking detailed
mea s ur em e nt s of barriers and photographing the enclosures of the
disaster.         It was noted that there was no effective security on arrival
at the ground of the enclosures.         Immediately we were within the
enclosures I i dentified ourselves to a man who was stood on the
terracing, he confirmed that his name was Don Sherriff of the Buil di n g
Sur ve y o r ' s Section.   The taking of measurements was to enable the
p ro du c t i o n of a plan of the terracing and comparison with the "Green
Code".        Later Mr.   Purchon, John Rice a nd others from the Town Hall
Chambers mee ti ng attended the site.       John Rice had now taken the lead
role in the investigation.

Dr. E a s tw oo d the Sheffield Wednesday En gineering Consultant arrived and
also B r i a n Hibbs, Consultant for the H.S.E.        Whilst measurements were
b e i n g taken it was noted that other barriers, not obviously damaged, had
been affe ct e d by the pressure and also the perimeter fence showed
evi d en ce of pressure damage.      Paul Jackson requested details of the
C or on e r ' s seizure of evidence from a Inspector of South Yorkshire Police
and G o rd o n L evers of the Public Safety Unit videod the terrace tunnel
and area behind the West Stand.        Dr.  Ea st wo o d brought load testing
e q u i pm e nt on to test various barriers, the first barrier that was tested
was out s id e the enclosures that had bee n affected by the crowd pressure
a n d the barrier was in Area 2 w hich was connected to barrier 136.

A t 12.10 bar ri e r 137, which had suffered bending during the incident, .
was load tested.           The barrier was tested beyond the guidance load and
y i e l d e d at 500 lbs. per linear foot.     At 1.4 tonnes there was a 13 m m
d e f l e c t i o n of the barrier, the barrier failing at a maximum of 1.6
tonnes.

A t 12.30 a similar load test was undertaken on barrier 128.             T he test
load of 400 lbs. per linear foot was h e l d by the barrier with a 4 mm
p e r m a n e n t set noted.    The barrier was further loaded to 1.4 tonnes and a
d e f l e c t i o n of 15mm was noted.   T h e barrier recovered after release of
t h e load.         The barrier was then further tested to a load 25% over test
level, i.e.           1.7 5 tonnes and a 27 mm movement was noted after three
minutes.           The load was released and then a further load test was
u n d e r t a k e n up to 50% over the test load, i.e.  2.1 tonnes. At this load
4 0 m m of defelction was observed and on release of the load

           At arou nd 13.30 the barrier pole from 124A which had been previously
           moved from the terracing to the secured Referee's Locker Room, was moved
           by m ys el f and Paul Jackson to the S e c r e t a r y ’s Office for further
           security.

           A m e e t i n g for 09.00 a.m. the next day at the Health and Safety
           E x e c u t i v e ' s testing laboratories was m a d e w i t h their Field Staff.

           At ar ound 14.00 hours myself and Paul Jackson left the ground.                  We
           returned to Town Hall Chambers to discuss the investigation w i t h John
           Rice.         John Rice had been appointed Chief Investigating Officer for our
           D e p ar tm en t and our various roles were identified.             I was asked, along
           with Pa u l Jackson, to read the G u idance Note on Safety in Sports Ground
           and fo l lo wi n g that make initial observations.              I noted that several of
           the b a r r i e r heights that we had m e a s u r e d during the morning were b e l o w
           the G u i da nc e N otes recommended heights and also the spacing of the
           b arriers in E nc l os ur e 3 were more w i d e l y spaced than the Guidance N o t e
           recommended.            I immediately n o tified Joh n Ri ce of this and I was asked
           to r eturn to Hi l ls b o r o u g h the next day to carry out the second detailed
           m e a s u r e m e n t of the terracing.    D u r i n g this period in the office I
           d et ai l ed my Unit' s involvement to date and discussed the investigations
           progress with John Rice.            I left the office at around 17.00 hours.
           That evening, I again studied the Guid an c e Notes on the Safety of Sport
           Grounds .

17.4.89.   I arriv e d at work at 08.00 a.m. and arranged for a member of the Healt h
           and C o n s u m e r Services Depart me nt to d r a w a plan of the terracing based
           on the m e as u re me n ts u ndertaken the day previous.      I arranged for the
           films of the photographs taken the day previous to be processed at Boots
           the C h e mi st on Fargate.

           At 10.00 a.m. I left the office with Mr. S. Pitts, a Technician, and we
           arrived at Hi ll s borough at a p p r ox im a te ly 10.15 a.m.   During the morn in g
           s ession Mr. Pitts and I took detailed measurements of Enclosure 3 and
           the tunnel.         D u r in g our time on the terracing a team of Health and
           Safety E x e c u t i v e Investigation Officers were examining the barriers
           w ithin Enc l os ur e 3. Mr.         Paul Jackson undertook brief measuring of
           gaps w i t h i n the barriers and barrier heights.        Also the Fire Service
           a t t e n d e d to also measure various details of the terraced area.

           B e f o r e leaving the terraced area, the terracing was secured by the
           ground staff of Sheffield Wednesday w i t h locks and chains both at the
           pitch entrances and also at the tunnel entrance at the rear of the West
           Stand.       A n officer of the B u i l d i n g Survey o r' s Section of the.City
           C oun ci l arrived but, under instruction from Paul Jackson, I advised h i m
           that he could not enter the two central areas of the terracing because
           of the investigation of the disaster.

           Mr. P it ts and I left Hil ls bo ro u gh at approximately 13.00 hours and
           ret ur n ed three quarters of an hour later to carry out further detailed
           mea su r em en t s. During the afternoon w e measured the relevant dimensions
           of both barriers and the terraced area in Enclosure 4.          Detailed
           d rawings of the perimeter fence were also taken.
                                                 -   6   -




          On c o m p l e t i o n of the measuring in Enclosure 4, Mr. Pitts and I examined
          the rear of the West Stand and noted that there were only two apparent
          signs for standing areas on the Leppings Lane end of the ground.           One
          placed over the tunnel entrance and a smaller one indicating entrance to
          the Wing Terrace nearer to the South Stand.           I did not see any sign
          i nd ic a ti ng terraced or standing areas to the North Stand Wing of the
          West Terrace.

18.4.89. A r r iv ed in the office at 08.00 hours and spoke to Paul Jackson regarding
         the roles, in the investigation, of Paul and myself.- His view would be
         that we are to carry on the investigation to any physical defect of the
         ground that may have caused the disaster.             I informed Paul that John
         R ic e had requested me to consider the questions to be put to Stewards
         and to Sh effield Wednesday and Paul was of the opinion that I should
         i mm ed i a t e l y carry on with the hard evidence to support the
         investigation.             I arranged for Mr. Pitts to start the conversion of the
         m e a s u r e m e n t s taken the day previous onto a scaled plan.   During my
         absence at Hillsborough the day previous, the Health and Safety Section
         of the Depart me n t had been fully briefed on the events and given tasks
         of investigation.             I briefed the members of Health and Safety Section
         r e g a rd i ng attendance at the ground, that entrance would be fine so long
         as they had identity cards, did not enter the enclosures affected by the
         c r u s h i n g and to refer any press people w a n ti n g interviews to the
         D i r e c t o r of our Department.      Up to 10.30 there was very little ma p or
         plan supp li e d to this Department.          I arranged for a plan of the ground

         indivi d ua l tasks highlighted left the office for Hillsborough at around
         11.00 h o u r s .

          It had been agreed with Paul Jackson that further detailed examination
          of the terraced areas was required regarding any defects of terrace
          steps and nosings and other structure faults.           It was also agreed that
          the gradient of the tunnel and terracing should be calculated and the
          l e v e ll i ng equipment from Osgath or pe D epot was arranged so as to enable
          site at te n da nc e that same day.

         I qu es t i o n e d with John Rice whether David Moore, an Environmental Health
         O f f i c e r who had been seconded the the Health and Safety Executive,
         s h o u l d be asked if he would return to Sheffield to give advice on any
         i n s pe ct io n s of the ground he had u ndertaken during his employment in the
         H e a l t h and Safety Section.         David Moore had responsibilities for t h e •
         S a f e t y in Sports Ground Act, with particular reference to Sheffield
         W e d n e s d a y F o o t ba ll Club. John's immediate reaction was that he didn't
         t h i n k that was a good idea but later, about one hour later, he said that
         we should try to gain David's return for a couple of days.

         I n o t if ie d D av id Purchon that the Heal th and Safety Executive's Field

         for infor ma t io n had been placed wit h John Rice and referred back to
         D a v i d P u r c ho n by David Bownes of the Administration and Legal

                I provided for John Rice, v i a D a vi d Bownes of the Administration and
                Legal Department, the current ground capacity, the capacity of the
                Leppings Lan e end, the capacity of the Leppings Lane standing areas and
                the date of the last inspection of the City Council.       John Rice briefed
                me at 14.00 hours that D av i d Moore would be returning to the Unit to
                provide expert k no w ledge on the Safety in Sports Ground Act for twenty
                days.  He also informed me that there is now pressure to undertake
                safety visits at Bramall Lane and, therefore, there was an obvious
                problem w i t h the amounts of staff to be put onto the ground.

                I was requested to get half a dozen copies of the "Green Guide" and I
                delegated John D a w s on to do this. When a copy of the original document,
                d ated 1976, was available from the photocopier someone is required to
                compare the 1976 "Green Guide" to the most recent published (1986).

                At 14.10 hours I left Town Hall C hambers with Steve Pitts to go to
                H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium to measure the gradient of both the terrace and
                tunnel.

                At 14.30 hours we arrived at H il ls borough but had difficulty (45
                minutes) in gaining access due to the visit of the Duke of Kent and the
                i n s t r uc ti o ns of Lord Justice Taylor re access. Eventually we gained
                access into the ground and the gradients of both terraces in Enclosures
                3 & 4 were measured, the gradients of the tunnel was also levelled and
                deta il ed ex amination of the terrace steps in Enclosure 3 made.

                W e left the ground at 17.25 intending to return next day to photograph
                and c o mplete our examination of the terracing.   At approximately 18.30
                Pau l Jac ks on telephoned me at home that the investigation had been
                s us pended b y Lord Justice Taylor and hence not to enter the ground until
                furt he r notice.

     19.4.89.   I asked Mr. Pitts to draw up the measurements taken previously to scale.
                At 10.00 hours John Rice briefed the Health and Safety Section re the
                events.      The officers were told to w rite up their notes and to gather as
                m u c h in formation as possible without direct investigation.

                Mr. Rice informed me that I was to lead a team of officers specifically
                for the i nspection of B r a ma l l Lane and Owlerton. This was to be given
                p r i or it y and inspection of Bramall Lane would take place from Monday
                24th April, 1989.        Staff from other Sections would support this,
                i nc luding my manage ri al position in the Environmental Protection Unit.

                I c on t acted David Bownes unit to try to gain copies of plans of Bramall
                L a n e but I was told that at this time it would not be possible and staff
                w e r e busy co ll at i ng Hillsborough details.

                G r a h a m Smith, David Moore and Alan Charlesworth were selected for Lead
                I n s p e c t i o n Officers for Hillsborough, Bramall Lane and Owlerton
                r e s p e ct iv e ly .       D a vi d Moore was fully briefed on the disaster on his
                a r r i v a l in the office at about 12.00 hours.            A previously arranged
                b r i e f i n g m e e t i n g wi t h David Purchon was postponed and I arranged to file

                          On the occasion of the above match, there was am incident
                          at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
                          enclosure, which resulted in injuries to spectators
                          because of crushing.

                          From our enquiries it appears the.crushing was caused              $
                          through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to                 If
                          problems on the Motorway, and "rushing to"their places            jf
                          after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems            f
                          to spectators at the front of the terracing who had               \
                          been in the ground a considerable length of time.

                          According to our turnstile readings there were 335 in
                          excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular

Dear Sir

FA CUP SEMI-FINAL                      -   11 APRIL 1981

I would refer to the FA Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
Wanderers Football Club" and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
Saturday 11 April 1981.

As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.

Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances         j
caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate j
traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of      j


football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the    \
start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the 1
afternoon could have been anticipated.

I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

On the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
Coventry and travelled the short distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
which Were at a premium in London. Others also made the journey from London
to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest^
groups of standing supporters at. opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
      ■the -two participating Semi-Final clubs saw fit to inform the South
      Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club or the Football
      Association about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
      was not properly catered for. The result of this was that some 400
      Tottenham fans had to be removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
      of general safety and public order, and were accommodated in the Leppings
      Lane end of the ground,’,which had been designated for use by Spurs
      supporters.

     / The capacity at the Leppings Lane end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
     > a safety factor. At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
     ( gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
       apparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
       ■that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

       A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
       large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised,
-v    On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
       day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
       centre of this enclosure,’-thereby creating a jamming effect at the
       extremeties of it. The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
      ».gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
      limmediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
      'after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
       terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
       fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John. Ambulance
       representatives present at the game.

       As a result ox tins tne safety gates at 'die zrcnt on tne .Li^ppxncjs Lsns

     I enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
       onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
       terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
       refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to
       get in. In my view no other course of action could have been adopted in
       the interest of public safety.

)     During the half time interval my officers attempted to move the spectators
       who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
       spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
       did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
       by officers within the ground.

       In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
       inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
       I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
       at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
       events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
       of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
       the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

       Yours faithfully

              Hillsborough Disaster - boundary wall running frcm
              South Stand to Leppinqs Lane end

              I refer to your memorandum of 8th May, 1989. Might I say at once that the
              entreaty contained in your fourth paragraph whilst understood is quite
              unnecessary; we are all well aware of our responsibilities in the matter.

              Turning to the matter of the condition of the wall the short answer is
              that its condition had not caused concern to inspecting officers of this
              Division prior to April 15th, 1989, nor, so far as I am aware to the
              Club's consultant engineer advisors. Nevertheless an examination of the
              wall by Gordon Levers and myself after the events of April 15th showed
              that it was capable in places of being 'rocked' and was out-of-plumb to
              varying degrees along its length.

              To give amplification to the above statement I can state as follows

              The fact of such a wall being out-of-plumb is not necessarily significant
              in the context of performing its function. In this case calculations
              indicate and usage proved that the wall was capable of sustaining normal
              lateral loads, such as wind, which it is reasonable to suppose that it
              would be subjected to. The wall acts principally as a boundary wall
              running parallel to and dividing the flow of spectators entering or
              leaving the ground and it is certain that its original design would not
              have allowed for the high lateral forces which can be created by masses of
              people pressing against such a wall from one side or the other.

               The fact that the wall could be 'rocked' in places after the events of
               April 15th leads one to the probability that it could be due to damage to
               the ground bedding courses caused by tensile stresses created by such
               excessive lateral pressures, frcm one side or the other.

               The wall, as with other structural elements in the ground, had been
               viewed as part of the regular visits to the ground by the former S.Y.
               Working Party prior to 1986 and subsequently by your Advisory Group team.
               So far as I am concerned none of my inspecting officers can recall, nor do
               the files present any evidence, that the wall had given any cause for
               concern as to. its stability on these inspections. According to records
               the wall has been required to be re-pointed at regular intervals to
               preserve its strength and integrity, but currently there is a clear need
               for fresh work in this regard. A few years ago a former A.R.P. building
               was removed adjacent to Gate C, on the advice of the police as I
               understand it. This did of of course remove some lateral support to that
               part of the wall as a consequence, but the wall is slightly thicker at
               that point than elsewhere.

               One final point; the action taken by me to deal with this wall as a
               potentially dangerous structure was taken under the Building Act
               1984 sections 77 and 78. This will if necessary be justified on the
               grounds of the condition of the wall as found after the disaster and in
               view of the then intended re-opening of the exit route from the
               South Stand to Leppings Lane as the Club resumed its business.
                                    - 2 -


It is my view that this wall did not fall within the category of a wall
"used to divide spectator accorrmodation" as described in paragraph 103 of
the Green Guide which would have caused a designer and/or the licensing
authority to view it as a wall likely to be subjected to high lateral
loading. In this context the wall as it stood, prior to the events of
April 15th, could be described, in my view, as satisfying the relevant
requirements of the Green Guide, apart from the question of preventative
maintenance referred to earlier.

HILLSBOROUGH INQOIRY

As you know# the Council is preparing its statement to the Hillsborough
Inquiry.   Counsel has requested that the Building Surveyors submit
a report on the technical aspects of the Leppings Lane end of the
Stadium. The report should includes -

      Crush   barriers,   radial   fences,   perimeter    fences,    gangways,
      etc.

Obviously, reference should be made to the Green Guide and comparisons
drawn, where appropriate.   It is apparent that your report can only
be based on the information which you have to hand at the moment;
it should contain comments as to its limitations, if appropriate.
Please bear in mind that you may be required, in due course, to give
evidence before the Inquiry.    Would you please let me have the first
draft of your report as soon as possible as Counsel for the Inquiry
expects to receive the Council’s complete statement by Thursday 18
May 1989. You should also be aware that I have asked Mr Levers to
report on his recent involvement at Hillsborough.

I refer to the recent works which you have initiated at Sheffield
W ed nesday Football
                  Club.   As part of the Council's submission to
the Public InquiryI have been advised to obtain a detailed written
statement from youabout all aspects of the problems you have dealt
with.

Please, therefore, let me have a draft (as soon as possible) of your
statement, which should include your professional judgement as to j -

(a)   whether or not any problems with the wall and related areas
      would have been apparent, prior to 15 April 1989» and

(b)   how the defects are likely to have arisen.

Plaase'bear in mind that you may be required to give evidence before
the Inquiry at a later elate.

            H I LL S BO RO U GH INQUIRY

            H aving read the letter from the T reasury Solicitor dated 9 May 89 re the
            above I would wi sh to make the following comments.

       1.   Stadium capacity and means of escape are specific areas on w hi c h South
            Yorkshire Fire Service were asked to comment under the existing
            a dministrative system for the certification process, similarly crowd
            control and evacuation procedures are with in the remit of South Yorkshire
            Police.   On a general note however the central pens at the west end would
             appear to be too small to warrant separate access/egress gangways.     The
            area immediately surrounding the exit to the tunnel is yellow cross
            hatched to identify this as a gangway area.

       2.   The provision of directional flow exit and emergency exit signs are a
             specific function of the grounds safety officer and also an integral part
             of a comprehensive safety management plan.   You will recall that as a
             result of advice from this department the Club have been encouraged to
            appoint the Club Secretary as Safety Officer with effect from October
             1987.  However with the exception of this appointment no significant
             progress has been mad e in drawing up a comprehensive safety management
             plan.   My officers are of the opinion that the sign provision is both
             inadequate and ineffective.

       3.   The location and strength of crush barriers should have be en adequately
             cpvered by the Building Surveyor's report and the annual report of the
             Club's Consulting Engineer.  However the enclosed plan of the west end
             drawn up after the events of the 15th April indicate that the barriers do
             not fully comply with the Green Guide in terms of height and spacing.

       4.   T he statement that the access tunnel is not of a constant gradient is
            correct.   The enclosed drawing shows the relevant changes in gradient
            from 1:23 to 1:6.   Whether or not this constitutes a potential hazard is a
            subjective assessment which of course is m uc h aided by hindsight.

       5.   I am not in a position to comment on the references to the height of the
             turnstile wall.

       6.   Ac cess to emergency vehicles is once again a central element of the safety
            management plan which the Club has, until very recently i.e.   post
            distaster, been reluctant to progress save for, as recently mentioned, the
            a ppointment of the Club Secretary as Safety Officer.

            W i t h regard to the provision of First A id facilities and equipment; this
            h a s been the subject of extended correspondence between this department
            a n d yourselves between August 1987 and February 1988 (copies can be mad e
            available).     The essence of the correspondence has been an attempt to
            secure an adequately constructed and equipped First Aid Room and a
            formalisation of the arrangement for attendance of First Aiders.

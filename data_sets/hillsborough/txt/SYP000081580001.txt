although           it    was       apparent            that      some          had    been       drinking,                were       well

behaved           and    in       good      spirits.             However,             some       of    these          fans          had

obviously           arrived           without           tickets            for       the       match       as    they          were       going

round        fans       leaving            the    buses        asking           if    there          were       ’a n y     spares’.

At     1345       hours       (1345)         Claywheels               Ln       was    completely                full       of       supporters’

and     2 mini          buses        at     this       location.

At     1,425 h o u r s        (1425)         we       were     further           de ployed            to    the       junction                of

We     positioned             ourselves               outside         the       public          house       s ituated               on    that

PS     SHERRATT          instructed               my    Serial            to    form       a    filter          lane       of       officers

along        this       pavement            and       the    pavement            on       the    opposite             side          of    the

carriageway              and       requested            us     to     inform          any       supporters                passing             this

there       was          a       continuous                flow       of       Liverpool           supporters             in       groups

approximately                         10 a b r e a s t          on    both           sides    of       the       carriageway                corning

towards          us.

The       majority                of       these          supporters                 were    males          in    the    lower          age       bracket.,

it    was       very             apparent             to    me       that        a    large       amount          of    alcohol             had    been

consumed             by          the       vast       majority             of        these    men.

A    large       number                of       them       were       still           drinking          on       their    way          towards        the

ground          and          a    large          number          of       them        were    halted             and    asked          to    leave       their

intoxicants                      at    this          location.                 Some     of    them          left       their       drinks,          others

insisted             on          consuming                them       at    this        location.                 These    drinks             consisted

of    a    variety                of       canned          beers          avid       lagers.           The       whole    of       the       wall

outside          The             Gate       public          house          became           heavily          littered             with       these

0oje cts .

Generally                these             supporters                were        all    of    good          b e h a v i o u r , they          were

drunk,          but          not       incapable                or    unduly           disorderly.                 It    was       apparent           to      me

from       the       t ime            I commenced                my       position           at    thi s         location          how       late     these

thousands                of       drunken             Liverpool                supporters              had       left    it       to    go    to    the

ground          in       such          a mass             hoping          to     get    into       the       ground       before             the

commencement                      of       the       game.

1 knew          that             there          was       little          likelihood              of    them       being          there       for     the

kick-off.                    I felt             it    hard       to       understand              why       these       persons             should

travel          so       far          to    allegedly                support           their       team          and    then       (a)       leave       it

far       too    late             to       get       to    the       ground           and    (b)       be    in    such       a    drunken

condition                so       as       not       to    be    able          to     fully       appreciate             th e      match          from     the

obtained             admission.

This       heavy             mass          of    persons             continued              without          any       significant                gaps

appearing                until             about          1310       hours           (1510).

At    1455       hours                (1455)          I went          with           other    officers             to    The. G a t e         public

house       as       a       result             of    a    report          of        f,ighting         inside.

These       premises                   were          locked          and       entry        was    gained          with       some          difficulty.

Upon      entering             the      lounge          1 saw         that       it w a s     full        of    football          supporter;

supporting               red     and       white        colours.             The       atmosphere              was    hostile          and       a

lot      of       them    were        h e a v i 1y      drunk »            The    landlord          w a s ^ a'p p r o a c h e d       fay P S

SHERRATT            and     the       persons           present            were     r e qim^siTed to            leave       the       premises

and      the       landlord           was       requested             to    c 1o ye     the       bar.         I ascertained                that

there         had       been     a    fight          inside        thes<e        premises          where        stools          had    been

thrown.             The     fight          was       b e t w e e n / d i f f e rent       supporters                groups.           No

injuries            were       apparent              a n d /fo     complaints             were      received.

A    number         of    Liverpool              su/porters                had    to    be    escorted              from    the       area       as

they      were          wanting        to R e t u r n         inside         th e      public       house           and    perhaps          cause

further            disorder,

Our      Serial          then        r/turned           to    its         static       point       arid    continued             to    marshall

the      s u p p o r t e r s . / The            passage          of       fans    had     now      thinned           but    there          was

still         a    n u m b e r / of    Liverpool              fans         still       making       their           way    to    the       ground.

About         1515       hours        (1515)          t he    street         was       relatively              quiet       and    we       liaised

with      our        commander             Inspector             TOWNEND.

Suddenly            I noticed              a    sudden        surge         in    the     Police          activity          around          the

ground            and    could        hear       constant             radio       traffic          from        PS    SHERRAT's             radio,

but      at       this    time        I couldn't              quite         make       out    what        was       happening.              We

then       proceeded             along         Penistone              Rd    to    the     ground?          entering             via    the

two      ambulances              parked          in     the      corner          close       to    the     corner          of    the       Spion

Hop.          There       were        two       persons          being       deposited             beside           these       aitibuiances,

both       covered          and       appeared            dead.

We    were         then     directed             to     the      pathway          into       the    Spion           Kop    and    it w a s

there         that       I was        approached              by      a    number       of    Notts        Forest          supporters                who

offered            their       services.                At    this         time     I was         still        not    quite       sure

exactly            what     was       happening,              other         than       seeing       the        two    dead       persons             and

          where          I. w a s    confronted              by    the    sight          of    the       whole       of    the     playing               area

          literally             covered          with        the    bodies          of    the       dead    and       injured.              There             were

          large          numbers          of    persons           also    present             on    the    pitch          who    were       assisting

          in a t t e m p t i n g          to    revive        these       persons.                 Police       officers          were          fully

          were       many       non       injured          supporters              cluttering             the    area       and       making             it

          North          Stand       it    rained          human        spit       on    us.        Looking          up    I saw       hundreds                 of

          hostile           young         men    shouting           abuse          and    spitting          in       our    direction.                    I

          d o n ’t       know       how    many       bodies        we    carried             past       this    location,             but       1 would

          recall          that       the       spitting           was    present          throughout.                 The       area       beneath               the

          North          Stand       adjacent          to     the       gymnasium             soon       became       full       of    bodies             and

          injured           persons.             This        area       was    still          heavily       congested             with          grieving

          relatives             searching             fo r    their       friends             and    family.              The    whole          situation

          was     not       progressing,               difficulty              was       being       experienced                in m o v i n g

          injured           from      this       location           to    parked          ambulances             nearby.

          .Inspector'BARKER                     took       charge        of    the       situation.              I was          delegated                on      a

          cordon          line       across          the     natural          gateway          into       the    area       underneath                   t he

          With       difficulty                the    area        was    semi-cleared                of    unnecessary                persons.                   The

sterile          area          wa       hoped          to    create          was    under          constant             pressure             by    persons

approaching                our          cordon,             the    majority             of    them       I sense             were       truly

grieving             and       upset          and       confused,             looking             for    their          friends          and       family.

A    lot    of       them          were       not       helped          in    their          grief       fay t h e m         being       drunk,,                The

officers             on    this          line          were       placed       under          a    tremendous                strain          for       a

number          of    hours,             having             to    cope       with       the       physical             and    mental          abuse

aimed       at       them          by    these          relatives.

We     understood                  their          grief.           We       understood             their          need       to    know       if       their

loved       ones          or       friends             were       inside,          we    understood                their          frustration,                   it

d i d n ’t h e l p .               They       expected             that       we    would          have       a    list       of    the       dead          and

expected             us    to       allow          everyone             of    them       to       freely          wander          past       our       cordon

to     search         for          their          loved          ones.        We    explained             to       them       the       position

that       to    allow             anyone          past          the    cordon          at    this       time          who    was       not       there

for     the      purpose                of    saving             lives       could       prevent          such          lives       being          saved.

This       gained          a mixed                reaction,             some       persons          accepted                our    sound          advice,

taut    others            physically                   fought          to    get    through             the       lines       and       had       to       be

repelled.

Throughout                my       period          on       this       line,       constant             comings             and    goings          took

place,          involving                the       injured.                 Their       exit      was     severely                hampered             by       the

selfish          attitudes                   of    a    number          of     these          Liverpool                supporters.

The     constant               barrage             from          grieving          relatives             continued,                arrangements

ware       made       for          them       to       be    transported                via       bus    to       Hammerton             Rd    Police

Station          and       this          seemed             to    assist       the       situation.                    Relatives             were          at

least       able          to       find       someone             who       could       possibly          assist             them.

However,             it    should             be       noted       that       prior          to    this,          an    Inspector             had          set

up a       table          outside             our       line       and       this       had       assisted             us    because          we       had

been       able       to       direct             all       such       enquiries             to    him.           This       did    defuse             the

situation             to       a    certain             extent.

We     remained            in       situ          at    this       cordon          until          being       relieved             at    1815          hours

(1815).              We    then          regrouped                at    Claywheels                Police          Garage          and    we       were

              My    whole    Serial         I could       feel   was     in a    deep    state     of    shock,    no   one

              spoke    very         much    during      the   journey      and    on    reaching        Mexborough      Police

              Station       I could         see    everyone      was     sickened       by   the   enormous       tragedy

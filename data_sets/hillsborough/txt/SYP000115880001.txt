                Following         the    briefing         I commenced foot                 patrol    in iiiddlewood Road                  in

                that    road,       from     the M i d d l e w o o d T a v e r n towards H i l l s b o r o u g h Centre,                  in

                whilst       in M i d d l e w o o d R oad       (O u g h t i b r i d g e   side)    numerous Liverpool

                s u p p o r t e r s were    drinking alcoholic                  b e v e r a g e s w h i c h they had brought

                w i t h them or         p u r c h a s e d near to the gr o u n d from Off Licences.                            A

                n umber      of these       supporters           had o b v i o u s l y tr a v e l l e d     by private

                i n t o x i c a t e d w i t h drink.           I would estimate              that    this w o u l d have           been

                approximately            11am     ( 1 1 0 0 ) / 1 1 . 3 0am    (1130).

                I recall         later     on,   approximately                12 noon       (1S00),     walk i n g    into     the

Approximately              1.00pm       (1300)      I a t t e n d e d at P a r k s i d e S e c t i o n S t a t i o n

to g ether w i t h PC Pow e l l              in order        for a short            break.      Whilst        inside

the S e c t i o n S t a t i o n       I heard noises             on the       roof.        On going       outside        to

in v e s t i g a t e    I saw f o u r / f i v e L i v e r p o o L j ^ p f ^ o r t e r s    on the    roof of the

building,         all      of w h o m were        ur i n a t i n g    onto    the floor        below.         Together

w i t h other officers,                we m a n a g e d    to move       them on but even during                    this

time     other         supporters        were w a l k i n g      round the building                in order to

relieve        themselves.             All     these youths m e n t i o n e d were heav i l y

i n t o x i c a t e d an d sh o w e d the usual              signs      of drunkenness.              I recall

watching         one y o u t h who was about                 19/20 years            of age s e n d i n g       near to

the S e c t i o n Station.                I saw him drink approxinj^rtfely three quarters                                  of
                                                                             /.
a bottle         of V o d k a     in the       space of a m a t t e r             of minutes.        After

finishing          the     bottle       he simply w a l k e d ^wa y               to the ground          or   rather       in

the    general         direction         of it.

Approximately 2.45pm                    (1445)      fol i a t i n g    foot       patrol    in M i d d l e w o o d Road

I a t t e n d e d at       the Gy m for          ref/eshments.               We    remained for          but a few

minutes        due      to the      large number           of    people m i l l i n g around,             before

returning         to M i d d l e w o o d Road via L e p p i n g s Lane.                    It w^re obvi ous         to

Hillsborough,              mostly       in uniform,          that      the    l a r g e /.nflux     of    people

outside        the e n t r a n c e ways         to the L e p p i n g s        LarlS e n closure was unusual

for that         time      of day.         There      is u s u a l l y a heavy            influx    of s u pporters

going      into the gr o u n d at this                 time     but     on this       particular          day this

was well a bove              normal.         I also       recall       supporters          standing      on walls

a bove     the    turnstiles.              F r o m L e p p i n g s Lane we made             our way       into

Whilst       in the      park,      an d      I can o n l v ^ f S a r d a guess at 3 . 1 0 p m               (1510)/

3 . 15pm     (1515),       I recall           hea|>rtgurgent             messages       over    our   personal

radio.        It a p p e a r e d    to me at          this    time       that s u p p o r t e r s were       fighting

within      the L e p p i n g s Lane           enclosure/turnstiles.                    After what         s eemed

only a mat t e r         Of m i n u t e s      I then heard          that a tem p o r a r y m o r t u a r y was

being set up           in the g y m n a s i u m and we th e r e f o r e                i m m e d i a t e l y made our

way    to the ground,              going       in t h r o u g h the P e n i s t o n e Roa d Entrance.                 On

getting       inside       I saw as what              I can only d e s c r i b e d as numerou s                   people

being      carried       in by other s u p p o r t e r s            on    plackcards/bi 11 b o a r d s .           Some

of these were            obviously            injured/dead.              I rendered a s s i s t a n c e       to one

m a n who was a l r e a d y dead and                  I saw that          other     bodies/injured            persons

were JSeing taken              into     the gym.         A fter      dir e c t i n g    someone       into    the gym

wilti the body            I went      into the gym via the                     rear entrance.             I there saw

 odies s c a t t e r e d all          across         the floor,          all    o b v i o u s l y dead.      Other

injured        parties       were at the far side                   of the gym where First Aid was

being      r e n dered     by P o l i c e / A m b u l a n c e and suppo r t e r s          from both factions.

I then       left     the gym a n d made my way down the                           ramp betw e e n        the S pion

Kop and N o r t h Stand.                On getting           onto    the       pitch    it a p p e a r e d as though

there      had been a pitch                i nvasion a l t h o u g h        realising        the e n o r m i t y of

the s i t u a t i o n q u i c k l y     realised        it was       not.        I recall       seeing       three

bodies       laid out and           covered up          in front          of the S p i o n Kop.            I then

a s s i s t e d a young        probationer            constable          to render       heart m a s s a g e      to a

ma n   in his       twenties who              by his a p p e a r a n c e was a l r e a d y dead.              I

in structed         him to remove              the body to the gym w h i c h he did having                           been

assisted        by s upporters.                There were       numerous           bodies      strewn ar o u n d      in

front      of the N o r t h S t a n d and both police                      officers and suppo r t e r s were

rendering a s s i s tance.                 I saw at this            time that          bodies were         still

being      t r a n s p o r t e d ac r o s s    the    pitch by both             police and s u pporters

a like     on m a k e s h i f t    stretchers.           I made my wa y across                  the    pitch

towards        the L e p p i n g s Lane E n c l o s u r e and saw bodies                     being      pulled

t h r o u g h an open        part       of fencing,          this     fencing        had o > v i o u s l y been cut

open to a l l o w fans                to escape.        At    this     time     &*^al       supporters            began

chanting        towards          the Live rpool         s u p p o r t e d ! a n d a lar.g_| pij^er .who

already spilled              out onto the            pitch      Nln tow^fds           tlie...Sjg>,ion Hop.            I was

unable       to render a s s i s t a n c e         due to the          large amount           of     people in

front       of the fencing,              so    I ran back ac r o s s           the    pitch a n d thro u g h a

cordon of          police who were              by this       time ac r o s s        the    centre      line to stop

rival       factions        meeting        from either          end of the ground.

After       passing       through        the    cordon       I a s s i s t e d w i t h both        relatives/

friends and the              like       e n qu iring a fter          injured     parties,          di r e c t i n g    them

towards        the g ymnasium.                I myself       r e t urned to the gym a short                       time

later after a s s i s t i n g and then t r a n s p o r t i n g a body back w i t h a

u n i f o r m PC.      By    this       time    the gym was           clu t t e r e d w i t h bodies          of the

de c e a s e d and also           relatives        enq u i r i n g   after      them.

Af t e r    some    semblance           of order was          resto r e d      I was       instr u c t e d to assist

unif o r m P C ’s w i t h the            searching,          i d e n t i f i c a t i o n and d o c u m e n t a t i o n of

bodies.         I did        this w i t h two bodies.

After       this    had      been done w ith all               or should       I say nearly all,

t o g e t h e r w i t h others,          I was t r a n s p o r t e d     up to H a m m e r t o n R oad Police

Station        in order          to ob t a i n Miss i n g P e r s o n Repo r t s from               relatives/

friends who          had a c c u m u l a t e d outside           the station.              A number         of     reports

were       taken by m y s e l f         although       I would       not      like to hazard a guess as

to how many.

Detective Constable 1 %
Ecclesfield Police Station


At 9#00am on Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at Ecclesfield Police Station
and was at this time ia'casual civilian attire# Following my commencement of duty
I was transported to Hillsbrough together with other officers where we were firstly
briefed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and then by our Sector Commander,
Detectire Inspector Scaife.


Following the briefing I commenced fotpatrol in Middlewood Boad in company with
PC 2302 Powell, Our designated duty was to patrol along that road, from the
Middlewood Tavern towards Hillsbrough Centre inorder to spot potential trouble
spots and/or street crime(Thefts from vehicles,pickpockets etc) I did note that
during this period whilst in Middlewood Koad(Ougtibridge side) that numerous
Liverpool supporters were drinking alcoholic beverages which they had brought with
them or purchased near to the ground from Off Licences* A number of these supporters
had obviously travelled by private vehicles and by this time some of there numbers
were heavily intoxicated with drink* I would estimate that this would have been
approximatly 11am/l 1.30am.


I recall later on, approximatly 12 noon, walking into the centre of Hillsbrough
shopping precinct and again Liverpool supporters appeared to be purchasing
liquor(Beer/Cider & lager) in large quantities from Off Licences. These were in
the form of cans and bottles*


Approximatly 1.00pm I attended at Parkside Section Station together with PC Powell
inorder for a short break* Whilst inside the Section Station I heard noises on the
roof* On going outside to investigate I saw four/five Liverpool supporters on the
roof of the bailing, all of whom were urinating onto the floor below* Together with
other officers, we managed to move them on but even during this time other supporters
were walking round the building inorder to relieve themselves. All these youths
mentioned were heavily intoxicated and showed the usual signs of drunkenness. I
recall watching one youth who was about 19/20 years of age standing near to the section
station. I saw him drink approximatly J of a bottle of vodka in the space of a matter
of minutes. After finishing the bottle he simply walked away to the ground or rather
in the general direction.of it.


Approximatly 2*^5pm following fotpatrol in Middlewood Road I attended at the Gym
                                BUT
for refreshments* We remained for a few minutes due to the large number of people
milling around,before returning to Middlewood Road via Leppings Lane. It was obvious
to myself at this time, having worked numerous football matches at Hillsbrough,mostly
                                                                         il s   tr

in unifrora, that the large influx of people outside the entrance ways to the
Leppings Lane Enclosure was unusual for that time of day. There is usually
a heavy influx of supporters going into the ground at this tiae hut on this
particular day this was well above normal* I also recall supporters standing
on walls above the turnstiles. Jron Leppings Lane we made our way into
Hillsbrough Bark with the intention of making this a short cut up to Middlewood
Road.


Whilst in the park, and I can only hazard a guess   at 3*10pm/3*15pnit I recall
hearing urgent messages over our personall radio. It appeared to me at this
time that supporters were fighting within the Leppings Lane enclosure/turnstiles.
After what seemed only a matter of minutes I then heard that a temporary
mortuary was being set up in the gymnasium and we therefore immediately made
our way to the ground, going in through the Feaistone Road Entrance. On getting
inside I saw as what I can only describe as numerous people being carried in
by other supporters on plackcards/billboards. Some of these were obviously
injured/dead. I rendered assistance to one man who was already dead and I saw
that other bodies/injured persons were being taken into the gym. After directing
someone into the gym with the body I went into the gym via the rear'entrance.
I there1saw bodies scattered all across the floor, all obviously dead. Other
injuried parties were at the far side of the gym where First Aid was being
rendered by Police/Ambulance and supporters from both factions.
I then left the Gym and made my way down the ramp between the Spion Cop and
North Stand. On getting onto the pitch it appeared as though there had been
a pitch invasion although realising the enormity of the situation quickly
realised it was not# I recall seeing three bodies laid out and covered up
inforat of the Spion Cop# I then assisted a young probationer constable to
render heart massage to a man in his twenties who by his appearance was already
dead. I instructed him to remove the body to the gym which he did having been
assisted by supporters. There were numerous bodies strewn around infront of the
North Stand and both police officers and supporters were rendering assistance.
I saw at this time that bodies were still being transported across the pitch
by both police and supporters alike on makeshift streches. I made my way
across the pitch towards the Leppings Lane Enclosure and saw bodies being pulled
thorugh an open part of fencing, this fencing had obviously been cut open to
allow fans to escape. At this time rival supporters began chanting towards the
Liverpool supporters and a large number who had already spilled out onto the
pitch ran towards the Spion Cop. I was unable to render assitance due to the
        I "   — «______   ,
                                                                            esir

large amount of people infront of the fencing, so I ran back across the pitch and
through a cordon of police who were by this time across the centre line to stop
rival factions meeting from either end of the ground.
After passing through the co^doa I assisted with both relatives/friends and the
like enquiring after injured parties, directing them towards the gymnasium.
I myself returned to the gym a short time later afterassisting and then transporting
a body back with a uniform PC. %    this time the Gym was clutered with bodies of
the deceased and also relatives enquiring after them.
After some ^semblence of order was restored I was instructed to assist      Uniform
PC’s with the searching, identifiaction and documentation of bodies. I did this
with two bodies.
After this had been done with all or should I say nearly all, together with other
I was transported up to Hamraerton Hoad Police Station inorder to obtain Missing
Person Reports from relatives/friends who had accumulated outside the station.
A number of reports were taken by myself although I would not like to hazard a
guess as to how many.
Later that night, I dot .not know what time I was transported back to the Gym at
the ground. I there assisted with relatives and the like re: identification
(formal) and the completion of documentation.
At one period after the temporary Mortuary had closed down, I transported
relatives to the medico legal centre for the formal identification of a body.
I recall going into the rear of the mortuary where I saw numerous bodies,
approximatly 15/20 in number, which had had to be laid out on the floor due
to shortage of space. Following the idetification I returned to the gym, where
together with other officers went formally off duty at &am. I the® returned
to Ecclesfield, leaving at Ifam on Sunday 16 April 1989*

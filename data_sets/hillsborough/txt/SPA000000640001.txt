SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY - 13 DECEMBER 1991

DEFAMATION - LEGAL ACTION BY A PUBLIC AUTHORITY/SERVICE

Report of the Clerk and Financial Officer

1     Matter for Consideration

      To up-date members on the Private Eye article of 1 March
      1991.
2     Background

2.1   At the A u t h o r i t y ’s meeting on 11 October it was resolved that
      the Solicitor to the Authority should seek a substantive
      reply from Private E y e ’s Solicitors to the Au t h o r i t y ’s demand
      that the statements made in the article be withdrawn.
2.2   Those Solicitors have now replied stating that they do not
      consider the article to be defamatory.
2.3 C o u n s e l ’s opinion which was obtained on behalf of the
     A uthority stressed that although the article iscapable of
     being held to be defamatory of the Authority, practical
     considerations should properly be borne in mind, not least of
     which is whether any useful purpose would be served by
     repeating the allegations to a wider audience. There is also
     the important consideration of whether the costs would
     justify the benefit to the public of doing so.
3     Recommendation

      That members consider whether any useful purpose would be
      served by pursuing further any action against Private Eye.

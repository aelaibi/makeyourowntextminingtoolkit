             I -am a Police Constable with the Sot^lfh Yorkshire Police, at present

             stationed at Wath Upon Dearne.



             At 3.12 pm <1512)           on Saturday 15th April           1989 <150439)?    I was on duty,

             attached to the Rotherham Divisional Support Services,                        in Corporation

             Street, R o t h e r h a m ? w h e n ,   as a result of information received,          I was

             transported,        via police transit van with other officers,                 to

             Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield.                      Whilst en route to the

             football ground we were directed to attend the Leppings Lane entrance
n u m b e r , with their heads covered by clothing.      NumerouV' p^gjsne

lying on the ground injured.



At this time there was a large crowd of people milling around,               several

were intoxicated and showing particular aggression towards police

officers.


                                           ft o c
On entering the area, Superintendent MARS

move the bodies to an adjacent lane.       With another officer,         1 moved a

man, who was obviously dead,     from near to the entrance of the t un n el

leading onto the terraces.      I would describe this man as being

approximately 30 years of age,     heavy build, with light brown coloured

hair, about 6 ft tall and wearing denim jeans and a red coloured

shirt.   The man was carried outside th               - ard and placed on a lane

at the rear of a waiting ambulance.



At 3.40 pm (1540),   this date, a message was received te f the effect
                              <^3^ -                £ r \ r ’ y/
that there was trouble in the Leppings Lane staaid                 tp§«e=iher wi



Whilst in the stand many of the supporters           present were drunk and

showed aggression towards us.      We were instructed to remain in that

location until 4.50 pm (1650) when we were           instructed to travel to

Sheffield City Centre and patrol the city in the transit van.



At 7.00 pm (1900),   this same date,    1 returned to Main Street Police

Station and took no further part in this incident.

           At 3.12 pm (1512)             rday J5th April         1989 <150489)   I was on duty,

           attached to the Roi                 isional Support Services in Corporation

           Street, Rotherham.

           As a result of information received I was transported via police

           transit van, with other officers to Hillsborough football ground?                 in

           Sheffield.    Whilst en route to the football ground we were directed to

           attend the Leppings Lane entrance to the g/ound.
                                           fs/ IO    7ZQ
           At 3.25 pm <1525) with Inspector GRACE ^ f 4 jflfrher officers            1 entered

           the rear courtyard area of the Leppings Lane stan/.

           On entering the courtyard I saw several bodiei^/approximately six in

           number with their heads covered by clothing.

           Numerous people were lying on the ground injured.
             i
           At this time there was a large crowd of people milling around,                 several

                                                                                      S3783A

                were   intoxicated and showing particular aggression towards police

                officers.
                                                        11 0 9
                O n entering the area Superintendent MARSHA           istraloted our unit to

                move the bodies to an area adjacent to M^he^stream just outside the

                ground.

                With another officer I moved a man who was obviously dead from near

                to the entrance of the tunnel    leading onto the terraces.

                I have previously described?    in my recollection this man as being

                about 30 years of age?   heavy build? with light brown coloured hair?

                about 6 feet tall and wearing denim jeans and a red coloured shirt.

                On reflection I feel that it is possible he was wearing a jumper as

                opposed to a shirt.

                This man was carried outside the courtyard and placed in the lane

                outside the ground.    There was an ambulance waiting in this area.

                We went back to the courtyard area and almost immediately got a call

                to the effect that there was trouble at the Leppings Lane end? and

                were directed there.

                I had no further dealings with that particular body?        or in fact any

                other deceased.

                Whilst in the stand many of the supporters       present were drunk and

                showed aggression towards us.     We were instructed to remain in that

                location until 4.50 pm (1650) when we were instructed to travel to

                Sheffield City Centre and patrol the ci^y centre,

                As far as I am concerned to the best of my knowledge that person that

                I moved is the one shown in the facia]/photograph.

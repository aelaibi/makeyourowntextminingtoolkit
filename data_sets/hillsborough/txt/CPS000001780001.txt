She was checking up on the progress of the CPS decision and said that members of
the group were expressing concern as to when they’d receive the decision. She would
like them to be first on the list to hear of the decision. I said that she and the two
defendants would be first to be faxed with our decision and that we were on target for
the decision to be given on or before Friday 18.12

Spoke to CE who said we should consider using two fax machines at the same time.

FILE NOTE - Telephone conversation with Dm Sharp ling - 9 December 1998

HILLSBOROUGH

Some puzzlement as to why Stephen Wooler has raised the Adamoko point.

Dru pointed out a subtle distinction between recklessness and gross negligence. So
far as recklessness is concerned a judge would have to direct a jury with precision as
to the recklessness test and the way in which they should consider the defendants
conduct in relation to that. So far as gross negligence is concerned, it is a matter for
the jury to determine whether there is negligence and if so whether it is gross and
finally for the jury to consider whether that amounted to criminal behaviour deserving
punishment.

Did counsel consider this particular point in the advice. Answer almost certainly not
although this would be at least partly covered by the Bateman test.

Also briefly discussed with Dru the issue about whether we should take over the
attempt pervert course of justice. Dru pointed out there is an argument that
Parliament clearly intended to preserve the right to bring a private prosecution and she
referred to a case of ex-parte Doody which indicates that policy should not be applied
rigidly where there is an element of descretion. There is a distinction here between
policy on private prosecutions and the Code.

Dru suggested that it would be an idea to give Stephen Wooler a ring to talk to him
about the Adamoko point.

                                                                     Your Ref:




HILLSBOROUGH

1.   I have been considering the point about whether Adomako should be applied
     in this case and the extent to which the proper tests were applied by counsel in
     the 1990 advice when they went on to consider what was the appropriate test
     for involuntary manslaughter

2.   In his review, George briefly set out the applicable law in chapter 4. I have
     read and re-read Adomako this morning. The cases of Andrews and Bateman
     in 1925 and 1937 respectively indicated that gross negligence was then
      sufficient to found a conviction for manslaughter. The word ‘gross’ was not
     used on its own but was given as an example of the type of negligence under
     consideration.

3.   All would have been well had it not been for the case of Seymour in 1983
     where, in a driving case, the judge directed the jury in terms of recklessness,
     as defined in Lawrence. The House of Lords agreed that this was the correct
     approach.

4.   Despite this, Lord Mackay, in Adomako, said that Andrews was ‘the most
     authoritative statement of the present law’ and further that it was a ‘decision
     which [had] not been departed from’. I find this a little hard to reconcileffBu?
     the conclusion I am driven to is that Adomako clarified the law in thatlLard
     Mackay specifically described Bateman and Andrews as ‘satisfactory as
     providing a proper basis for describing the crime of involuntary
     manslaughter’.

5.   I argue that Adomako did not change the law but clarified it.

6.   Thus, in my view, the appropriate test to be applied is the Adomako test, as
     set out by George in paragraph 4.2 of his review.

7.   The next question is whether counsel applied the correct test in 1990.
     Interestingly, one of the counsel who advised CPS in 1990 appeared for the
     appellant in Adomako!
8.    Counsel’s advice was principally directed to ‘reckless’ manslaughter, ie.
      where a person causes the death of another intending to do an act which
      creates an obvious and serious risk of causing personal injury (a) not giving
      thought to the possibility of such risk or (b) having recognised there was some
      risk involved, nonetheless going on to take it. Clearly this is not good law
      now.

9.    Counsel went on to say (paragraph 59 of the joint opinion) ‘it may also be
      manslaughter if the person causing the death intends to do an act, or omits to
      do an act where there is a duty to do so, being grossly negligent whether death
      or serious personal injury results’. In my view this is an adequate enunciation
      of the principles now set out in Adomako.

10.   Counsel went on to say that the law was uncertain, and made reference to
      Seymour and also Kong Cheuk Kwan. Counsel particularly noted that in the
      1986 case of Goodfellow, it was said of Kong Cheuk Kwan that the question
      was whether the defendant was ‘guilty of recklessness (or gross negligence)’.
      Counsel then went on to say that they considered that the gross negligence test
      was sufficient to establish the offence of manslaughter.

11.   Unfortunately, the matter does not stop there. In the 1990 advice, counsel
      referred to the case of R v West London Coroner’s Court, ex p Gray. The
      Divisional Court held that a Coroner should direct the jury in the following
      terms where the death is alleged to have been caused by neglect by the police:

      11.1 That they had to be satisfied of four ingredients, namely (a) that the
           police were under a duty to have regard to the health and welfare of the
           deceased, (b) that in the circumstances there was a failure to do what
           should have been done for the health and welfare of the deceased, (c)
           that the failure amounted to a substantial cause of death, and (d) that the
           failure amounted to recklessness.

      11.2 That the test of ‘recklessness’ was whether a police officer, having
           regard to his duty, was indifferent to an obvious and serious risk to the
           health and welfare of the deceased or, recognising that the risk to be
           present, deliberately chose to run it by doing nothing about it

      11.3 That a failure to appreciate that there was such a risk was not itself
           sufficient to amount to recklessness and

      11.4 That the jury could only return a verdict of unlawful killing if they could
           attribute the unlawful conduct to a single police officer.

12.   It is clear from the 1990 advice, that counsel felt that these points had a direct
      bearing on their advice (para 65).

13.   Ex p Gray was cited in Adomako. Lord Mackay in approving of the use of the
      word ‘reckless’ in its ordinary sense in cases of involuntary manslaughter, said
      that ex p Gray was an example of a case where the word reckless had been
      used with complete accuracy. On the face of it, this is difficult to reconcile as
      the reference in paragraph 11.3 to recklessness appears to be something
      bordering on a Cunningham definition (note the reference to failure to
      appreciate that there was a risk not being sufficient to amount to recklessness).

14. I found the use of the word ‘indifferent’ difficult to reconcile here. I note,
     however, that failure to appreciate that there was a risk was specifically ruled
     out by the court as a sufficient state of mind for recklessness in this context.
     Accordingly, this only leaves a narrow scope for ‘indifference’ which I think
     must mean that the officer, bearing in mind his duty, must have deliberately
     shut his mind to the presence of the risk.

15.   In my view, ex p Gray cannot stand against Adomako and it should not be
      regarded as good law. How then does this leave counsel’s advice, bearing in
      mind that ex p Gray was in the forefront of their minds?

16. At paragraph 81 of the 1990 opinion, counsel were considering the position of
    the police as an organisation in relation to a possible charge of corporate
    manslaughter. The say ‘...there seems to us to be no evidence that in making
    what were undoubtedly errors of judgment and practice, the police
    organisation, or any individual within it, acted recklessly or in a grossly
    negligent manner’. This is highly significant because, even if counsel applied
    the recklessness test in ex p Gray, they also clearly considered gross
    negligence as a separate head. It must have been separate as gross negligence
    does not feature in ex p Gray.

17. So far as Mr Duckenfield is concerned, the position is more difficult. The
     weight of the opinion in paragraphs 83 to 89 is towards recklessness. At
     paragraph 88, counsel opine that the omissions to act did not     create a
     risk which was obvious at the time.

18.   Paragraph 89 says, and I quote in full: ‘We conclude, therefore, that there is
      insufficient evidence on which to found a charge of recklessness against Mr
      Duckenfield. Nor is there evidence that he was grossly negligent in failing to
      act as mentioned above. We bear in mind particularly the judgment of the
      Divisional Court in the West London Coroner’s Court case, the requirements
      of which are not in our view satisfied’.

19. Given that gross negligence and recklessness as defined in ex p Gray are
     substantially different, I am of the view that the reference in paragraph 89 to
    ex p Gray must be read as referring back to recklessness only and not to gross
     negligence. I recognise that this is a rather technical interpretation of
    paragraph 89 but I suggest it is nevertheless correct. After all, counsel quite
    properly directed themselves in the main to the current case law as understood
    by most people at the time (ie. recklessness was the test) and only added gross
     negligence out of a desire for completeness, bearing in mind their own views
    on the state of the law. It is a tribute to them that they were so accurate.
20.   If that is right, and I suggest that logically it must be, then counsel’s opinion
      can be said to have considered gross negligence manslaughter in the terms set
      out in Adomako.

Chris

Thank you for your helpful response.

I think that it w ould be a good idea to contact the Treasury Solicitor, but you might like to speak first to Stephen
Wooler (0171 271 2403), in case he has already put similar enquiries in train (or has, in some other way, already
found out the answer).

I have not looked further than the words that you quote from the Taylor report, but they do not necessarily imply
that Salmon undertakings were given. They could refer to letters sent at a later stage - after the evidence had
been given -forewarning those who were going to be criticised in the report. Such letters are not unusual and do
not carry any retrospective undertaking about self-incrimination. However, as you suggest, the letters
themselves are the best source to track down.

I had failed to appreciate that George was still away because of his wife's accident. I trust that things are
improving on that front. Thank you for holding the fort in his absence.

Para 11 of the introduction to Lord Taylor's Interim Report says:
"Where it seemed likely that any allegation or criticism might be made of the conduct of any person or any party,
the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned setting out the
likely grounds for complaint. This followed the practice established by the Royal Commission on Tribunals of
Inquiry (the Salmon Commission)."

I note that witnesses were not sworn.
I also note that the W est Midlands police inquiry was responsible direct to Lord Taylor. I make this point as it is
not clear at whether, if a Salmon letter was sent, it was sent before the W est Midlands police had taken
statements, or after that time but before the Inquiry proper started.
I suggest that T Sol is the best contact here to see whether the defendants received such letters, if so on what
terms and when.
Do you want me to contact T Sol?

I only have an old Policy file going back to 1992 - which is, obviously, not very helpful.

2. ECHR
Does the point of concern arise under Article 7 (No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of
any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national law at the time when it was
committed), or have I completely misunderstood?

I have heard from Stephen Wooler, who is working his way through the
papers. He raised two points with me. First, he wants to know whether any
form of undertaking (eg a Salmon undertaking) was given to any of the
witnesses to the Taylor Inquiry. It is an important point, of course,
because if any such undertaking was given it would presumably apply to any
transcript of the evidence of either Duckenfield or Murray. We would have
to ensure that that evidence was not used in a private prosecution in any
way that was inconsistent with the undertaking.

Does anyone know the answer to this question? I cannot remember and I have
not noticed any reference to the point in any of the papers that I have
read. Perhaps the Report itself says something. I should be grateful if
George would try to get an answer to this. I am including Curt Wise in the
recipients of this message, because he keeps the records on my behalf of
witness immunities and undertakings; but I doubt whether the records go
back as far as 1989/90. Stephen said that he would try to make enquiries
at his end, as well.

Secondly, Stephen raised the same point as me about the propriety of basing
a prosecution on Adomako, rather than the law as it was understood to be in
1990. I mentioned that Gareth Williams and Peter Birts had expressly borne
both recklessness and gross negligence in mind when advising in 1990, but
the point is still troubling Stephen and he is minded to draw it to the
attention of the Law Officers in his submission. He is concerned as to
whether there are any ECHR implications. Does anyone (including Curt, who
has concurrent interests in the ECHR, of course) want to add to this? I
told Stephen that I had been troubled by the same point and had not
accepted the advice given to me without some hesitation.

We shall need to move quite quickly on this, I think, in order to get back
to Stephen before he puts his submission up to the Law Officers. I should
be grateful if George could let me know far he has got by close tomorrow,
Tuesday

She had not received my letter of 1st December 1998,1 read it out to her and said I
would fax it to her. I said that we would not be present at court on Monday. I told
her that I had had a telephone conversation with the Listing Clerk at Leeds
Magistrates Court who had expressed the view of the Stipendiary Magistrate that the
matter should proceed. I told Ann Adlington that I had, without any disrespect, made
no comment in relation to that because I am not a party to the proceedings.

Her main reason for telephoning was to let me know that she intends to apply for
witness summons against the Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police in
relation to original witness statements in his possession. Her reason for enquiring
whether we might be at court was in case there was any question about the
documentation we held but she understood that we do not hold original witness
statements. I indicated I thought that was probably right but that my indication should
not be taken as a definite answer.

definitely there won’t be decision by 7l December, I rang him and said it was highly
unlikely that there would be a decision by 7th.

I returned a call to Karen, Listing Officer at Leeds Magistrates Court, telephone

Cadbury is of the view that the case should proceed. I said that I was in difficulty in
that I couldn’t give any indication in a CPS decision and I nothing that I said could be
construed as hinting at what the decision may or may not be, which she understood. I
said I was further in difficulties in that as I am not a party to the proceedings I did not
feel I could comment on what Mr. Cadbury was saying which she also appreciate. I
did say that I noted carefully what had been said. I did also indicate that I not intend

FILE NOTE - HILLSBOROUGH - Telephone call from Chris Newell



He hopes to get the papers off to the Attorney General’s office today. He does not
anticipate an answer before Monday, (7/12/98) the day when it is next in court.

He told me that he has discussed the matter with Philip Havers of counsel
(considering the case from a judicial review angle) Dru and Robin Booth. All agree
that we should not intervene in any way in the case. So far as the attempt pervert is
concerned, this is because this is the minor charge and our policy simply doesn’t cater
for intervening in part.

We agreed that I would write to the parties and the court informing them that we
should have a decision by 18 December 1998. He will let the Law Officers know that
we have committed ourselves to this date.

He asked me to let him know if I considered that there was a problem with this. I
said I would

In the meantime, I said we would do some work on preparing draft correspondence
which he will want to see before it goes, given the risk of judicial review. That
correspondence can be signed here at branch although it is clear that the decision is
that of Mr. Newell.

    RE: HILLSBOROUGH

    1.   Robin Booth has been asked to look at the case by Dru. He commented that
         your report was good work.

    2.   I understand that Chris Newell also has a copy.

    3.   Robin rang today and asked a couple of questions. First of all, he asked that
         you let him have copies of:

y         •    The joint counsel opinion; and

J         •    The operational order for policing the match.

    4.   So far as the pervert course of justice allegation is concerned, please can you
         let Robin know how quickly the lie was retracted.

    5.   Robin asks for some clarification on the separate positions of Duckenfield and
         Murray. At paragraph 16.17 and subsequent paragraphs you talk about the
         evidence against the officers in joint terms. Robin’s view is that some
         amplification might be necessary here, to identify with the precision the
         evidential issues against each defendant individually. I suggest that you have a
         word with Robin about this before undertaking additional work.

FILE NOTE: HILLSBOROUGH FILE




3.10 pm - 3/7/98 - CE rang Richard Manning of Walker Morris Solicitors in Leeds, 01132-
832500. Told him that the matter is being handled here at the moment, gave him my name
(which he knew of old) and that of George Croston. He has written to the Director and
kindly agreed to fax to me a copy of that letter.

Inevitably, he asks that we take over the prosecution and drop it. He did mention that he
is arguing quite strongly that the summons has been unlawfully issued. He took me
through Section 1 of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 and pointed out his argument (which
George had already spotted).

He appreciates that, if the summons is qucjghed, that is not the end of the matter. However,
i£may mean that the defendants, having been put on notice, are able to obtain advance
warning of any application to issue summonses in Sheffield.

I said that we were not going to be acting particularly quickly here as we wanted to make
sure we had considered the matter fully. I did mention that Mr. Murray’s case was not
dealt with in detail in the joint opinion of counsel. Mr. Manning did say, however that Mr.
Murray’s case is that he stands behind Mr. Duckenfield.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION 3rd JULY 1998 WITH DAVID LEATHER OF
WATTS LEATHER - TEL. 0151-236191


1       Mr. Leather asked whether we had reached any view in relation to his letter of 30
        June 1998. I said not at this stage. He pressed me to supply information or at least
        give an indication of when we would be able to do so and offered to come over to
        our offices to inspect what material we have here. He mentioned that information
        has been drip-fed in the past and it is quite difficult for them to know what exists
        and what does not. He indicated that he hoped we would be able to co-operate with
        him.

2       I indicated I was unable to assist him at this stage as we were in the very early
         stages of thinking about our response to him. He asked whether he could have an
         indication by phone early next week. I said I was unable to promise that I would
         be able to do that. He continued to press on the basis that there are time constraints
         so far as he is concerned.

3       I asked whether Ann Adlington was still involved. He said yes, she still represents
         the Hillsborough Family Support Group. As an outside lawyer, he has been drafted
         in to assist now that a private prosecution has been launched. He has only recently
         been instructed and he has set up an office and the HFSG premises.

4       I asked whether there had been a split in HFSG as reported by teletext. He said that
         this was a storm in a tea-cup that the matters had now been resolved and they were
         very much united.

                                                        HILLSBOROUGH CASE



              29.6.98

              1.         Having seen the short report in the Sunday Telegraph and on teletext, re the private
                         prosecution now commenced against the two senior police officers over the last w/e,
                         I contacted South Yorkshire Police only to find that no one was in until tomorrow.

              2.         They will ring me back tomorrow morning.

              3.         ACTION: GC to consider options based on likely representations to be made to us
                         by Chief Constable, solicitors for the two defendants or the solicitor for the HFSG.
                         IE:-

                         •            Take the case over to discontinue it

                         •            Take the case over to prosecute it

                         •            Let the private prosecution continue

              4.         The CPS Prosecution Manual Volume 1 at Chapter 7 refers. Although I have an
                          extremely full set of papers, including the bundle that was sent to me by the solicitor
                          for the HFSG in 1997, it may be that they now have more material.

              5.         While I have not yet been asked to act, or indeed have not been informed of the
                         matter by the complainants, I do have a duty under Paras 7.15 to 7.17 to consider
                         taking over the the case in the light of the previous proceedings.

              6.         CE to be consulted, and a letter should be drafted asking HFSG solicitor for a copy
                         of their papers (if any are different to what we already have). At the moment, based
                         on the evidence contained within our presentcomprehensive file,while there may
                         not be a realistic prospect of conviction there may be acase toanswer, the latter
                         being one of the tests for taking over to discontinue. I am especially mindful of the
                         m*any courts that have reviewed the case and the conclusions that they came to.

    I refer to your letter of today in which you ask:-

    (a)        W hen you will receive a response to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's letter                      of
               13 October?

                An initial response was sent yesterday, together with copies of the schedule of
                video tapes. Copies of video tapes TB3 and TB4 were sent under separate cover
                yesterday.

    (b)        Could you have a copy of the exhibits lists for Lord Taylor's Inquiry and the
                Inquests?

                 Copies of both are enclosed herewith.

    (c)        Could you have a copy of the video tape of the inquest when video C 539 was
                shown to the jury?

                 This will be forwarded to you with a separate letter once we have copied the tape
                 which will take 4 hours.

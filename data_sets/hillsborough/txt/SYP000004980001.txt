            I am a single woman living at the above address with my friend,

                                 I have    lived at the address         for a period of two years

            and, with the house                                                       from Sheffield

            Wednesday Football Ground,         I have become accustomed to the ritual                     of

            football    crowds coming and going and have previously witnessed                       crowds

            on cup semi~0i nal d a y s .     I have been a life long supporj^fr of

            Sheffield Wednesday and do,        together with friends,                 regularly visit

            the grourya to watch g a m e s .

            On Friday 14th April       1989 <140489)    I was given an opportunity to

            purchase some tickets for the cup semi-final which was due to be

            played at the ground on the following day between Liverpoo 1 and

            Nottingham Forrest.        The tickets were from a friend who knew somebody

            in the box office.        We had no choice in where the tickets were for
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S493

and paid £6 for the ticket to stand in the Spi on Hop end where the

Nottingha m Forrest fans were to be placed.

The other friends who purchased tickets were                              and two

f ri e n d s ,             and                    (can be contacted on Sheffield



On the morning of Saturday 15th April              1989 (150489),   I got up very

early because I knew if I was to go shopping              I would want to beat the

crowd.           It must have been 9 am (0900) when I left the house       in

company with                     I   noticed as we left that, already one or two

cars had arrived and were arriving which clearly contained football

supporters although I could not say of which team.

We went towards Sheffield City Centre.               It would be fair to say at

this stage the crowd was already beginning to arrive and a few

people, wearing         red and white      colours, were already milling about      in

the Peniston Rd area although I could not say I saw anything

untoward.          J. remember thinking that with the     crowd already arriving

:i.n private vehicles       it was most unusual      for the police not to have

cordoned off the side roads              in the immediate vicinity of the ground.

We must have been shopping for a good two and a half hours and

returned to park the car outside the house around              11.30 am (1130).

Again,      excepting the volume of fans at that early stage,          I would

not say there was anythi ng remarkable about what             I saw.

I still had shopping to fetch so                     and I decided to walk to the

Gateway Food Store on the Halifax Rd nearby to fetch the few

remaining items.          It would be about 12.30 pm <1230) when we set off,

having stopped at home for a bite to eat.               We walked down our road to

Leppings Ln and I remember the barriers being across the road and

manned.

As we got into Leppings Ln I saw there was already a number of fans

trickling towards the ground.               As we turned the corner, and passed
                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                       S498

the traffic       island into Halifax Rd,             I would say that       is when I saw

the crowds       really arriving.

There were       coach loads of fans unloading              in the road just past the

Niagara Police Club.             It, was my opinion that the volume of crowd was

thousands as opposed to hundreds.                    The   Pans were wearing red and

white and were in quite a boisterous rnood.                     I could tell that they

were Liverpool         fans as they were shouting to one another.                  I recall

hearing several         people shouting across,            "Let's go find pub."       They

all headed off up Halifax Rd                (the opposite direction to the ground)

with a sense of urgency.

As we walked up Halifax Rd we started to mingle with the crowds.                             I

did notice that there was a heavy police presence but the police were

quite clearly saturated in the vicinity of the public houses and more

sparse    inbetween.
                                                                  /
It was as we were walking along                in an area^fcWe pa 1 ice we re not so

heavily patrolling that Liverpool                   people were asking around to see if

they could purchase tickets.                 T h e y w e r e all Liverpool   people asking

and were all       in late teens or early twenties.

On seeing this I commented to                          that on the day of last year's

semi-final,       people were trying to sell tickets and this year they

were trying to buy.                             ,
                                               L^CT           *H-C ■
By now a steady s t r e arp^'o f the people coming down we r ey € r i nk i ng from

beer    cans and b e t ^ b o t t l e s ,   not only this,      they i^re also     carrying
                                                                      /
four    packs        cans.

By the time we had reached Wads 1ey Bridge,                    I noti ced that the p o 1i ce

presence had withered down to nothing which surprised me in view of

the number of people and shops                in that area.

The people drinking from cans were,                  by now,    the vast majority of the

people     in that area and I would not say they were sipping from the

cans,    rather they were          consuming alcohol ajar fast as possible.            I
                                                                          PAGE        4

would not say I saw anyone drunk but they were all         in high spirits

and drinking as if it were go'              “ “    ‘'

As we crossed the road to go to the Gateway SujyfYmarket, the f o o t b a l 1

supporters were stood in grou                                       es.     I

also saw a steady stream of fans going in and out of the supermarket,

obviously purchasing more.

We went    into the supermarket and whilst we were near the off-licence

section I watched a steady stream of fans going through.          I remember

overhearing some supporters discussing which beer to buy,         they were

placing great emphasis on which were the strongest and I saw nearly

each supporter was going through the checkout with two four         packs.

The beer   I witnessed being bought was not cheap brand names but

rather the most expensive Pilsner Lagers such as Stella Artois.             I

knew the people buying the beer were from Liverpool         because of their

accents and,   in my mind,   from what   I. was overhearing and seeing,

there was a large element who were not only keen to drink as much as

they could but were all out to get drunk.         The sort of supporters        I

saw were all male, white,    aged IS yrs to 25 y s , and, whilst we were

in the area,   no more than a minute,     some   18 to 20 supporters must

have gone past and more were coming through.

We left the supermarket and rushed back as we had to meet friends.

The journey back was similar     in route and the obvious thing that

struck you was the size of the crowd and the fact the majority was

still drinking.    The atmosphere had livened up and I would say a

                     demeanour       language. „ e re on             t. being

drjank.

On the way back down to the house, again in the non-policed areas,               we

were approached by numerous M o p l e    with Liverpool accents asking to

purchase ti ckets.   In no vsyBre than 100 yards we must have been

asked by

Although I refer to Halifax Rd being partially n o n ~ p o 1i c e d , it would

only be fair to say that the police were             in control.    In fact,     I

witnessed a policeman telling one supporter               to pick up litter he had

dropped.

We must have got back to the house by 1.10 pm (1310).                Our fri e n d s ,

      and      , arrived about          1.30 pm (1330) and at about 1.43 pm

(1345) we all set off via Penistone Rd to the match.

We had purchased the tickets the day prior through a friend and the

tickets meant we were to be standing with the Nottingham Forrest fans

in the Spion H o p .

We walked to the ground and were inside within ten minutes.                  One

thing that was noticeable was that the fans on the way to that                   part

of the ground were not drinking,             but that may well   have been due to

proximity to the ground.        The fans, who I took to be Nottingham

Forrest fans,    were a lot less boisterous than the Liverpool              fans that

we had seen.

When we got in the ground I w a s s u r p r i s e d          by the lack of smell

of alcohol which I had expecVed not having had a drink.
                                    /
We would have been in the Spion Kop on a barrier near the North Stand

side and stood chatting and looking about the ground.                I remember

thinking and commenting amongst ourselves             that   it was strange having

a section of Liverpool       fans       in the Kop by the North Stand but       I would

have to say no trouble did occur and that area                   we 11 poli ced.     I

do not feel    I could offer any more relevant            information,   save to say

t h a t , in my opinion,   by 2.20 pm (1420)       the/terraced central areas

below the West, Stand appeared a l r e a d y J i a   be full to capacity (pens 3

and 4 on ground m a p ).     It was notiireable that the wings of the

terraces still had space but as/more             people   came in from the centre
----------------------------
they did not fill out.



                                                                    .........

nothing more I could really add except to say when they did come out

there was a surge,          quite noticeable,     in the terraces   I now know as

pen,                    r      I           ^

The game kicked off at about 3 pm (1500) and I w o u l d ^ a y          just ‘"four

minutes after that time there was a not i ceabl ej^Tve as fans              in pens

3 and 4 appeared to crush forward.               The mo^rtent was as much to the

right and left as forward.

The next thing I noticed            was some sp'ft of chaos   in the area of      pens 3

and 4,    people were being pulled up into the West Stand,            people     were

being let onto the pitch.            I did not realise what had happened but I

think the feeling was in            theNottingham Forrest end that the

Liverpool    fans were causing trouble.

Shortly after the players had gone off I could see a jdktizen L i v e r p o o l

supporters who I assume had got through the fences                come running down

to the Spion Kop end.  They were waving f istj s and beckoning at the
                                         ”      V
Forrest fans in a gesture I understood 'X jsT 'h e a~^Fios'tl I e '~ac t^ In

hindsight,    I suppose they might not brave realised what was going on,

but,    nevertheless,       their actionsywere those of hooligans.         The   police

cleared these hooligans off tfoe pitch.              In my opinion,   the police

cordon formed following thsr removal of these hooligans was a wise and

sensible    precaution in view of the number of Liverpool             fans now

spilled onto the pitch.            I could not    particularly describe these

youths but they were all from the Liverpool              end and were of varying

ages,    in red and white       colours.

By about 4.10 pm (1610),           the crowd received the first public

announcement to the effect that they should remain in the ground to

allow emergency servies to get through.               There was still no

explanation given as to the type of incident that we were witnessing.

I would like to say that there was,              from time to time,   spasmodic

applause from the Nottingham Forrest fans but              I would say that was         in

         appreciation of the brave efforts of people tending to the dead and

          i nju red .

         The scene      I saw from a distance was in, my opinion,          chaos.   I accept

          the police cordon was necessary but I felt the police watching the

         Nottingham Forrest fans specifically was unwarranted.                From where   I

         was      I would say I saw a person lying obviously unconscious o n the

         Agrass being tendered to by fans who clearly did not understand first

      /y' a id.     I am a trained first aider and I can say that, although he may

          ifeve already died or may have died in any case,            the method of heart

          ,o heart massage     I saw being given by fans was frantic and hopelessly

          .na dequat e.    I assume he died as he was        later carried out covered

         up.      The m a n had black h a i r , was wearing jeans and I think a dark

          coloured t-shirt.      I could not describe any of the fans trying to

          revive him but there were about ten around him.

         My other observations would be at no time did any person appear to be

          taking charge of the situation.

          It was not until the fire brigade         arrived with what I took to be

          resuscitation equipment was      put to good use and the assistance given

          to injured people appeared to be carried on more effectively.

          I suppose     it would have been 4.45 pm (1645)        that we left the ground

          and returned home.      I was very distressed as I realised my brother

         was working at the match in the capacity of plain clothed police

          officer but I soon learned he was safe.

          I would be prepared to attend the             enquiry ifrequired.

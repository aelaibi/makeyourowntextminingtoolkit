AT FIRST THE FOREST SUPPORTERS WERE BOO-I.NG, THINKING THAT THE

LIVERPOOL FANS WERE FIGHTING BUT WHEN THEY SAW PEOPLE BEING

CARRIED OFF THEY STARTED CLAPPING AND ENCOURAGING THE HELPERS.

THE AMBULANCE WERE SLIGHTLY HINDERED BY THE SPECTATORS ON THE

PITCH,   OTHERWISE EVERYONE DID THE BEST TO H E L P .




FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE AS A TURNSTILE O P E R A T O R „ IS THERE

ANYTHING SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS MATCH WHICH

IN YOUR OPINION MADE IT DIFFERENT FROM SIMILAR PREVIOUS

MATCHES?



MY OWN OPINIONS    IS THAT THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE GIVEN THE

WRONG END BECAUSE OF THEIR LARGE FOLLOWERS.

Q 4 8 « IS THE IRE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU f-t.EL IS VI iAL       iO

       THIS JUDICIAL     INQUIRY?



       I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A DELAYED KICK OFF TO

       LET THE FANS IN BECAUSE I THINK THEY'VE DONE IT BEFORE WHEN

       T H E R E ’S BEEN A LARGE CROWD O U T S I D E ,   I ALSO THINK THAT

       THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POLICE AT THE LEPPINGS LN THAN

       THERE WAS ON THAT D A Y , KNOWING THAT THERE WAS A LARGE CROWD

       OUTSIDE IN LEPPINGS LN.

       I ALSO FEEL THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR THE CLUB TO PUT IN THE

       PARTITION FENCES IN THE LEPPINGS LN END,




Q49.   IT HAY BE ALLEGED THAT YOU ALLOWED SUPPORTERS THROUGH YOUR

       TURNSTILE WHO HAD NO TICKET AND THAT YOU MAY HAVE THEREFORE

       INCREASED THE NUMBER OF AUTHORISED SPECTATORS TO THE GROUND

       IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO SAY AT THIS TIME IN RELATION

       TO THAT POSSIBLE FUTURE ALLEGATION?



       THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO GOT IN WITHOUT TICKETS WERE THOSE WHO JUMPED

       OVER THE TURNSTILES AND T H E R E ’S NOTHING I CAN DO ABOUT T H A T ,

       NORMALLY THERE IS EITHER POLICE OFFICERS OR STEWARDS DEALING

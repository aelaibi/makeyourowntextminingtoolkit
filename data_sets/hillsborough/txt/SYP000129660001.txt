1.0   Steelwork

      1.1    The work shall be executed by labour competent
             for the class of work on which it is employed
             and is to be under the direction of an
             experienced and competent supervisor.
             All work shall be done to the satisfaction of
             Eastwood & Partners, hereinafter called the
             Engineer.  B.S.449 together with other relevant
             British Standards and the clauses specified in
             this documents shall apply as the minimum
             standard of acceptance.

      1.2   No shop or site work of any kind shall be sub­
             let without the approval of the Engineer.
            Submissions in this respect shall give details
            of the work involved and the names of the firms
            proposed.

      1.3   The principal dimensions for setting out the
            work shall be those shown on the Drawings,
            which are to be read in conjunction with all
            further drawings issued by the Engineer.

             The Contractor shall allow in his tender for
             obtaining all dimensions from site necessary to
             ensure that the steelwork he is supplying
             matches to the existing steelwork and building
             structure and fabric.

      1.4   If any steel sections shown on the drawings are
            unobtainable, the tenderer shall include for
            the cost of substitutions required by him of
            sections of no less strength than those shown.

      1.5   All materials shall be of British manufacture
            throughout.   All steel shall comply with B.S.
            4360 grade 43A.

      1.6   All workmanship shall be of first class quality
            in every respect; the greatest accuracy being
            observed to ensure that all members will fit
            properly together on erection.

      1.7   All plates shall be flattened and all bars and
            sections straightened and made free from twist
            before any other work is done on them, so that
            when assembled the adjacent surfaces shall be
             in close contact throughout.  The methods
             adopted for the above shall be such as not to
             injure or mark the material.



                              4
1.8    All cut edges must be straight and true and
       rounded off. Any burring, fash or sharp edges
       and corners shall be removed for the safety of
       the general public.  Hand flame cutting must
       not be used except where the cut is subsequently
       machined or ground to shape.

1.9    Washers, nuts and bolts shall be galvanised.
       The bolts shall be grade 4.6 to BS.4190, style 3

       on the Drawings.

       The nuts shall be grade 4.6 to BS.4190, and
       washers to BS.4360 shall be fitted under the nut
       of every bolt.  All nuts shall be spanner tight
       and a proprietory locking compound employed,
       'Loctite’ or similar approved, used to prevent
       subsequent undoing.

1.10   Over the areas of welding, the steel is to be
       cleaned down to bright metal to remove all paint,
       rust, oil and any other deleterious matter or
       contaminants.  No site welding shall be carried
       out when rain is falling or in conditions of high
       wind.  No welding shall be done if the surfaces
       of the work are wet.

       Electrodes compatible with the grade of material
       being welded shall be used throughout and shall
       be stored and used in accordance with the
       manufacturer’s recommendations. Damp or damaged
       electrodes shall not be used.

       All slag and spatter shall be cleaned off every
       run of weld metal.

       In addition to full supervision by the Contractor
       and inspection in accordance with BS.5289, if in
       the opinion of the Engineer, the quality or
       strength of any weld is in question this weld is
       to be completely removed and the piece re-welded.
       No payment will be made in respect of time lost
       for carrying out any remedial work.

1.11   Welded box or hollow sections shall be sealed off
       and made airtight to the satisfaction of the
       Engineer, to prevent corrosion of the inside.

1.12   Surfaces which will ultimately be welded or in
       contact with concrete or asphalt, shall be free
       of paint or any other applied finish, oil, dirt,
       rust and scale.   No paint shall be placed within
       7 5mm of a surface subsequently to be welded.  The
       inside surfaces of sealed box sections may remain
       unpainted.




                         5
      1.13   Permanent connections shall not be made until

      2.1    All surfaces of the steelwork are to be blast
              cleaned to second quality as defined in BS.4232.

      2.2    All painting materials described in this section
              are to be products of a recognised paint
              manufacturer to the approval of the Engineer.
              One coat of Alkyd gloss is to be applied over
              one coat of undercoat over a prepared priming
              coat.

      2.3    All paints shall be thoroughly mixed before use
              unless there is a specific instruction to the
              contrary on the container.  They shall be stored
              so as to minimise exposure to extremes of
              temperature.  All painting is to be carried out
              strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's
              instructions.

      2.4    After blast cleaning all surfaces of the steelwork
              shall receive one coat of a high build zinc
              phosphate primer, applied no later than two hours
              after being cleaned.  Care is to be taken to
              ensure that all edges of the members are fully
              covered.

      2.5    Primed or undercoated metalwork shall not be
              left in an exposed or unsuitable situation for
              an undue period before completing the painting
              process.

      2.6    The steelwork is not to be delivered to site
             until the priming paint has hardened.  After
             erection, lining and levelling all blemishes,
             erection damage and welds are to be wire brushed
             and cleaned to remove all rust, dirt and
             contaminants.  The surfaces are then to be primed
             as described in 2.4.

      2.7    No exterior or exposed painting shall be carried
             out under adverse weather conditions such as
             extremes of temperature or during rain, fog, etc.

      2.8    When all priming paint has dried and hardened one
             Alkyd undercoat shall be applied followed by one
             Alkyd gloss coat after the undercoat has dried.

            aggregate 20mm graded, two parts of fine aggregate
             and one part of cement all measured by weight.

      4.3   Coarse aggregate shall consist of Derbyshire lime­
            stone graded to the limits    given in Table 1 of
            BS.882.  Fine aggregate shall consist of clean
            hard coarse naturally occurring sand graded to
            the limits of Zone 2 given in Table 2 of BS.882.
            Cement shall be Ordinary Portland Cement and shall
            comply in all respects with the requirements of
            BS.12.

            25mm measured as the pouring of the batch commences
            and at a time not more than 20 minutes after the
            commencement of mixing.

      4.5   Ready-mixed concrete from an approved supplier
            shall be used.  Each delivery of concrete must be
            accompanied by a delivery note stating the exact
            weights of materials and water content, and the
            time at which water was added to the mix.

            against sun, wind and rain by suitable covering.

      4.8   All concrete shall be thoroughly vibrated using
            an emersion type poker to ensure maximum density.




                            7
4.9    Before placing concrete the excavations are to
       be cleaned out to remove all loose material or
       debris and the bottom well rammed to give a firm
       surface.  Concrete shall be placed in a single
       operation to the full depth of the bases.

4.10   All concrete surfaces, except those covered by
       formwork, shall be cured by either keeping wet
       for seven days or using a proprietory curing
       agent.  Curing shall commence at the earliest
       possible time following placing of the concrete.

4.11   Shuttering shall be ply or soft wood and be
       removed gently so as not to damage the concrete
       surface.   Any concrete which is in the opinion
       of the Engineer insufficiently dense, out of line,
       of unsightly finish shall be cut out and made
       good at the Contractor's expense. Rendering over
        any surface shall not be permitted.

4.12   Horizontal surfaces shall be accurately screeded
       to levels which match the existing terrace steps
       or slabs.  The concrete shall be trowelled
       smooth followed by brushing over with a stiff
       brush.

       Vertical surfaces shall be as struck from the
       shuttering.   The risers shall line through
       exactly with the vertical edge of the existing
       terrace step.   A chamfer or arrise shall be
       formed on the nose of the step to match the
       existing.

                       cleaned off before painting.

   e.                  The undercoat is "grinning" through the gloss coat
                       in many places and there are numerous "misses" on
                       the top coat.

   f.                  Please clean the paint off the terrace and walls.

   g.                  The south gate binds on the catch bar.

   h.                  There is a loose blue brick adjacent to the south
                       gate post where a drilled hole has been abandoned.

                       side of the south fence 600mm from its support.
                       Please grind or file smooth the ends of the tubes.

                                                                     Registered in England - No. 1134531

e.    Please remove the bolts through the precast concrete,
       units and repair the spalled concrete with an epoxy
       based mortar.   After the mortar has reached strength
       re-install the bolts and fencing.


       General
a.    Have padlocks and keys been handed over to the
       Employer?   If not, this should be done without delay.

b.    Please run a mastic fillet round all backing and
       base plates to prevent moisture penetrating to the
       bolts.

       to the gates is not as shown on the drawings.
       Please remove all these plates and replace with new.

Dear Eric,
                       Radial Fences and Oates
         We. have today forwarded a certificate for the payment
of   ^       to Bless Vale (Fabrications) Ltd. for work on the
new gates at the back of the West Stand. The originalis
enclosed. A copy of the certificate together with a
statement will again be presented to you by Bless Vale.

         As requested we have obtained a price from Bless Vale
for repairing the six stanchions round the boundary wall
near gate *0'.      They have given a figure of ^ f o r -
this work, plus VAT.      We have recently had some similar
work done by another contractor at a chemical works in
Immingham. The rates given by Bless Vale are very much in
line with these after accounting for breaking out the
concrete round the base of the stanchions. We therefore
recommend that the price given by Bless Vale is accepted.
         Last week John Strange spoke to Mr. J. Altken from
the B.B.C., about a proposed extension to the existing
camera platform walkway in the South Stand.

         Mr. Altken said that because of our local knowledge
and familiarity with the structure and procedures with
8.T.C.C. it would be less expensive for the club if we
dealt with the extension.      He is probably correct in his
thinking but we do not know what financial arrangements exist
between the Club and the B.B.C.   Perhaps we can discuss this
with you in the next few days.

     Their proposals arrived last Friday.   Single copies of
their letter together with sketches are enclosed.




                                    Tours sincerely,

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.,
Hillsborough,
SHEFFIELD. 86 18W:

Dear Eric,
                  Security Gates

      As explained by John Strange yesterday we have
negotiated a price with Blessvale (Fabrications) Ltd of
£1030 for the gates at the back of the West 1 m . We feel
this is a fair price and consistant with the cost of the
other gates. Following your agreement yesterday we confirn
that we have instructed the Contractor to proceed with
fabrication.
      We have also today forwarded a certificate for the
payment of       to Blessvale (Fabrications) Ltd for work on the
fences and first set of gates. The original is enclosed. A copy
of the certificate together with a statement will be presented
to you by Blessvale.
      The contingency iten of 4    remains almost untouched
and it seems reasonably clear that if you so wish this could
be set against the cost of the new gates.
      We have retained ff   for Blessvale's account which will
not be released until they have cleaned the paint off the walls
and floors. They have apologised for the mess and we understand
are making genuine attempts to clean the surfaces.


                                          Yours sincerel/,

There is a loose blue brick adjacent to the south
gate post where a drilled hole has been abandoned.

Dear Sirs,
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
               Radial Fences and Gates
     We noticed last Saturday that the gates round the
north stand have still not been completed, despite your
assurances to the contrary.
     Furthermore, one of the radial fences at Leppings
Lane has not been painted.
     We have been patient with you so far but may we
remind you that the work should have been completed by
23 October. A delay of over four weeks on a contract
this size is quite unacceptable and you are In great
danger of jeopardising your prospect of gaining
future work. Would you please return to the ground and
complete the whole of the work within the next two days.




                 Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                    Radial Fences and Gates

     This morning the G.P.O. returned a letter wo had sent
to you on 18 September. The envelope as you will see is
clearly addressed but seems to have gone astray in the post.

     The letter is of course an important one and will form
part of the contract between the successful tenderer and
the Employer.

     We enclose the letter and would be grateful if you can
confirm that your Tender Sum is not altered by the contents
of the letter.

     Most of the items mentioned in the letter were discussed
with you on site.

                                   Yours faithfully,
                                                           I

Dear Eric,
              Radial Fences at Leggings Lane lad
                      and Security Gates

      We have now received four completed tenders for the
radial fences and gate®.    Two I opened yesterday afternoon
in the presence of John Strange. The other two firms
telephoned their tender sums and have since delivered their
documents to the office.
      The total tender suras received are as follows

      Blessvale Fabrications Ltd.              £
      George Shaw Engineering (Sheffield) Ltd. £
      Norman Tate fc Sons Ltd.                     £
      Downings (Barnsley) Ltd.                     £ _____
      lach tender includes a contingency sum of £200 which
may   ormay not  need to beexpended. We asked the tenderers
to pricetheradial    fences and gates separately.          These are
itemised below.

      George Shaw
      Norman Tate
      Downings       (tender sum not i t e m i s e d ) |
     The work Is to be completed before 23 October providing
the successful tenderer can start work no later than 28
September. Tenderers were made aware of the first team
fixtures and they have allowed in their price for clearing
up and making the ground safe before these matches.

     Blessvale have worked under our control on several jobs.
The quality of their work is to a good standard and they
have never been difficult when dealing with claims or valuing
additional works. We therefore recommend that the tender
received from Blessvale Fabrication Ltd. is accepted.

                          Radial Fences and Gates
                     Further to the discussions during the visit to site
               with Mr. Strange on Tuesday 15 September we write to
               confirm the following items raised either by yourself or
               by a representative of one of the other contractors
               preparing tender prices for the work.


                     1.     The concrete base shown round the bottom post
                            of the south fence, drawing 3563/1,                                                            is not to
                              be constructed because of the drain in front
                              of the concrete perimeter wall.                                                        The post shown
                              is to be extended in height and welded top and
                              bottom to the horizontal angles of the fence.
                            Allow for cutting the existing mesh and welding
                              back to the new post.                                                Provide a 12 mm thick




                                                           R e g iste re d in     E n g la n d -   No. 1134531
                                                                   SHEET   2 .


EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




                 base plate with two 16 mm diameter self drilled,
                 or resin fixed bolts.


            2.   Allow for breaking out an average depth of 100 mm
                 of existing concrete terrace.   The units are
                 usually lightly reinforced with say four
                 longitudinal 4mm diameter wires.


            3.   The material below the terrace is likely to be
                 a mixture of ash, and clay with some brick rubble.
                 There is the possibility of encountering old
                 timber sleepers beneath the terrace.   Please allow
                 for sawing these out.


            4.   Instead of constructing a concrete base round the
                 post shown on elevation B, drawing 3563/3 please
                 provide a 12 mm thick base plate with two 16 mm
                 diameter self drilled or resin fixed anchors.


            5.   Please rake out the joints of the boundary wall
                 shown on elevation 2, drawing 3563/2 before
                 re-pointing.


            6.   Two gates, shown on elevation 3563/2 are required.
                 One at the top of each ramp into the north stand.


            7.   The existing concrete walls at the top of the
                 ramps are reinforced.   Please make allowance for
                 this when drilling for the fixings.


            8.   The ground is usually open Monday to Friday from
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




                 08.00 until 17.00 but arrangements can be made
                 with the staff for working outside these hours.


            9.   You must clear up and vacate the ground before
                 10.00 on the day of a Saturday home game and
                 16.30 on the day of an evening home game.

                   Sheffield Wednesday Foobball Club
    Because of the delay in completing the strengthening
of the boundary fence and the crush barriers which showed
signs of distress under the test load, I thought it
appropriate to send a progress report to South Yorkshire
County Council.   A copy of my letter to Mr. Vaughan is
attached.
    I     am not sure whether you would like to carry out a
further inspection before I send off my formal note to the
County Council. II so, I should be very grateful if you
could contact John Strange to make the necessary arrangements,


                               Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
    Thank you   for your letter of 8 September. I am grateful
to you for accepting our letter of 2 September   as giving
the formal      21days notice under paragraph 5(2)of     the
General Safety Certificate.
    Tenders have to be returned by 23 September and we shall
be reporting to the club shortly thereafter.    Normally the
contractor would ccramence on site in not more than about two
weeks from receipt of order.    Thus work is likejry to begin
in early October subject to there being no objection from the
County Council.
    We may be wishing to place the formal order for the work
on about 24 or 25 September so that if there is the likelihood
of suggestions for major changes to our proposed scheme, I should
be grateful if I could have notice by that time.

                                  Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
    As previously intimated to you we carried out tests
oU approximately one fifth of the crush barriers in July and
also made a preliminary inspection in company with Mr. Sheriff.
    One or two of the crush barriers showed signs of distress
under the test load and along a length of the boundary fence of
the Kop at the North East corner it was discovered that certain
of the stays were rusted through.   Remedial work has now been
carried out and the defective crush barriers have been successfully
subjected to the test load.   We shall be inviting Mr, Sheriff
to inspect the remedial work in the next few days following
which X will issue a certificate on the lines of that which I
sent to you last year.

with the Installation of Radial Fences and Gates


Steelwork

1.1   The work shall be executed by labour competent
      for the class of work on which it is employed
      and is to be under the direction of an
      experienced and competent supervisor.
      All work shall be done to the satisfaction of
      Eastwood & Partners, hereinafter called the
      Engineer. B.S.449 together with other relevant
      British Standards and the clauses specified in
      this documents shall apply as the minimum
      standard of acceptance.
1.2   No shop or site work of any kind shall be sub­
       let without the approval of the Engineer.
       Submissions in this respect shall give details
      of the work involved and the names of the firms
       proposed.
1.3   The principal dimensions for setting out the
      work shall be those shown on the Drawings,
      which are to be read in conjunction with all
       further drawings issued by the Engineer.

      The Contractor shall allow in his tender for
      obtaining all dimensions from site necessary to
      ensure that the steelwork he is supplying
      matches to the existing steelwork and building
      structure and fabric.
1.4   If any steel sections shown on the drawings are
       unobtainable, the tenderer shall include for
       the cost of substitutions required by him of
       sections of no less strength than those shown.
1.5   All materials shall be of British manufacture
       throughout. All steel shall comply with B.S.
       4360 grade 43A.
1.6   All workmanship shall be of first class quality
       in every respect; the greatest accuracy being
       observed to ensure that all members will fit
       properly together on erection.

1.7   All plates shall be flattened and all bars and
       sections straightened and made free from twist
       before any other work is done on them, so that
       when assembled the adjacent surfaces shall be
       in close contact throughout. The methods
       adopted for the above shall be such as not to
       injure or mark the material.
1.8    All cut edges must be straight and true and
       rounded off. Any burring, fash or sharp edges
       and corners shall be removed for the safety of
       the general public. Hand flame cutting must
       not be used except where the cut is subsequently
       machined or ground to shape.

1.9    Washers, nuts and bolts shall be galvanised.
       The bolts shall be grade 4.6 to BS.4190, style 3
       from Selfix (Celtite) Ltd., self drill anchors
       from Phillips Drill Co. Ltd., as and where noted
       on the Drawings.
       The nuts shall be grade 4.6 to BS.4190, and
       washers to BS.4360 shall be fitted under the nut
       of every bolt. All nuts shall be spanner tight
       and a proprietory locking compound employed,
       'Loctite' or similar approved, used to prevent
       subsequent undoing.
1.10   Over the areas of welding, the steel is to be
       cleaned down to bright metal to remove all paint,
       rust, oil and any other deleterious matter or
       contaminants. No site welding shall be carried
       out when rain is falling or in conditions of high
       wind. No welding shall be done if the surfaces
       of the work are wet.
       Electrodes compatible with the grade of material
       being welded shall be used throughout and shall
       be stored and used in accordance with the
       manufacturer's recommendations. Damp or damaged
       electrodes shall not be used.
       All slag and spatter shall be cleaned off every
       run of weld metal.
       In addition to full supervision by the Contractor
       and inspection in accordance with BS.5289, if in
       the opinion of the Engineer, the quality or
       strength of any weld is in question this weld is
       to be completely removed and the piece re-welded.
       No payment will be made in respect of time lost
       for carrying out any remedial work.

1.11   Welded box or hollow sections shall be sealed off
       and made airtight to the satisfaction of the
       Engineer, to prevent corrosion of the inside.

1.12   Surfaces which will ultimately be welded or in
       contact with concrete or asphalt, shall be free
       of paint or any other applied finish, oil, dirt,
       rust and scale. No paint shall be placed within
       7 5mm of a surface subsequently to be welded. The
       inside surfaces of sealed box sections may remain
       unpainted.



                         5
      1.13   Permanent connections shall not be made until
             proper alignment has been obtained.


2.0   Painting
      2.1    All surfaces of the steelwork are to be blast
             cleaned to second quality as defined in BS.4232.

      2.2    All painting materials described in this section
              are to be products of a recognised paint
             manufacturer to the approval of the Engineer.
             One coat of Alkyd gloss is to be applied over
             one coat of undercoat over a prepared priming
             coat.
      2.3    All paints shall be thoroughly mixed before use
             unless there is a specific instruction to the
             contrary on the container. They shall be stored
             so as to minimise exposure to extremes of
              temperature. All painting is to be carried out
             strictly in accordance with the manufacturer's
              instructions.
      2.4    After blast cleaning all surfaces of the steelwork
             shall receive one coat of a high build zinc
             phosphate primer, applied no later than two hours
             after being cleaned. Care is to be taken to
             ensure that all edges of the members are fully
             covered.
      2.5    Primed or undercoated metalwork shall not be
              left in an exposed or unsuitable situation for
              an undue period before completing the painting
              process.
      2.6    The steelwork is not to be delivered to site
              until the priming paint has hardened. After
              erection, lining and levelling all blemishes,
              erection damage and welds are to be wire brushed
              and cleaned to remove all rust, dirt and
              contaminants. The surfaces are then to be primed
              as described in 2.4.
      2.7    No exterior or exposed painting shall be carried
              out under adverse weather conditions such as
              extremes of temperature or during rain, fog, etc.
      2.8    When all priming paint has dried and hardened one
              Alkyd undercoat shall be applied followed by one
              Alkyd gloss coat after the undercoat has dried.

            materials shall conform with B.S. Code of Practice
            CP.110.
      4.2   All concrete shall consist of four parts of coarse
            aggregate 20mm graded, two parts of fine aggregate
            and one part of cement all measured by weight.
      4.3   Coarse aggregate shall consist of Derbyshire lime­
            stone graded to the limits    given in Table 1 of
            BS.882. Fine aggregate shall consist of clean
            hard coarse naturally occurring sand graded to
            the limits of Zone 2 given in Table 2 of BS.882.
            Cement shall be Ordinary Portland Cement and shall
            comply in all respects with the requirements of
            BS.12.
      4.4   The slump of the concrete shall be 50 mm + or -
            25mm measured as the pouring of the batch commences
            and at a time not more than 20 minutes after the
            commencement of mixing.

      4.5   Ready-mixed concrete from an approved supplier
            shall be used. Each delivery of concrete must be
            accompanied by a delivery note stating the exact
            weights of materials and water content, and the
            time at which water was added to the mix.

      4.6   The concrete shall be transported from the
            batching plant and be in its final position within
             45 minutes after mixing commenced.

      4.7   All concrete shall be protected during
             transportation and when in its final position,
             against sun, wind and rain by suitable covering.

      4.8   All concrete shall be thoroughly vibrated using
             an emersion type poker to ensure maximum density.




                            7
4.9    Before placing concrete the excavations are to
        be cleaned out to remove all loose material or
        debris and the bottom well rammed to give a firm
       surface. Concrete shall be placed in a single
       operation to the full depth of the bases.

4.10   All concrete surfaces, except those covered by
       formwork, shall be cured by either keeping wet
       for seven days or using a proprietory curing
       agent. Curing shall commence at the earliest
       possible time following placing of the concrete.
4.11   Shuttering shall be ply or soft wood and be
       removed gently so as not to damage the concrete
       surface. Any concrete which is in the opinion
       of the Engineer insufficiently dense, out of line,
       of unsightly finish shall be cut out and made
       good at the Contractor's expense. Rendering over
        any surface shall not be permitted.

4.12   Horizontal surfaces shall be accurately screeded
       to levels which match the existing terrace steps
       or slabs. The concrete shall be trowelled
       smooth followed by brushing over with a stiff
       brush.

       Vertical surfaces shall be as struck from the
       shuttering. The risers shall line through
       exactly with the vertical edge of the existing
       terrace step. A chamfer or arrise shall be
       formed on the nose of the step to match the
       existing.

Dear Eric,
               Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End
                       and Security Gates

     We have pleasure in enclosing two copies of our drawings
3383/1, 2 and 3 showing details of the two radial fences at
the Leppings Lane end and the various security gates round the
north stand.
     Copies of these drawings have been sent to David Vaughan
asking for comments on the arrangement of the radial fences.
A copy of our letter to him is also enclosed.
     In the meantime we shall issue tender documents and have
the work organised ready to start in the next few weeks.



                                  Yours sincerely,

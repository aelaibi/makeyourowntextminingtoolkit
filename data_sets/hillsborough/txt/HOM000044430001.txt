As you will be aware, I have now published Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's report of
his scrutiny of evidence on the Hillsborough Disaster.

I understand that, as part of his scrutiny, you raised certain issues with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith about the circumstances and the police documentation
relating to the tragic death of your son, Andrew.

The Judge dealt with these concerns, and those of other families, in appendix 9
of his report to me. In view of the personal nature of the material in the
appendix, I have decided that the relevant passages should be sent direct to the
families concerned rather than included in the published report.

I therefore, enclose a copy of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's comments.

Andrew Sefton

I met Mr and Mrs Sefton, Andrew’s parents, in Liverpool together with their daughter
and son-in-law and Professor Scraton. Counsel for the Family Support Group also
discussed Andrew Sefton’s case in their written submission to me.

Both at my meeting with his family and in Counsel’s written submission to me it was
said that police officers had made inconsistent statements about Andrew Sefton. The
two officers concerned are PC Shipley and PC Kearney.

PC Shipley made two statements and I was told that these were inconsistent with each
other. In an undated statement, he said that only when he reached the Leppings Lane
goal area did he become aware that people were dead and dying around him. He tried
to calm and comfort people, and

        “At some stage I assisted in getting injured supporters onto hoardings fo r
       transportation towards any available medicalfacilities ”.

PC Shipley then spoke in his statement about trouble between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest fans. He continued

       “after a short time I continued to assist the injured to reach medical facilities
       at the rear o f the Kop, in the new formed medical area, ie the gym area ”.

In a further statement, dated 13th September 1989, PC Shipley said that he dealt with
several persons who were injured or dead but he could only identify one. That was
Andrew Sefton, whom he identified from photographs shown to him. He identified
himself as being involved, with other people, in carrying Andrew Sefton on a
hoarding. This photograph is timed at 15.30. He did not say that he had performed
any resuscitative measures.

At the mini-inquest on Andrew Sefton Inspector Sawers summarised the evidence of
Patrick Shannon, a Liverpool supporter who attempted to resuscitate him and later
carried him across the pitch with PC Shipley. Mr Shannon said that as he gave
Andrew Sefton mouth-to-mouth ventilation a police officer gave heart massage.
Inspector Sawers said this officer was “believed to be PC Shipley”. I do not know the
source o f his belief and Inspector Sawers y/as not asked about it by Mr Fraser who
represented the family. It may be the belief was mistaken. But there seems no reason
to doubt that some police officer gave heart massage as Mr Shannon says. I can see
no inconsistency between PC Shipley’s two statements.

Counsel for the Family Support Group said in their written submission’s to me that PC
Keamey had given conflicting statements as to where he took custody of Andrew’s
body. In his first statement dated 19th May 1989 he said that he was ordered to move
from the pitch to

       “behind the north stand to the area o f the gymnasium and police room. Whilst
       at this location an unidentified man (Andrew Sefton) was carried into the area
       on an advertisement board. I checked his body fo r signs o f life but none could
       be found. The body was then taken into the gymnasium where it was placed
       on the floor".

PC Keamey remained with the body until it was identified. In a statement dated 4
July 1989 in which he identified himself beside the body in a temporary mortuary, he
said “I took over this body outside the gym after half a dozen fans had dumped him
there."

I cannot detect any inconsistency in these statements. Counsel asserted that in his
statement of 19th May PC Keamey had said that he “took custody of Andrew’s body
when it was brought into the gymnasium”. But this is not what he said.

In her interview with me Mrs Sefton expressed concern that Andrew had in fact died
much later than the evidence presented to the mini-inquest indicated, because when
she identified his body at 0300 on the Sunday morning (16 April) his face was still
warm. I do not think it is right to draw this conclusion. The Coroner asked the
pathologist (Dr Shortland) about this at the mini-inquest on Andrew Sefton.    He
said (transcript 19 April 1990, page 3)

       “Q - One o f the things that worried Mrs Sefton was that when she went along
       to identify the body ....she thought that the body still appeared warm to
       her?.... A - Yes, I think that there are certain features which you have to take
       into consideration, first o f all, the build o f the individual... the ambient
       temperature is important and possibly the proximity with the large number o f
       bodies, the proximity o f the bodies together actually retained heat within them.

       Q - I think Mr Sefton was either in a body bag or wrapped in some form o f
       blanket.... Would that make any difference? A - Yes, I think it would'

       Q - I f he had been...? A - Enclosed".

                                 JACK STRAW
Graham Roberts


There are two problems in this case.

The first is an apparent conflict between the evidence of two police officers as to
when Graham Roberts died.

PC Yates described treating a man (later identified as Graham Roberts) lying on the
terrace about 15-20 feet from the tunnel entrance, partially concealing the body of a
youth. It appeared that he had been dragged there by supporters. He pulled the man
off and left him in the prone position. He said he appeared to be dead.

PC Best helped to carry a number of persons from the area near to and in the tunnel.
One of these he identified as Graham Roberts. He said that he carried him to an area
of the lane near the gates and as he put him on the ground he was breathing. Moments
later he returned with another body and saw that the man was dead.

Neither PC Yates nor PC Best gave oral evidence, and so far as I am aware there was
no request by Mr Fraser, solicitor for the Steering Committee representing the
families, that they should. But the conflict between their accounts was explored as
far as possible at the mini-inquest. It is not possible to resolve it now. In the light of
the pathologist’s evidence, it seems probable that PC Best was mistaken in believing
that Graham Roberts was breathing when he put him down.

The second conflict was between the statements of PC Sinclair and PC Wadsworth.

PC Sinclair stated that about 16.15 on the 15th April he went to the Leppings Lane
side of the stadium and was allocated a body. He stayed with the body while Dr
Ashton certified death at 16.25 hours and when it was taken to the gymnasium, until it
was identified at 01.50 hours on 16th April as that o f Graham Roberts. This was the
evidence given at the mini-inquest.

PC Wadsworth said that he attended the Leppings Lane End and gave mouth-to-
mouth resuscitation to a casualty with the aid of a resuscitator. He did this for about
10 minutes whilst an ambulance man and another attendant fitted a drip to the man’s
arm. PC Wadsworth said that the man was put in an ambulance and that, before that
happened, he had a pulse.

In a subsequent statement he purported to identify this person from photographs as
Graham Roberts. This evidence was not referred to at the mini-inquest, and PC
Wadsworth’s statements do not appear on the body file.

It is quite plain in my judgement that PC Wadsworth was mistaken in his
identification. Graham Roberts was never taken to hospital. It is true that some
bodies were collected and taken by ambulance from the Gate C area at Leppings Lane
to the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium. But there is no evidence that this
happened to Graham Roberts. In view of the resuscitative treatment which the
person whom PC Wadsworth describes had received, and the evidence that he had a
pulse, it would have made no sense for an ambulance to have taken him to the
mortuary rather than to hospital.

The inconsistency between PC Sinclair and PC Wadsworth was one relied upon by
Counsel for the Family Support Group in their written submissions to me. When
however I pointed out that Graham Roberts had not been taken to hospital and
therefore it seemed that PC Wadsworth was mistaken, I understood Counsel to accept
this. I have had no further submissions from the legal representatives on this matter.

                                 JACK STRAW
Richard Jones

At my interview with Mr and Mrs Jones about the death of their son Richard they said
that they werejcencemed that statements made by Mr Jones had apparently gone
astray and not been provided by the police when he asked for them. Mr Jones told
me that he made three statements to the police in the early hours of the Sunday
morning after the disaster (16 April). One of his statements identified Richard, one
identified Richard’s girlfriend Tracey Cox, who was with him and was also killed, and
the third was an overall statement. He said they hadn’t got the statement relating to
Tracey.

In the body file for Richard Jones there are three statements made by his father. The
first, dated 16 April 1989, deals with the identification of both Richard and Tracey.
The second and third dated 15 August and 23 November 1989 deal with identification
from photographic material. I think these would have been the only matters upon
which Mr Jones could or would be likely to give relevant evidence.

Mr Jones also told me he had doubts of the reliability of the evidence of PC Bromley.
PC Bromley was involved in the rescue operation. In a statement dated 3 May 1989
he said he saw a man lying unconscious on the pitch. Two supporters were attending
him, but he thought he was dead.

PC Bromley said that he assisted another person to the gymnasium and then returned
to the pitch. He saw a group o f supporters carrying a body on an advertisement
hoarding -

         "The body on the hoarding was, I believe, the same body I had seen earlier on
        the pitch. All I can remember about the clothing on the body was that the man
        was wearing grey coloured trousers. ”

He said that, with another officer, they attempted resuscitation without success and
that he then accompanied the body to the gymnasium and stayed with it until Mr
Jones identified it as that o f his son. Mr Jones said that Richard was in fact wearing
blue jeans and he therefore considered that PC Bromley cannot have been with
Richard’s body as he states.

There is a photograph of Richard’s clothing including his trousers on the body file.
The colour reproduction in the photograph may not be perfect but the trousers could
easily be described as grey, although I suspect they are much washed jeans. I do not
consider this is a sufficient basis for doubting PC Bromley’s evidence.

                                 JACK STRAW
James Aspinall


At the mini inquest on 19 April 1990, Detective Sergeant Killoch said when
summarising the evidence about the death of James Aspinall that:

        "Sometime after the crushing had occurred in the West Stand terracing, James
        was removed from the enclosure, placed onto the pitch and taken to the
        gymnasium. It has not been possible to identify the persons involved in these
        actions ”.

There is however a statement on the body file for James Aspinall from Detective
Constable Fox in which Mr Fox identifies himself with James in a photograph
(MW1/2) and says that he tried, without success, to resuscitate him. This statement is
dated 25 March 1990. An addendum to the summary on James’s body file refers to
DC Fox’s statement, though there is no date indicating when this addendum was
made.

Mr and Mrs Aspinall asked me why DC Fox’s evidence was not mentioned at the
mini-inquest. I asked Dr Popper about this. He could not offer an explanation but
there can in my view be no conceivable reason for anybody to suppress this statement
deliberately. Inspector Layton, who was in charge of the visual identification from
photographic material, gave evidence at the mini-inquest and referred to the
photograph MW1/2. But he did not take the statement from DC Fox.

  I think the most likely explanation is that there was some delay in adding DC Fox’s
. statement to the body file, so that when Detective Sergeant Killoch and Inspector
  Layton examined it for the purpose of giving evidence it was not then available. If
  so, that would clearly have been an unfortunate error. But it does not affect the
  verdict o f the Inquest.

                                 JACK STRAW
Ian Glover

The police originally had on the body file a statement dated 7 July 1989 made by PC
Fojut, in which-Ee purported to identify a person whom he had helped to carry across
the pitch to the gymnasium as Ian Glover. The identification was based on a
recognition o f clothing shown to the officer in a photograph.

There are a number o f inconsistencies between this statement and that of Joseph
Glover, Ian’s brother, who saw him brought onto the pitch from pen 3, and helped to
take him across the pitch. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that at the mini­
inquest Joseph Glover was asked if any police officer had helped to carry his brother
across the pitch to the gymnasium. He said that they had not.

In the result, PC Fojut’s evidence was not included in the inquest summary of
evidence of Ian Glover’s case because it was appreciated that his identification must
have been mistaken. This matter was fully explained at the mini-inquest. In my view
it is clear that PC Fojut had mistakenly identified the person he helped with as Ian
Glover.

Mr and Mrs Glover told me at my meeting with them that they were still confused
about this. It is, o f course, unfortunate that PC Fojut misidentified the person he was
dealing with as Ian Glover, but I do not consider there is now any room for doubt that
Joseph Glover was right and PC Fojut was mistaken.

                                 JACK STRAW
 Victoria and Sarah Hicks

 Mr and Mrs Hicks had the terrible misfortune of losing their two daughters Sarah and
 Victoria.

 Victoria

When I met Mr and Mrs Hicks in Liverpool in October their main concerns in respect
of Victoria related to the evidence o f Paul Taylor and that of PC Marshall. I have
dealt with Paul Taylor’s evidence in Chapter 4. In a submission which I received on
8 January 1998 Mr Hicks disputes the part which PC Marshall says that he played in
recovering Victoria from pen 3, taking her to the ambulance and accompanying her to
the hospital.

Mr Hicks says that he has no recollection of the presence of any police officer other
than PC McGuinness assisting with Victoria. He believes that PC Marshall’s
evidence is untrue and that he played no part in assisting with Victoria.

A number of witnesses in addition to Mr Hicks himself helped with Victoria.

PC McGuinness made three statements. The first is undated. He said:

        "Eventually I made my way back through the West Stand and onto the pitch,
        assisting officers to carry another girl onto the pitch. Whilstfire and Police
        Officers attempted to assist her Iran to the gymnasium where I collected an
        oxy'gen cylinder and mask.

       I brought this to the girl and attempted to resuscitate her. Together with the
       girls father M r Hicks we put the girl ‘Vicky ’ into an ambulance and travelled
       to the Northern General Hospital. Mouth to Mouth was administered
       throughout the journey to the hospital and then on arrival the hospital
       medical sta ff took over. After assisting a doctor at the hospital I was told that
       Vicky was dead. ”

PC McGuiness’s second statement is dated 8 May 1989. It is much to the same effect
but he says that he performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on Victoria in the
ambulance.

His third statement is dated 6 July 1989. It is concerned with visual identification
from photographic material. He identifies himself at 15.38 running towards the
ambulance with the oxygen bottle.

Two things should be noted about PC McGuinness’s evidence. The first is that there
is no mention of a second police officer in the ambulance, but neither is there any
reference to ambulance man Tony Edwards, the nurse or anybody else other than Mr
Hicks who was on the scene or travelled in the ambulance. Secondly, he does not say
that Victoria was passed over the radial fence into pen 2.
                      ivas a spectator in pen 3. He made two statements. In the first
dated 31.5.89 he said that he assisted in taking bodies from police officers through the
perimeter gate to pen 3. He said:

       “We then returned to the gate and the same four officers met us with a young
       woman. I don’t know where they had collected her body from. Me and the
       dark haired lad had an arm each to carry her and one Police Officer had
       both her legs. We carried her passed the 2 men we had already taken onto
       the pitch and we laid her perhaps 8 or 10 yards (8 or 10 yds) further into the
       playing area from the touch line. "

In a statement dated 16 November 1989 he identified the girl as Victoria Hicks from
photographic evidence.

PC Marshall made a statement dated 10 July 1989. He said:

        "After moving numerous bodies I helped an officer lift a young girl out o f
        the pile o f bodies. We walked to the fence with her and Ijumped onto the
        perimeter, carrying her in my arms towards an ambulance.

        After leaving her on the grass fo r a short while a further officer approached
        me holding an oxygen bottle, he said. Come on do you know first aid... we
        can save this one I carried the girl to the rear o f an open ambulance placing
        her along the seats. Almost immediately two others were placed in the van,
        one a youth being put on its floor. The ambulance then shut its doors and we
        set o ff at speed to the N. G.H.

        Throughout the journey we attempted to revive the girl using chest and heart
        massage, the mask o f the oxygen being placed intermittently over her mouth
        as we tried to pump air into her body. The girl was Victoria Hicks. Her
       father was trying mouth to mouth after I had cleared the vomit from her
        mouth. The second girl in the ambulance was I believed her older sister.

        Upon arrival at the N. G.H. I carried the body o f the girl into the hospital and
        placed her on a wooden bench, the only free furniture in turn I then carried
        the youth, my strength seemed that o f ten, the hospital was in chaos with
        bodies everywhere and medical sta ff running about. ”

He said that Mr Hicks had been abusive to him in the hospital.

 Fireman                  also assisted with Victoria. In his first statement he
wrongly described her as having blonde hair, but he later corrected this on being
shown photographs. His reference to blonde hair was obviously a mistake.

Tony Edwards was the ambulance man concerned. I have discussed his evidence at
length in the main body o f my report. He says that there were three bodies in the
ambulance, a nurse, two police officers, two spectators (one of whom was Mr Hicks)
He goes on to describe what happened. Mr Hicks says this must be a reference to
himself although he is not identified as such. He disputes some of the detail, but it is
not clear whether he accepts that he had an encounter with a police officer on the lines
described by PG Taylor. In a further statement dated 3 May 1989 PC Taylor makes
no reference to this incident.

PC Andrew Sheil made two statements, in one of which he refers to one of the 11
bodies which he saw in the mortuary at the Northern General Hospital as being
female. Again Mr Hicks says this must have been a reference to Victoria, although
she is not identified in the statement.

              was a spectator. He made two statements. In the second dated 9
January 1990, he speaks of helping to put a girl into an ambulance and says that her
father was present. From the context of the statement this appears to be a reference to
Victoria and he identifies Mr Hicks as the man, having subsequently seen him on
television.

               kras a mortuary technician who was involved with all the bodies in the
mortuary at the Northern General. He refers to one having been identified as Victoria.

James W ardrope, consultant at the Accident and Emergency Department at the
Northern General Hospital, made a statement referring to the resuscitative treatment
given to those who were taken to hospital, including Victoria.

Mr Wardrope gave oral evidence about this on Day 1 of the main inquest. But it
might have been preferable if the statements of PC Taylor,               and
      jhad been on the Body file. However it is entirely understandable that a
conscious decision may have been taken to exclude them. The involvement o f each
of these witnesses is entirely peripheral, and adds nothing of consequence to the
evidence of other witnesses. In my view, PC Sheil’s statement has no relevance.


Sarah

There was clear evidence of what happened to Sarah. She was removed from pen 3
and placed on the pitch. Attempts were made to resuscitate her by, amongst others,
Dr Flenley. These were unsuccessful and Dr Flenley said Sarah was dead. She was
taken to the gymnasium end on an improvised stretcher, where again attempts to
resuscitate her were made until a person who was unidentified, but believed to be
medically qualified, said she was dead. She was taken to the part of the gymnasium
where those who were believed to be dead were placed. Her death was confirmed by
Dr Bull at 16.20.

In his latest submissions, Mr Hicks has expressed his concern about two matters in
particular. The first is a statement by a Liverpool supporter, Tony Bambrock. He
made a statement to the police, dated 2 May 1989. He says that he was in pen 4 and
managed to make his escape onto the pitch and then assisted with the injured. Among
those he helped was a girl who he thought was about 22 years old. She was recovered
and himself. He treated Victoria and showed how to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
while the spectator did cardiac massage. He remembers nothing of the journey.

In his very detailed comments which reached me on 8 January 1998 Mr Hicks makes
a number of criticisms o f PC Marshall’s evidence, and for that matter PC
McGuinness’s evidence as well. Although PC Marshall may be inaccurate in matters
of detail, I can see no reason to doubt that he assisted in recovering Victoria from pen
3, putting her in the ambulance and travelling with her in the ambulance. There were
obvious omissions from PC McGuinness’s statements, but there is nothing otherwise
inconsistent between them. Mr Edwards’s statement confirms the presence of a
second police officer in the ambulance.

The evidence o f PC Marshall was accurately summarised in the summary of the
evidence on the body file for Victoria Hicks, and a copy of this was sent to Mr Hicks
before the mini-inquests. No point was raised in relation to PC Marshall’s
participation. I find it entirely understandable that in the terrible circumstances in
which he found himself Mr Hicks, whose concentration must have been almost
entirely on Victoria and Sarah, did not take in what others around him were doing.

Mr Hicks, in his latest submission, says that the reason why he did not question what
was said in the summary about PC Marshall’s participation is because he was
beginning to doubt his own memory and that he was still in a state of deep shock.
Had the matter been raised at the time, it is possible that some of the minor
discrepancies which exist, such as PC McGuinness’s omission to mention others in
the ambulance, and who exactly performed resuscitation on Victoria, might have been
capable of resolution. I do not consider that it will be possible to resolve these matters
now and I have not thought it right to delay submission of my report in an effort to do
so.

In his latest submissions to me Mr Hicks raises a very large number of points o f detail
relating to the contents of, or omissions from, the body file relating to Victoria. It is
not possible for me to deal with all these extremely detailed questions. None of them,
singularly or cumulatively, could affect the verdict of accidental death, and neither do
they affect the question of where and when Victoria died. They do not justify the
suggestion that there has been some deliberate concealment or suppression of
evidence. For reasons I have already explained, it is only to be expected that there
will be differences o f recollection among witnesses.

But I will nevertheless try to deal with some of these points.

Omission o f statements from Victoria’s body file

Mr Hicks complains that the following statements by PC Stephen Taylor, PC Andrew
Sheil,__                         and James Wardrope were wrongly omitted from
the file.

PC Stephen Taylor refers in an undated statement to meeting a Liverpool supporter
at the Northern General Hospital who said that two of his daughters had been killed.
from pen 4 and laid on the pitch. He says he knew she was dead. He says that a man
came up and said he was her father. He then left the girl. He says he later found out
that the girl wasjonly 19 and her name was Sarah Hicks.

Mr Hicks had a copy of the statement in December 1989 and sent it in February 1990
to Mr Fraser, who was both his personal solicitor and representing the Families as a
whole. It does not appear that any point was taken on it at the inquests. This is not
surprising. It is clear in my view that this is a case of misidentification. Sarah was
never in pen 4. Mr Bambrock’s account is wholly inconsistent with that of all other
witnesses if it related to Sarah, which in my opinion it does not. There is no reason
why Mr Bambrock’s statement should be on Sarah’s body file.

The second matter relates to the police video tape taken in the gymnasium (VRM 2).
A copy of this had been supplied by South Yorkshire Police to Yorkshire Television
at the same time as tapes TBl, 2, 3, and 4. Yorkshire Television allowed Mr Hicks to
view it and copy it. The relevant footage showed someone on the floor in that part of
the gymnasium set aside for recovery. The person concerned is surrounded by people,
mainly firemen, evidently trying to resuscitate him or her.

It is only possible to see the person’s body from the waist down. They are dressed in
light blue jeans with sharp tum-up of 1-2” and dark shoes. It is just possible to see a
white garment on the top part of the body. The footage lasts about one minute. It is
not timed but would appear to have been taken at some time between 15.50 and 16.20.

Mr and Mrs Hicks say that the body is that of a female, and they consider it is Sarah.
I have examined the tape carefully. The body may well be that of a young woman,
but I do not think one can be sure. The jeans are much lighter than those in the
photograph of Sarah’s clothes which is on the body file and the shoes do not appear to
me to be the same, though this is more difficult to tell. In my judgement it is n o t .
possible to make a reliable identification from the video footage. It does not cast any
reasonable doubt on the very clear evidence to which I have already referred.

I have carefully considered Mr Hicks’ comments on the witnesses relating to Sarah. I
do not consider they justify any suggestion that evidence has been concealed,
suppressed or slanted in favour of South Yorkshire Police.

As you will be aware, I have now published Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's report
of his scrutiny of evidence on the Hillsborough Disaster.

I understand that, as part of his scrutiny, you raised certain issues with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith about the circumstances and the police documentation
relating to the tragic death of your son, Kevin.

The Judge dealt with these concerns, and those of other families, in appendix 9
of his report to me. In view of the personal nature of the material in the
appendix, I have decided that the relevant passages should be sent direct to the
families concerned rather than included in the published report.

I therefore enclose a copy of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's comments.

Kevin Williams

I have discussed the evidence of PC Bruder and WPC Martin in Chapter 4, part 1.

In her memorial to the Attorney General Mrs Williams, Kevin’s mother, submitted
transcripts of interviews with two other witnesses conducted by researchers compiling
the Cook Report TV programme. These people said that they had helped to carry
Kevin Williams across the pitch on a hoarding.

I have not been provided with any signed statement by either of these two witnesses,
nor have I been invited to interview them. The first, Mr O’Keefe was a qualified first-
aider. In spite o f some persistent questioning by the Cook Report researchers it is
extremely difficult to discern a clear answer from Mr O’Keefe as to whether he
thought Kevin was still alive when he and the others carried him across the pitch and,
if so, why.

At one point Mr O’Keefe said Kevin appeared to be alive, but the next moment he
said he didn’t really know. Mr O’Keefe’s main reason for thinking Kevin might have
been alive at that time was that he and the others were rushing him across the pitch,
and he didn’t look as blue as some others.

The second witness interviewed by the Cook Report researchers is Steven Hart. His
evidence is equally difficult. When the researchers first ask him what condition Kevin
was in, he does not really answer the question. Effectively he appears to say that he
does not know if Kevin was alive, but that he was not off colour and they were
anxious to get him to the other end of the pitch as quickly as possible. But after what
appears, from the transcript, to be a break he appears more positive, “He was alive
because you knew he was alive”. Mr Hart says he could see that some people were
clearly dead. Kevin did not look like them. This appears to be the basis of his
opinion, rather than that there were definite signs of life.

Mr Hart also made a statement to the police, dated 24 May 1989. In this he describes
seeing a policeman giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a young lad on the pitch.
He later describes coming back to the lad who was lying alone with his eyes closed.
He thought he was unconscious and with a couple of other supporters placed him on a
hoarding. “As we lifted him on to the board a policeman came forward and pulled
the lads jumper up and over his face and! realised then that he was dead”. They then
carried him to the other end of the pitch. It seems clear that this must have been
Kevin, although he never identified him as such, since this is the only casualty that he
refers to as being dealt with in this way.

In my view this evidence adds nothing to the evidence of PC Bruder.

It is I think necessary to refer to the evidence that Dr Slater gave about PC Bruder’s
account at the mini-inquest on Kevin Williams (4 May 1990, page 13B):

       Q. “In the light o f what you heard and what we have heard now, do you feel
       that this lad died, i f you like, in the totality sense, I don't mean that his skin
        was dead, but in lay terms at the point in time when Mr Bruder was with
        him?"

       A. "Yes, sir, I am quite confident o f that. When one speaks to lay people who
       have experienced people dying, a word which is recurrent in these
       descriptions o f death is the way that individuals turn grey. In fact, I was very
       impressed by the content in PC Bruder's statement o f the word ‘grey',
       recurring several times. To me as a doctor that implied that that was the point
       o f whole body death. In fact I feel that it was probably around that time that
       Kevin's whole body died. His brain had died twenty/twenty-five minutes
       before that at the time o f the crushing, but his whole body died at the time PC
       Bruder was with him. "

Assuming, therefore, that Kevin was alive at 15.35 or shortly thereafter when PC
Bruder and the St John Ambulance people were attending him, I do not think it is
possible to say that his life could have been saved. In a report dated 29 October 1993
which was considered by the Divisional Court, Dr Iain West, Consultant Forensic
Pathologist at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital, who was then advising Mrs Williams
referred to the injuries to Kevin’s neck. His report continues:

         "This type o f injury is amenable to treatment in the form o f an emergency
        tracheotomy or a crico-thyroidotomy. Whilst an emergency tracheotomy is a
        relatively major procedure, this crico-thyroidotomy is a simpler procedure
        which involves the passage o f a tube through the membrane between the
        thyroid and cricoid cartilages. It is possible that i f one o f these procedures
        had been carried out at the scene then he would not have sufferedfrom the
       fatal asphyxia which led to his death.

        Both crico-thyroidotomy and emergency tracheotomy can be performed in the
       field although, in the latter instance, with difficulties owing to an increased
        likelihood o f haemorrhage at the operation site ".

There is a difference o f opinion between Dr West and Dr Slater. Dr West’s opinion is
based upon photographs and Dr Slater’s post-mortem report. He did not therefore
have the advantage of carrying out the post-mortem. Their difference of opinion has
been enlarged upon in letters to me from Dr West, dated 12 December 1997, and from
Dr Slater, dated 22 December 1997. ~'

It is Dr West’s view that the sole injury was to the neck. He points to the absence of
bruising on the chest. Dr Slater accepts that there was an injury to the neck, but
contends that the primary cause of death was the crushing of the chest, with the injury
to the neck being contributory but secondary. He relies on ‘the extensive cyanosis
extending down to the upper part of the chest. This was particularly severe down to
the level of the clavicle and unequivocally present but less severe to a level
approximately below the nipples’. The absence of bruising to the chest was a
common finding in those who unequivocally died of crush asphyxia at Hillsborough.
Dr Slater supported his conclusion by a finding of bruising within the heart itself. He
also points out that there was no bruising of the neck muscles. Oedema and swelling
of the larynx was also absent; this might be expected to be present if the sole injury
was to the neck. It is unfortunate that there is this difference of opinion between
distinguished pathologists. I am very far from being persuaded that Dr Slater is
wrong.

Mrs Williams considers that Dr West’s view is supported by a change in some
information on the Coroner’s Certificate after the inquest. The original certificate,
dated 28 March 1991, gave the cause of death as ‘Traumatic Asphyxia’. At that time
certain information was also required for statistical purposes. In answer to the
question‘parts of body injured’ - the answer w a s‘chest’. As a result of her
communications with Dr West, Mrs Williams wanted this changed to ‘neck’.
Mr Domes, who by then had taken over as Coroner from Dr Popper, raised the matter
with Dr Slater. He was not disposed to dissent. By this time, 1996, the same
statistical information was no longer required and similar questions to those in the
 1991 form were not asked.

Mr Dorries was however prepared to issue an amended certificate, dated 4 April 1996.
The cause of death was still given as Traumatic Asphyxia. But in Part V of the form
in answer to the question ‘Details of how accident happened’, the form now reads:
‘Sustained crush injuries at football ground’; Type of injury: ‘Crush’; Parts of body
injured: ‘Neck’. This is not inconsistent with Dr Slater’s opinion, since the only
visible external injury is to the neck. But I think that if Dr Slater had foreseen the
problems that Mrs Williams was to continue to have on the matter, he might have
been wiser to point out to Mr Dorries that his opinion as to the cause o f death had not
changed and that the primary cause remained the crushing of the chest, although the
only external injury was to his neck.

Even if Dr West is correct, in my view there was no realistic possibility that Kevin
Williams’ life could have been saved. The St John Ambulance personnel, in whose
charge he was, were neither trained nor equipped to perform either operation
suggested by Dr West. I cannot see that there was any basis upon which a diagnosis
could have been made which indicated the need for such an operation. Dr West
described the symptoms which indicate the need for a cricothyroidotomy as 'only
being apparent in somebody who was still alive and would be shown by the
difficulties that individual is experiencing in breathing. This would take the form o f
increased and exaggerated respiratory movements involving the chest accompanied
by fairly characteristic noises emanating from the throat and resulting from the
individual attempting to draw in air through a severely constricted airway'.

This is quite inconsistent with the evidence of PC Bruder, who is the only reliable
witness on Kevin’s state.

Victoria and Sarah Hicks

Mr and Mrs Hicks had the terrible misfortune of losing their two daughters Sarah and
Victoria.

Victoria

When I met Mr and Mrs Hicks in Liverpool in October their main concerns in respect
of Victoria related to the evidence of Paul Taylor and that of PC Marshall. I have
dealt with Paul Taylor’s evidence in Chapter 4. In a submission which I received on
8 January 1998 Mr Hicks disputes the part which PC Marshall says that he played in
recovering Victoria from pen 3, taking her to the ambulance and accompanying her to
the hospital.

Mr Hicks says that he has no recollection of the presence of any police officer other
than PC McGuinness assisting with Victoria. He believes that PC Marshall’s
evidence is untrue and that he played no part in assisting with Victoria.

A number of witnesses in addition to Mr Hicks himself helped with Victoria.

PC McGuinness made three statements. The first is undated. He said:

           "Eventually I made my way back through the West Stand and onto the pitch,
           assisting officers to carry another girl onto the pitch. Whilst fire and Police
           Officers attempted to assist her I ran to the gymnasium where I collected an
           oxygen cylinder and mask.

       I brought this to the girl and attempted to resuscitate her. Together with the
       girls father Mr Hicks we put the girl ‘Vicky ’ into an ambulance and travelled
       to the Northern General Hospital. Mouth to Mouth was administered
       throughout the journey to the hospital and then on arrival the hospital
       medical staff took over. After assisting a doctor at the hospital I was told that
       Vicky was dead."

PC McGuiness’s second statement is dated 8 May 1989. It is much to the same effect
but he says that he performed mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on Victoria in the
ambulance.

His third statement is dated 6 July 1989. It is concerned with visual identification
from photographic material. He identifies himself at 15.38 running towards the
ambulance with the oxygen bottle.

Two things should be noted about PC McGuinness’s evidence. The first is that there
is no mention of a second police officer in the ambulance, but neither is there any
reference to ambulance man Tony Edwards, the nurse or anybody else other than Mr
Hicks who was on the scene or travelled in the ambulance. Secondly, he does not say
that Victoria was passed over the radial fence into pen 2.
                      was a spectator in pen 3. He made two statements. In the first
dated 31.5.89 he said that he assisted in taking bodies from police officers through the
perimeter gate to pen 3. He said:

       “We then returned to the gate and the same four officers met us with a young
       woman. I don’t know where they had collected her body from. Me and the
       dark haired lad had an arm each to carry her and one Police Officer had
       both her legs. We carried her passed the 2 men we had already taken onto
       the pitch and we laid her perhaps 8 or 10 yards (8 or 10 yds) further into the
       playing area from the touch line. ”

In a statement dated 16 November 1989 he identified the girl as Victoria Hicks from
photographic evidence.

PC Marshall made a statement dated 10 July 1989. He said:

        "After moving numerous bodies I helped an officer lift a young girl out o f
        the pile o f bodies. We walked to the fence with her and I jumped onto the
        perimeter, carrying her in my arms towards an ambulance.

        After leaving her on the grass fo r a short while a further officer approached
        me holding an oxygen bottle, he said, Come on do you know first aid... we
        can save this one I carried the girl to the rear o f an open ambulance placing
        her along the seats. Almost immediately two others were placed in the van,
        one a youth being put on its floor. The ambulance then shut its doors and we
        set o ff at speed to the N. G.H.

         Throughout the journey we attempted to revive the girl using chest and heart
         massage, the mask o f the oxygen being placed intermittently over her mouth
         as we tried to pump air into her body. The girl was Victoria Hicks. Her
        father was trying mouth to mouth after I had cleared the vomit from her
         mouth. The second girl in the ambulance was I believed her older sister

        Upon arrival at the N. G.H. I carried the body o f the girl into the hospital and
        placed her on a wooden bench, the only free furniture in turn I then carried
        the youth, my strength seemed that o f ten, the hospital was in chaos with
        bodies everywhere and medical sta ff running about. ”

He said that Mr Hicks had been abusive to him in the hospital.

 F i r e m a n a l s o assisted with Victoria. In his first statement he
wrongly described her as having blonde hair, but he later corrected this on being
shown photographs. His reference to blonde hair was obviously a mistake.

Tony Edwards was the ambulance man concerned. I have discussed his evidence at
length in the main body of my report. He says that there were three bodies in the
ambulance, a nurse, two police officers, two spectators (one of whom was Mr Hicks)
and himself. He treated Victoria and showed how to do mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
while the spectator did cardiac massage. He remembers nothing of the journey.

In his very detailed comments which reached me on 8 January 1998 Mr Hicks makes
a number of criticisms of PC Marshall’s evidence, and for that matter PC
McGuinness’s evidence as well. Although PC Marshall may be inaccurate in matters
o f detail, I can see no reason to doubt that he assisted in recovering Victoria from pen
3, putting her in the ambulance and travelling with her in the ambulance. There were
obvious omissions from PC McGuinness’s statements, but there is nothing otherwise
inconsistent between them. Mr Edwards’s statement confirms the presence of a
second police officer in the ambulance.

The evidence of PC Marshall was accurately summarised in the summary of the
evidence on the body file for Victoria Hicks, and a copy of this was sent to Mr Hicks
before the mini-inquests. No point was raised in relation to PC Marshall’s
participation. I find it entirely understandable that in the terrible circumstances in
which he found himself Mr Hicks, whose concentration must have been almost
entirely on Victoria and Sarah, did not take in what others around him were doing.

Mr Hicks, in his latest submission, says that the reason why he did not question what
was said in the summary about PC Marshall’s participation is because he was
beginning to doubt his own memory and that he was still in a state of deep shock.
Had the matter been raised at the time, it is possible that some of the minor
discrepancies which exist, such as PC McGuinness’s omission to mention others in
the ambulance, and who exactly performed resuscitation on Victoria, might have been
capable of resolution. I do not consider that it will be possible to resolve these matters
now and I have not thought it right to delay submission of my report in an effort to do
so.

In his latest submissions to me Mr Hicks raises a very large number of points of detail
relating to the contents of, or omissions from, the body file relating to Victoria. It is
not possible for me to deal with all these extremely detailed questions. None of them,
singularly or cumulatively, could affect the verdict of accidental death, and neither do
they affect the question of where and when Victoria died. They do not justify the
suggestion that there has been some deliberate concealment or suppression of
evidence. For reasons I have already explained, it is only to be expected that there
will be differences of recollection among witnesses.

But I will nevertheless try to deal with some of these points.

 Omission o f statements from Victoria's body file

Mr Hicks complains that the following statements by PC Stephen Taylor, PC Andrew
Sheil,         ~1                and James Wardrope were wrongly omitted from
 the file.

 PC Stephen Taylor refers in an undated statement to meeting a Liverpool supporter
 at the Northern General Hospital who said that two of his daughters had been killed.
He goes on to describe what happened. Mr Hicks says this must be a reference to
himself although he is not identified as such. He disputes some of the detail, but it is
not clear whether he accepts that he had an encounter with a police officer on the lines
described by PC Taylor. In a further statement dated 3 May 1989 PC Taylor makes
no reference to this incident.

PC Andrew Sheil made two statements, in one of which he refers to one of the 11
bodies which he saw in the mortuary at the Northern General Hospital as being
female. Again Mr Hicks says this must have been a reference to Victoria, although
she is not identified in the statement.

              vas a spectator. He made two statements. In the second dated 9
January 1990, he speaks of helping to put a girl into an ambulance and says that her
father was present. From the context of the statement this appears to be a reference to
Victoria and he identifies Mr Hicks as the man, having subsequently seen him on
television.

____________ was a mortuary technician who was involved with all the bodies in the
 mortuary at the Northern General. He refers to one having been identified as Victoria.

Jam es W ardrope, consultant at the Accident and Emergency Department at the
Northern General Hospital, made a statement referring to the resuscitative treatment
given to those who were taken to hospital, including Victoria.

Mr Wardrope gave oral evidence about this on Day 1 of the main inquest. But it
might have been preferable if the statements of PC Taylor,              and_____
       had been on the Body file. However it is entirely understandable that a
conscious decision may have been taken to exclude them. The involvement of each
of these witnesses is entirely peripheral, and adds nothing of consequence to the
evidence of other witnesses. In my view, PC Sheil’s statement has no relevance.


Sarah

There was clear evidence of what happened to Sarah. She was removed from pen 3
and placed on the pitch. Attempts were made to resuscitate her by, amongst others,
Dr Flenley. These were unsuccessful and Dr Flenley said Sarah was dead. She was
taken to the gymnasium end on an improvised stretcher, where again attempts to
resuscitate her were made until a person who was unidentified, but believed to be
medically qualified, said she was dead. She was taken to the part of the gymnasium
where those who were believed to be dead were placed. Her death was confirmed by
Dr Bull at 16.20.

In his latest submissions, Mr Hicks has expressed his concern about two matters in
particular. The first is a statement by a Liverpool supporter, Tony Bambrock. He
made a statement to the police, dated 2 May 1989. He says that he was in pen 4 and
managed to make his escape onto the pitch and then assisted with the injured. Among
those he helped was a girl who he thought was about 22 years old. She was recovered
from pen 4 and laid on the pitch. He says he knew she was dead. He says that a man
came up and said he was her father. He then left the girl. He says he later found out
that the girl was only 19 and her name was Sarah Hicks.

Mr Hicks had a copy of the statement in December 1989 and sent it in February 1990
to Mr Fraser, who was both his personal solicitor and representing the Families as a
whole. It does not appear that any point was taken on it at the inquests. This is not
surprising. It is clear in my view that this is a case of misidentification. Sarah was
never in pen 4. Mr Bambrock’s account is wholly inconsistent with that of all other
witnesses if it related to Sarah, which in my opinion it does not. There is no reason
why Mr Bambrock’s statement should be on Sarah’s body file.

The second matter relates to the police video tape taken in the gymnasium (VRM 2).
A copy of this had been supplied by South Yorkshire Police to Yorkshire Television
at the same time as tapes TB1, 2, 3, and 4. Yorkshire Television allowed Mr Hicks to
view it and copy it. The relevant footage showed someone on the floor in that part of
the gymnasium set aside for recovery. The person concerned is surrounded by people,
mainly firemen, evidently trying to resuscitate him or her.

It is only possible to see the person’s body from the waist down. They are dressed in
light blue jeans with sharp tum-up of 1-2” and dark shoes. It is just possible to see a
white garment on the top part of the body. The footage lasts about one minute. It is
not timed but would appear to have been taken at some time between 15.50 and 16.20.

Mr and Mrs Hicks say that the body is that of a female, and they consider it is Sarah.
I have examined the tape carefully. The body may well be that of a young woman,
but I do not think one can be sure. The jeans are much lighter than those in the
photograph of Sarah’s clothes which is on the body file and the shoes do not appear to
me to be the same, though this is more difficult to tell. In my judgement it is not
possible to make a reliable identification from the video footage. It does not cast any
reasonable doubt on the very clear evidence to which I have already referred.

I have carefully considered Mr Hicks’ comments on the witnesses relating to Sarah. I
do not consider they justify any suggestion that evidence has been concealed,
suppressed or slanted in favour of South Yorkshire Police.

Paul Carlile

At my interview with her, Mrs Stringer said she was convinced that there was
photographic evidence that showed her son Paul Carlile outside the ground and in the
vicinity of Gate C at 14.54 and 14.55, but also inside the ground, on the terraces, at
the earlier time of 14.49.

Inspector Layton gave evidence at the mini-inquest held on 3 May 1990 that Paul
Carlile had been identified by his two sisters on the photographs taken outside the
ground at 14.54 and 14.55. These photographs are of good quality. Mrs Stringer told
me that she had recently come into possession of a video still, apparently from a BBC
video, timed at 14.49 showing Paul on the terrace. She said she could identify him.

Quite clearly both identifications cannot be right. There is another video still of the
terraces timed at 14.58, and again Mrs Stringer said she could identify her son in it.
While it is not impossible that he could be outside at 14.55 and inside at 14.58 it
seems unlikely. The quality of the video stills is in my view very poor and that at
14.49 shows less than half of the person’s face.

I have not been able to draw any definite conclusions and am not sure that it would
now be possible to do so. However, the photographs which show Paul outside the
ground at 14.54 and 14.55 are far clearer than the two video stills of the terraces at
14.49 and 14.58. In my view the West Midlands Police and the Coroner cannot be
criticised for accepting the identification made by Paul Carlile’s sisters.

The other area of concern that Mrs Stringer has is about the evidence of Mr
Hollinghurst, an off duty nurse. There is a passage in a statement by Mr Hollinghurst
dated 15 May 1989 which suggests that when he first saw Paul Carlile he was alive,
but on the ground in the crush. Mr Hollinghurst was aware of a hand grabbing at his
leg. Very sadly, when Mr Hollinghurst got an opportunity some time later to attempt
to resuscitate Paul, he was dead.

Mrs Stringer’s concern was that this was not mentioned at the mini-inquest on Paul
Carlile or when Mr Hollinghurst later gave evidence on Day 26 of the Inquest. But
this aspect of Paul Carlile’s case was considered in full by the Divisional Court.
There is certainly no new evidence in relation to it.

I understand that, as part of his scrutiny, you raised certain issues with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith about the circumstances and the police documentation
relating to the tragic death of your son, Philip.

The Judge dealt with these concerns, and those of other families, in appendix 9
of his report to me. In view of the personal nature of the material in the
appendix, I have decided that the relevant passages should be sent direct to the
families concerned rather than included in the published report.

Philip Hammond

Counsel for the Family Support group submitted to me that Dr Walker’s evidence
was of criticarunportance in the case of Philip Hammond, and shows that evidence
given at the mini-inquest in his case was wrong (para 64 written submissions). I do
not accept this. At the mini-inquest P S Killock summarised the relevant part of the
evidence about Philip as follows (2 May 1990 p8 D-G):-

        “Shortly after 1505 hours, following the severe crushing in the West Stand
       terracing, Police Constable Stephen Taylor went into the tunnel leading to
       the West Stand terraces. At the end o f the tunnel he saw a boy who he now
       knows to be Philip lying on the ground. The Officer, with assistance from
       Police Constable Andrew James Shiel, carried Philip and placed him in an
       ambulance which was in attendance at Leppings Lane.

       Attempted resuscitation was then carried out by Police Constable Taylor,
       Ambulance Officer Jane Moffatt and Ambulance Officer Alan Smith. The
       ambulance was then driven to the Northern General Hospital by Police
       Constable Shiel and during that journey the Police Constable and the
       ambulance crew continued attempted resuscitation.

       Upon arrival at the hospital Philip was taken into the Casualty Department
       where further treatment was carried out by a doctor who unfortunately has
       not been identified, sir. After some twenty minutes the doctor stated he
       could not detect any pulse or signs o f life and Constable Taylor took Philip
       into the plaster room which was being used as a temporary mortuary at the
       hospital.

       Dr Janet Rosemary Doore shortly afterwards examined Philip in the plaster
       room and certified life extinct”.

In answer to the Coroner Sergeant Killock gave further details of Philip’s case,
including the fact the doctor tried for twenty minutes to revive him. The
unidentified doctor was Dr Walker. The hospital record of Philip Hammond has no
relevant information on it and it was not appreciated at that time that he was the
second patient referred to in Dr Walker’s statement of 20 July 1989.

Dr Slater, who was the pathologist in this case gave evidence. He said that his
autopsy of Philip showed signs of medical intervention in that three ECG electrodes
were positioned on his body (inquest, page 3F). In answer to a leading question
from Mr Fraser, who appeared for the family, he said (page 5E):

        “Q. Dr Slater, correct me if I am wrong, but I think by the time Philip had
       got to hospital he was dead? - A. Yes, I shouldn’t be surprised in my
       profession. I was somewhat surprised that Philip was taken to the Northern
       General Hospital because my autopsy finding was such that I would have
       thought he would have died extremely quickly and become unconscious
       instantaneously at Hillsborough. I have asked the Officers involved with this
       and I understand Philip was not seen by a doctor at Hillsborough. I think
       this explains that only essentially lay people saw him and, in my opinion,
       Philip would have been brain dead at Hillsborough ”.

Having heard the evidence summarised by P S Killock Dr Slater was recalled and
asked about it. He accepted that it was theoretically possible for the heart of
someone in cardiac arrest to be restarted. But he thought that a lay person, namely
a policeman might be mistaken in detecting a pulse. Mr Wardrope, Accident and
Emergency Consultant at the Northern General, also gave evidence in relation to
Philip Hammond. He said (page 23C):

       “In the initial part o f the incident I was sending people who came in with a
       cardiac arrest, patients undergoing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and
       external cardiac massage, I sent them to the resuscitation room initially to
       see whether they could have a chance o f being brought round, to start the
       heart going. The fact that the only post mortem evidence were three ECG
       electrodes, I think possibly he was sent to the resuscitation room but the
       ECG showed no cardiac activity, and because o f the great pressure on the
       resuscitation beds at that time he would be sent to the mortuary”.

Mr Wardrope also said that if someone underwent a resuscitation attempt he would
not have been triaged dead. (P26B). What Dr Walker’s evidence does is to
confirm that Philip was not dead on arrival, but he died very soon afterwards. This
would mean that Dr Slater’s opinion - which was in any event at variance with the
other evidence given at the mini-inquest - was wrong to that extent.

I entirely understand that it is important to Philip’s family that he died somewhat
later than Dr Slater thought. But it is not something that can impugn the inquest
verdict of accidental death. Nor does it support the conclusion that Dr Slater’s
opinion in other cases was wrong.

In written submissions to me dated 3 December 1997 Mr Hammond, Philip’s
father, claims that Mr Fraser, the solicitor acting for the Hillsborough Steering
Committee was not acting for all the families, including the Hammonds, when
arrangements were made in respect of the mini-inquests. He also says that Mr
Fraser was being paid by Municipal Mutual Insurance (MMI), insurers for the
South Yorkshire Police, the implication being that he did not properly represent the
families.

These claims are based on a misunderstanding. It is clear from Mr Fraser’s letter
of the 9 March 1990 addressed to the firms of solicitors acting directly for the
families (in the Hammonds’ case Bartlett & Son) that Mr Fraser would be acting on
an agency basis for these solicitors at the mini-inquests unless the client wished
otherwise, in which case they could appear in person or through their own
solicitors.

So far as MMI paying his costs are concerned, it is quite clear that Mr Fraser was
not retained by MMI and there was no conflict of interest. In fatal cases where
civil liability is established, it is perfectly proper for the dependants to recover, as
part costs in the action, reasonable expense of legal representation at the Inquest. In
my view what MMI accepted in this case was that the attendance of Mr Fraser,
whether as directly representing a client or as agent for other solicitors representing
the families, could be regarded as a reasonable expense for this purpose. To that
very limited extent they were meeting his costs, but he was not retained by them
and was in no way acting on their behalf or under their instruction.

As you will be aware, I have now published Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's report

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith about the circumstances and the police documentation
relating to the tragic death of your brother, Michael.

Michael Kelly

At her interview with me on 8th October 1997 Mrs Sinclair raised her concern over
the evidence o f PC Maugham in relation to the death of her brother, Michael Kelly.

In a statement dated 15th February 1990 PC Maugham stated that he was approached
at the West End of the pitch (the Leppings Lane end) by two men carrying a person
who they said was their friend. They asked him to help. He saw that the man was
blue in the face and appeared not to be breathing. He attempted to resuscitate him.
After a while he started to breathe but kept slipping back into unconsciousness.

PC Maugham assisted in carrying this man to the other (Kop) end of the ground,
where he was handed to the care of a St John Ambulance man. He then went back to
the Leppings Lane end where he rendered further assistance. He later identified the
person he had helped to carry as Michael Kelly from photographic evidence, though
he was by no means certain.

PC Maugham’s evidence was accurately summarised at the mini-inquest by Inspector
Layton who also said that since that time PC Maugham had discussed the
identification with Michael Kelly’s sister and he was now satisfied that it was him.
At the family’s request PC Maugham was called to give evidence at the main inquest,
and he said that when he handed the person over to the St John Ambulance man he
was still breathing.

All this evidence was considered by the Divisional Court, because it was alleged to
them that Inspector Layton had misled the Court in his summary of PC Maugham’s
evidence. The Court rejected this.

The point that now troubles Mrs Sinclair appears to be that PC Maugham was
summoned away from Michael Kelly to form a cordon across the pitch instead of
attending to the dead and dying. This criticism seems to me unfair. PC Maugham
handed over the person he was carrying to qualified hands. He did not neglect the
people who were still in trouble at the West End of the ground. He said that he
rendered further assistance there until he was asked to help make a cordon.

I have examined the body file for Michael Kelly. It is clear that there is a marked
conflict between the evidence of PC Maugham, if he has correctly identified Michael
Kelly, and that of two other police officers, PC Wilmot and PC Lally.

Both PC Wilmot and PC Lally, in statements dated 3rd May 1989 and the 7th May
1989 respectively, describe finding a man lying unconscious on the pitch near the
goal. He was checked for signs of life and there were none. They took him on a
stretcher to the gymnasium where he was again checked for signs of life. At 15.59 Dr
Byrne certified death in PC Wilmot’s presence.

PC Wilmot remained with this person’s body, which was given the body number 72.
Evidence from other witnesses proves that the person was later identified as Michael
Kelly. It is true that there is a period of about 20 minutes between 15.40 and 15.59
during which PC Wilmot does not appear to have been with the body.

This evidence was summarised at the mini-inquest and the conflict with that of PC
Maugham must have been apparent. The St John Ambulance man referred to by PC
Maugham has not been identified and it is not known what happened to the person
whom PC Wilmot handed over to him.

It is impossible to resolve this conflict now and it is not in fact one which Mrs Sinclair
raised with me. It seems to me more likely that PC Maugham was mistaken in
thinking that the person whom the two men had brought to him at the Leppings Lane
end of the ground was Michael Kelly.

Gary Church

At their meeting with me Mr and Mrs Church complained that PC Webster and PC
Hays claimed fn the statements to have done too much on the day o f the disaster, and
could not have been in the ground at 3 o’clock as they claimed. As I understand it
their argument is that these two officers could not have been involved with Gary
Church at 3.25.

There is no evidence that PC Hays was involved with Gary at all and he never said
that he was.

PC Webster made a statement which is undated but evidently made soon after the
event. He said he was on duty on the day of the disaster on a mobile patrol which
included PC Hays. Shortly after 15.00 they were in Penistone Road North area when
they received a radio message that there was crowd disturbance at the ground. On
arrival at the pitch he went to the West Terraces and tried to help. After the gate from
pen 3 onto the pitch was opened he formed part of the chain of police recovering
bodies.

He describes one youth whom he helped to resuscitate (not Gary Church), apparently
successfully. In a statement dated the 12th October 1989 he identified himself on
BBC film between 15.25 and 15.27 carrying a young lad, who he identified from
other photographic evidence as Gary Church. He placed him on the pitch and tried to
resuscitate him, unsuccessfully.

Another police officer, PC Haigh, also attempted with this resuscitation.

I cannot see that there is any valid criticism o f this evidence.

relating to the tragic death of your sons, Christopher and Kevin.

                                 JACK STRAW
Christopher and Kevin Traynor

Mr and Mrs Traynor had the great misfortune of losing two of their sons, Christopher
and Kevin. In their interview with me they expressed concern about what they
considered inconsistencies or inadequacies in the mini-inquest evidence and body
files.


Christopher

At the mini-inquest on Christopher Traynor Det Sgt McCombie summarised the
evidence relating to Christopher. This included that of Mr N J Langley, a spectator,
who said in a statement dated 3rd May 1989 that he had fallen in one of the pens and
had been helped up by someone he later identified as Christopher Traynor. The
problem with this evidence was that Christopher was undoubtedly in pen 3 and Mr
Langley said that on leaving the tunnel he had gone to his left into pen 4. It is clear
that attempts were very properly made to reconcile the conflict over a period o f time,
but it had only been resolved on the evening before the mini-inquest when it emerged
that Mr Langley had been spun round on leaving the tunnel and may have been
disorientated. He may in fact have been facing the tunnel when he said he had gone to
his left, which would put him in pen 3.

All this was explained at the mini-inquest (27 April 1990, p4-6). There is in fact no
copy of Mr Langley’s statement on the body file. I think this was an error. It should
have been there, since Mr Langley identified Christopher Traynor in his statement.
However his clear statement that he had gone into pen 4 makes it understandable that
doubt may have been entertained as to the relevance or accuracy of his identification.
In the event the matter was resolved at the mini-inquest and Mr Fraser, who appeared
for the families asked no questions.


Kevin

There is a discrepancy between the evidence of PC Turner and that of PC Howell. PC
Turner helped to remove Kevin from pen 3, laid him on the pitch and a little while
later, with the assistance of fans, carried him on a hoarding to the gymnasium. He
stayed with Kevin’s body until it was identified.

PC Howell thought that he had assisted in carrying a body, which he subsequently
identified as Kevin, from the pitch in front of the terraces to the Kop end where he
was placed on the pitch at the comer. Having seen photographs taken o f the deceased
in the mortuary and of his clothing, he said he was 99% certain it was Kevin. PC
Howell’s statement was not on the body file relating to Kevin. This is obviously
because it was thought that his identification must be mistaken. There is in my view
no reason to doubt PC Turner’s evidence.

                parked up off            the m ain A61,            I d o n ’t know the side               road.        We d i d n ’t

                t fta ground.

                We knew        of a pub off          the M i d d l e w o o d Road           from ins     semi     final      last

                year,        so we tried         that     but     it was       closed.        We went      to a shop         for

                sandwiches           and went tera p u d called the Beehive for a drink.                I had a

                singing,           it was    no worse           or better       than a n y w n e r e    else.         We made        our

                way    to the        ground about           S.15pm.           We knew the way           from     last years           semi«

                I saw police           officers          near     to Leppings          Lane,    they were         stopping           fans

                and    checking        if they had any alcohol                    and       confiscating         it.      They

                from     last year.           We    got     outside       the ground at about 25                  past,      half      past
5 . o . a . /
                two.         There was a fairly                 large    crowd outside,              w hich at    that     time

                gates.         I can    remember          seeing        only four       or five        police     officers

                outside arm given the                    size     of the       crowd there was           no way they were

                going        to be adle       to    control        it and       the    crowd knew t h a t .            Three     of us

                joined the back             of     the    crowd with the              other    three     going        to the N o r t h

                Stand.         Before       long we were           fairly well          forward.         The     crowd was

                getting        bigger,       it w a s n ’t tight,             just a    lot    bigger.          Just as      1 got         to

c a t           the    perimeter        gates       some        police    on foot       I think        shut     them,     two    of my

MAI/si          mates        got   through but           1 remained on the              outside.         I think        they shut

                these        gates    to ease       the     conge s t i o n on the           turnstiles.          I r e m ained

                outside about           4-5 minu t e s          then the        gates were           opened and we all

                pushed forward              to join the           crowd at       the    turnstiles.             The    crowd w a s n ’t

                really moving           very muc h until                I saw    it was moving           over     to my

                riqht        hand side,       I thought           there must          have    been some         other     wav    in so

                  N o b o d y a sked    for my     ticket and           I retained the whole                  thing and          just

                  walked     in.       This w o u l d    be at about 2 . 5 5 p m .             It was        just a steady flu\

                  of    p e o p l e ? not a rush thro u g h the g a t e .                As    I walked           into    the

                  co u rtyard area         the only       place        it seemed        to go was        through          the    tunnel
                                                                                 CAT e>£-M|-f=i/s/Ai_
                  so    I followed e v e r y b o d y      else,         At J.ast years          semi     I w ent         to one of the

                  corner     sections       but    this year           there was        no d i r e c t i o n to go
                                                                                    CAT          TO^dL                            STAWD
                  an y where     else     other    than    the        tunnel,           went    down     it a nd there was

                  still     only a steady          flow    of     people,        some    people were              running       but most

                  were    just walking          fast.      I could see            the    pi ten and          players and          I think

                  they were        just about       to kick           off as     1 came       out    of the        tunnel,        I went

                  into Pen 3.           Assoon as        I got     into there           I was       spun around           due     to a
      # _
 c    /y T        large     push from         behind me and             I was     carried down the t e rracing                    to
$ U t2 < 3 f£ S
l/J               about     half way,           It was      only when           I stopped        that the crush            really       hit

& H J 3 rs /D     me,    when    1 stopped        I was    standing           on tip--toe»           I   was leaning

                  sl i g h t l y backwards        and    felt     sligh t l y     raised above           the       rest    because       the

                  pressure       was    on my     diaphragm,            The    crush was         persistant          you    just

                  couldn't       push against           it and my arms were               trap p e d     by my side.              The

                  crush     carried on for          what        seemed     like ages,            I could hear             shouting       and

                  screaming        aro u n d m e » 1 star t e d to shout                as well        and    panic       telling

                  people     to move       back    but    it was        p o i n t l e s s , they     cou.J/dn* t move,

                  Wit n me shout ing the            br e a t h went        out    of me and          I started to s t r uggle

                  for/breath.           Someone     who was           facing me      sooke       to me and          calmed me          down
                  Y---
                  and told me to           breatn evenly.

                  The    next    thing     I remember           was    going     back    up the      terracing            and    being

                  calmed down ay           someone,         I    c a n ’t really        remember a           lot,        I remember

                  some    people       rushing     past    carrying           someone,          I made my own way                out

                  t h r o u g h the    tunnel     and    out     of the ground,           1 think            I was       still    in

                  shock at this           stage,    1    didn't        feel any pain at all,                 all     I wantea          to ao

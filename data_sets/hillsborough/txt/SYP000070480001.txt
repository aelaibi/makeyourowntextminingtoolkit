f ighting         which we         had to split up.

Two Liverpool               fans,     one    in a turquoise          blue    tracksuit a s s is t e d      us to

re-direct             fans to other          gates and the          fans    paid more a t t e n t i o n    to them

than they did to the Police.                        These 2 fans a s s i s t e d us greatly.                    After

these     duties,           1 attended         the de-brief         in the N o rt h S ta nd and then

formed      part of a             cordon near      to    the g ym n as i um holding         the    dead.        This

was    to prevent a n y u n a u t h o r i s e d          access.

At about 6 .30 pm we were                      told we      could s tand down and          I made my way

back    to h a mmerton Roa d                in company w it h fC 591 Tune.                At H i l l s b o r o u g h

Corner     we were a p p r o a c h e d a g a in by a Liv er po ol                fan who     called us

"Fucking murderers".                    On a r r i vi n g    back at H a m m e r t o n Roa d      I went     off

djuty at 7.0 0          pm.

Throughout            the    p re - ma t ch time all         contact       I had w it h fans was          good

h um o u r e d and      pleasant.           These were the N o t t i n g h a m Forest             fans.      Whilst

on the gate duties                  there were a         couple      of s t ewards     next to us at            an

exit gate who               let    caterers      etc.    in and out and a s s i s t e d to direct                the

fans    upstairs.

The    stewards         upstairs        in the S o ut h S t a n d , just         stood about        w at ch in g

the    events         taking       place on the         pitch and      in the Leppings          Lane

terracing         .
I cannot          recall      seeing any other              stewards       a t any other     l oc ation      I

att e n d e d .

Whilst     on the           pitch,     even whe n trying            to help     people,    1 kept       looking

a r o u n d me due to the Liv er po ol                  fans    running a ro un d on the           pitch.        I

was    pushed about               numer ou s    times    by these      fans     in their     efforts       to

r e m o n s t r a t e w ith me a nd         in their attem pt s            to get to the Fo re st          fans

end of the ground.                   These a c ti on s       caused    con fu si on on the         pitch and

split     efforts           to help the         injured.

Throughout            the    incident       I cannot        recall    any f ee lings      but a f te r w a r d s       I

was a f f e c t e d     by the way and amount                  of   r esentment     shown towards myself

     IT WAS AFTER 1600 HRS <1600).

     G51

j. DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION EITHER OF A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

i SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

i

| A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCED THE GAME HAD BEEN ABANDONED.       I LEFT WITH MY BROTHER

           R THIS.

     G52

► DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

    G'19

     G53

     DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE    WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

. AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

     I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED BY THE POLICE OR AUTHORITY OVER THE

     lA     SPEAKER OF THE DISASTER WHICH HAD OCCURRED IN PENS 3-4.   NOBODY KNEW

     WHAT HAD HAPPNED EVEN I DID NOT KNOW AT THE TIME WHAT HAD HAPPENED OR HOW
     MANY LIVERPOOL FANS HAD ACTUALLY DIED. I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I HEARD IT LATER

     ON THE CAR RADIO.    ALSO THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED 15 MINS FOR THE

     KICK OFF DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF FANS OUTSIDE THE GROUND, WAITING TO

     ENTER AT 1500 <1500) HRS.    KICK OFF TIME.

  I AM OF THE OPINION IT WAS THE RIGHT DECISION TO OPEN GATE C, AT THE SIDE

  OF THE TERRACE TURNSTILES.     TO AVOID THE FANS BEING CRUSHED OUTSIDE.    IF THE

  GATE HAD NOT BEEN OPENED WHEN IT WAS FANS    WOULDHAVE   BEENINJURED.     IT WAS

I SUCH A SMALL AREA FOR THE AMOUNT OFFANSPRESENT      AND TRYING   TOENTER THE

  HAD GOT OUT.


 G1®

  G49

 AFTER THE MA

 THREE TIMES THE GATE AT THE FRONT QF THE PEN MAS FORCED OPEN AND TWICE THE

 POLICE THREW FANS BACK IN.        ON THE THIRD OCCASION THEY FILED FANS OUT.

 POLICE AND FANS WHO HAD GOT WERE SHOUTING 'PUSH BACK’ WHICH WAS JUST

 IMPOSSIBLE.

 G54

     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY.

     1.   TICKET ALLOCATION WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

 W        2   FEET-
 3.       THE SAFETY FENCING WAS TOO HIGH AND RESTRICTING.

 4.       THE VIEW THROUGH THE TUNNEL IS DANGEROUS JUST SEEING THE BACK OF

 2)        LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POLICE OFFICERS

 3)        THE POLICE WERE SLOW TO REALISE THE SITUATION AND RESPOND.

 4)        LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT WERE MADE, WERE UNINFORMATIVE, AND CAUSED

 MORE CONFUSION THAN CALMED THE SITUATION.

 5)        AT ABOUT 15.20 HOURS AS WE WERE LEAVING THE TERRACING TO STAND AT THE REAR
                                                                              PAGE

          *
 OF THE TERRACING, I SAW SIX STEWARDS STOOD BEHIND A WALL, I DON’T KNOW IF THEY

 WERE AWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN HELPING PEOPLE WHO

 WERE INJURED.

 Q54     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1)     THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED THIS WOULD HAVE TAKEN THE PRESSURE

 OF THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE KNOWING THAT THEY WOULD GET IN.

 2)     ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND WAS POOR BY BOTH POLICE AND STEWARDS.

 3)     THE TERRACE SHOULD NOT BE PENNED TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MOVE TO THE SIDES.

 4)     THERE WASN’T ENOUGH BARRIER, IF THERE HAD BEEN MORE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN

 LESS PRESSURE ON THE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT.


319      Q ji-    19^
 Q55     LAST YEARS GAME, THE POLICE OUTSIDE WERE NOT ALLOWING PEOPLE TO WAIT

 OUTSIDE,        IF THEY WERE IN THE VICINITY OF THE TURNSTILES THEY WERE BEING

 PUSHED INTO THE GROUND, WHICH WAS CAUSING A CRUSH THE SAME AS THIS YEAR.         IT

 APPEARS THAT THE POLICE PANIC OVER THE FANS BEING OUT ON THE ROAD, AND THEY

 JUST WANT TO GET THEM INTO THE GROUND.

 PERSONALLY,   I THINK IT WAS OUTSIDE WHERE THE PROBLEM STARTED BUT ONCE INSIDE

 THE CROWD JUST WENT FOR THE ONE SPOT INSTEAD OF BEING TOLD TO GO TO OTbfER

 AREAS.   ALSO I THINK THE SLOWNESS IN OPENING THE GATES ONTO THE P ITCh/ DIDN'T

 HELP THE SITUATION.

 [Ail    UNTIL EVERYONE LEFT.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,       IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT (CAUSED IT? (BRIEFLY)

 THE ONLY TIME I REALISED THERE WAS A CROWD SURGE WAS WHEN I SAW PEOPLE

 CLIMBING UP OVER THE F E N C E «   UP UNTIL THEN I HADN'T HEALLY LOOKED AT THE

 CROWD EXCEPT TO SEE THAT IT WAS REALLY PACKED I N .     A   EXPECTED SOMETHING LIKE

 THAT, BUT I DIDN'T REALISE IT WAS AS BAD AS I T W#S.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO,

 (353

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D y

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT JUST SEEMED AT FIRST THAT POLICE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND NEITHER

 DID THE PLAYERS BECAUSE SOME FANS GOT OVER THE FENCE AND ONTO THE PITCH.              THE

 ® L I C E WERE ORDERING THEM BACK     INTO THE CROWD AND THE PLAYERS WERE TELLING THE

 FANS TO GET OFF THE PITCH JUST BEFORE THE GAME WAS STOPPED,           I DON'T /Hlisji^ IT

 WAS HANDLED GOOD ENOUGH,        THE POLICE DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHERE TO START AND

 TbSEY WERE REALLY SLOW TO REACT,        I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE

 LIVERPOOL FANS HAD BEEN ALLOCATED MORE TICKETS AND THE LARGER END OF THE

 GROUND,     THE FOREST FANS HAD SO MUCH SPACE THEY WERE ABLE TO SIT DOWN ON THE

 TERRACING,

                      Qj
 THE SAME LAST YEAR BECAUSE THE SAME THING HAPPENED.           IT l/AS APPARENTLY A BIT

 IT SEEMED AS IF MOST OF THE POLICE OFFICERS WER^JUST HANGING AROUND, AS IF

 THEY DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO.       THE FANS HELPED MOST OF THE INJURED BY RIPPING

 DOWN BOARDS AND CARRYING THEM TO MEDICAL      j/E L P   ,

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

       ICIAL INQUIRY?

 S     RE WAS A LACK OF POLICING.    I CAN COMPARE THIS YEAR WITH THE SAME EVENT

 LAST SEASON - LAST YEAR OUR TICKETS WERE CHECKED ABOUT 1/2 MILE FROM THE

 GROUND, IF YOU HAD NO TICKET THEN YOU DIDN’T GET NEAR THE GROUND.         THERE

 WERE MORE ENTRANCES LAST YEAR INTO THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACES - THIS YEAR

 I ONLY SAW ABOUT 20 OFFICERS ON FOOT OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND SOME OFFICERS

 IN VANS.      INSIDE THE GROUND THERE WERE ONLY A FEW.      ALL OF THEM WERE TOTALLY

 DISORGANISED, THEY ONLY SEEMED INTERESTED IN STOPPING FIGHTS BETWEEN THE FANS.

 THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER USED IN THE TERRACES ASSISTING THE INJURED OUT OF

 THE PENS.

Q8

 G21

 DID YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY ENTERING THE GROUND, IF YES, GIVE BRIEF REASON?

 YES WE JOINED THE BACK OF THE CROWD AND SUDDENLY THERE SEEMED TO BE HUNDREDS

 OF PEOPLE JOINING ON BEHIND US.      IT WAS A VERY HOT DAY WITH NO WIND AND THE

 CRUSH WAS BEGINNING.     I WANTED TO GET OUT BUT MY HUSBAND PURSUADED ME TO

 REMAIN.    WE MADE OUR WAY TOWARDS THE AREA BETWEEN THE 2 OUTER GATES WHERE

 THE PRESSURE WAS LESS.     AS WE GOT CLOSER TO THE TURNSTILES THE PRESSURE

 BECAME WORSE.    THE MEN IN THE CROWD WERE VERY CONSIDERATE AND AS THEY SAW I

 WAS HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING THEY LINKED ARMS AND CLEARED A WAY FOR MY

 b ^ B A N D AND MYSELF TO GET THROUGH.   IT TOOK 15 MINS FOR US TO GET TO THE

 TURNSTILES.     IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 2-3 TIMES AS LONCj^ IF THEY HADN'T CLEARED A

 PATH FOR US.     I REMEMBER PANICKING AND THINKING THAT THE CRUSH OUTSIDE WAS

 SUFFICIENT THAT THERE WAS A DANGER OEXflHE WALL COLLAPSING. S / 0 &        (A.

 YES I HANDED BOTH OF OUR TICKETS IN BUT HE ONLY GAVE HE ONE STUB BACK. WE THEN

 HAD DIFFICULTIES GETTING INTO TJn    STAND.             /

 I REMEMBER SEEING A MAN AND A WOMA N BY THE GATE£j    THE NORTH STAND TERRACES

       I BELIEVE WERE TICKET/TOUTS.   I WAS QUITE SURPRISED THAT I ONLY SAW A

 COUPLE OF PEOPLE ASKING FOR TICKETS, NORMALLY YOU ARE INNUNDATED BY DOZENS OF

 THEM.

 Q2S

 ONCE INSIDE THE GROUND, DID YOU SEE ANY SIGNS DIRECTING YOU TO YOUR MATCH

 VIEWING POINT?.

 NO WE WENT RIGHT BY MISTAKE AND SOME ONE SHOUTED FOR US TO GO THE OTHER WAY.


012

 Q29

 4 ) YOU HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY AT ALL IN FINDING YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 NOT ONCE WE WERE GOING IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION ONCE IN THE STAND THERE WERE
 NO PROBLEMS.    WE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE STEWARD AT THE ENTRNACE TO THE STAND

 BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT ONLY ONE STUB WAS RETURNED TO US.

 Q30

 DID YOU USE THE TUNNEL TO THE STANDING AREA (TO PENS 3 & 4 ON MAP).

 NO.

013

 032

 WAS THERE ANY POLICE CONTROL EVIDENT AT THIS POINT IN THE GROUND?

 WHEN WE WENT TO THE RIGHT BY MISTAKE I SAW THAT THE COURTYARD IN FRONT OF

 THE TUNNEL WAS VIRTUALLY EMPTY WITH JUST TRICKLES OF PEOPLE GOING ACROSS,

 I SAW NO POLICE.

 033

 WAS THERE ANY MATCH STEWARD CONTROL AT THIS POINT?

 NOT THAT I SAW.

 034

 l£| YOU WITNESS ANY DISORDER OR OTHER INCIDENTS BETWEEN YOUR ENTRY POINT AND

 MATCH VIEWING POINT?     (BRIEFLY DESCRIBE).

 INSIDE THE GROUND IT WAS FAIRLY EMPTY GOING TO THE STAND BECAUSE THE PEOPLE

 WERE EITHER SEATED OR STANDING AT THEIR PLACES OR STRUGGLING TO GET IN AT THE

 TURNSTILES.

 NO.

 047

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 I SAW PEOPLE WHO HAD GOT ONTO THE PITCH SIT DOWN AND THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY

      iURED.    BUT I DIDN’T SEE ANYONE DIE.     I REMEMBER COUNTING THE BODIES

»     ENG CARRIED AWAY AND IT WAS WHEN I REACHED 30 THAT I REALISED THE SCALE OF

 THE DISASTER.

 048

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED, IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO I REMAINED IN THE NORTH STAND.

 IF IT HAD BEEN PUT OVER THE TANNOY FOR ANY MEDICAL STAFF I WOULD HAVE GONE

 PEOPLE ON THE PITCH.

 <349

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YQJef^CONSIDER WAS FACTOR IN THE DEATHS OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 YES AT A QUARTER TO THREijjr (1445) I SAW THAT THE CENJffE TERRACES WERE FULL

 AND THE ENDS WERE HALF EMPTY.      AT THAT TIME I R ^E MBER WONDERING WHY PEOPLE

 WERE NOT BEING DIRECTED TO THE ENDS.

 Q50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 WHEN THE TANNOY SAID THAT WE COULD LEAVE LONG AFTER KENNY DALGLISH HAD MADE

 HIS SPEECH.     I CAN'T SAY THE TIME.

 Q51

 Ift YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT.


QEQ

 <352

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

      ^ER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL IF THE LOUj       SPEAKER SYSTEM HAD BEEN

                                           iG ON^TOJCH
 USED TO INFORM EVERYONE OF WHAT WAS ( >I1\I  ( W M J C H EARLIER

 THE AMBULA                  AKE AN UNDUE TIME TO ARRIVE AND IT TOOK A TIME

 FOR IT TO WORK AROUND THE EDGE.      I DON’T KNOW WHY IT DIDN’T DRIVE ACROSS

 THE PITCH.

 I REMEMBER THAT THE FANS AND ST JOHNS       AMBULANCE WERE WORKING IN A FRENZIE

 BUT NEXT TO NO POLICE OFFICERS.      THE POLICE DID NOT SEEM TO GET INVOLVED
                                                               .r7a.    _          PAGE 10

WITH ASSISTING THE DEAD AND INJURED^tHER THAN^A^8t<ALL NUMBER

I KNOW WHY THE POLICE WERE ACROSffiiHE PITCH, IT WAS BECAUSE THE LIVERPOOL

FANS WERE CHANTING, "SHITTY Q^OUND" AT 2.55 (1455) BEFORE THE MATCH WAS

STARTED AND THEN LATER ON AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED SOME LIVERPOOL FANS RAN

TOWARDS THE FOREST FMffi OBVIOUSLY TO REMONSTRATE WIJ^T t HEM BECAUSE THEY HELD

UP A SHANKLEY BANbiO.

IT WAS THEN THj*T THE POLICE PUT A CORDON ^ R O S S THE PITCH.         I COULD SEEj^HffY IT

WAS NECESSAB'V BUT THE NUMBERS USES WE R^FAR TOO GREAT AND THEY REJOINED THERE

FAR TOOOvONG.    OVER HALF OF THEM C W L D HAVE BEEN USED TO ASSIST WITH THE

INJURED.

IF THE TANNOY SYSTEM HAD BEEN USED TO REQUEST PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL TRAINING

■^In THEY COULD HAVE GONE ONTO THE PITCH AND ASSISTED.          I AM NOT SAYING THAT

THE FANS DID NOT DO THEIR BEST BUT OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE WITH TRAINED MEDICAL

KNOWLEDGE COULD HAVE SAVED SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIED OR ENDED UP WITH BRAIN

DAMAGE.

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU F£f.L IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE TICKET ALLOCATIONJ J m S , ATTROCIOUS.       THE NUMBERS FOR THE

LIVERPOOL FANS WERE TOO SMALL AND 9 0 / m E NUMBERS      OF PEOPLE WHO HAD TO GO

^ p O U G H THE TURNSTILES AT THE LEPPINGS LAME END WERE FAR TOO MANY. IT WAS THAT

THAT PARTIALLY   LED TO THE CRUSH OUJ^IDE THE GROUND,

ALSO THERE WERE NO POLICE OUTSLtfE THE GROUND AT LEPPINGS              E CONTROLLING THE

CROWD BEFORE THEY REACHED TJ>       GATES.

IF THERE HAD BEEN SUfY   ic/ e NT   POLICE THERE THEY>roULD HAVE ORGANISED THE CROWD

BETTER AND PREVENTED THE PROBLEM FROM OCCJ**RING.        THEY ALSp COULD HAVE
                                                              fir
PREVENTED THE TICKET TOUTS FROM BEING/PRESENT.

ALSO I KNOW THAT THE PERIMETER FENCES ARE THERE BECAUSE OF THE HOOLIGANS IN

THE PAST, AND I DO NOT THINK THAT THEY NECESSARILY NEED TO BE PULLED DOWN.

BUT THE DESIGN OF THOSE GATES WAS BAD, THEY WERE TOO SMALL, AND THERE WERE
                                                                                             PAGE 11

 NOT ENOUGH OF THEM.        IF THEY HAD BEEN MANNED BY POLICE, >FFICERS AT ALL

 EARLIER AND RELIEVED EARLIER.

ALSO I CANNOT SEE WHY, WHEN IT BECAME OBVIOUS                      QUARTER TO 3 PM (1445)

 THAT THE CENTRE PENS WERE FULL THE SENIQ^POLICE OFFICERS DID NOT DIRECT

A FEW POLICE OFF ICERS OR STEWARDS TiT STAND BY THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL AisJD

DIRECT FANS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT’'                       \

 I CANNOT BLAME THAT POLICE OFFICERS FOR OPENING THE GATE BECAUSE AT THE TIME

THE SITUATION OUTSIDE MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE BECAUSE AT THE TIME THAT I WAS

 THERE IT WAS BAD ENOUGH,          IF THAT CROWD PRESSURE HAD NOT BEEN RELIEVED

THEN PEOPLE COULD HAVE DIED OUTSIDE.

 WHO SUPPORTED ME THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND SAT ME DOWN AT THE REAR OF

     Q33

     DID YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS           OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE     WAYTHE INCIDENT

     WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

     I DID NOT HEAR ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS OF WHAT TO DO OR WHAT WA

     I THOUGHT THIS WAS WRONG.          I THOUGHT THAT THE POLICE WERE

     THEIR REACTION IN OPENING THE GATES, BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE

     FOR HELP AND FOR THEM TO OPEN THE GATES, SO THEY COULD GE

     THE POLICE ON THE PITCH JUST SEEMED TO BE            LOOKING IN AT ONE TIME

     WITHOUT DOING NOTHING.            I ALSO THINK THAT THE     OTHER EMERGENCY

1          VICES WERE SLOW IN ARRIVING AT THE GROUND.

     Q54

     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

     VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQj/1 RY?
                                  S
     OUTSIDE THE GROUND THEBE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF POLICING OR CONTROL OF
                            M u } L -c J t-
     THE CROWD.     LAST YEffl THERE WAS MORE POLICE AND GREATER CONTROL OVER

     THE MOVEMENT OF/^ANS.       ALSO THIS YEAR THERE WAS MORE POLICE FURTHER

     AWAY FROM TH^-GROUND THAN NEAR IT.

     I THINK IF THE GATE HADN’T BEEN OPENED THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN

     FU S I B L E DEATHS OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

     I THINK THERE ALSO COULD HAVE BEEN MORE TURNSTILES TO ALLOW THE

     CROWD TO GET IN.

     I ALSO THINK THAT THE FENCES FORMING PENS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN
     REMOVED TO ALLOW THE CROWD SIDEWAYS.

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH, IF SO, CAN YOU SAY

 WHAT TIME THIS HAPPENED?

 ABOUT 10 MINS. BEFORE THE GAME STARTED WE WERE LIFTING PEOPLE

 OUT OF PEN 3 INTO OUR PEN, THIS WAS MAKING OUR PEN FULL AND

 THROUGH SHEER PANIC OF THE PEOPLE WHO WE WERE BRINGING OUT OF

^ N    3, THIS WAS CAUSING OUR PEN TO HAVE A SLIGHT CRUSH.

 Q45

 FORWARDS.

 049

 DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 0i>0

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 17.45 HOURS.

 051

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

 STEWARD, A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 LEFT OF OUR OWN ACCORD.


019

 052

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A

 CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.


020

 053

 ®YOU     HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1)     IT WAS UNORGANISED, LACK OF COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN

 EMERGENCY SERVICES.

 2)     LOUD SPEAKER WAS NO GOOD, YOU COULDN’T HEAR WHAT WAS

 BEING SAID ON IT.

 3)     AT ONE STAGE A LINE OF POLICEMEN WERE ACROSS THE HALFWAY

 LINE.    ALTHOUGH I KNEW THAT THERE WAS A NEED FOR THEM TO

 BE THERE BECAUSE THE NOTTS FOREST TEAM HAD STARTED TO SING

 SOMETHING ABOUT LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS AND SOME LIVERPOOL FANS
                                                                             PAGE   9

HAD RAN TOWARDS THEM, THEY DIDN’T GET EVEN AS FAR AS THE

HALFWAY LINE, WHEN THEY RETURNED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD.

THE POLICE STAYED WHERE THEY WERE, WHEN I FEEL THAT SOME

OF THEM COULD HAVE GIVEN HELP TO THE INJURED, OR EVEN DIED.

4)    THERE DIDN’T APPEAR TO BE ANY EMERGENCY PLAN FOR THIS TYPE

OF SITUATION.

054

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

1 )   TICKET ALLOCATION IS TOTALLY WRONG.

2)    ALTHOUGH YOU HAD A TICKET FOR A CERTAIN STAND, THERE WAS NOBODY
ft
INSIDE THE GROUND TO DIRECT YOU OR MAKE SURE YOU WENT INTO THAT

PEN, YOU WERE ABLE TO GO INTO WHICH EVER STAND YOU WANTED TO,

AND BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO GO BEHIND THE GOALS, THIS IS

WHAT HAPPENED?

3)    BEING ALLOWED TO GET IN THE LEPPINGS LN END, EVEN THOUGH YOU

HAD A TICKET FOR NOTTS FOREST END.

4)    PLACES ALLOCATED IN THE GROUND,   (I.E. GIVEN THE SMALLER ALLOCATION

EVEN THOUGH MUCH LARGER FOLLOWING).

5)    NOT ENOUGH TURNSTILES TO ALLOW A STEADY FLOW TO GO THROUGH,

E ^ A U S E OF THIS A LARGE BOTTLE-NECK ACCUMULATED OUTSIDE.

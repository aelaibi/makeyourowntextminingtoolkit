ARRANGED PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION AND ANSWER FOR WRITTEN ANSWER ON
 IO XANiUA£-M        R g lO

     *. I^° ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what
the circumstances are with regard to the ending of the trial of
electronic monitoring in Nottingham, and if there are plans for the
introduction of monitoring on a trial basis in other areas.




DRAFT REPLY

The Nottingham trial contract was let to run from 14 August 1989 to
29 January 1990.       The trial will be ending, as originally planned,
on that date.      No new defendants will be accepted after that date but
existing participants will continue to be monitored until 22 April.
The results of the trial will be carefully evaluated,                         but   it is
a lready clear that the technology can be put to practical use and
that   the   procedures         for   fitting    the    equipment    and      monitoring
*defendants are practicable.           It would now be desirable to test the
use of electronic monitoring on a trial basis in an area in which
substaatial„juimbers are likely to be eligible for its application as
a condition of bail.

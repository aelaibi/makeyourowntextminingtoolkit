Attending at the Football Association with John Dyson,

Glen Curtain, Andy Williamson ana jacjc (jrawiord.

The meeting was held to discuss the first draft of the FA's
phase 1 Submission.

JD felt that the draft should be in 3 parts.

(i)       Causes of Hillsborough.

(ii)     FA recommendations.

(iii)    Discussion of the F A â€™s responsibility.

He had met Andrew Collins at lunch who had said that the FA
had made mistakes but they were not causative.

Although going into the causes of Hillsborough was somewhat
departing from the low profile policy the FA had taken in
the case, we cannot avoid saying something about what
happened.

We discussed the recommendations of the FA representatives
and decided that a meeting would be held on Thursday
morning to discuss the style of the Submission.

Time engaged: 3h hours including travel

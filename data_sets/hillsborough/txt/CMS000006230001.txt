I refer to the letter to you of 16 January from Mr K E Vinicombe of
the Planning Inspectorate at the Department of the Environment. The
Sports Council to whom he sent a copy of your letter have passed the
copy to this Department as we are the sponsoring department for the
Council.
However in your letter you suggest that the timetable for the move to
all seating at football grounds is too tight and that the whole issue
should be reconsidered. All seating at football grounds is in fact the
responsibility of the Home Secretary to whom I notice you copied your
original letter. I have therefore passed a copy of this letter to the
Home Office who will no doubt be replying to you direct.

Yours sincerely

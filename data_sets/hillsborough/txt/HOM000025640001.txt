           SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS

           Thank you for your letter of 26 February.

           I very much welcome your proposal that we should meet to consider
           implementation of the Taylor Report in Wales; that would be most
           helpful in ensuring a common approach and help to establish firmer links
           between our Divisions.

           May I suggest chat we meet in Cardiff and that your* secretary contacts
           mine to make suitable arrangements?

Our ref: FEP/90 35/48/93 (S)




Thank you for your letter of 29 January to the Home Secretary
about the effect on football in Wales of the recommendations of
the Final Report on the Hillsborough Disaster.

You may be aware from the Schedule placed in the Vote Office on
29 January following the Home Secretary's statement to the House
on the Taylor report, that the Government expects to apply the
recommendations on all seated accommodation in the case of UEFA
high risk matches, the four divisions of the Football League and
the national stadia.

The timetable recommended in the Final Report, would appear to
require that Cardiff City, Swansea City and Wrexham in view of
their current league status, convert to all seated accommodation
by 1999.

However there is an additional element that the clubs and the
Football Association of Wales will need to take into account.
Last year FIFA, the sport's international governing body, passed a
resolution requiring that all preliminary rounds of the 1994 World
Cup - commencing in Autumn 1992 - should be played in all seater
stadia.  The resolution went on to place a duty on national
football associations from 1993 to hold high risk matches in their
countries only in all-seater stadia.  The definition of high risk,
provided by UEFA, is contained in paragraph 82 of the Final
Report.

In order to comply with the FIFA resolution, with entry into
European competitions and the 1994 World Cup, it would appear that
the Football Association of Wales has the option from those dates
of playing European and international matches at club grounds
using only the seated accommodation or playing matches at a
suitable alternative venue.

                                          /Whether



Dafydd Wigley Esq MP
Whether the FIFA resolution on high risk matches as defined by
UEFA will be applied to domestic football, is a matter we will
discuss with the football authorities.

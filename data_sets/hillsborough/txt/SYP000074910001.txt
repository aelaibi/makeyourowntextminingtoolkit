                    was     then t r a n s ported to Sheffield,                by doubl e - d e c k e r        bus,         for duty at

                    the Liverpool          v Notts.        Forest     football        match.

                    I was     part of Serial            No.   25 super v i s e d by P S . 2640 Perry and after

                    being     briefed      inside       the ground,        and a short meal                 break.          I left with

                    other Of ficers          to take       up a point         in M i d d l e f i e l d Road       near        to the

                    H i l l s b o r o u g h shopping     precinct.

                    Throu g h o u t   this    time      I was      in company with P C . 2225 Purvis and other

                    Officers        were working         in pairs at          regular        intervals along M i d d l e f i e l d

                    Road.      This      ’p o i n t ’ commenced about            11.15am that day and the other
                                                                                                  S 1917

Officers          referred to were PCs Enwright,                      Smith,, Wild, Weeks, Foster and

Gibsonalthough              there were        others      positioned further             towards       the

football          ground.

F rom    taking      up the       ’p o i n t ’ there were many small              groups     of both sets

of supporters walking                    towards      the ground       from the general          d i r e c t i o n of

the City          centre,    a l th ou gh most         of them seemed to be Liverpool                    fans

(the     common      red/white           colours made         identification,          at time,       difficult),

In the early stages                there was          little    rowdiness,       chanting,       etc,      but

from about          1.00pm,       the numbers          of supporters        increased and the

Thr e s h e r s    off-licence,          w h ich^was     situated only a few yards                from my

des c r i p t i o n s and inyfarge quantities.      Individual people were buying

up to six          cans
                             //
                           ojr beer/lager and            large bottles          of wine were also             being

consumed.           Ow/ng    to the        large      numbers    of    people    entering       the    premises

the m a n a g e ^ c l o sed the shop at 2.00pm.                       I believe       it was PC G i b s o n who

spoke     \y r    the manager       but     that the      closing of the          premises was a

v ol un t a r y act.

It was also apparent                that     by this time many supporters were worse                             for

drink and it was n e cessary to advise some of them about their conduct*

I was not in possession of a Police radio/but PC Purvis was, and I

caught      only brief,           and sometimes          garbed,        t r a n smissions    from other

Of f i c e r s who      I took to be on duty/£t                 the ground       itself.

S ho r t l y after 3.00pm           I recall am Officer,                over    the    radio,    requesting

for     the gates         to be ope n e d     j6X,   herwise    there w o u l d be serious            i n j u r i es

I assu m e d       it was    that/£ame Officer who                repeatedly a sked for               the gates

to be opened but,                again,     owing to the garbled state                  of the

t r an sn us si on / r e c e p t i o n    I was      unable    to unae r s t a n d exactly what was

happeni n g .

S h or tl y after         this    I did hear a t r a n s m i s s i o n      requesting all            Officers
                                                                                                                  PAG E      3
                                                                                                                  S1917

              to   return to the ground,                 A Police    transit     van    came    into M i d d l e f i e l d

             Road     from B ra df i e l d Road          but because    it was already full             of Officers

              did not         stop,     I wa l k e d back    to the Leppings Lane end of the ground

             with PC Purvis,              Other    officers,       including PS Perry and             Insp

             Humpher i e s , a 1so returned.

             On arrival          I saw a large           number   of Liverpool        fans already        leaving      the

             ground from the L a p pings Lane                 end.     Most    of them were        in a dist r e s s e d

              state and some            bore minor        injuries and were          being helped away          by

             f r ie n d s .

              I was    not      instructed to enter           the ground and by this             time em e r g e n c y

             vehicles were arriving.

              I w ould estimate           that 50 Police Officers were                 on the    road/footpaths

             and that          they,    like myself,        was unaware       of what    had happened         inside

             the ground,          a l t h o u g h some    fans did say that deaths             had occurred.

             Most     of      those    leaving were        extremely hostile         towards     the Police.

              I a s si st ed     in keeping       clear     the   road so that the emergency services

              could gain access            to the ground.

             About 5 . 2 0 pin I was         instru cted by PS Perry            to    return    into M i d d l e f i e l d

             Road,     with other Officers,               and about 6,0 5 p m        I returned to tne ground

             w here we were e ve n t u a l l y stood down.

                                                                                                                SI G N E D

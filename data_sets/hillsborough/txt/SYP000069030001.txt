There was          no fighting           or orunkeness             on our way             to the    ground ana we

Police       searching          Dags     for    drink.        At    this       part i cular        time we      did not

see any       stewards          either       outside        the    ground       or     inside      the   ground.           At

Although            1 witnessed             scenes        of    crowd       crush    I was       not       involved          in a n y

did not, see any                 crowd       surge as           suers but we did               see    a number              offans

being        pulled        up    into       the West St arm frost: the                   terraces.                At    t h i s time        1

thought         that       there        could        have       oeen a fight             but tnen we             realised that

people were               being       crushed and were                  being       pulled to safety                   by

spec t a t o r s      in the West Stand,.



We did not witness                      any deaths             and    it was       not    until       we    saw a stretcher

There was             no    point         in any        of us going            down on to the               pitch      because

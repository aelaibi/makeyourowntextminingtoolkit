            I am ^             a            n          d            I live        at    the     above    address with my

            mother       and     father          and    tw o   sisters.

            I have       been       a Liverpool              supporter        for       all     of m y   life       and     I have       been

            going       to m a t c h e s        since      I was     10.      First        of    all w i t h m y         father     and

            secondly         on m y      own      recently          but     only       to h o m e m a t c h e s .        I o n l y go        to

            an    away     fixture          if    it    is a n      important           match.

            On    Friday       7th April              1989     I went       with my        friend

                                                               to    t he    ground        at A n f i e l d    and we        both bought

            tickets        for      the m a t c h       on S a t u r d a y    15th Apri l           1989.          I paid        £6.00       for

            it a n d     it w a s      fo r      the    Leppings          Lane     terrace,         gate      B.

            On Monday          10th April              1989,                and        I went      to    the o f f i c e s of      the

            coach      company,          HOME         JAMES     (Topping)          in H i g h     Street,          Wavertree,

            Liverpool          15    to g e t         coach    tickets        to go        to    the m a t c h .

            The    tickets were                 £6.00      each     return,       my mother          had phoned            around        for

            me    to   find      the     cheapest.

            The    coach was           to       leave      from outside            th e    coach company             offices        in H i g h

            Street,       Wavertree              at    1100    a m on       the    Saturday        so    I spent          th e   Friday

            night      (14     4/8 9 )      at m y n a n s                                                          It    is o n l y     a

short       distance          from          the H i g h       Street.

I went       round       to                     address          at     0900     am on         the S a t u r d a y m o r n i n g        to

make    sure that             he w as         up and          at q u a r t e r      to    1000 am we           left                 and

caught       th e b u s       to       th e H i g h      Street         getting          there       sometime        before        half

past     1000      am.

The    coach was             late       arriving          a n d d i d n ’t ge t           there until           10 p as t         1100

am.     It w a s        an    executive             coach        and w h e n we           g ot    on    the d r i v e r      checked

our    tickets.              The       coach       filled        up and we            set      of at h a l f        past     1100 am

this     is h a l f      an ho ur            late.

We went       non       stop        to S h e f f i e l d       with      no    problems           except       for       being

delayed       on    the M 6 2           by    traffic          jams      that       kept       on ho l d in g       us    up.      It

was    no    sooner          than you had                got     through         one      that       5 minutes           later

you were        in a n o t h e r            one.

We    got    to S h e f f i e l d ,          some where           close        to     the      ground,       when        the c o a c h

was    stopped          and       a couple          of u n i f o r m e d       Police          Officers        looked        in    the

coach.        One went             upstairs             and    th e     other       looked        in on us          in the        rear

lower       section.              H e d i d n ’t c h e c k        our      bags       or a n y t h n g .       I d i d n ’t see

anyone       drinking             on    the     coach but             I presumed              that     that w a s        what     he wa s

looking       for.

We    arrived       in S h e f f i e l d           at    about        25 p a s t      1400       p m a nd    the     coach

dropped       us    off       somewhere             on    the     road up           to B a r n s l e y u p      from       the

roundabout          near          to    the    ground.            There was              a Gateway          supermarket            on

the    right       nearby.

We    walked       quickly             to    the ground,                       a nd      I,   and      it o n l y    t o o k us

about       5 minutes.                 I wanted          to    ge t    there       quickly because my watch was

broken       and    I knew             that we w e r e           l at e a n d       I had        to a s k p e o p l e      the

time.        I d i d n ’t s e e             any problems              or a n y o n e      drinking          from where we               got

off    the c o a c h         to    th e      ground       itself.             Everyone was              very    g oo d natured.

I arrived          at    th e      ground          just       after      half      past       1400      pm and       that w a s

where        I saw          th e       first        Police           since being                on     the      coach.           They were

outside           the       entrance               to    the       gates        to    the       Leppings             lane    turnstiles.

There        had been              a    lot       of     coaches           on       the w a y        to     the g r o u n d       and       there

were     alot          of p e o p l e w a l k i n g                to     the       ground        so      I sumised          t ha t     there

would        be    a    lot        of p e o p l e w a i t i n g             to g e t         in.

I saw        that       there           was       a b ig          crowd     back          out     into       Leppings            Lane       it s e l f

with     a couple             of        dozen           Police           Officers          on     foot       and     6 on h o r s e          back

outside           the       gates           to    the        turnstiles.                  They were             regulating             the n u m b e r

of     people          going           through           to       the     courtyard             and       the     turnstiles.

However           most       of        th e      officers            were       covering             the     entrance            to    the

turnstiles              for        the        seats          in    the W e s t        Stand          a nd    there were               only     2 on

horseback              covering               the       turnstiles              A    to G w h i c h          lead      to    the       Leppings

Lane     terraces.

The     turnstiles                 1-16          f or    the W e s t        Stand          were        for h o m e      supporters               I

think        because          there was                  a sign           saying          Home       Supporters             by    there        and

away     supporters                    by     turnstiles                 A-G.        There        is a w a l l         and       railings

seperatig              those           two       turnstile               courtyards.

The     Police          for        turnstiles                  1-16       had       got    people           into     queues           but    the     two

Police        on h o r s e             back were               telling          people          to w a i t       before          going       through

the     gate       to       the        courtyard               for       turnstiles             A-G       u n ti l   he m o v e d       the     horse

to     let    them          through              a f e w at          a    time.           However           the h o r s e        was    moving

from side              to    side           and     people were                 nipping           thro u g h .

I must       admit           that           I was        surprised              at    the       s m al l     number      of       turnstiles

f or   people           going           into        the       Leppings              Lane    terraces.

I s a w no         stewards                 there        at     all.

When     I was          let        through              by     the       Police       I went           into      the    courtyard where

there were              3 or        4 Police                 on h o r s e b a c k         trying          to c o n t r o l       the    crowd

waiting           to g e t         into          th e    turnstiles.                  There were                no q u e u e s        and    the

officers           were       trying              to     form        t he m but           the h ors e w as m o v i n g                 around        and
                                                                                                                                  PAGE

w
as    everyone was              moving        away         to a v o i d      getting kicked              it w a s       just          a

crowd.

I went       through         turnstile            (gate)           B and      h anded my          ticket        in to        the

steward.           I d i d n ’t s e e         any      stewards           other         than    the     ones      actually

operating          th e    turnstiles.

I had       no d i f f i c u l t y     knowing where                   to go       because        there w e r e         clear             signs

saying which way                 to w h i c h         turnstile,             even       though     I had never               been

there       before.

I had       some    difficulty               getting          to    the      correct        turnstile           though        because

the    crowd       pushed        me    over       to o n e         side.

I d i d n ’t s e e        any    other        gates         open       other       than     the    turnstiles            an d         I

d i d n ’t s e e a n y o n e         fighting          or     drinking            or    climbing        over      or    anything.

Everyone         appeared            to h a v e       tickets            and e v e r y t h i n g was normal              except             for

the    fact      that      it w a s      packed.

Once     I got      through           the     turnstiles               I d i d n ’t s e e a n y         signs      d i r e c t i n g me

where       to go      and      there were             no     Police         or    stewards        there        either.

However        I knew where              to go         because          as        soon    as   I came through                the

turnstiles          I could           se e    the      tunnel            a n d the       pitchbeyond            leading down

to    the    terraces,

I went       through         the      tunnel,          everyone was                walking        normally,            and    there

were    no     problems.              I didn't             see any        Police         or s t e w a r d s .      Again          I

d i d n ’t s e e    anyone           drinking.

When    I came         out      of    th e    tunnel          i nt o    the       terrace       I went       to    the       right          of

th e d i v i d i n g      fence with                           The      pen was          pretty       full      right        to       the

back    I would           estimate           t ha t    there was             room       for m a y b e    100 m o r e         people

and    pen     4 was       the s a me.

I worked my way                 forwards          to g e t         the b e s t         v i e w until     I was         about          h al f

way    to    the    front        and     9 or         10    feet       from       the    dividing        fence         between

pens    3 and       4.       I took          up m y m a t c h          viewing          position        at a b o u t     quarter

  time    there w a s          getting           to be         no    room        to m o v e w h e r e         I was.         I was

  standing normally                    and people were                     pressing             against me           f r o m all     sides.

  It w a s    getting          uncomfortable.

  Just    after         that       the p r e s s u r e         of    the        people          from behind           continued         to

  get w o r s e     and       I was       slowly being                 pushed             forwards        towards        the    front

  fen ce.        There        were      no     fights          or a n y t h i n g          it w a s     just     the     number       of

  of p e o p l e    in       the    pen.

  By about         10    to    150 0      pm     things         were        g e t t i n g b a d an d          I could        see     that

  people      at    the       front were             in a       bad        way.           In f act      t h ere w e r e      people        that

  looked      as    though          they m a y         have         been dead              by    then.

  I was      now    about          5 or        6 rows        of p e o p l e          back from          the     front       fence

  about      9 or       10    f ee t    from        the    dividing              f e n c e for       pen s      3 and       4 and it

  was    about      the       same      sort        of d i s t a n c e          to    the       front     fence.

  I could        see     that       the g a t e        onto         the     pitch was             over     to    the     r i ght     but     that

  the w o r s t     crush was             at    the       front        near          to    the d i v i d i n g       fence     btween

  pens    3 and         4.

  The    crush      continued             to g et w o r s e            and       I was          pushed     forwards.            I was

  about      5 people          to      the     left       of    one        of    t he b a r r i e r s w h e n         it b r o k e    and     it

  caused      a surge          forward.              As    the       barrier went                 down     it k n o c k e d p e o p l e

  in f r o n t     of    it    slowly          to    the       floor        because everyone was                       so    packed .

  The    thing      that       sticks wi t h me                 most        is       that b e f o r e      it    snap pe d people

 were     being         crushed        against            it a n d         their mou t h s were                 open and       they were

 screaming.              Their         faces        stick       in m y m i n d            as     they ch an ge d         to a y e l l o w

 colour       and       then       to a b l u e        and      a purple              colour       and     then       they w ould

  slump      and hang          over       the       bar    or       t he    people          next      to them.           They were

 being       held       upright        by      the b a r r i e r s          and       the p r e s s u r e       of    the p e o p l e

^T h e r e w a s    half       a dozen        or     so    of      them m o s t l y          lads    in t h e i r        20's w i t h a

 couple       of o l d e r       men.       I cant         described             t h e m or      t h ei r     clothing          really.

 Some    of    the       people        in f r o n t       of      the b a r r i e r      were       crushed         as    they were

 knocked       to       the    floor       and     trampled.              There was            nothing         anyone        c o u l d do

about      it b e c a u s e         they were          just        pushed        forwards           from behind            into        the

 small     gap made            by    the     person          going        down     and that thenc a u s e d                 more            of a

push     against          th e      poor     people          at     the    front.

There      was      a    little        boy with           black       hair       and     a    lad a b o u t        20 w i t h    blond

hair     and       he    had blood          coming         f r o m his         nose.         On e m a n w a s        bout       30,     and

 six    foot       tall,       broad with            short         blond       h a ir.       They were             all    in f r o n t       of

 the    barrier          and were          knocked         down when             it b r o k e .       The m a n was             in     the

ambulance w i t h me                 later w h e n         I went         to H o s p i t a l        a nd    I remember           him

saying        ’’H e l p me,         I ’m g o i n g     to d i e . ”           I d o n ’t k n o w       if    they survived                  or

not.

 I was     pushed         forwards           until        I was        4 or      5 f ee t       f r o m the        f e n c e but w i t h

still      the      same       number        of     people          in f r o n t      of me.

 I think       t h at     the       barrier        broke          just    before         the g a m e        w as    stopped          and

shortly        after          I noticed          that      the      gate       towards         the    right         hand    e n d of

pen     3 was       open       onto     the pit c h .

Before        the m a t c h w a s          stopped         people         at     the     f r o nt w e r e      trying       to c l i m b

over     the       fence       and    onto       the    pitch.

One     P o l i c e man,         I cant       describe             hi m but       he     looked y o u n g           and    I have

seen a picture                 of    him   since          in o n e       of    the     papers,        climbed            up onto        the

fence      and was            shouting        for      people         to p u s h       back.         I saw         several       Police

Officers         pushing            people     back who             were       c l i m b i n g up over             the    front

fence.         It       looked       to m e    as      though         they      thought         that        they were           dealing

with     a pitch          invasion         and       didn't         realise          what     w as    really         going       on.

It w a s      a good          5 minutes        before           they      realised what was                   happening              an d

started        helping          people        out      and     it w a s        then      that     the m a t c h w a s

As    this w e n t        on,     a couple            of m i n u t e s     after        th e m a t c h w a s          s t o pp e d ,      it

seemed       to e a s e w h e r e         I was        and    a space           of a c o u p l e         of     steps         ope ne d up

a r o u n d me.

All    in    front        of m e w a s          l i ke a m a s s       of b o d i e s        all    entangled             in e a c h

other,       people         had     been        climbing          over     them        to    try a n d        get     out      over       the

fence       and     onto      the       pitch.

I could         hear      that      some        of    them were           crying        for h e l p a n d           together             with a

couple       of     fans      and       a Police           Officer        who     had       arrived,          I started           pulling

people       ou t    of     the     t a n gl e .       I d o n ’t k n o w w h i c h w e r e              dead       or    just

passed       out     and      injured           but we w e r e         helping          t hem and         giving          some       of

them     th e     kiss      of    life.

One    that       sticks         ou t    in m y m i n d       is    t ha t      as w e m o v e d         on e    body         of a m a n

from     the      tangle         near     to     th e m i d d l e      of p e n        3 at       the    front        I s a w the b o d y

of    a man       lying       face       downwards           with      a body          of    a    little        boy      still       on

his    shoulders.                His     arm was           reaching        ou t      towards        the       gate.

Just     after       this        we w e r e      taking more              bodies        across          to w h e r e      t h e y had

pulled       open      th e      fencing         to ge t      them        out     and       I remember           that         th e r e

was    another         push       from      the       back.        I was        just        lifting        up a d e a d m a n

and    as    the p u s h         developed            it p u s h e d      me    into        the p i l e       of d e a d       bodies

and    I took        that m a n s         place.            The    other        bodies           were    pushed          on    top

of m e      and     I blacked            out.

I came       around         on    the     pitch        and    the      same       policeman             that     had      been

helping me           from        th e    start       w a s w i t h me.            He    told me          that       he    had

d r agged me         ou t     onto       th e    pitch       by    t he    edge        of    the p e n a l t y        area

across       by     the     fence        between           pens    2 and        3.

That     same       Policeman,            when we were              moving           the     bodies       had       been

helped him           and    gave         him      the k i s s of           life until          he c a m e      a r o un d .

We    both     then got        on        with      h e l p i n g to      m o v e the        bodies.           It wa s

one    of    those     situations where                    you don't            think        of y o u r s e l f       you

have    a chance           to g e t      o ut     but     you     j us t      get    on a n d h e l p         everyone

who's       hurt.

As    we were        moving       the b o d i e s         ou t s e v e r a l        Policeman were               coming        in    to

in    the    pen     and    to a n       extent         their         coming        in m a d e m a t t e r s        worse.

When    I had        come     round        I had        no m o v e m e n t      in m y       right        leg,      it wa s

without        any    feeling         at    all      and       the     Policeman            hel ped me         to m y       feet

and helped me              to w a l k      until        I could         stand        on m y        own.       There were            still

so m a n y     people       lying        there       outside           the     pen and         on    th e pi t c h .

There       were     Policemen           inside         t he    pens       helping          to d r a g       people

out    and     so    together         with          the    s a m e P o l i c e m a n Ih e l p e d       to       get

the    advertising           hoardings              and put people              on       them      to     u s e as

s tretchers.

I c o u l d n ’t w a l k     properly             and     I was        dragging my             right         leg b u t w e

after       them.

One    ambulance           came     onto        the p i t c h         between        the     North        Stand       and     the    Spion

Kop    and drove           down     to     th e     pen s .

Two    were     between        the W e s t          Stand       and      the    South         Stand and ambulance were

by    the    side    of     the     gy m n asium and              the    north           stand queueing               up    to c o m e

with    someone       another            would       come       in.

in     the    crush       inside pen                3 when         the b a r r i e r       broke.

wasn't        there.

It m u s t     have       been       about          10     past       1700       pm when          another           policeman

suggested           that       I go       to       the ho s p i t a l           I got      into        an a m b u l a n c e ,         o ne w i t h

blond        hair    who       I mentioned                 earlier          who was         in s h o c k a n d             shouting           that

he was        going       to die.              I dont           know any           of    the      others.

It     took abou t         10 m i n u t e s           to     get      to    th e R o y a l        Hallamshire                Hospital

where        I was    seen       by       the d o c t o r s           and       nurses      and        kept     in.

It w a s      about       quarter             to    1600        pm before             I could phone my mother                            a nd

father        and    tell       them what                 had    happened.               I c o u l d n ’t f i n d            a phone          and        I

parents        know       I was            a l l r i g h t so      I managed             to     wheel         myself          off      in a

wheel        chair    until          I        found        a phone         so     that     I could            let        t h e m k n o w I wa s

           Two     BBC      journalists            came       in a n d     said     that      they were m y           a u n t y a nd

           uncle        which     also       was    a    lie.        It w a s      terrible         they kept         on    trying       to

           get     onto       the w a r d     to    interview             people      and     they were         impersonating

           Doctors,           relatives        and       social          workers      to    t ry a n d g e t     in.        In    the e n d

           they had           to c h e c k    closely          everyone who              came    in a n d w e h a d         to c h e c k

           that      people       were       who    they said             they were         before      they cam e          in.

           It w a s      most     upsetting             and    they would           not     g i v e up.        Even when          they w e r e

           kept      out      they were        shouting             in    from     the     corridor       to    tell       them what          it

           had     been       like.       It w a s       right       at    the     t im e w h e n    you wanted            to    tr y a n d

           well     without         it.

           They      even went         as     far       as    to h o v e r    a helicopter            outside         t he w i n d o w     of

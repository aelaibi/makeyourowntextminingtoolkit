I believe         that     this was        taking       place       directly        in front        of the w icket

still     pressure         from       persons       still    t rying       to leave       the      pen a nd the

o p e r a t i o n to move        bodies was b a dl y h ampered.                     I c o n t i n u a l l y had to

break     off what         I was       doing to shout           to fans        to move          b a c k w ar d s and

give      room.      Some       r em o n s t r a t e d w i t h me,    s h ou ti ng     o b sc en it ie s,       some had

to be      pushed a w a y        to    prevent       them    climbing        over      the m o u n d      of bodies.

S ev eral     were     shouting         r ec ri m i n a t i o n at    the P olice         for      causing the

Suddenly        he s t a r t e d sna tc hi n g        breaths        a n d such was        his w e ig h t        that    it

would      not be      p ossi ble       to pass        him over the           fence.       He was         carried to

I returned         to the front            fencing a nd         it was a pp a re n t            by then that a

              As far as           police a c t i o n s are               c on c er n ed    it has to be said that                    in the

              of the fans                on the terrace at that                    time      that any a t te m p t at

              o r g a n i s a t i o n was       e xt r e m e l y    difficult.             Although        c ri ti c is i ng     the

    about 2,bO$m as it came over the public address system twiee askiag people

    outside the grouad aot to push as there was ilLenty of rook inside the ground.

    van car park and shouted “Everybody inside. Pitch invasion.H I am aot aware of the

    identity of these officers and I was aot in possession of a persoaal radio so I

    had ao first haad knowledge of what was taking place inside the grouad*

                      Myself aad several other officers immediately entered the grouad

         and I saw that there appeared to be trouble ©a the Leppiags Laae terras* ia

        the centre •pea1* Qflficers oa the piteh at the froat fencing of that pea

        were tryiag to lift faas over the top of that feaciag and that there were

    considerable persons ia the area of the Leppiags Laae goal mouth* I saw that

    persoas were being crashed agaiast the froat feaciag and also along the vertical

    feaciag running along the left haad side of the pea whea viewed from the pitch*

        It thea beoame appareat that there was paaic to leave the pea but as I could see

        ao evidence of fighting I was uaable to aseertaia why thsy were tryiag t© leave*

                          appeared to be about fire persons deep aad at its worst where I was,

                      approximately a half to two third® the nay bask towards the top of the terrace.

                                   After assisting a couple of persoas of** the feasing it became . ; •

         l

         ''- apparent that there «a« no obvious cause for the crushing* Behind the five deep :

              crush there waspleatly of space aodaost people were ignoring the crashing at the

              fence and looking forward oter towards the pitch without any apparent distress

              or discomfort*         (X am unable to recall whether the game had been stopped at that

               time)*         I shouted to those persoas crashing to get over the feaoe that there

             was plenty of room behind the* aad to move backwards* Other fans outside the pen

             seemed to see the merit in this and also took mp the call to more baok* However

             most of those tryiag to scale the feaee igaired thin, one or two shouting sash

             remarks as, "Tou dont know what its like."
                               I could see that at the front feaciag the crush and panic to leave

             was much worse           was seven or eight persons deep* Officers at this time were

             sat atop the fencing assisting fans over but once again I could see behind those

         crushing that there was plenty of room if only they would move back*

                              I decided to assist from inside the fen and scaled the vertical

         fencing, climbing oger the shoulders of several fans still pressing to get out.

         I palled several fans physically backwards to alleviate the crush, again shouting

         that there was plenty of room behind them. This hat a little effect and the crushing

         eased and very shortly after entering the pea I made my way quickly and relatively

         easily down the terrace to the front fencing*             I could not understand still why there

was the panic to scale the fencing.

                          At this time I do not believe there were any other officers inside the

        pen and I repeated the operation at the front fencing shouting for persons to meve

        back and physically dragging baok a number of fans* As I did so I was confronted by

        a large mound of persons in a heap iramediaiely infront of the fencing*               top and facing

        upwards                yoi^^ agfd ;agfrijiiaat*iy If^.ycar**. I belief® with reddish hair who

        Standing in the middle of the mound with ..dead or unconscious persoas .all around her           ■

          She was conscious but apparently unable to more, 1 began dragging

 bodies bask off the sound but fond this sore difficult thafc I anticipated as

- they were enmeshed together. the first few with, the exception of the dead body

 already referred t© appeared alive bat badly injured and with the assistance of .

 faas inside the pea. were past over the fencing, to office** on top of the fens*.

              I believe that this was taking plase directly in front of the wicket

 gate which was ©pea but clogged with poBMW    bodies from the monad aad it was

 easier to pass persons over the fencing for a short time* there was still

pressure fro* persons   still tryiag to leave the pea and the operation to move

bodies was badly hampered* I continually had to break off what I was doiag t©

shout to fans to move backwards aad gire room. Some reaonstrated with me, scouting

obscenities, some had to be pushed away to prevent them climbing over the mound

of bodies. Several were shouting recrimination at the police for causing the incident

but many fans showed great presence of mind in assisting with the dead and injured*

A great many fans appeared affected by alcohol and there was an odour of beerAiqu©*

genrally on the terrace*
            One heavily built youth aged about 22 showed signs of life although

initially taken for dead* I slapped him about the face and shouted at him to

breath which I believe he was not doing at that tiae* Suddenly he started snatching

breaths aad such was his weight that it would not be possible to pass hi* over

 the fence he was m   carried to the rear of the terrase by myself and several fans,

 and out through the tunnel where he was laid down and showed signs of recovering*

             I returned to theJfrent fencing and it was apparent by then that a lot

  of fans had left the terrace, presumably through the rear tunnel.

             Superintendent Greenwood was standing at the open wicket gate in

 the fencing and with a aegaphoae was tryiag to organise a *ehaia gang* to pass

  bodies through the gate whioh had cleared considerably* fbls was abandoned

  after a w r y short' time as a number of the approximately 150 fans Utt on the

 terrase continually kept getting la. the: way either to shout recriminations at       .

 the police, get out through the gate to look for friends or just generally \
    stagger about. Although there is mo doubt many were badly shocked

    there is equally     bo   doubt that many were drank or atvtfre least affected

   • by alcohol*
              ■    Eventually the bodies and injured were removed aad I weat «*t,.

through the wicket gate. Fersoas were aimlessly try!**' to fit" bask ■          P©a

■ or leave it        .I stood guard on the gate restricting entry and exit as

necessary.
                   At one point, whilst doing so, I saw ft w r y drunken man, aged about

    25/87, thinly buildt, staggering about on the terrace near the front picking

    up and placing coins in his pocket which had obviously been dropped by the

   ■ dead anl* injured. Before I could respond two fans in the pen leapt on hi*

    and one struck him violently in the face. I entered the pen and dragged ths

    drunken youth out of the pen and onto the pitch to get him out of the way .

   There was still approxiaaely 100 persons on the terrase and the public order

 situation could once again have detiriorated .Accordingly and with regret I

  was unable to arrest the drunken youth and stayed guarding the gate. About this

 this fighting broke out at the front of the balcony above the terrace and I

 saw a number of officers despatched from the pitch to deal with this.
             Followoag the incident with the man pocketing coins            remaining on the

  terrace became aggitated by the personal possessioosof the dead and injured

  left on the terrace.        I organised a number of the fans in to collecting up the

   possessions, consisting of handbags, coats, glasses and watches and a very

  large number of shoes. These they past to ae through tie gate where they were

  piled. Via a passing sergeant with a radio I requested that a number of bags

  be sent for. These eventually arrived and the possessions were bagged and taken

by myself and several other officers to the Incident Control la the gya*                   /
                  I did not return to ths pen or the pitch as by then the ground was

well on the way to being emptied*        ''
               Xn any life and death situation such as this recollections

  nill become distorted. This account is accurate to the best of my belief

   but it has to be said that whilst some areas are crystal clear and have a

  lasting impact, other areas are hasy. I am unable to give any accurate

   idea of tine scale for these events.

                X am fairly certain that I was the first to the front fencing

   on the inside of the pen having made ay way at least half of the distance

   down the terrace. I know I was able to do so without too much difficulty

    aad will remiin convinced that many of the fatalities and injuries could

   have been avoided if persons in the ^crushes* had simply moved backwards,

   although X appreciate the   blind panic to leave precluded this.

              As far as police actions are concerned it has to be said that in

 the early stages it was necessary for individual officers to do what they

thought best in the rescue operation. Persons were liberally dieing before there

eyes, and I speak personally of my own experience. Seconds counted and there

waant time to stand around awaiting instructions.     My first recollection of a

senior officer being present was , as already described, Superintendent

Greenwood organising a chain for the removal of bodies but such was the

actions of the fans on the terrace at that time that any attempt at organisation

was extremely difficult.   Although crticising the actions of many fans for

their conduct I also praise the many who were of great assistance in the rescue

operation and undoubtedly saved lives by their readiness to act both on their

own initiative and the instructions of myself and other officers*

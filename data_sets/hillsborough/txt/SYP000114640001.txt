d / fficult     simply       because        of the        number        of    people    in the area.              The

        On    reaching       the    playing area                I saw that           other officers             and mefnbe.r.s' of

        get    oufl but as we were                  doing       so   I became         aware       that    there was a large

        about    20 years          old.        On arrival            at   the    gym we          left    the    body with an

Ronald Cooper,Police Constable ^51» C .1. Sub-division,Rotherham.


On Saturday 15th April 1989 at 8.30am I paraded At Main Street Police Office
in relation to duties at the F.A.Cup semi-final at Hillsborough.

I was attached to Serial 37,P»S.Kennedy,C.2. sub-division was in charge. We were
working together with Serial 36 with P.S.France,C1.sub-division and both
serails were commanded by Inspector Ellis,C.1.sub-division. We were conveyed
by coach to the ground where we attended the briefing after which we went
to Wadsley Bridge Railway Station arriving at about 11.15am.0ur duties were
to retndin at the station until the arrival of a special train which was expected
at about 2.Opm.

At approximately I.^Opm,( I did not make a note of the exact times) I heard a
message over my personal radio to the effect that assistance was required at
Gateways Supermarket which is situated about 200 yards from the station and
further up on Halifax Road.With several other Officers I attended at that location
and at the same time received a further message that further assistance was not
required. I remember that there were several hundred Liverpool supporters in the
area of Gateways,they were forming queues to the store and also at a nearby kiosk.
It was apparent that they were queueing in order to purchase alcohol, large numbers
of the fans were on the grass verge at the junction with Halifax Rd and they were
consuming cans of beer and several of them were drinking from wine bottles.lt
appeared that a large amount of alcohol had been drunk and had been done so
for some considerable time. From the time of our arrival at Wadsley Bridge, large
numbers of supporters were seen en route to the ground drinking beer from cans as
they went.

When it was known that assistance was not required we returned to our original
location at the station and remained there until the special train arrived at
about 2.0pm. There k e k was in the region of §00 fans on the train,I did not see
any evidence of them having consumed alcohol^xhey were not in possession of any
and they were very well behaved. As they left the station the first few were
stopped near to the Railway Public House but they were only stopped for a very
short period of time until all the passengers had left the train and we were able
to escort them all as a group to the ground. On the subject of the Railway Pub,
the front doors were closed and only selected customers,obviously regulars,were
being allowed access via the back door.

When all the fans from the train were together we walked with them to Hillsboro*
they were extremely quiet,no chanting from them and there were no incidents worthy
of note on the way to the ground involving this particular group.

On arrival at the ground they went straight to the Leppings Lane turnstiles to gain
entry to the ground. We remained in the Leppings Lane area standing on the footpath
on the opposite side of the road to the ground. I was standing with P.C.1679 Oxley
at the time and on several occasions we were asked by Liverpool fans if we knew
where they could obtain tickets.lt was apparent that many fans had travelled to the
ground without tickets but I am unable to put any figure or even estimate how many
had.

At about 2.45pm there was what seemed to be a surge in the numbers of fans arriving,
until the frontage of the ground in the turnstile area was filled with people
trying to gain admission. It was apparent that a large number of these fans had
consumed a large amount of alcohol and were still doing so. We were engaged in
trying to keep some sort of order within the crowd but it was becoming increasingly
difficult simply because of the number of people in the area# The fans were
becoming more and more anxious to gain admission as kick off time approached. I
definitely recall a request being made,By Supt. Marshall I believe, for the kick
off to be delayed until 3 »15pm and we began telling as many people as possible
that that request had been made.
                                                                           to if

It was shortly after this that Iheard a request over the radio for the   main
gates to be opened in order to avoid a tragedy outside the ground.This   request
was made several times and I plainly heard it. Whilst standing outside   the
ground I also saw fans climbing onto the wall above the turnstiles and   gaining
access to the ground.

The mood of the fans at the time seemed to me to be mainly that they were
anxious not to miss the kick off and were prepared to go to any lengths to gain
admission. I could not see any of the cluh stewards due to the number of
people present and I am not in a position therefore to comment on their actions.
I do not recall any beakdown in radio transmissions up to that time and I do
not think that there was one during the following described events. It is possible
that there could have been one later but due to the incidents I was not able to
accurately follow the transmissions.

          Whilst we were on the Leppings Lane area It became apparent that the
game had started and the kick off had not been delayed, this made the fans outside
even more anxious to get in* The next thing I recall was a a request for ail
available personnel to enter the ground and attend in the area of the Leppings
Lane stand.

P.C.Oxley and myself were eventually able to do this after getting through
the crowd outside and climbing over a turnstile, (approx.3»10pm)

On reaching the playing area I saw that other Officers and members of the
crowd were on the |dbc pitch. We went straight to the fencing at the front of
the terracing and I saw other Officers attempting to pull the fencing down.
We went to their assistance but it quickly became apparent that we were wasting
our time pulling the fence down and so We climbed onto the fencing itself.

I saw that the crowd was pushed against the fencing,It was obvious that persons
were badly injured,they were on the floor behind the fencing and I then realised
that there were dead people there also. Together with other Officers we began
to pull as many people as possible over the top of the perimeter fencing.They
were either climbing over the bodies to get over the fence or were being passed
up to us by other fans. I do not remember how many we were able to get out
but as we were doing so I became ik aware that there was a large number of
dead people lying behind the fencing adbcfck* in the area of the gate in the
fencing at the rear of the gaol. People were also being passed from the back
of the crowd and into the North Stand. When we had got as many people as we
could out of the ground, and the crowd situation had eased somewhat, we went onto
the playing area and using a makeshift stretcher, we removed one body from the
pitch to the gymnasium. The only description I can give of him was that he
was about 20 years old.On arrival at the gym we left the body with an Officer
who had assisted to remove him from the pitch, I do not know that Officer's
identity.

We then returned to the area in front of the North Stand and gave what at
first aid was possible to the injured persons. At one stage P.G.Oxley and
myself went onto the terracing to give further assistance to Officers already
there.As we did so we had some sort ofliquid thrown over us and I sensed that
the mood of the fans left there was ofanger directed at us.

We remained in the ground until there was nothing else for us to do in the
way of giving assistance.We were then directed by Chief Superintendent Nesbit
to try and encourage what fans were left to leave the stadium which we did.
We then made our way back to Wadsley Bridge Station,as per the match ebaacfc detail
order,on arrival we met other members of our serial.We then returned to
Claywheels Lane where we were stood down to return to our Division arriving
there at about 7•Opm.

             had        been    taken          from    them.           Their          general          mood    and       behaviour            was

 *          access        to       their       particular             area          of    the       ground,             it    was       difficult             for

             them    to    know          which       area       they          had    tickets             for,       due       to    the       poor

             indications                shown       at    the    ground.                 Several          of       the       fans       were       in    fact

            admitted           through          the       wrong          turnstiles             pure          and       simply          to    try       and

             release       the          pressure          outside             the    ground.              I    had       been       engaged             in    the

            area     in    the          central          turnstiles                but    had       to    move          across          to    the       side       to

            avoid        being          crushed          against          the       turnstile             wall.              We    tried       to

             encourage             the       supporters          to      move        back       and       form          some       sort       of    orderly

             queue       but       because          of    the    sheer             numbers          involved             this       was       not       possible.

             The    situation                stayed       the    same          until       3.00pm             (1500)          by    which          time       the

             majority          of       the    fans       were       inside          the       ground          and       shortly             after       the

             kick    off       everyone             had    gained             admittance.                 We       went       into       the       ground          and

             took    a    position             at    the       very       rear       of    the       South          Stand          until       we       attended

             at    the    gymnasium             for       meal.           We       had    only       been          at    that       location             for       a

             short       time       before          we    were       called          out       to    a    reported                large       fight          on    the

             Hop.        This       did       not    prove       to       be       the    case       and       our       presence             was       not

             required.              After       meal       was       completed,                prior          to    the       end       of    the       game,          we

             took    up    positions                on    Leppings             Lane       to    await          the       dispersal             of       the

             crowd.        We       were       then       engaged             in    escorting             the       supporters                to    the       coach

             park    and       Wadsley          Bridge          Railway             Station          until          we       were       stood       down          and

             returned          to       Cl    arriving          there          at    6.30pm          (1830).

             Although          I    have       stated          that       a    large       number             of    the       supporters                had       been

             drinking          heavily,             I do       not       recall          any    widespread                   incidents             of

             disorderly             behaviour             or    undue          rowdyism.

             Due    to    the       nature          of    our    duties             at    the       game,          mainly          outside          the

             ground       on       the       turnstiles,             I    have       no    information                   and       cannot          comment             on

             the    situation                which       existed          in       either       Pens          3,    4    or       the    tunnels.                 I am

             not    aware          of    any    of       the    gates          being       opened             either          by    Police          or

 Main Street,Main Street,Rotherham.


On Saturday 9th April 1988 , together with othe® members of *E', I was engaged on
duties connected with the F.A.Cup semi-Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest
at Hillsboro1 football ground Sheffield.I paraded at Main Street Police Office
at 8 .30am and we were transported to the ground by coach ready for briefing at
10.0am. Other members of my serial included P.C.*s Yeomans,Kettleborough,Reynolds,
Slater,Oxley.P.S.2171 was in charge of our serial.

Following the briefing our duties were to remain at the turnstiles at the Leppings Lae
end of the ground until kick off and to search the fans for alcohol etc.We did
this and as the number of supporters grew, we gathered a large quantity of cans of beerpfikaf
and lager which had been taken from them.Their general mood and behaviour was generally
good but,as kick off time approached, it soon became apparent that a lot of the fans
had been drinking heavilly.

As the kick off time approached,by about 2»30pm, there was a large number of
supporters in the Leppings Lane area and we were gradually pused back against the
wall at the turnstiles. There was a lot of confusion amongst the fans as to which
turnstiles gave access to their particular area of the ground, it was difficult
for them to know which area they had tickets for,due to the poor indications
shownat the ground.Several of the fans were in fact admitted through the wrong
turnstiles pure and simply to try and release the pressure outside the ground.
I had been engaged in the area in the centralturnstiles but had to move across to
the side to avoid being crushed against the turnstile wail. We tried to encourage the
supporters to move back and form some sort of orderly queue but because of the
sheer numbers involved this was not possible.

The situation stayed the same until 3 .Opm by which time the majority of the fans
were inside the ground and shortly after the kick off everyone had gained
admittance. We went into the ground and took a position at the very rear of
the South Stand until we attended at the gymnasium for meal.We had only been at
that location for a short time before we were called out to a reported large fight
on the Kop.This did not prove to be the case and our presence was not requires.
After meal was completed,prior to the end of the game,we took up positions on
Leppings Lane to await the dispersal of the crowd. We were then engaged in escorting
the supporters to the coach park and Wadsley Bridge railway station until we were
stood down and returned to C.1. arriving there at 6.30pm

Although I have stated that a large number of the supportershad been drinking
heavily,I do not recall any widespread incidents of disorderly behaviour or
undue rowdyism.
Due to the nature of our duties at the game,mainly outside the ground on the
turnstiles,I have no information and cannot comment on the situation which existed
in either Pens 3»^ or the tunnels.I am not aware of any of the gates being opened
either by Police or stewards.

Further to my previous statement made regarding the F.A. Cup Semi Final at
Hillsborough Football Ground in 1988, I would like to add the following comments;

I am not able to say if the ingress of mounted officers eased the problem or not,
I am able to say that these officers did manage to place themselves between the
supporters and the turnstyles thereby creating a gap which obviously did ease the problem
to some degree.
I would estimate that the crush had eased slightly after 2.45pm that day and the
situation was in no way as serious as that created during the 1989
Semi Final at the same location.

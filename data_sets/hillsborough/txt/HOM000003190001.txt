                 I am




                 Until July 1988 I was a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police

                 stationed at Wombwcll, of Barnsley Division.



                 On Saturday 9 April 1 9 8 8 , 1 was detailed to supervise a serial of constables

                 performing duty at Hillsborough Football Stadium.                                           The two football teams

                 taking part were Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.



                 The serial was delegated duty at the rear of the West Stand and in particular

                 to control fane entering pens 3 and                                    , that is the centre pens of the stand.



                 During the game and because of the amount of fans within pens 3 and 4, I

                 receive              struction to close the gates to the entrance and thereafter direct

              fans to the two outer pens of the stand.                  I carinoL recall where the

              instruction came from.          Under normal circumstanccs instruction came from a

              Serial Inspector or via radio from control.                       I cannot say from which the

              instruction came.



              Bearing in mind the time lapse and having attended several matches at

              Hillsborough, it is difficult to relate detail regarding this particular

              match.

                I am the owner             of    premises, trad i n g as

               T h e y were      rowdy but         not    in a n a g g r e s s i v e    manner.        It became   obvious,

              During       the    time    that        the yo u t h s       were       in or about my shop two of them

              had their



              Wh i l s t   the two wer e            ha v i n g     their                      I was having a general

              I said to them             "fancy            coming all          this    wa y without          tickets".       They

              saiS      " D o n ’t w o r r y a b o u t      us we'll           get    in".    The yo u t h s      did not say how

              they were g o i n g         to get            into    the m a t c h and I did not ask them.

              close my          p r e mises at        1 frm and go home.




              All      I can say a bout             the y o u t h s    in r e l a t i o n to their              description     is

              that      they w e r e     all      white,         in their        e a r l y 20s and spojce wit h a

              tickets         for the m a t c h        I never        saw them.

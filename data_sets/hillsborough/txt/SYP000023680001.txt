"Don't t r y to change peo ple:               change t h e s i t u a t i o n . "     In i t , he c i t e s the example

ia at Los                      belief that greater improvements in performance and behaviour are likely to attend efforts to change

 M c d ical                    crim e seem more effective than attem pts to reform delinquents. Moreover, given that most
                               delinquents desist from crim e in early adulthood, minimal interference in their lives may be the best
Sahimore                       policy. For those requiring institutional placement, humane care rather than reform should be the goal.

   As a preliminary, a b rief defense o f the reconviction criterion is needed against
the criticisms made o f it as a m easure o f treatm ent effectiveness [cf. Brody (1976)
for a fuller discussion]. First, as shown by Scott (1964), reconvictions are quite
strongly correlated with other measures o f post-treatment adjustment such as holding
down a job and establishing a steady relationship. Second, while reconviction may
be an incomplete and even biased m easure o f offending in that it is influenced by
the actions o f the authorities, other m easures o f offending (including self-reports o f
delinquency) are unsatisfactory in their own ways and m ay also be more expensive
to collect (cf. H ood & Sparks, 1970). Thirdly, though reconviction data are usually
collected only for comparatively shorter periods o f 1-3 years, longer follow-ups which
have occasionally been undertaken reveal substantially the sam e picture as shorter
ones (H am m ond, 1968).


                                        P R E D IC T IO N STU D IES

   T he H om e Office prediction studies had a num ber o f objectives: (i) to identify
high risk groups with the intention o f aiding decisions about the treatment or manage­
ment o f offender’s; (ii) to gain som e understanding o f the causes o f delinquency by
studying variables associated with reconviction; and (iii) to identify the more
potentially effective treatments by comparing risk o f reconviction scores with eventual
outcome.                                                                     .        .
   T he best known exam ple o f this phase o f research was the M annheim -W ilkins
borstal prediction study (M ann h eim & W ilkins, 1955).* T his successfully identified
a number o f variables such as previous work record and prior criminality as predictive
o f reconviction. It also satisfactorily divided borstal lads into high- and low-risk
groups, and produced som e evidence that borstals run on open lines (that is to say,
without locked doors or perim eter security) were slightly, though significantly,
more successful than ‘closed ’ ones. T his seem ed to be the case even when the fact
that better risks tended to be allocated to open conditions had been taken into
account, though critics (C ockett, 1967; M orrison, 1955) suggested that decisions
about allocation might have been influenced b y ‘intangible risk factors which, if
properly allowed for in the com parisons, w ould have rem oved even the apparent
residua] superiority o f open borstals.
    This criticism o f inadequate standardisation o f risks was to bedevil all the treat­
ment evaluations using predictive matching, including H am m ond’s (1964) well-known
study in The Sentence of the Court, a guide for m agistrates issued by the H om e Office.
 Ham m ond found some evidence that for ju ven ile first offenders fines seem ed to be

 the m ost effective disposal, approved schools the least, with probation som ewhere in
 betw een. But in his com parison, risks were standardised on a m uch narrower range
 o f variables than was done even for the M annheim -W ilkins study, and while it m ay
 be that more lenient sentences such as fines are indeed more effective, it is more
likely that the better risks are given the lighter penalties.
     T he criticism that prediction m ethods did not allow for proper com parison o f
intakes, together with what at best were small treatm ent effects, m ade it even more
im portant to ensure that differences in intake were properly controlled in future
treatm ent evaluations. For this reason— despite the ethical objections— the case for                             i

                     com pany o f others with a history o f absconding (and therefore presum ably exposed
                     to exam ple and persuasion) were them selves more likely to run away (see T able 4).
                        T he study also uncovered som e evidence o f learning to abscond in that, for
                     persistent absconders, intervals between abscondings follow a typical learning curve.
                     This raised the question o f whether this learning might generalise to other delinquent
                     behaviours either because absconding might be seen by both boys and staff as a
                     delinquent act or, more sim ply, because an absconder is more likely to com mit
                     offences while on the run (for exam ple, by breaking into a house to get food or
                     m oney).
                        T w o further cross-institutional studies were undertaken to exam ine the possibility
                     that high absconding rates or, more generally, high rates o f m isbehaviour might
                     result in worse reconviction rates. T he first used statistical records o f absconding
                     and reconviction for 66 approved schools (Sinclair & Clarke, 1973) and found that,
                     taking account o f intake, schools with disproportionately high absconding rates did
                     in fact have worse reconviction rates. H ow ever, the relationship was not strong in
                     that it accounted for only about 10% o f the variance in reconviction rates.
                         Sim ilar results were obtained in A nne D u n lop ’s (1974) more detailed study o f
                     eight approved schools catering for boys aged 13—15 on adm ission. She interviewed
                     some 400 boys in the schools during the m id-1960s about their experience o f training
 of the year or      and followed them up for five years after release. It was found that schools which
iding (this did       appeared to lay emphasis on trade-training and on mature and responsible behaviour
                     had lower rates o f both absconding and other forms o f m isbehaviour during training

   T aken together, the findings o f the three phases o f treatment research provided       extent c
a dam aging critique o f the m edico-psychological model o f causation which for so         other be

o f pre-treatm ent factors for any group o f offenders. T he most im portant factors        will onl;
relate to age and history o f offending. According to the treatment experiments, there      over tiro
was little if anything to choose between the long-term effectiveness o f different          acts o f d
forms o f treatment. The cross-institutional studies succeeded in identifying some longer   and mai
term effects o f treatm ent, but these were very small and appeared to be related to        however
m isbehaviour in the institution. M oreover, the levels o f this m isbehaviour vary         behavio
greatly between institutions and are strongly associated with aspects o f institutional        T hou

    In the light o f these findings it was d ear that the m edico-psychological m odel      psychol*
provided at once too static and too simple a view o f offending— and in particular          nature
one that expected too much from treatment. A n alternative was needed that played           persist e;
down the role o f individual dispositions and which also accom m odated som e small         not per:

the current environm ent. Such a theory w ould discourage unrealistic expectations          release,
o f treatm ent.
    M eanw hile the m edico-psychological model was com ing under attack from other
quarters. Its failure, and indeed that o f H om e Office research, to take proper
account o f sociological factors had been criticised for a num ber o f years (cf. W iles,
 1976). N ow , however, not only the medico-psychological model, but also mainstream
sociological theories were being criticised for their ‘positivism ’ by deviancy theorists   lines
such as T aylor, W alton and Y oung (1973). In particular, positivist theories were         Cornish
alleged to take insufficient account o f the problematic nature o f definitions o f         deterren
delinquency and also o f the stigm atising effects o f certain aspects o f the criminal     senteno
justice process and, hence, its possible role in exacerbating criminal conduct.             out o f b

F the majority         Broadly speaking, crime prevention measures can be divided into two groups:
                    (i) m easures com ing under the heading o f ‘social prevention’, which are intended to

lish & Clarke,      Q . W ilson (1975) has argued, it is difficult to see what can be done about m any o f
 importance o f     the psychological and social factors implicated in crime. For exam ple, how can

     As far as sm aller scale local m easures are concerned, it is not always clear, as in    school
  the case o f youth em ploym ent schem es or youth clubs, whether these are intended to     and t t
  m odify underlying attitudes or sim ply to keep potential offenders more usefully          W inch
  occupied. In general, these m easures seem to attach too much weight to the longer          1979),
  term benefits o f changed attitudes and expectations. In other words, social prevention    public
  appears to operate on principles uncomfortably close to the medico-psychological           that th :
  m odel. As discussed above, how ever, according to environm ental/learning theory          enviror:
  crime m ay be less a matter o f underlying dispositions than o f more imm ediate           flat far?,
  environm ental pressures. Even when young people are kept occupied for part o f the        control

       Dear Mr. Swingler,

       Re; Your refs AA17193

       Hie Sun's Ombudsman has investigated complaints from
       readers regarding our report headlined "The Truth" on
       April 19, 1989.

       I am enclosing a copy of his adjudication which was
       published across six columns at the top of Page 2
       in today's newspaper (May 9).

       I would be grateful if you would add this report to
       our previous submissions on the Hillsborough tragedy.

       Yours sincerely,




      winiam iNewman,

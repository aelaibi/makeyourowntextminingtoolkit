D e a r Mr.   Kelly

                                 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

T h a n k you for your letter of 19th December,                1997 r e s p o n d i n g to my
e a r l i e r letter concerning the above matter.

I note and u n d e r s t a n d you r concern that you should not commit the
support of the F.A. to the H i l l s b o r o u g h families campa i g n for
j u s t i c e without m ore d e t ailed knowledge of the nature of the
c a m p a i g n and indeed of the evidence w hich has emer g e d as a result
of r e s e a r c h under t a k e n for the "Hillsborough" TV Programme made by
G r a n a d a TV. Therefore although as you w o u l d appreciate I am not
ab l e to prov i d e you w ith every document which will form the basis
for the d e t a i l e d legal submissions w hich are to be made, I do
e n c l o s e some papers w h i c h will give you further basic i nformation
a bout the issues arising from the television pro g r a m m e including
the nature of the fresh evidence w h i c h has emerged.

It w o u l d be hoped that the e n c losed information m a y enable the
F.A.. to join the grow i n g number of organisations and individuals
w h o have alre a d y e x pressed their unequivocal support for the
c a m p a i g n of the b e r e a v e d families. As you can see from the
a t t a c h e d document, Liverpool City Council at an e x t r a o r d i n a r y
m e e t i n g h eld on 19th December, 1996 p a s s e d a r e s o l u t i o n p r o v i d i n g
its full and unanimous support to the families in their camp a i g n
a n d it is m y u n d e r s t a n d i n g that the terms of that r e s o l u t i o n are
in the process of being adopted b y every other Council on
Merseyside.
Other elements of support have included Liverpool Football Club
who, I u n d e r s t a n d from the S e c retary of the H i l l s b o r o u g h Family
Support Group, Phil Hammond, have also agreed to provide wha tever
as sistance they can to aid the campaign. M a n y Members of
Parliament, from across the political spectrum, have a l r e a d y
p r o m i s e d their b a c k i n g to the families as have various supporters
o r g a nisations and fanzines. Howe v e r perhaps most importantly, m a n y
individuals from all over the country have shown, either through
direct letters and telephone calls to HFS G or the City Council or
through r esponding in their thousands to the p e t ition org a n i s e d by
the "Daily Mirror" for the re-opening of the Inquests, their
disgust w i t h the previous treatment of the families b y the legal
system and their strong desire for the actual truth of what did
ha p p e n that day to be p l a c e d finally on public record.

In short the public reaction to the transmission of the Programme
has b e e n little short of phenomenal. The programme as well as
demolishing, in the public consciousness, the m yth that Liverpool
supporters caused the tragedy, has also awoken the conscience of
the n a t i o n about the appalling aftermath of the Disaster. I have
p e r s o n a l l y recei v e d calls from people in places such as Barnsley
and Watford, who have no connection to Liverpool and in some cases
who do not even have a parti c u l a r interest in football, wh o are
e x t r e m e l y a n g r y about the w a y the families have been t r e a t e d and
wh o are offering their services to help to rectify the injustice
in a n y w a y they can.

As you will p r o b a b l y be aware the Families have alre a d y met with
the Home Sec r e t a r y to express their concerns and are pre s e n t l y
a w a i t i n g a de c i s i o n ' b y him on w h e t h e r there should be a fresh
Inquiry into the n e w and unused evidence w h i c h has come to l i g h t .
H o w e v e r you should be aware that the families, who are b e i n g
a d v i s e d by a leading London QC, are also in the process separately
of i nstigating the following actions in order to take forward
t h e i r campaign

i) an ap p l i c a t i o n to the A t t o r n e y General under Section 13 of the
Coroners Act asking the High Court to review the Inquest verdict;
an d

ii) a complaint to the Director of Public Prosecutions seeking a
cr i minal investigation into possible misconduct in the w a y
e v i d e n c e was or was not p r e s e n t e d to the Inquest jury. This action
is b a s e d on the evidence of the v ideo technician Roger
Houldsworth, who was not called as a witness to the Taylor Inquiry
o r the Inquest and whose existence was not known to the families
u n t i l the TV programme was made. The n e w evidence d i r e c t l y
c o n t r a d i c t s what some South Yorkshire Police Officers told the
jury. Details of the evidence are to be found in the enclosed
document, issued at the time of the programme as a press release
b y Gran a d a Television.
I w o u l d hope that this r e asonably detailed response to y o u r               letter
will enable the Football A s s o c i a t i o n to re v i e w its p o s i t i o n   and,
as the b o d y at the pinnacle of English football, add its
e ndorsement to the growing campaign to rect i f y an injustice                    which
not onl y continues to scar the public image of the football                       world
but also to cast a dark shadow across the r eputation of the                       entire
Brit i s h judicial system.


Yours    s i ncerely

   HILLSBOROUGH: COST OF INVESTIGATIONS BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

   Thank you for your letter of 8 June about the power to meet the
   costs of the investigations by West Midlands police into the
   Hillsborough disaster.

   We agree that the assistance being given by your force to South
   Yorkshire police is probably not mutual aid under Section 14 of the
   Police Act 1964 and that this assistance is not covered by the
   Police Act.   However, in the absence of any statutory provision,
   liability for the costs of the police investigations seems to us to
   rest with the body who instigated those investigations.
   On this basis we have suggested that the South Yorkshire Police
   Authority should reimburse the additional costs incurred by your
   authority in investigating the Hillsborough tragedy.       In other
   types of investigations by one force on behalf of another, costs
   are met by the force which requested assistance initially.

   I accept that one difficulty facing us at present is the reluctance
   of the South Yorkshire Police Authority to accept liability.      I
   hope, however, that we can find a solution to this when Lord
   Ferrers meets a delegation from the South Yorkshire Police
Authority on 20 June.    We will write to you again as soon as
possible after that.

We are very anxious for the question of costs to be settled as soon
as possible.   I agree with you that recourse to the courts should
be avoided : it would clearly be better to sort the matter out in
the further discussions to which I have referred.

Hillsborough Independent Panel - Witness statement from Paul Robinson


To: The Hillsborough Independent Panel

Date: 15 February 2011


I am an HSE employee and have been employed by HSE since 1987. My witness statement
is in direct response to a global email message that was issued to all HSE staff on 30th
Septem ber 2009. Specifically, my response is in relation to para 3 of this message that is set
out below:

"Over the last few years, HSE has taken the initiative and published a large amount of
information on Hillsborough on its website
(http://www.hse.gov.uk/foi/releases/hillsborough.htm). We will pass this material to the Panel
and are searching corporate records for any other information that may be of interest to them.
However, given the passage of time and the organisational changes since this tragic incident,
it is important that we assure ourselves that we have identified all of the information held by
HSE. If you hold or are aware of any information relating to Hillsborough that is not currently
in the public domain or in a corporate record store, could you please send details of it to
                 jn the Information Management Unit (mailto.                  Qhse.gsi.gov.uk-
tel. 523      ) by 14 October 2009."


Backqround summary

 1. At the time of the disaster, I worked within H S E ’s Statistical Services Unit (SSU ) as an
Administrative Officer. One of the main tasks that my team and I were responsible for was to
compile HSE's Official Injury Statistics that were published each year within Health & Safety
Commission's annual report. These figures included reports of all fatalities to employees,
self-employed and members of the public who were killed through work activity.

2. My team and I were responsible for compiling HSE's injury statistics for inclusion within the
1989/90 Health & Safety Commission Annual Report around the autumn of 1990. Whilst we
were putting together the figures for this report, I noticed that the ninety five Hillsborough
fatalities were excluded from the fatality reports we used to compile these statistics. I queried
this matter with my line manager i                 as I thought this was odd in that the fifty six
fatalities to members of the public following a previous football disaster (the Bradford fire
disaster in 1985) had always been referenced in previous statistical reports that our section
had compiled. As I had lost my younger brother Steven at Hillsborough, I did have a personal
interest in this matter.

3. Having looked in to this]                 pdvised me that there was a lack of clarity across
HSE as to whether these fatalities should be reported under the injury reporting regulations.
He advised that he had found some correspondence on one of our files that showed that
the HSE Board had sought advice from Dr Jim McQuaid (HSE's Chief Scientist) on the
reportability issue. Dr McQuaid's considered advice (that I saw sight of in a written memo)
was that the fatalities and major injuries to the public that resulted from this tragedy should
not be included within H S E ’s official figures as 'the root cause of the disaster was drunken
hooliganism’.

4. I was distressed by this memo as I felt that this was inaccurate and not based on fact. To
me this was merely an opinion that was prevalent at the time and this flawed advice should
never have been provided to the HSE board. I was particularly angry and upset given the
fact that the root cause of the disaster that was cited in the Interim Hillsborough Stadium
Disaster Report (Led by Lord Justice Taylor) that was published back in August 1989 was
'failure of police control' and not 'drunken hooliganism'. This was also the conclusion of the
final report by Lord Justice Taylor that was published in Jan 1990. W hy Dr McQuaid failed to
consider the official version of causation before providing his professional advice to our board
was, and remains, beyond my comprehension.

5. I raised my concerns to my head of unit (f                    at the time and the decision
not to include these fatality figures in the Annual Keports was challenged and eventually
overturned and the fatalities and major injuries were included within the 1989/90 HSC/E
Annual Report and all subsequent statistical reports (suitably footnoted).

Why do I feel this information is relevant to the panel?

1. The fact that this view of the root cause of the disaster in 1990 was held within my own
organisation for a time after the independent inquiry leaves me to believe that the negative
media coverage was such that it could and did influence opinion to such an extent that
the facts became irrelevant. O ver twenty years later, there is still widespread opinion that the
root cause of disaster was caused by the behaviour of the fans and not with the police who
were accountable for the safety of supporters during this event.


2. As part of the request for relevant documentation held by HSE, I requested a search for
this memo from Dr McQuaid to the HSE Board. Although a thorough search for this memo
was undertaken (and I fully trust that this was the case) this particular document was not
found. Given the fact that HSE did provide a lot of technical evidence that was held and
retained on file in relation to Hillsborough I was very surprised that this particular document
was not kept and can only conclude that it was either destroyed in error, or deliberately
removed after the decision to include these figures was overturned to safeguard any
embarrassment to HSE. This is the reason why I have written this witness statement.

3. I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not wanting to try and embarrass HSE on this
issue, and that my intentions are entirely honourable and fully in line with what HSE has been
asked to identify and provide to this Independent Panel. This statement is accurate and true
to the best of my knowledge. I am writing this as a member of HSE staff and as a bereaved
brother and this statement is not on behalf of either the Hillsborough Families Support Group
(which my family belong to - but not in an active capacity) or the Hillsborough Justice
Campaign Group.

I am happy to provide additional information or clarification directly to the panel in relation to
this matter.

HILLSBOROUGH : REPORTING OF ACCIDENTS UNDER RIDDOR


1.    The meeting of 17 August decided that both numbers of fatal
and major injuries arising from the disaster at Hillsborough
should be included in the 1989/90 provisional injury figures that
will be quoted in the Annual Report to be published in December.

2.       The number of fatalities that occurred isknown to be 95
and     this is the figure that will be included in the 1989/90
statistics.

3.      The situation is less straightforward for major  injuries.
In an attempt to establish the number of injuries I have
contacted RLSD, the Home Office and the West Midlands Police and
in each    case I have been referred to the interim Taylor Report
which quoted a total of 766 people injured at the ground. The
West Midlands Police suggested that I contact a solicitor acting
for the Hillsborough Steering Committee who advise families whose
relatives   were killed or injured in the tragedy. I have not
pursued    this line as I felt it might  be unwise to go outside
public bodies or published sources.

4.    In the absence of any other figures the figure of 766
injuries   has been included in the    provisional major injury
figures for 1989/90. Clearly some of these injuries will not be
major injuries as defined under RIDDOR but it is also possible
that people who were injured are not included in the figure of
766.

5.    The inclusion of the 766 injuries has not      affected   the
trend in major injuries to members of the public     although   the
decline in numbers is now less marked.

     HILLSBOROUGH : REPORTING OF ACCIDENTS UNDER RIDDOR

     We discussed this morning with Mr Ecclestone, Mr Whomsley, and
     Dr Derrick the line to be taken on the Hillsborough accident
     statistics in the Annual Report about which there have been
     recent exchanges of minutes.

    2. We had a word about accidents to non employees which seemed
    to fall to be reported under RIDDOR. We had no general
    difficulty with the definition in 2(2)(c) of RIDDOR which
    referred to reportable accidents arising out of or in connection
    with work as including those attributable to the manner of
    conducting or undertaking, the plant or substances or the
    condition of the premises used.  This would exclude children
    falling over themselves in the playground or natural disasters
    such as earthquakes. A good test was whether the management
    through the provision of hardware, supervision and systems,
    could (rather than should) have removed the cause.

     3. In the Hillsborough case the original advice not to report
    the accident was taken (Mr Ecclestone's minute of 16 July) on
    the ground that accident arose from crowd behaviour and control,
    and the first indications were that it was associated with
    drunkenness and disorder.   However the Taylor Report shed a
    different light on the accident: it seemed to stem not from the
    crowd's behaviour but from the failure of systems and management
    of crowd control. The respective responsibilities of the club
    and the police are not easy to determine, but despite the
    important and perhaps decisive role of the latter we agreed that
    in the light of the evidence now available the accident would
    have been reportable.  It was hard to see it did not arise in
    connection with work.  The manner of conducting the undertaking
    had relevance. We also had in mind that to exclude the accident
    on the grounds that the police rather than the club seem to have
    taken the major decisions would make the statistical series of
    accident to non employees in this sector - or more generally -
    difficult to follow or explain.

    4.   We also considered the treatment of the statistics in the
    Annual Report. We agreed that as the proposed headings to the
    tables did not say that all the statistics came from RIDDOR, all
    that was needed was a footnote to Table 1 to say that it
    included the fatalities and injuries to members of the public in
    the Hillsborough stadium disaster, 15 April 1989. The numbers
    would be in the text.   The table should however include not only
    the 95 fatalities, but also the major injuries.   If the Taylor
    report contained such a figure that should be used; otherwise we
    should use the total quoted in the press at the time. We
    recognised that this would not exactly correspond to the 24
    lours in hospital test of RIDDOR, but we decided that this was
    the better course as:
7
                                                                                     Reference




                    (a) it was inconsistent to include fatalities and not
                    injuries and to insert no figure for injuries was
                    misleading;

                    (b) there was little hope we could get a more reliable
                    figure at this date;

                    (c) imprecisions in the large total of injuries mattered
                    less and it had not been customary to produce breakdowns of
                    injuries to non employees by cause or seat;

                    (d) nevertheless it would be helpful if when ESB had
                    decided firmly on the figure the club were told that we did
                    propose to include figures in the Annual Report, as they
                    had been told originally not to report them.

               5. We thought that though the discussion had been useful more
               guidance on reporting of S.3 accidents was not necessary at this
               stage. Mr Whomsley would however bring the points to the
               attention of FOD management; Dr Derrick would consider whether
               for the future we did not need to bring out that exemption from
               RIDDOR did not necessarily apply to the same sectors as
               agreements to leave enforcement to another authority under a
               statute other than HSWA, so that the obligation to report could
               apply even where S .3 was not actively enforced by HSE or the
               local authorities.

    HILLSBOROUGH : REPORTING OF ACCIDENTS UNDER RIDDOR




    1.   I thought you might find it useful for the meeting about
    Hillsborough if you could see where in the Annual Report
    Hillsborough features and what it says. This is attached.

    2.   I also attach a short minute from Ian Greenwood.   I
    wanted to know whether it was possible to fall back on the
    legal restriction raised by the Solicitor i.e. if the injury
    is not reported within 7 days it is not a RIDDOR injury.
    The 'quick and dirty' analysis done by the LAU (which I
    understand was done on a sample of 100 forms currently
    waiting for processing) shows only about a third falling
    within the 7 days. I suspect the HSE database would
    similarly suffer if we applied the 7-day rule rigidly. I
    don't know whether           is able to do an analogous
    sample check?   I can see that Hillsborough is perhaps
    exceptional in being 15 months overdue in reporting.

    3.   I hope this is helpful background information.

HILLSBOROUGH: REPORTING OF ACCIDENTS UNDER RIDDOR


1.   You asked me to check what we have included in the draft
HSC/E annual report for 1989/90.

2.   The very latest draft is attached.  It is taken from the
computer version so may differ slightly from the drafts we have
been shown before.

3.   There is a direct reference to Hillsborough and, by
implication, the effect it has had on our policy on overcrowding,
in para 4.159.

3.   I have also attached the section on Leisure Services.
Logically speaking, we should include the Hillsborough fatalities
in the figures we intend to quote in para 3.152 (perhaps with a
specific reference to Hillsborough to explain why they are so
high).

    recognised that taking steps to reduce or prevent this risk is an
    integral part of an employer's health and safety obligations.
    HSE's guidance leaflet "Violence to Staff" , produced in February
    1989 to help employers tackle the problem proved popular and
    140,000 copies were distributed during 1989-90.

    4.157   HSE has provided the Secretariat to HSC's
    Interdepartmental Committee on Violence to Staff since its
    formation in 1983. In May 1990, the Commission approved an
    extension of its membership with representatives from industry,
    the Industrial Society and Victim Support.

    4.158   The Committee's main purpose is now to act as a forum for
    the exchange of problems and solutions and to promote awareness in
    sectors where interest needs to be stimulated or experience could
    usefully be shared. With these ends in mind, HSE arranged two
    seminars during the year, on Safe Office Design and on Violence to
    Staff in the Retail Sector. Both were well attended by employers,
    trade unions, government departments and other interested bodies.
    Further seminars are planned for the coming year.

    Crowd safety
    4.159   During the year, the control and safety of crowds in
    public areas became an area of growing public concern,
    particularly in view of the Hillsborough tragedy. HSE's scientific
    and technical staff provided assistance to the Hillsborough
    inquiry including assessment of crush barrier integrity, crowd
    density measurement and turnstile flow rates. They also
    contributed to the Inquiry's technical working party which
    examined in detail the present Home Office guidance " Guide to
    Safety at Sports Grounds" and reported to Lord Justice Taylor.

    4.160    Most owners of sites or promoters of events which attract
    crowds have a duty to protect those crowds from hazards such...as—
    crushing]. Health and safety r e q u i r e m e n t s c r o w d oontr«l^are not
    always fully appreciated and sometimes confused with the heed for
L   crime prevention. The police have a great deal of experience in
    crowd control but there is less technical knowledge and expertise
    available in the field of crowd safety.

    4.161   A first task of an HSE Working Party on Crowd Safety was a
    search of the available literature; this identified areas for
    further research with the objective of formulating and issuing
    general guidance on crowd safety.

    4.162   Pop concerts, a phenomenon of the last 30 years, have been
    growing in size and number. Responsibility for enforcing the HSW
    Act at most pop concerts was transferred from HSE to local
    authorities on 1 April 1990 and HELA (the joint HSE/Local
    Authority enforcement liaison committee) recommended that work
    should start on new safety guidance. The Home Office, which has
    responsibility for the legislation under which pop concerts are
    licensed, gave its support. Work started in February 1990 by an
    Environmental Health Officer seconded to HSE's Local Authority
    Unit from the North West Leicestershire District Council.
Hunan Factors
4.163   Recent official reports such as the report on the
investigation into the Clapham Junction railway accident by
Sir Anthony Hidden QC, and HSE's report on the fires and explosion
at BP Oil (Grangemouth) Refinery Ltd. have shown that though
individual errors at 'the front line' may have triggered events,
root causes of these incidents lay in flawed organisational
systems in which the individuals worked.

4.164   Increased enquiries to HSE about 'human factors' and
several seminars during the year on the subject, in which HSE
staff participated, reflected increasing interest in systematic
approaches to the management of human behaviour and more awarenss
by industry that a programme to influence human behaviour can be
an effective means of influencing what hitherto has been thought
of as an irreducible core of accidents ascribed to "human error".

4.165   HSE staff have pursued with a number of major companies
ways and means of controlling the human factors in industrial
management which may be a source of potential weakness to the
safety system. Further guidance on these issues is in preparation.
I




    3.145   Through the Meat Trades/HSE Joint Working Pa^ty, guidance
    was issued on working in cold stores and avoidance of slips and
    revised safety standards were agreed with manufacturers of
    derinding machines.

    3.146   Many serious accidents in the meat industry are due to
    stabbing while deboning with hand knives. A survey of standards^by
    HSE and Local Authority inspectors showed that while employees in
    most premises are provided with and wear protective aprons and
    gloves, and that the number of persons trained to deal with heavy
    bleeding was high at 80%, at almost half of the remaining 20%
    there were no protective aprons provided and no notice displayed
    showing action to take in the event of a stabbing accident. NIG
    Inspectors participated in the preparation of a British Standard
    on protective aprons.
    3.147   Through the Safety in Bakeries Liaison Committee the NIG
    participated in guidance on permit to work systems for entry into
    plant and assisted the flour milling sector to produce and update
    guidance on fork lift truck driver training.

    3.148   Standards for precautions against explosion in spray
    driers, chiefly used in the milk products industry, for both new
    and existing installations were agreed with Users. The NIG
    contributed to the development of British Standards on safeguards
    during milk pasteurisation and discussed with industry ways of
    avoiding the need to go on top of milk tanker lorries to eliminate
    the risk of falling.

    3.149   During the year, the Commission's Health Services Advisory
    Committee (HSAC) completed work on guidance on Safe Working and
    the Prevention of Infection in the Mortuary and Post-Mortem Room
    to take into account developments since the Health Departments
    published the Howie Code of Practice in 1978 and complement the
    Department of Health's planned revision of Building Note No 20
    with recommended standards for mortuary and post-mortem room
    accommodation.

    3.150   HSAC also revised its guidance on precautions against
    infection from hepatitis B in line with precautions recommended by
    the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens.

    3.151   Guidance was produced on the management of COSHH in the
    NHS and circulated to senior managers prior to the Regulations
    coming into force. Health Authorities and Boards faced problems
    because of the diversity and number of substances used and
    activities undertaken, often spread over large geographical areas.
    The guidance aimed to illustrate a workable strategy for
    implementing COSHH using the considerable expertise within NHS,
    and ensuring the application of consistent standards and the
    sharing of information.

    Leisure Services
    3.152   Until April 1990, HSE was the enforcing authority for a
    wide range of leisure activities, including fairgrounds, theme
parks and pools. Front 1 April 1990, enforcement responsibility for
much of the industry was transferred from HSE to local
authorities, [xx] accidents in 1989-90 involved members of the
public and gave rise to considerable concern and publicity. HSE's
Entertainment NIG prepared guidance on safety on hazards described
below.

Electrical Safety for Entertainers

3.153   A number [- please specify] of fatal accidents involved
musical instruments and equipment, with poor design and
maintenance, unsatisfactory installation and a widespread lack of
knowledge of the associated electrical dangers all contributory
factors. After wide consultation with the industry, two guidance
documents were published with the aim of improving standards and
establishing good practice: "Electrical Safety at Places of
Entertainment" is aimed primarily at those who manage venues -
"Electrical Safety for Entertainers" at players.

3.154   Indoor and outdoor laser displays are in increasing use in
entertainment, pop concerts, trade and promotional events. Work
started on revising HSE's guidance note "Use of Lasers for Display
Purposes11 to make it more accessible and take account of
developments in the industry.

Fairgrounds

3.155   Fairs remain a popular form of entertainment - some 3
million rides are taken each year on fairground and amusement park
machines - and HSE gives fairground safety high priority. The
"Code of Safe Practice at Fairs", first published in 1984 in
consultation with industry representatives, was updated during
1989 to include new guidance on test runs and advice to ride
attendants on passenger safety.

3.156   Although more people are visiting fairgrounds, the^
incidence of fatal accidents is low and appears to be falling. HSE
commissioned research from the UK Atomic Energy Authority's Safety
and Reliability Directorate with the aim of identifying and
quantifying the risk from fairground rides, and comparing them
with those of other activities. The study, published in [Spring
1990], concluded that risk to a member of the public using a
fairground ride is substantially lower than risk incurred in a
typical car journey and roughly equal to risk from walking to the
fairground. Risks to fairground employees were comparable to those
in metal manufacturing, and slightly below those in construction.
                                                   t
3.157   Work on machinery safety connected with the Single
European Market provided impetus for further development of safety
at fairs and amusement parks, and work started on a European
standard on the safety of fairground and amusement park machinery
and structure, with HSE nominated as the chair of the CEN
Technical Committee leading the work.

Education services
3.159   The Education Service Advisory Committee (ESAC)
concentrated on initiatives designed to promote better health in
education establishments. With the emphasis on providing useful
practical advice, Working Groups produced guidance on allergy to
laboratory animals "What you should know about allergy to
laboratory animals", on managing occupational stress in schools
[title to follow] and on occupational health services in higher
education establishments [title to follow].

3.160   The need for this document was reinforced at a conference
in November 1989, organised by HSE in collaboration with the
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, for senior
managers in higher education and the health services and their
professional advisers to discuss their specific occupational
health needs.
3.161   ESAC also produced guidance on the application within the
education sector of COSHH; a best selling booklet for schools with
a more detailed version for higher education establishments
"COSHH:Guidance for schools" and [title to follow].

3.162   The problems of violence to employers in the education
sector identified by the Independent Committee of Enquiry into
Discipline in Schools in England and Wales (The Elton Committee)
tackled by ESAC with guidance on identifying the potential for
violence, formulating an action plan and statement of intent,
recording incidents, preventative strategies and supporting staff
who are victims of violence [title to follow].

RIDDOR REPORTS TO LAs
1. You asked for a \quick and dirty1 analysis of RIDDOR returns
from LAs to see whether or not accidents were generally reported
to them with 7 days.
2. Because of the way the sample was drawn the results are not
statistically valid, but they are interesting:

             -only 36 per cent of forms are received within 7 days;
             -the range is from 3 to 55 days; and
             -the mean is 12 days.

3. If you want us to do a full and proper sample please let me
know.




LAU
26 July 1990
Ifl
13.   Reported major injuries to self-employed people in 1989/90 increased for the
third successive year to 1,287, although the increase of 135 was less than in the
previous 2 years.     Over 70% of the reported injuries were to self-employed people
in the construction sector and in that sector the increase of 170 was in fact
greater than the increase overall.            The reported major injury incidence rate for
self-employed people in    1 9 8 9 /9 0   was 40.4, less than half that for employees.
Given that self-employed people have a higher fatal injury incidence rate than
employees (see previous paragraph), this suggests a high level of under-reporting
of major injuries by self-employed people.            This is even more marked for over-3-
day injuries where the 1989/90 reported rate of 58.0 was less than one twelfth of
the rate for employees,              an additional ractor^may be a lower propensity for
self-employed people to take time off work.            On the other hand the increases over
the last few years in the numbers of reported major and over-3-day injuries may
well indicate raised awareness of the need to report injuries rather than any
real increase in injury numbers.


Non-employed people
                                                                                            J•

14.   In addition to employees and self-employed people, the RIDDOR"Tys'tenT
includes a requirement to report injuries to non-employed peoples            In sectors
such as construction, energy and manufacturing reported injuries generally relate
to members of the public.        In the service sector they include injuries to pupils,
patients and people in residential homes.


15.   In 1989/90 there was a major increase in the number of fatal injuries to
non-employed people to 197 from 121 in 1988/89.            This was due to the deaths of 95
people in the tragedy at Hillsborough Football Ground.            Fatal injuries to tite?
non-employed in both construction and agriculture declined slightly in 1989/90

HTT.T.SBOROUGH: REPORTING OF ACCIDENTS UNDER RIDDOR


1.      Thank you for your minute of 19 July.    In it, you ask some
general questions about the application of RIDDOR in circumstances
where legislation more specific than the HSWA applies, and you also
ask some more questions about Hillsborough.


Application of RIDDOR


2.      Under regulation 3 of RIDDOR, death or serious injury (as
there described) resulting from an accident or specified dangerous
occurrence must be notified and reported by the responsible person to
the enforcing authority.   "Responsible person" is defined in some
detail in regulation 2(1). Where persons are injured in premises open
to the public, the responsible person would, I take it, be the person
(or company) for the time being having control of the premises
(paragraph (c) of the definition).


3.      The enforcing authority to whom notifications and reports
must be sent is either HSE or, where the main activity carried on in
the premises in which the incident occurred is specified in the
current enforcing authority regulations (the 1977 Regulations were in
force at the time of the Hillsborough disaster), the local authority
                                                                          VS            hXAX2((vAi <T\
                                                                                      Usuc . "JW.
                                                   2               (2m ■i (3 iV^ OfA'S P"®Wa » ^ 3 l^VOUC. Ids-



    for the area in which those premises are situated.                The maiiy activity
    carried on at Hillsborough (professional sport) was/and isjnot
    specified in the enforcing authority Regulations.               Thus, any
    notifications and reports required under RIDDOR should have been sent
    to HSE.


    4.            A body will not necessarily become an enforcing authority for
   the purposes of RIDDOR simply by virtue of their functions under
    legislation which happens to be more detailed and specific in its
    application than the general provisions of the HSWA.                  Thus, the
    safety of major football stadia is primarily governed by the Safety
   of Sports Grounds Act 1975, under which the local authority has
   specific functions, including those relating to enforcement.                           The
    fact that HSE considers that it is more appropriate for other bodies
   to enforce safety legislation at sports grounds does not somehow mean
   that HSE ceases to be the enforcing authority for the relevant
   statutory provisions at those premises.                Regardless of whether or not
   HSE chooses to enforce the relevant statutory provisions at football
   grounds, it remains the body to which notifications and reports under
   RIDDOR must be sent.


   Hillsborough


   5.             As your earlier minute of 13 July made clear, it had been
   agreed that HSE would not seek to enforce section 3 of HSWA to secure
   the safety of spectators at sports grounds in view of the more
   specific obligations contained in the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
   1975.        It is also clear from                   s minute of 12 July and my
   subsequent conversations with Mr Linehan and Mr Osborne (as noted in
   my minute of 16 July), that the application of RIDDOR was considered
   at the time and the decision was reached that the Regulations were
   not applicable.               It may be, as you suggest in paragraph 8 of your
   minute, that subsequent information, had it been available at the
   time, would have led to a different view.               But as you know, accidents
   must be notified forthwith under regulation 3 of RIDDOR, and followed
   within 7 days by a report.               It follows, therefore, that questions as
  'to the applicability or otherwise of RIDDOR must be considered at the
   time when the obligation arises.

           would be to      go back to the Club and ask them to produce the necessary

           accidents after the time which has now passed.              Even if they were
       deJrt*.>minded to help, we would have no way of knowing whether the
       i' information would be made available in the timescale which we need
   aie/uV-
           for our present purposes. An alternative, and to my mind more
           suitable, way of dealing with the situation (should you wish to
           record the disaster in the HSC/E Annual Report) would be to accept
           that the fatalities and injuries cannot appear in the RIDDOR
           statistics, but to refer to them in the text in the Annual Report
           describing the RIDDOR table (eg page 85 and following in the Annual
           Report for 1988/89).       The seriousness of the disaster could be
           underlined, and the figures in question given, together with
           something to the effect that these were not reported under RIDDOR as
           it appeared immediately following the disaster that the fatalities
           and accidents were not reportable.             Should there be any comparable
           accident in the future, however, HSE might regard it as reportable in
           the light of information subsequently available following the
           Hillsborough Inquiry.


           7.         I shall be on leave for 2 weeks as from 23 July.             If you have
           any further queries please speak to Alex Rae.

HILLSBOROUGH: REPORTING OF ACCIDENTS UNDER RIDDOR



1.   Thank you for your minute of 16 July.


2.   I can fully understand why the HSW Act was not thought to
apply    to the particular circumstances of the tragedy at
Hillsborough, at the time.    After all, the Bradford FC civil case
confirmed our policy line that section 3 of HSW Act can
legitimately be held to cover any risks to spectators which are
generated specifically from the way in which an undertaking is
conducted, but that it does not cover acts of disorder or violence
within a crowd.    First indications of the root causes of the
Hillsborough fatalities were indeed drunkeness and disorder.


3.   Our current difficulties stem from the fact that this initial
assessment of the root causes proved to be wrong.    The Inquiry
demonstrated that it was the management systems for dealing with
the spectators which were at fault - that it was in fact a health
and safety problem and not a public order problem.
4.   We already have general agreement that section 3 of HSW Act
is relevant to the management of crowds in this, and many other
situations.     The Railway Inspectorate gave us a practical example
of this last June when they served an Improvement Notice on London
Underground Limited requiring action to mitigate danger from
overcrowding.


5.   We are also clear that, provided we have a demarcation
agreement with another enforcing authority which enforces
legislation more specific than section 3 of HSW Act, then we will
not normally attempt to use section 3.     However, we are less clear
about the application of RIDDOR in these circumstances.


6.   There are attractions, from a policy perspective, in seeking
to continue to require notification under RIDDOR even in those
circumstances in which we have agreed to set aside section 3
enforcement.     Only in this way could we ensure that we have a more
complete picture of the risks to the public.     It would also be
consistent with the way in which, for example, we treated the
Bradford Fire injuries.     In that case, we had a demarcation
agreement which meant that section 3 of HSW Act was not enforced
in relation to the spectators there and yet we asked for, and got,
RIDDOR accident reports and included the figures in our published
statistics (page 39 of the 1985/86     HSC annual report refers).


7.   Mr Hodgkins, in his minute of 16 July, mentioned the legal
question.     On the face of it, there seems no reason why RIDDOR
should not apply in the circumstances of a section 3 accident,
even where we have an administrative demarcation agreement that
says we will not enforce section 3 of HSW Act (although there are
lessons to be learnt about the way in which we draw up demarcation
agreements, and perhaps also about the way we publicise RIDDOR).
However, I should be grateful for your advice on that score.        Is
an employer's duty to notify section 3 accidents under RIDDOR
affected by any administrative arrangements which HSE makes with
other enforcing authorities about the extent to which we will
enforce section 3 of HSW Act?


8.      And, to return to the Hillsborough problem, I would be
grateful for your views on what can we do, legally, to recover our
position.     It seems to me legitimate to say that the legal advice
given at the time not to require notification was given in the
light of information then available.     Subsequent information
suggested that, in retrospect, notification should have taken
place.     It would, therefore, seem right to include the statistics
in the HSE database and the 1989/90 annual report.     There would
seem no question of the employer being in breach, except perhaps
in a purely technical sense:     He was acting on the advice given by
the HSE Area Office.     The Area Office was in turn acting on advice
from the HSE Solicitor.


9.      Turning to the practical difficulties of getting the
information, I see no reason to insist on the employer notifying
us.     I understand that we could include the figures on the
fatalities from information already available to HSE.     And
sufficient information on the major injuries is probably available
from evidence to the enquiry.     Similarly, I would not suggest
saying much about the Hillsborough disaster in the report although
obviously we would have to refer to it because of the number of
fatalities.


10.     It seems to me that if the statistics do not get included,
someone is going to notice the omission and ask why.     It would be
difficult to explain with hindsight the reason for excluding the
figures particularly when that exclusion is perhaps inconsistent
with other public disasters and is not in line with our current
policy on crowd management.

HILLSBOROUGH:   REPORTING OF ACCIDENTS UNDER RIDDOR

1.   Thank you for sending me a copy of your minute to the
Solicitor.  I am puzzled by some aspects, quite apart from the
fact that you do not explain why it has become so urgent to have
advice about something which amounts to formal notification of
facts well known 18 months ago and we should have taken up much
earlier, if we needed to do so.

2.   Your minute does however suggest to me that there may be some
aspects of RIDDOR's application to accidents under s.3 which
either have not been thought through and/or have not been properly
applied.

3.   There is the legal question.   Is there a duty to notify.   And
to whom does it apply?

4.   There is the policy question.   Do we expect everybody to whom
the legal duty formally applies to notify, and in this context
what about double notification.   (There is as always the further
policy question of whether the legal position is correct or needs
changing.)

5*   Then there is the statistical question. Which s3
notifications should we count in our statistics?

6.   I do not pretend to know the answers to these questions, but
some points in your minute suggest that either the framework we
need is missing i.e. we have not got a consistent series of
answers to the above questions, or we may be in danger of making a
mistaken application of them to Hillsborough. Examples are:-

     (a)   para 1 - the fatalities at Kings Cross and Bradford may
           have been reported to us, but they do not appear to
           feature in the published statistics for 1987-8 or 1986-7
           (reports table 1 both years). Indeed the 1988-9 report
           (p.85) says injuries to passengers travelling on a
           railway and members of the public injured on a railway
           premises are excluded from RIDDOR.

     (b)   para 5 - if Bradford was not included in the published
           statistics, I find it difficult to see why Hillsborough
           should be.

     (c)   para 6 - I do not understand the last sentence. The
           Hillsborough disaster if it is to be reflected in the
           health and safety statistics should have been included
                  in the statistics in 1988-9 and in the Annual Report for
                  that year already published.

7.   ESB is responsible for statistics, but I find it difficult to
see that HSE can suddenly wake up and tell an of best agnostic
world "Sorry folks. When we added up the accident statistics we
forgot Hillsborough, the second biggest disaster that year."

8.   But let us first consider what our policy is and then if
necessary what it should be.

HILLSBOROUGH:    REPORTING OF ACCIDENTS UNDER RIDDOR


1.      Thank you for your minute of 13 July, which we discussed
briefly last Friday.


2.      You will now have seen             's minute of 12 July to Mr
Lindsay, noting that the fatal and major accidents sustained at the
Hillsborough disaster were regarded as not reportable under RIDDOR.
             refers to advice given by Mr Osborne to Mr Linehan.     I have
now had the opportunity of speaking with both Mr Linehan and Mr
Osborne to clarify this.     I understand that the basis for the
conclusion reached at that time was that the dominant factor appeared
to have been crowd behaviour and control (not a health and safety
matter for the purposes of HSWA) rather than breach of a health and
safety obligation.     The uncollected litter at Bradford, however, did
constitute a breach of such an obligation, as noted by                     As
you will appreciate, a decision on reportability under RIDDOR has to
be taken very quickly, as the accident itself must be reported as
quickly as possible and followed by a report within 7 days.        It is
clear, therefore, that the reporting of the fatal and major accidents
sustained at Hillsborough was not overlooked; rather it was decided
at the time that RIDDOR did not apply.
3.       You also mention the Coroner.   I am conscious that questions
have arisen about Coroner's inquests in respect of deaths reportable
under RIDDOR.            has advised on this in the past.


4.       I shall be in Bootle tomorrow for the meeting of the HSC, so
if you wish to discuss any of this further, would you please speak to

HILLSBOROUGH : REPORTING OF ACCIDENTS UNDER RIDDOR

1.   I would be grateful for your urgent advice about the
legal position on the reporting of the fatalities at the
Hillsborough disaster in January last year.

2.   Perhaps I could outline the position. There is little
doubt that the RIDDOR provisions covered these fatalities,
whether the dead were employees or members of the public (in
the same way as the fatalities at Kings Cross and Bradford
were I understand reported to us). However, at the time of
Hillsborough we had a demarcation agreement with the Home
Office for sports grounds/. The agreement was very short (see
Annex 1) and did not touch on the reporting of accidents.     I
am not entirely sure, because I was not involved in the
negotiations with the Home Office, whether the issue of
reporting ever came up. However, I think not.    (Perhaps Mrs
       :ould correct me if the files and the section's
recollections prove me wrong.)   It is probably true to say
that if the subject had arisen, we would have continued to
have required reporting to us under RIDDOR, because the Home
Office overlapping legislation on sports grounds does not, I
believe, contain any provision for reporting accidents.

3.   The demarcation agreement was (and still is) as I under­
stand it, a purely administrative arrangement to avoid dual
inspection and enforcement by HSE under HSWA and l.as under
the sports ground legislation.  I do not think it has any
statutory backing.

4.   The demarcation agreement was fleshed out for
the purposes of giving guidance to the local authorities when
the in April 1990 they took over responsibility for enforcing
the HSWA at most sports grounds. A copy of the guidance is
at Annex ^ . I attach it merely to illustrate the intention
of the demarcation agreement between HSE and Home Office in
January 1989. Obviously the local authorities were not at
that time the enforcing authority for HSWA at sports
grounds.

5.   If this outline of the position is correct, the 95
Hillsborough fatalities should have been reported to us and
should be included in the HSE 1989/90 statistics and Annual
Report.

6.    I do not know why the fatalities were not reported to
us.    Perhaps           could help here. However, I under-
stand that, possibly acting on advice, FOD decided that they
were not the enforcing authority and did not receive (were
not offered?) the reports on the fatalities. As far as we
are aware, this branch was not consulted and as I have indi­
cated, I would have come to the opposite view. As you will
appreciate, it is going to be highly embarrassing if we have
to go back to Sheffield Wednesday, the employer, at this
point and ask for the reports.   (I assume this is legally
feasible and Sheffield Wednesday would still have a legal
duty to report the fatalities to us?) However, it might be
even more embarrassing in future if the figures appear in our
statistics without a mention in the Annual Report.

7.   There is another, perhaps even more, embarrassing aspect
to this issue. I also understand that FOD informed the
Coroner that they were not the enforcing authority and had no
interest in the inquest, again acting on advice.  I would be
grateful if you could advise on this action. I am not
familiar with the Coroners Act but were HSE the "enforcing
authority" for the purposes of that Act o not? If we were
and we informed the Coroner incorrectly, are there any legal
implications with respect to, for example, the inquest?

8.   I do not think we can move on this issue until we have
your advice, hence my plea for urgency.  I am in most of
today and I believe you are free.

               1.    You will recall that this subject was discussed at the DGBG
               on Monday.


               2.    I have now received from SPDD a copy of the redrafted
               paragraphs on HSWA of the Home Office's written evidence which
               has been prepared for the Court of Inquiry.               You will see that
               the question of Section 3 has been covered and that reference
               has been made to the agreement between         HSE and the Home Office,
               centrally and confirmed locally at Hillsborough that HSE does
               not generally attempt to enforce Section 3 to secure the safety
               of spectators at sports grounds.


               3.     I am told that HSE has not been asked to give evidence but
               that we have been asked to assist the Court of Inquiry by giving
               them technical advice on such topics as the siting and strength
               of crush barriers etc.          The HSE team providing this advice is
               headed by Dr Chris Nicholson and he is working closely with
               Prof Mander one of Lord Justice Taylor's two assistants.


               4.     In view of the agreement between the Home Office and HSE on
               Section 3 and the fact that we have not been asked to give
               evidence, are you content that there is currently no need for
               high level briefing or representation along the lines of that

CODE   18-77
Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974


12.   Separate evidence will be submitted by the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) on the technical aspects of spectator safety at
sports grounds (eg. safety of crash barriers).   The Health and
Safety at Work etc Act 1974 could also be used to enforce general
spectator safety at sports grounds.   Section 3 of the HSW Act is
wide-ranging in that it places a duty on an employer to conduct
his undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as is
reasonably practicable, that persons not in his employment who may
be affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their health of
safety.   A sports or other entertainment 'undertaking' would fall
within this category.   However, it is the stated policy of the
Health and Safety Commission that, as a general principle, they
and the Executive wish to avoid duplication of enforcement with
other authorities.   The HSE would not therefore generally attempt
to enforce the requirements of section 3 of the 1974 Act when they
overlap with duties imposed by other more specific legislation,
where other authorities have responsibility for policy and
enforcement.   The Safety of Sportsgrounds 1975 Act represents more
specific legislation and HSE does not, therefore, generally attempt
to enforce section 3 of the HSW Act to secure the safety of
spectators at sports grounds.   This arrangement is agreed between
HSE and the Home Office, centrally, and had also been confirmed
locally at Hillsborough.


13.   In practice HSE are concerned primarily with the health and
safety of employees at a sports ground (eg. players, ground staff,
contractors) using section 2 of the HSW Act.   HSE would also
normally take the lead on the protection of spectators from the
effects of the event taking place in the arena (eg. stock car and
motor racing).   HSE also have policy and enforcement
responsibilities at sports events held elsewhere than at a sports
ground defined under the 1975 Act (eg. motor cycle scrambles).

           2 The Act, w hich came into force on 1 September 1975, im plem ents the m ain recom m endations
\         of the Report of the Enquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds (Cmnd 4952), which w as
 \        prepared following the Ibrox disaster in 1971. Its provisions are concerned with the
  1       safeguarding of spectators at sports grounds, but not with the risks inherent in participation in
           the sporting activity.

          3 Sports grounds in E n glan d and W ales which have accomm odation for more than
          10.000 spectators can be designated a s requiring a safety certificate. A number of grounds
          have been designated under the S afety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 1976
          (SI 1976 N o 1264) (file 5). Others h ave been added by the subsequent D esignation Orders of 1977
          and 1978 (SI 1977 N o 1323 and SI 1 9 7 8 N o 1091 respectively (file 5)). A list is given in A ppendix 1.

           4 Scottish sports grounds with accom m odation for more than 10,000 spectators can sim ilarly
V         be designated and a number h ave been designated by the Safety of Sports Grounds
           (Designation) (Scotland) Order 1976 (SI 1976 N o 1285 (s 106) (file 5)) and by the subsequent
           D esignation Orders of 1977 and 1978 (SI 1977 N o 1345 s 99) and SI 1978 N o 1099 (s 98)
           respectively (file 5)). These are listed in A ppendix 2.

          5 Regulations m ade under this Act, the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976
          (SI 1976 N o 1263 (file 5)) and the Safety of Sports Grounds (Scotland) Regulations 1976
          (SI 1976 N o 1300 (s. I l l ) (file 5)), contain procedures for applications for safety certificates,
          including their am endment, replacem ent or transfer.

          6 In dealing with applications for safety certificates, LAs have been asked to h ave regard to the
          safety standards set out in the “Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds” (file 5) which w as issued
          jointly by the Hom e Office and the Scottish Home and H ealth Department. T his publication,
          know n as the “Green Code”, gives guidance on those matters covered by a certificate and
          includes reference to access, egress, terracing, barriers, stands, and also fire precautions and
          access for emergency vehicles.

      7 The Green Code recom m endations are especially applicable to football grounds, although
      the advice is intended to cover grounds where sporting events of all kinds are held and where the
^ . gathering of large crowds is likely to present a safety problem. Powers to enter and inspect sports
U 'I- grounds are contained in s. 11 of the A c t and under s. 10 local authorities are empowered to apply
* " to a m agistrates court for an order prohibiting or restricting the adm ission of spectators to a
      sports ground where they consider the risk to be so great as to justify such action.

                                             Relationship with HSW Act s.3
           8 The A ct and subordinate legislation is designed to protect the public, and enforcem ent is the
           responsibility of LAs. There could be, however, an overlap with HSW A ct s.3.

           9 The key to the application of HSW A ct s.3 in this area lies in the risks arising from the w a y in
           w hich the undertaking is conducted, and it follows that the risks m ust be specifically generated
           in this way. Risk of injury from violence am ong spectators will not be covered by s.3; on the other
           hand the ground capacity, m ean s of exit, crash barriers, handrails, fencing, the construction
           and strength of stan ds, etc, could be w ith in its scope.

           10 The S afety of Sports Grounds A ct specifically deals with such m atters and where it can be
           applied there should be no reason for HSW A ct to be invoked. A ny cases of difficulty w h ich arise
           because the LA h a s been unable to take remedial action under the 1975 A ct should, in the first
           instance, be referred to the AD.

           11 Copies of the A ct, the relevant regulations and orders made under it, and the “Green Code”
^     .    will be distributed for subject files.

DRAFT LAC(L)



THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 (AS
AMENDED BY THE FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987)
AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ETC ACT 1974


Introduction

1.    Local Authority inspectors will be aware that, after 1 April
1990, by virtue of the Health and Safety (Enforcing Authority)
Regulations 1989, LAs will for the first;time be responsible for
enforcing the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSWA) in
sports grounds. Sports grounds under the control of LAs will
continue to be inspected by HSE.

2.   This circular offers enforcement guidance for LAs which they
should consider carefully. The enforcement arrangements suggested
are similar to those devised and adopted by HSE to deal with the
overlap of legislation and enforcement responsibilities in
football grounds. Because of this overlap those local authorities
which enforce HSWA should consider which piece of legislation is
more appropriate to use in different circumstances. The fact that
HSE had worked out enforcement arrangements in relation to fire
legislation and HSWA, and had acted within those arrangements,
doubtless influenced the judge in the Bradford football club case
when he found that HSE had acted reasonably.  It is the
responsibility of individual LAs to ensure that they have made
adequate enforcement arrangements in football grounds and they
will need to determine how, and to what extent, they should follow
this guidance.

3.   Section 3 of HSWA, because of its wide scope, overlaps with a
lot of other more specific legislation enforced by other
Departments or authorities. The guidance in this circular is
restricted to the overlapping provisions relating to safety of
sporting events at sports grounds and the need for liaison
arrangements between the various authorities involved. It does
not deal with the safety of the many other events for which
grounds may be used. Guidance on those aspects of sports grounds
- particularly their use for pop concerts - will if necessary be
issued separately.  It should be noted, however, that the
certificate issued for the sports ground may contain specific
requirements in relation to the use of the ground for activities
other than sporting events.

4.   In view of Lord Justice Taylor's report on the Hillsborough
disaster, this circular may only be interim guidance. Further
guidance will be issued if necessary.

                                1
Legislation specific to safety in sports grounds

5.   The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) and the
Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act)
are concerned with the safeguarding of spectators at sports
grounds, but not with risks inherent in participation in the
sporting activity or with safeguarding employees.

6.   The 1975 and 1987 Acts are administered in London and the
conurbations by the London Borough Councils and Metropolitan
Authorities respectively, and in the rest of England and Wales by
County Councils.  In Scotland the work is carried out by Regional
or Islands Councils.  For ease of reference these Councils will
hereafter be referred to as the "Certifying Authorities".

7.   Under the 1975 Act, the Certifying Authorities are required
to issue safety certificates for grounds designated by the
Secretary of State. Designated grounds are, in general, those
used for soccer, rugby and cricket and with a capacity over
10,000, although this figure can be amended by the Home Secretary,
using powers given him by the 1987 Act. The certificate contains
such terms and conditions as the Certifying Authority considers
necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium
when it is in use for the specified activity or activities. The
specified activities could include non-sporting activities in
addition to the sporting activities which initially attracts the
application of the Act.

8.   Under Part III of the 1987 Act, Certifying Authorities have
similar powers in respect of regulated stands. These are stands
which have a capacity of 500 or more spectators under cover at any
sports ground.

9.   Under s.11 of the 1975 Act the Certifying Authority has power
to enter and inspect any sports ground and, under section 10 of
the 1975 Act, can issue a notice prohibiting or restricting the
admission of spectators to a sports ground or to any part of it
(whether or not the ground is designated) if the risk to their
safety is judged to be serious enough to justify doing so.

10. In dealing with applications for safety certificates,
Certifying Authorities have been asked to take into account
the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" which was issued jointly
by the Home Office and the Scottish Home and Health Department.
This publication, known as the "Green Guide", gives guidance for
certification purposes on access, egress, terracing, barriers,
stands, fire precautions and access for emergency vehicles, as
well as for other matters covered by a certificate.

11. Although the Green Guide recommendations are especially
applicable to football grounds, the advice is intended to cover
                                2
grounds where sporting events of all kinds are held and where the
gathering of large crowds is likely to present a safety problem.


Implications of the overlap between HSWA and sports grounds
legislation

12. There is an overlap between the provisions of the 1975    and
1987 Acts and with sections 3 and 4 of HSWA.

13.  [So far as HSE enforcement is concerned] it is the Health and
Safety Commission's policy that sections 3 and 4 of HSWA should
not generally be enforced if public safety is already adequately
guaranteed by the enforcement of alternative, more specific
legislation. As the 1975 and 1987 Acts are designed specifically
to protect spectators, there should generally be no reason for HSW
Act to be enforced in relation to spectators in sports grounds
covered by those Acts, other than to deal with risks arising out
of the activity taking place at the sports ground.

14. If'they follow that policy, LA inspectors responsible for
enforcing the HSWA will generally do so only in relation tothe
people at work at a sports ground (which will usually include
those who participate in the sporting activity taking place
there).


Arranging liaison with the other enforcing authorities involved

15. Safety at sports grounds is usually the responsibility of the
Licensing Department of the Certifying Authority, and it is they
who organise an "advisory group" consisting of themselves, the
building authority, the fire, service and the police authority.
The ambulance service may also be represented. HSWA enforcement
officers should familiarise themselves with the local arrangements
within their own area, and should be aware of the certificates for
each ground.

16. HSWA enforcement officers, and advisory group colleagues, may
wish to consider whether regular, formal liaison arrangements
might be helpful, perhaps to coincide with the scheduled advisory
group visits to relevant local grounds.

17. Whether or not these formal or regular liaison mechanisms are
in place, it is essential that an authority or Department which
notices a serious risk outside its remit alerts the relevant
enforcing authority or Department to the problem. Where such a
risk is noticed the relevant enforcing authority or Department
should be informed as soon as possible - by telephone if the risk
appears to be a serious threat to life or serious injury - so that
agreed, co-ordinated action is taken. It is suggested that local

                                3
authorities establish, as necessary, contact/liaison points within
Fire Authorities, Districts and Counties for this purpose.

18.  Outside the Metropolitan Authorities in England and Wales, it
would fall to the County Council as the certifying authority for a
designated sports ground, to notify the District Council, as the
authority responsible for HSWA at the ground, of any serious
breaches of HSWA. Conversely, the District Council should notify
the County Council of any serious breaches of the 1975/1987 Acts.
Similarly, in London and the conurbations, the certifying
Department within the Borough Council or Metropolitan Authority
should notify the Department responsible for health and safety, of
any serious breaches of HSWA at a designated sports ground, and
vice versa.


Action in an emergency

19. There may be exceptional circumstances in which LA inspectors
may want to use their powers under HSWA - for example to issue a
prohibition notice - in order to protect spectators, and LAs
should consider what their policy is in those exceptional
circumstances.  For example LA inspectors might want to use their
powers under HSWA if they consider a risk is such that it poses a
serious and imminent threat to life or of injury and requires
immediate remedy in order to eliminate or reduce it.

20. Certifying authorities also have wide-ranging powers to act
in an emergency - see para 9.

DRAFT PRESS NOTICE



                     SAFETY OF FOOTBALL SPECTATORS




At a recent meeting of the Health and Safety Commission (HSC),
Commissioners agreed a joint proposal from the Health and Safety
Executive (HSE) and the Home Office for enforcing safety at
football grounds.     [The proposal has also been agreed by HELA, the
joint HSE/local authority enforcement liaison committee.]


Although the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (HSW Act)
applies to football grounds, it is the HSC's policy to avoid
duplication between enforcing authorities.     In- practice this means
that, if the HSW Act overlaps with other, more detailed
legislation which is also designed to protect the public, then HSC
generally supports demarcation agreements between the enforcing
authorities involved.    The objectives in doing so are to ensure
that no areas of risk remain uncovered, and that public safety is
protected by the most appropriate legislation, while at the same
time avoiding needless duplication of enforcement effort.


The demarcation agreement for football grounds means that local
authorities, using their powers under the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975 and the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
1987, will continue to have primary responsibility for ensuring
the safety of football spectators, and that the HSW Act will
generally only be used to protect those who work in football
stadia.


The agreement includes a reciprocal arrangement whereby each
enforcing authority is to notify the other of any risks which give
rise to concern and which is for the other authority to enforce.
In addition, in an emergency, either enforcing authority is at
liberty to use whatever powers they have if they consider a risk
is such that it poses a serious and imminent threat of injury and
requires an immediate remedy in order to eliminate or reduce it.
As from 1 April 1990, local authorities have been responsible for
enforcing the HSW Act at many leisure venues, including most
football grounds.     However, the HSE will retain responsibility for
enforcing HSW Act at a few grounds, including those owned or run
by local authorities themselves.


[The proposal re-affirms a similar, earlier agreement between HSE
and the Home Office, which was endorsed by the judge in the
Bradford Fire case.     It was also recognised by Lord Justice Taylor
in his Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.]
BACKGROUND NOTES



1.    Section 3 of the HSW Act places a duty on employers and
others to ensure the health and safety of those who are not
employed by them - generally speaking, the public.


2.    The HSC's policy on enforcing section 3 was published in the
Commission Newsletter in February 1981 and again, revised, in
February 1989.


.3.   Local authorities have been responsible for enforcing the HSW
Act in retail, catering and some other service-sector premises
since 19??.   In April 1990 they were given responsibility for
enforcing the HSW Act in about 100,000 additional premises,
including most leisure venues, by virtue of the Health & Safety
 (Enforcing Authority) Regulations 1989.


4.    For the purposes of enforcing the HSW Act, "local
authorities" means


      District and Metropolitan Counties in England and Wales and
      District and Islands Councils in Scotland.


For the purposes of enforcing the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975 and the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport act 1987,
"local authorities" means


      in the conurbations, the London Borough Councils and
      Metropolitan Authorities and, in the rest of England and
      Wales, the County Councils.   In Scotland, it is the
      responsibility of the Regional or Islands Councils.

HSE RIDDOR ACCIDENT STATISTICS 1989-90
1.   Statistical Services Unit is currently preparing statistics for the HSC
      1989-90 Annual Report. I understand from them that the deaths which
      occurred at the Hillsborough football ground are not included on the
      SHIELD database - apparently because a decision was taken to regard them
      as not reportable.
2.   In view of the importance of so large a number of fatalities, and
      precedents about deaths in similar circumstances eg Bradford FC, I would
      be grateful if you could confirm your understanding of the reportability
      position. I would also be helpful if you could let Statistical Services
      know the reasoning behind the decision so that some suitable explanation
      can be placed in the commentary to the statistics.
3.   If there is any doubt about the position we need to clear it up within
      the next two weeks, not only because of our deadlines on text for the
     Annual Report but also, importantly because any changes to the database
      at this late stage could have serious implications for the tables of
      accident figures and the calculation of incidence rates.

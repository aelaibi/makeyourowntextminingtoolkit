suppo rt er s     sat about        d ri nking      on both sides             of Halifax Road.

At about 2.40          pm    (1440)      large     numbers       of N o t t i n g h a m Forest     supporters

were     converging         on the Ho p end of the ground.                       The m a j o r i t y a pp ea re d

to be a rr iving        from H er ri es Road.                 They were        not well     behaved and

a p p e a r e d to have      been drinking             heavily.        Man y    crossed the       road without

regard for        the traffic and against                     the d i re ct io n of a special

constable        directing        traffic.         I had o cc as io n to speak              to one

y ou t h who kicked at a passing                   bus.        Two men were a rr es t ed          near      to the

t ursntiles       by u ni f or m ed officers.

In the mai n the            conduct      of these         supporters arriving             late was

w orse    than that of the Liverpool                      supporters I had seen.                Having       said

that,     on arrival         at   the    ground,        they a p p ea r ed      to be passing        through

the    turnstiles       in an orde r ly manner.

I went       into the ground            by the     large gates          leading       to the g ym n as i um at

a bo ut 2.55      pm (1455).            At this        time N o t t i n g h a m Forest      supporters,          who

a pp e a r e d m os t ly the worse         for drink,           were    still arriv in g m a in l y          from

the dir ec ti on of Herr ie s             Road.

The Liverpool          s upporters        who had         been sitting drinking along Halifax

Road had gone.

                                                .ssr                                                                 SI 867

              I went       into the g ym n as i um where a number                 of u niformed officers             were

              taking refreshment.  I had been there for a few minutes w h e n Chief
                         £j2-bO
              Inspector Sumner came in and called all the u niformed officers out to

              go onto        the track.

              At this        stage      I do not think a n yb od y had any              idea that       there were

              casualties and officers                     thought    it was a pitch       invasion.

               I went      to the       pitch and stood near the Hop.                   I saw a number          of

              Li verpool          supporters       running about         on the     pitch.      The    players had

              already        left the field.               I saw one Liverpool          supporter       run the full

               length of the field from L ep pings Lane                        to the Kop.        He    stood    in the

               g oa l m o u t h    in front     of the Kop gestiu cl at in g aj^the N o t ti n gh a m Forest

              supporters           with both arms           raised and makijp^ two finger               gestures.           On

               being a p pr o a c h e d by three            special      constables     the youth       ran back

               towards       the L ep pings Lane            end but Was a r r e st e d    in m i d - f i el d by PC

              Brougham.             There was a cordon pn u n if ormed officers across                         the f i e l d

              at the L ep pings Lane               end of X h e      ground

              At this        stage      I was    unaware      of    casualties      and still     thought       it was a

               pitch      invasion.          1 jant/cipated the m atch            continuing when order              had

               been     restored.

      _       I thought           there w ou ld be trouble           between    rival    supporters after             the

2^            m a t c h and thought          I w ou ld be very        late off duty.          I then went         to use           a

      .Jr .   public      phone      to alter a rr an g em e nt s        I had made     for that       evening.

              On    returning         to the g y m n a si u m at about 3.20           pm (1520)        I was    h o r ri f i e d

              to see       bodies       being    taken      into t p 4   gymnasium.       I a s si s te d   in keeping

              order       in the area outside               the >fymansium for a short            time and then

              a s s i s t e d with the handling J5f bodies                  in the gymnasium.

       T'Y'   At 6 . 3 0     pm     (1830)    some    officers were         being    stood down.         I then spoke

              as    by this        time    e v er yt hi ng was      under   control     I was    no longer        required

            to assist and       it was a g r e ed   I should go off duty.

            D ur i ng   the time   I was   patrolling    outside   the ground     I was a p pr o a c h e d

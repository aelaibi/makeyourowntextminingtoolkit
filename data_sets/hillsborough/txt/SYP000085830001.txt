ab an do ne d and        people      began sl o w l y to leave             the ground.          Gradually          the

bodies were          removed        from    the    pitch and the stands                   emptied w i t h o u t any

further        problems.



Whe n the        ground was         nearly empty          I went     into     the L e p pings Lane           stand

together         wit h a younger           officer who         I had never           seen before and

            in the gym w hich by this                time had numerous               bodies     laid on the floor

            who    had    come to see        the    full    extent     of the disaster.             I then went             bac.K.

            into    the North S t a n d where            I stood by,          together     with quite a number                  a

            other     officers.         Onl y a handful        of our        two serials were           present,        I

            later     learned that          some we r e i nvo 1 vecl i n the           gymnas i u m . Re po r ts of

            trouble       in the City Centr e and              public       house     could be heard over               the

            radio     but we were         not used as        it was         explained    that      there was

            insufficient          transport        and the     traffic        jams    outside were         too    great.

            Some    time    later,       a l t h o u g h we were    still      held    in reserve we were

            allowed      to go to C l a y w he e l s Lane          for a meal         if we wa n t e d one        but       soon

                On S a t u r d a y    15 A^ril      1989      (150489)        I performed duty at the                   football

                m a t c h at H i l l s b o r o u g h b et w e e n L i v erpool       and N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t .

                 I have      p rev i o u s l y s u b m i t t e d my    r e c o llections      on the events             of that      day

   ^            a n d now w ish to clarify               certain m a t t e r s       in respect           of d e c e a s e d and

                 injured      persons        I had dea lings with.

                 I first      ente red the ground via Gate                     ’C " at about 3.05prn (1505)=                     I

                 have   p r eviously d e s c r i b e d the scene               in the       concourse a rea         immediately

                 b e h i n d the West Stand.             As    I a p p r o a c h e d the     t u n n e 1 I was     faced by two

                        e,    one of them a young woman,                      carrying       out   the body of a young
 O Jhr i        male.        I went        to assist     t hem and we          laid him down              in the   centre       of the

t><_\ T b ^ -    concourse.           I started to give               him m o u t h to m o u t h     r e s u s c i t a t i o n but   it

                was a p p a r e n t    that    he was      dead.         I w o u l d describe        him as        18 - 20 years,

                slim buiId,           fair hair       cut short,          wearing         jeans.     I cannot        remember

                anything         else about       him.       The    three    of us than moved him towards                    the?

                r iver       side   of the e n closure where             two or three          other     bodies were            laid.

                I had nothing           to do w i t h him after             that and     I do not know what

                ha p p en ed to him.

                I return ed to the             tunnel     and saw three          fans    carrying        out anot h e r

                youth.          They   put him on the           floor and went          back    into the tunnel.                 I

                per f o r m e d m outh to m o u th on him but he was                    o b v i o u s l y deceased.         I

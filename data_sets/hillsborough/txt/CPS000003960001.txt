                  Dear

                  HILLS BOR OUGH - RELEASE O F BARRIER 124A FOR TESTI NG

                  I am now in a position to allow access to the barrier 124A for samples
                  t.o be taken for metallurgical testing.  However, as you represent the
                  interests of the owners of the barrier then it is wholly appropriate
                  that any o ther parties with an interest in the barrier should first make
                  application through you for access to take samples.   Obviously I am very
                  concerned that all parties should have an equal opportunity to gain the
                  "best" evidence.

                  The Direc tor of Public Prosecutions has laid down the following
                  conditions about the taking of such samples from the barrier.    Those
                  conditions are that each party requiring to take samples should provide
                  the following undertakings in w r i t i n g : -

                  1.    When samples are taken and when tests are carried out w herever they
                        occur a representative nom inated by the Crown Prosecution Service is
                         to be present.

                  2.    Photographs are to be taken when ever samples are obtained and copies
                         provided to the Crown Prosecution Service.

                  3.    All reports and data are to be provided promptly                    to the Crown
                         Prosecution Service.




            I'I I A M   l l l l ' I Y Ml I I I !   (II I K I A I            i " 1'     1        ""
Please note that at this time I do not intend to return the barrier to
the custody of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.   The return of the
barrier will not take place until a decision has been reached by the
Di rector of Public Prosecutions and HM Coroner has concluded the
Inquests.   In the meantime it will be retained as a potential exhibit.

I trust that the above arrangements meet with your satisfaction.    I have
written to the o ther parties concerned with the civil proceedings
informing them of the action I have taken with you.   A copy of the
covering letter to them Is attached with circulation.

Yours sincerely

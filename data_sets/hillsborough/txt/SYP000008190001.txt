                a b o v e a d dr es s      for    the     past     six months,

                I am a       football        supporter           s up po r t i n g S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y and        I am a

                My shop       is s it u a t e d on a m a i n           road                                    from the L ap p i n g s

                L ane   e n t rance        to the H i l l s b o r o u g h ground.

                On Sat urday,           15 April          1989 a ware         of      it being a semi-final                day     I made

                m y w ay     into work a bit                earlier        at about          0600    hours,      after     opening         the

                shop things          were        very busy         because my              regular     customers       were       coming       in

                e a r l y to do the shopping.

                At a bout       10.30am          1 had the         first Liv er po ol           s u p po rt er s    coming        into     the

                s hop a nd asking            for the H o r s e         and J o c k e y        pub and others asking                 for     the

                Beehive       pub,      from that           time    on a lot           of    people were w a l ki ng             past    the
                                                                                                            PAGE     2

              shop quite a few of them                carrrying     beer   cans.

              As    the day      progressed the a p pe ar an ce        of the Liverpool        fans    changed a

              little         to the point w here you were able             to tell     that they had been

              drinking.          At about    quarter        to three   I had to go up the         road to

                               shop and w he n      I got    t h e r e , a Liverpool   fan was    leaning up

              a g a in s t    her w in d o w obv io us ly d r u n k , and at this time         I was   s urprised

              that     there were        so m any    people still      hanging a ro u n d so     close to kick

              off    time,      in fact at about        ten to three       there were     still    hundreds    of

              L iv er po ol     fans streaming down Wads ley Lane              obv i ously from the

              d i r e c t i o n of the    pubs those        being Horse and Jockey,        Beehive,      Sportsman

              and Wads 1ey Jack           it was     obv i ous to me that a l 1 these fans we re very

              very m er ry but saying            that   I d i d n ’t see any t r o u b l e .

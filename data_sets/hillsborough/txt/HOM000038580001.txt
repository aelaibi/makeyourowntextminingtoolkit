 1.    I Paul Taylor will say:



2.     I make this statement further to my statement dated 4th

May 1989 to the Hillsborough Enquiry (Appended hereto).



3.     On page 4 of that statement I refer to a girl who I pulled

out of the mass of bodies and tried to resuscitate.      I also refer
to a boy who I helped.



4.     Approximately 4-6 weeks after the disaster I spoke to

Mr and Mrs Hicks.     It became apparent that the girl to whom I

referred was Victoria Hicks.     I told Mr and Mrs Hicks that when I

lay the young boy next to Victoria a young police officer wearing

gloves came along.     He felt for a pulse in both Victoria and the

boy.    He then told me to leave both bodies as they were dead.    I

had not mentioned anything about this police officer in my earlier

statement nor did I specifically mention Victoria as at the time

of making my statement I was not aware of her identity.



5.     Mr and Mrs Hicks were keen that I added this information to

my earlier statement.     I therefore received a visit at home from

DC McCombie the West Midlands Police officer assigned to the

Hicks' case.     I explained what I wanted to add to my earlier

statement.     He told me that unless I knew the name and number of

the police officer that I would be committing perjury if I made

another statement.     He told me I could go to jail fof* committing

perjury.     At the time my wife had just had a baby.   I was

frightened by what
DC McCombie was saying to me and agreed that I would not make

another statement.    I did not want to put my family at risk.   I

did not refer to any of this when I gave evidence at the inquest.



Dated the            day of September 1997.

             worked our way down to the front nea* the pitch, fenoe and stood infront

            of the barrier*       This was about 2.40pm.          We could see into the side

            move because it will smell in a minute with the heat." Also you could'nt

            really see the corner flag to spe who took the cornora, so we moved

            about six or seven feet to the individual feaee between ue and the wide

            enclosure .-sweeping round to the Forest stance.



            Almost immediately peopl6f started to try ftflc clinb into t -1" erLcia.Vwi-c-

            wrilcV: v:as nearly empty.      So I put my foot on the bar of the fence and

            by his hair ar.d lea away.



            Th* police still did'nt seen to grasp what was going on, they seemed to

            think there »as some sort of pitoh invasion.              They seemed to be looking

             aes»amiig*t police on the pitch to help but they just looked at us.



             Just on 3.00pm I told Eifion to get over as it was now getting- ao bad you

             eould hardly aove.       I told him to meet me at the coaches after.                He was

            njirting eis well as my chest.       I started to find my breathing getting

            harder.     I then noticed a hoy between lo and 20 years old, about three

            people infront of me, his face train# pale then turning like blue, and I

           quite clearly he w&e dead and I passed him over.        Ey now I was very

           tired myself arid the policeman kept shouting1 to keep going and get as many

           ovap aa possible.



           It was then that i;.r,otic«c a huge blue pipe getting thrown over onto the

           pitch.    I realli^d.lt was fron the barrier.*e and            had stood in

          Aa it balanced on top of the fence all kinds of rubbish fell out whioh

          I later realized urae rust.



          By now there was quite a lot of room on the front of she terrace* aa

          people who were not helping had moved baok.        1 then spotted a girl with

          her lege trapped and lying over backwards ao I pulled her out and carried

          her to the aide.     I ?ut her down and went to give her the :<ios of life

          fifia Cr.en smelt the odour coning fron her mouth.     I realized then she was

          dead but I still did it out of instfrct.       I t.ien pulled her arm out of

          her cardigan s-r-.d pulluu i: over her face &.d left ner« and vent to help

          anyone else I could.


         We carried a few others over to the fence and pushed then over, by now

         one of the policemen on the other side of the fence was <ust standing

          there in coraplete shock as was a lot of people standing on the terraces.



         I then saw a boy lying there vhose eyes were slightly moving, so I, «ith

         another nan pulled him jfco one aide,     ife put hin next to the girl, I

         then tilted his head back to give him the kiss of life, then noticed his

         mouth had a few pieces of rust in it.         Phis must have come from the pipe*

         I pulled these out, and started to give him the kis9 of life.- He brought

         up like a bile taste into ay mouth and this made me bring the same taste

         up.     I turned to him again and his tongue had gone down to the baok of

    waist and put it over his face.

    earlier stood an because I knew he « u dead to get at the others.          Pour

    policemen picked him up ao I went to pick up the girl but two policemen

 B i t was sad to see all of that, someone had to die for it to be done.

      £.3 0    p.m.       the     full     serial       was a v a i l a b l e at the Police Roo m on

standby.           S h o r t l y after         that    time    the    serial         was    i ns tr uc te d to move           to

a   position          behind the           turn st il es       <inside            the ground)       w h ic h   gave

access        to the N o r t h Stand.                  We were       r e- al lo c at e d     call    sign      serial        65.

On arrival            at that         posit io n       I could seg^ through the t u rn st il es                        that

there was a seri ou s                  problem wi tj^c rushi rtg inside.                        There was         no

o rd er ly queueing,                people were          pushing         to get       through the          t urnstile

gates.         The     people         coming         thro ug h the turn st il es were                in a very

d i st r e s s e d    condition.               It was    clear       that, they had been               in a very bad

crush.         Some       of the       people were            trying         to    catch their       breath,

although           none     I saw      required         immediate            first aid.         Others who         came

through,           either        t hr o ug h    panic,     sh o jcj^ -o -f^ -d r i n k , were      very a gg re ss iv e

towards mys el f a nd                 other      oncers         present.             Many of the         people        had

ob v io u sl y been d ri nking                 heavily.

The turn st il es are                 po s i t i o                       .        At the   point w here          I was

the re .^ as an e l d e r l y ma n o pe rating                     the       turnstile       to my     right,      a

y o u n g e r ma n w it h          long    shoulder       length dark             hair o p er at in g       the

 t u rnstile         to my     left.        The e l de rl y m an at           one     point a sk ed me to            check

a ticket         of one        s u pp or te r     t hr ou gh his t u rn st il e who            had     come       through

 the w ro n g turnstile.                   His    ticket was          for the West' Terrace.                      It was

a pp a r e n t   that a lot of other                    people       had done       exactly the same,               coming

 through         the wrong          turnstiles.           In an effort             to a ll e vi a te    the

 crushing,           I asked        both turnsti 1 e ^ p e r S t o r s            to forget about            checking

 tickets and            to just          fr«^e>y^LeX^'eople            through.         This was an

 i ndependent           d e c i s i on    I made    because          of what       I could see from               inside

 the turnstile.                ft was       impossible          to hear, radio m es sa ge s             at    that

/t i m e .     At one       point        I s>K^young            boy a ged about           IS being          held

 h o r i z o n t a l l y above       the    crowd outside.              I reached thro ug h             the

 turnstile           and    lifted him t h ro ug h             it.     I stood him w i t h a Po li ce

 O ff i c e r at a fence a dj ac e nt               to the       turnstile,           instructing           him to

 wait        there    for his        father.        A short          time    later     he was     re-united.

 It was        impossible           to get o^tsjijle' 1 n i t ia 1 ly but whe n                I saw the

 crushing         had s u b si d ed        sYightly,       I went       over the t urnstile                 and

 outside.            P u sh i ng    my way       into    the    crowd,       I a tt e mp t ed to form             it into

 orde r l y queues.                After    some time          I managed          to achi ev e    this and the

^crushing         stopped.

 It was whilst              still        outside    the    gr ou nd that           I heard the         radio message,

 *ALL O F F I C E R S TO THE P I T C H ’ .               I climbed          back through the            turnstile

 and     inst r u c te d two officers               still       inside       to follow me.             We    joined

 other officers              running        towards       t h e / S o u t h Stand.

 I do not know who any of t h j x T o f f i c e r s                         were,     I just     ran w it h them,

 believing           there must           have    been some          sort    of    crowd trouble.             The

 s i t u a t i o n was      o b v i o us l y urgent       because as          I. ran the       radio mess ag e was

 repeated and              1 heard a similar 'qva^^Tge come over the                             ground       public

 address         system.           I then saw S er ge a nt Wright was                    one of the          officers

 running wit h me.                  I went       onto    the    pitch w it h other           officers         via the
                                                                                                                PAGE         i

S ou t h Standi.          I saw a number               of P o l i c e m e n up on the        fencing      behind

the L ep pi ng s        Lane      end goal,         people        from that enclosure             climbing        the

fence to get            out.       F r o m wha t       I saw a nd heard over the                 public address

system         I i m m e d ia t el y    realised there was a problem w it h                       crushing        in    ;

the    central          pen beh in d th^fiirSTr^rmmbered 3.                         The    crowd at      the

Le pp in gs       Lane, end,       both      in the        te rr ac in g    enclosures and          in the stand,

was very noisy.

K no w i p g    it w o u l d     be e x t r em el y di ff ic ul t          to get    people      over    the

perimfeter fenc in g an d out                    of ^pejj^tJT^V^ ente re d          p^r^nusjih^-r'' 2.      This

e n c losure       had m u c h more          space at           that   time.       The gate      in the

perimeter          fenc in g      leading        into      number 2 pen was            opened     for me to

enter.          I was     aware        of other        offic er s      following jus in there             but am

unable         to say who         they w e r e .          The    crushing      in mtrn£iB-ic-~3~pen was at             its

worst at          the    front.

People were a l r e a d y              trying     to      climb the        iron railings         from the front

of number 3 pen to                 get jjVtij-number 2 pen.                    I went      to the    railings at

this     point.          T he y are about           six     feet       in height.         I climbed onto the

railings and s t ar t ed                to assist          people who were           climbing       over.       Holding

one of the spikes                 on top of the             railings with my              left   hand,    I grabbed

peo pi e inside           pen 3^_£4*dT p hy si ca ll y            pulled them up and over                the     fence.

I was a s s i s t e d       by    people       in pen 3 who            pyj^+retn    ~t' was c o n s c i o u s    of the

spikes         on the     railings as            people         came   over and used my           right arm as a

cushioning           barrier,          lifting      people        upwards w ith        it and     simply

dropping          them ba cjsjuwrf^dfs^aver my h e a d .                The    c rowd behind me          broke

their     fall.

After      pulling        out     several        people         by this met ho d       I began to select

people who           I could see were               clearly        in distress.           I could see           people

were     clearly having                d if fi c ul t y    b reathing       frorn their      faces.       Some were

only being           held      up by the         pressure         e x er te d on them by the            crowd,

literally out             on their          feet.         I s h ou t ed to     less d i st r e s s e d m en      into

the    crowd to pass me               those    people.        The      lesser       d i s tr e ss e d m en behaved

i mpeccably,         vittiout      panic and        ignoring          their    own obvious          fears for

personal- s a f e ty an d          passed me the            people      I shouted for.              It was

nec%sary       to s hout        a nd s c r e a m toJa^Hrg^TrTtiut               I pulled several             more

people    over       the fence a ncrT was a ware                     that    other    s up po rt er s     behind me

were    tending       for    those most distressed.

After    pulling        in the        region of twenty               people over        th©    railings,      I got

my first     view of a pile of                 people       under      the    perimeter       fence.        They

were    laid in a heap             reaching       ten to twelve              feet    back     from the fence,

.six' or seven deep a nd along                  the      length of the fence.                 My    immediate

thought was          that    the      people    had just          fa ll en and because             some    of the

crowding     had been         relieved,         they were all               going    to get     up.       I then

saw a w o m a n ’s face.              She was     e n t a n gl e d    in the    pile towards             the top,

wit h her head          hang in g      backwards,           her      face was       purple.        I realised       I

had to get       to that woman.                I s h ou te d to someone              to my     right      to cup

his hands      to a c c o m m o d a t e my foot,            a ss i st i ng me to scale             the

railings.        I    cannot       be sure w h et he r        this      person was a P ol i c e Officer

or a supporter.              I got over         the fence and started to try and free

people     from the) e n t a n gl e d         p i le.     It became          i mmediately obvious            that

m an y of the        people were a lr e ad y dead.

Two    supp o r t e rs were        trying      to give       cardiac massage             to a y o u th of

about    twenty years.                They were         not giving m o ut h- to -m ou th .               The y outh

was    laid on the steps               of the terracing.                I got down,           could not feel a

pulse on the y o ut h 's              neck.     I gave the y ou th two quick                    lung

inflations,          f o ll ow in g    this    by cardiac massage and further m o ut h- to -

his mouth a n d throat                wit h my fingers a nd tried to get more air                            into

him.     I gave       further         heart m a ss ag e an d m o ut h- to -m ou th .               The y outh did

not    respond.         I left        the two     s up po rt er s wit h him trying                 to    revive

him.     He was       obviously         dead.

I went         back    to the         e n t a n gl e d    pile of       people an d tried            to    pull    some

free.          I was       surrounded          by suppo rt er s           trying     to help but           some,

u n de r s t a nd ab ly ,     looking          for       their    friends and         relatives,, w ere            just

g e tt i n g    in the way.              I tried to o rg an is e               theft into a line            to    carry

bodies         towards       the      perimeter           fence       gate.       I knew, there w o u l d be a

gate     so m ew he re       in the fencing and                    1 hoped        to get     people       out thro ug h     it:

to    receive         help from the P o 1 i c e ^J3ffi-eerfs and St.                        John's Ambulancemen,

on the         pitch.        W he n     I looked for the gate                     I saw    it was     still       closed.       ,

There was a pile                of bodies            under       it.      People     from the        crowd were       still

pushing         forward a g ai n st myself a n d other                         helpers.        The    only P o l i c e me n

I could see were                still         up on the          outside       of the      perimeter        fence.

The y were         pulling         people over             it who were            still    rushing        forward,

s cr am bl in g       over    the       bod ie S j^ M fr T ^ c ^ iftih in g    up it.        1 saw Police

C o n s t a bl e 1775 H u m p h r ie s        on         the fence pulling a s up porter                   over.      I

shou te d to Po li ce              C o n s t a bl e H u m p h r ie s to get the gate               open and to get

some P o l i c e m e n       into       the    pen to form a line to carry                       people      out.     I

then saw Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t                 Nesbit at the            fence.       1' shou te d to him

a nd made        the same          request.              Iheysupporters            in the     pert were acting

in panic and               it was       i m p o s s i b l e to o rg anise          them.

I    had f o u n d a y o u t h          in the       pile still           b re athing and        I was      carrying

him towards            the    gate,        a s s i s t e d by a s upporter            not     in panic.           Whilst    I

was     doing         so,    the crowd was still                  pushing         forward,     I was      kicked     in

the back,             someone behinsi--m'e picked up a length of br ok en                                 crush

looking         towards C hief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t              Nesbit who was           orga ni si ng men at

the gate         into a       line and           I saw the            barr ie r    land near      to him and those

officers.             As    X ne ar ed the gate                 it was     opem-Mdr'and a p an icki ng y outh

move     him to get         to the gate.                 Mr Nesbit       saw this and           came    into the

pen to assist.              The y o u th was             crushed t h r o u g h the gate.               I was     then

able     to    p a s s .the y o ut h        1 was       carrying,       a ss is t ed    by Mr Nesbit,          thro u g h

the     gate to o f ficers             ou tside         the    fence.        W ith Mr Nesbit and other

offic e r s     I began to move                  bodies       from the area        of the       gate.

O nce    this was a chieved,                 other       officers were able              to enter       the pen and

a ssist       to get     the    injured and dead out.                        There was no way           to select

the     living       from the         dead       in the       pile.     E ve ry    person was         pulled out

and     passed       t h ro ug h the g a t ^ O t h e r s              were    still c li mb in g       the fence

whilst        this    was    going         on.     In the strug gl e            I twisted my          right    knee

and     I felt a very           sharp        pain.        I s h o u t e d , "My knee's          gone."        I was

unable        to stand.         Mr Nesbit              saw this and          i nstructed me to          leave      the

pert.     He     remai n ed      in there wit h other                  officers.         I recall       Police

Constable         H u m p h r ie s    helping me          thro ug h     the gate and           I w a lk e d onto      the

pitch.         I was     p hy si ca ll y exhausted.                   After     sitting     on the      pitch for a

couple        of minutes,            the    pain       in my knee       eased.         I got    up,    took off my

Police a n o r a k and          tunic and              rejoined       the Police,        taking a position

d i r e c t l y at    the gate.             Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     Nesbit was still            in the

pen passing           the    injured through.                   I was aware         of anot he r       officer      on

the     fence     above my           head with a loud hailer                    organ is in g    the    line.       At

one     point,       a fter a number              of    people    had been passed thro ug h                 the gate,

the     line was       held     up.         Mr Nesbit          s h ou te d to me that          the    one   he was

passing was           still     alive.            Due    t/the        line    being     held up,       I carried

this     person       from the         gate ov(i,o the           pitch with anot he r            officer.         As we

put, him down           I felt       for a pulse              in his    neck.       I could not         feel     one.

I was     then aware           of Police S e rg e an t McCall                   to my    right       bending     over

inside    the      pen a ft er a while.               The      pile of         people    seemed      bottomless,

they    had been p iled several                    people      deep      in the well        at the      front of

the    terracing.              It was my only thought                   to get all       the    people        in ther

pile    out, onto         the    pitch.        T h ijt—p-by s i ca I— e-ffort involved was

tremendous.           At       one    stage w hi l st       in the       pen,I     saw S er ge a nt     McCall

going."      He was            lying, on the        steps      of the         terrace.      Most     of the         other

to get    the      s u pp or te r      out, onto the          pitch as quickly as               possible.             I

shouted,      "Come        on         let's have    him out."             I went    to pick the y ou th up,

he v om it te d and            Igot my fingers          into      his m ou th to make            sure        his

We w o rk e d until            all    the           people were           carried out.

I then saw that a                    crush barrier         had    c om pl et el y    collapsed.          There were

shoes,     coats and            personal       belon gi ng s       strewn all        over      the   front         of the

 On or about the 5 April 1989, I was asked to perform duties in uniform in

 connection              with         the         F.A.            Cup            Semi-Final                         match                between Liverpool                                          and

 Nottingham Forest football clubs, to take place on Saturday 15 April 1989,

 at Hillsborough.                      I was informed that insufficient uniformed officers had

 volunteered to work on this date.

 On        Saturday         15 April                1989,               I reported for duty                                                 in uniform at Police

 Headquarters, Snig Hill, Sheffield, as instructed.                                                                                       At 9 - 0 0 a.m. that date

     I attended at West Bar Police Station, Sheffield, for a briefing.

 At the briefing I was informed of my duties for the day.                                                                                                            Together with

     Police Sergeant 840 Wright of Attercliffe Police Station, I was to be in

     charge of a serial umbered 13 * consisting of .eight officers from that station.

     After the briefing had concluded, with Sergeant Wright and the serial, I

     commenced duties at the Sheffield Midland Railway Station.                                                                                                            The serial,

was involved in football supporter reception at the railway station.                                         The

first of the Liverpool supporters on service                                  trains arrived at around

11.00        a.m.      From     that   time on       the     Liverpool supporters arriving were

placed        on      special    buses     laid      on        to     take them       to   the      ground    at

Hillsborough.             Each of the buses left the station when full, with a two

man police escort, taken from the serials present.                                 Up until 1.00 p.m. the

 two men escorting a bus were returning with the empty bus from the ground

 to the station.            As it was to be our duty to be on stand-by at the ground

 during the match, after 1.00 p.m. officers were instructed to remain at

 the Police Room at Hillsborough until the full serial was re-grouped.                                         I

 left the Midland Station on a full bus of supporters, together with two

 men from my serial, at around 1.30 p.m.                            At that time some of the serial

 had already left for the ground, Sergeant Wright remained at the Station

 to follow with the remainder of the serial on later buses.

 I arrived at the ground shortly after 2.00 p.m.                                  I reported to the police

 room and grouped the serial.

 By 2.30 p.m. the full serial was available at the police room on stand-by.

 Shortly after that time the serial was instructed to move to a position

 behind the turnstiles (inside the ground) which gave access to the north

 stand.       We were re-allocated call sign serial                         65.
 On arrival at that position I could see through the turnstiles that there

 was     a    serious      problem     with   crushing          outside.           There      was   no   orderly

 queueing, people were pushing to get through the turnstile gates.                                           The

 people coming through the turnstiles were in a very distressed condition.

 It was clear that they had been in a very bad crush.                                  Some of the people

 were trying to catch their breath, although none I saw required immediate

        first aid.         Others who came through, either through panic, shock or drink,

        were very aggressive towards myself and other officers present.                                     Many of

         the people had obviously been drinking heavily.

        The turnstiles are positioned in pairs.                          At the point where I was there

        was an elderly man operating the turnstile to my right, a younger man with

         long shoulder length dark hair operating the turnstile to my left.                                     The

         elderly man at one point asked me                     to check a ticket of one supporter

         through     his    turnstile   who had come through the wrong turnstile.                               His

         ticket was for the West Terrace.                    It was apparent that a lot of other

         people had done exactly the same, coining through the wrong turnstiles.                                 In

         an effort to alleviate the crushing, I asked both turnstile operators to

         forget about checking tickets and to just freely let people through.                                  This

         was an independent decision I made because of what I could see from inside

         the turnstile.        It was impossible to hear radio messages at that time.

         At one point I saw a young boy aged about 12 being held horizontally above

         the crowd outside.          I reached through the turnstile and lifted him through

         it.     I   stood     him   with   a police         officer              at   a fence   adjacent    to the

         turnstile,        instructing him to await there for his father.                           A short time

         later he was re-united.

         It was impossible to get outside initially but when I saw the crushing had

         subsided slightly, I went over the turnstile and outside.                                 Pushing my way

         into the crowd, I attempted to form it into orderly queues.                                   After some

         time I managed to achieve this and the crushing stopped.

         It was whilst still outside the ground that I heard the radio message,

         "All officers to the pitch".                I climbed back through the turnstile and

         instructed        two officers     still     inside          to     follow me.          We joined other

officerB running towards the south stand.

I do not know who any of these officers were,                      I just ran with them,

believing there must have been some sort of crowd trouble.                      The situation

was obviously urgent because as I ran the radio message was repeated and I

heard a similar message come over the ground public address system.                         I

 then saw Sergeant Wright was one of the officers running with me.

I went onto the pitch with other officers via the south stand.                        I saw a

 number of policemen up on the fencing behind the Leppings Lane end goal,

 people from that enclosure climbing the fence to get out.                     From what I saw

 and heard over the public address system I immediately realised there was

 a problem with crushing in the central pen behind the goal, numbered 3*

 The crowd at the Leppings Lane end, both in the terracing enclosures and

 in the stand, was very noisy.

 Knowing it would be extremely difficult to get people over the perimeter

 fencing and out of pen 3, I entered pen number 2.                  This enclosure had much

 more space at that time.

 The gate in the perimeter fencing leading into number 2 pen was opened for

 me to enter.      I was aware of other officers following me in there but am

 unable to say who they were.          The crushing in number 3 pen was at its

 worst at the front.

 People were already trying to climb the iron railings from the front of

 number 3 pen to get into number 2 pen.                  I went to the railings at this

 point.     They are about six feet in height.                  I climbed onto the railings

 and started to assist people who were climbing over.                    Holding one of the

 spikes on top of the railings with my left hand, I grabbed people inside

 pen     three   and physically pulled      them up and over the fence.                  I was

assisted by people in pen 3 who pushed.                       I       was      conscious      of     thespikeson

the railings as people came over and used By right arm as acushioning

barrier, lifting people upwards with it and simply dropping them backwards

 over ay head.      The crowd behind me broke their fall.

After pulling out several people by this method I began to select people

 who I could see were clearly in distress.                        I could see people were clearly

 having difficulty breathing from their faces.                              Some were only being held

 up by the pressure exerted on them by the crowd, literally out on their

 feet.       I shouted to less distressed men into the crowd to pass me those

 people.      The lesser distressed men behaved impeccably, without panic and

 ignoring their own obvious fears for personal safety and passed me the

 people I shouted for.           It was necessary to shout and scream to be heard

 but I pulled several more people over the fence and I was aware that other

 supporters behind me were tending for those most distressed.

 After pulling in the region of twenty people over the railings, I got my

 first view of a pile of people under the perimeter fence.                                They were laid

 in a heap reaching ten to twelve feet back from the fence, six or seven

  deep and along the length of the fence.                     My immediate thought was that the

 people had just fell and because some of the crowding had been relieved,

  they were all going to get up.                  I then saw a woman's face.                       She was

  entangled in the pile towards the top, with her head hanging backwards.

 Her face was purple.          I realised I had to get to that woman.                       I shouted to

  someone to my right to cup his hands to accommodate my foot, assisting me

  to scale the railings.         I cannot be sure whether this person was a police

  officer or a supporter.         I got over the fence and started to try and free

  people from the entangled pile.              It became immediately obvious that many

        of the people were already dead.

        Two supporters were         trying to give cardiac nassage to a youth of about

         twenty years.     They were not giving mouth-to-mouth. The youth was laid on

         the steps of the terracing.             I got       down, could not feel a pulse on the

        youth's neck.      I gave the         youth   two quick lung inflations, followed this

         by cardiac massage and further mouth-to-mouth.                      The youth vomited into my

        mouth.      I turned him over, cleared his mouth and throat with my fingers

         and tried to get more air into him.                     I gave further heart massage and

         mouth-to-mouth.      The youth did not respond.                     I left the two supporters

         with him trying to revive him.           He was obviously dead.

         I went back to the entangled pile of people and tried to pull some free.

         I was surrounded by supporters trying to help but some, understandably

         looking for their friends and relatives, were just getting in the way.                       I

         tried to organise them into a line to carry bodies towards the perimeter

         fence gate.      I knew there would            be a gate somewhere in the fencing and I

         hoped   to get    people      out    through      it to receive         help   from the police

         officers and St John's ambulancemen on the pitch.                       When I looked for the

         gate I saw it was still closed.                 There was a pile of bodies under it.

         People from the crowd were still pushing forward against myself and other

         helpers.    The only policemen I could see were still up on the outside of

         the perimeter fence.          They were pulling people over it who were still

         rushing forward, scrambling over the bodies, and climbing up it.                         I saw

         Police Constable 1775 Humphries on the fence pulling a supporter over.                       I

         shouted to Police Constable Humphries to get the gate open and to get some

         policemen into the pen to form a line to carry people out.                          I then saw

         Chief Superintendent Nesbit at the fence.                      I shouted to him and made the

          impossible to organise them.

          I had found                                   a youth in the pile still breathing                                                                            and I was carrying him

          towards the                                   gate, assisted by a supporter not in panic.                                                                                                Whilst I was

          doing so, the crowd was still pushing forward, I was kicked in the back,

          someone behind me picked up a length of broken crush barrier and threw it

          over the perimeter fence at the Police.                                                                                                  I was looking towards Chief

          Superintendent Nesbit who                                                               was organising men at the gate into aline and I

           saw the barrier land near                                                              to him and those officers.                                                   As I nearedthe gate

           it was opened and a panicking youth who had seen someone in the pile of

           people he knew, jumped onto the pile in front of me and in front of the

           gate.                   The youth laid on top of                                                            the pile crying                                 and totally emotionally

           distraught.                                   I had to move him to get to the gate. Mr Nesbit saw this and

           came into the pen to assist.                                                                       The youth was pushed through the gate.                                                                                 I

           was then able to pass the youth I was carrying, assisted by Mr Nesbit,

           through the gate to officers outside the fence.                                                                                                        With Mr Nesbit and other

           officers I began to move bodies from the area of the gate.

           Once              this was achieved,                                                other officers were able                                                    to enter the pen and

           assist to get the injured and dead out.                                                                                           There was no way to select the

           living from the dead in the pile.                                                                              Every person was pulled out and passed

           through the gate.                                                Others were still climbing the fence whilst this was

           going on.

           In the struggle I twisted my right knee and I felt                                                                                                              a very sharp pain.                                        I

           shouted "My knee's gone".                                                                I was unable to stand.                                                 Mr Nesbit saw this and

           instructed me to leave the pen.                                                                       He remained in there with other officers.

        walked onto the pitch.         I was physically exhausted.                After sitting on the

        pitch for a couple of minutes, the pain in ay knee eased.                         I got up, took

         off *y Police anorak and tunic and rejoined the line of Police taking a

         position directly at the gate.         Chief Superintendent Nesbit was still in

         the pen passing the injured through.                I was aware of another officer on

         the fence above my head with a loud hailer organising the line.                         At one

         point, after a number of people had been passed through the gate, the line

        was held up.         Nr Nesbit shouted to me that                   the one he was passing was

         still alive.       Due to the line being held up,                  I carried this person from

         the gate onto      the pitch with another             officer. As we put him down I felt

         for a pulse in his neck.          I could not feel one.                  I was then aware of

         Police Sergeant McCall to my right bending over the youth.                        The youth had

         stopped breathing and Sergeant McCall started mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

         whilst I gave heart massage.        Almost immediately after starting this, two

         doctors came to the youth and continued to tend him.                       I left to re-join

         the line.     I went back inside the pen after a while.                   The pile of people

         seemed botttomless.       They had been piled several people deep in the well

         at the front of the terracing.            It was my only thought to get all the

         people in the pile out onto the pitch.                  The physical effort involved was

         tremendous.     At one stage whilst in the pen I saw Sergeant McCall again

        giving heart massage to an injured supporter.                       Another officer was giving

        mouth-to-mouth.       Somebody shouted,        "We've got this one going".               He was

        lying on the steps of the terrace.              Most of the other people had already

        been taken out of the gate.        Again my thought was to get the supporter out

        onto the pitch as quickly as possible.                 I shouted, "Come on lets have him

        out".    I went to pick the youth up, he vomited and I got my fingers into

         his mouth to Bake sure his airway was clear.                                 The youth was coughing and

         spluttering but I could see he then continued to breath.                                            Again Chief

         Superintendent Nesbit came to help us and we carried the supporter to the

         gate and passed him through to other officers.

         We worked until all the people were carried out.

         I then saw that a crush barrier had completely collapsed.                                            There were

         shoes, coats and personal belongings                          strewn all over the front of the

         above me shouting and screaming obscenities directed at the Police.                                          Some

         of the people remaining in the pen were becoming angry with each other.

         Some alleged that others had been running forward and picking up property

          from the front terracing.               I was in the pen but had not seen this.                                A

          problem with         a   group   of men and a youth was                        sorted out and then I

          organised ten police officers from the pitch to form a line across the

          terracing      halfway     down    to    preserve            the       scene    and     protect       the   lost

          property.        Whilst     still       in   the       pen       with       these     officers,       a   Police

          photographer,        Detective      Constable           Bond,         came     into     the    pen    to    take

          photographs of the scene.            This aggravated some of the crowd still in the

          pen.      It was apparent they believed Detective Constable Bond, who was in

          plain clothes and          not identifiable as a Police Officer,                              to    be a press

          photographer.        Two   or three men broke through thecordon of Police and                                ran

          at Detective Constable Bond in an aggressive manner, shouting obscenities.

          I      restrained    one   of    them and saw Police                       Sergeant    McCall       restraining

          another.       They were         taken back behind                 the      cordon to the top of             the

          terracing.          Detective Constable Bond left the. pen.                             I shouted to the

          remaining crowd in the pen to try and remain calm.                                    I explained that the

 nan with the camera had been a Polite photographer and that he was not

 press.         I explained that the photographs had to be taken for the Coroner.

 The Majority seemed to accept this, others replied with abuse.

 The property strewn around was collected and piled on the track around the

 pitch.         The Police in the pen, including myself, then left the pen.

 There were both Police and suppporters on the pitch.                                Some injured were

 still     being attended,       both Police           and supporters involved in carrying

 people on advertising boards used as stretchers.                            An ambulance was on the

 pitch.           The   crowd   in   the   West       Stand          was   now    quiet   although   some

  individuals were shouting obscenities at the Police and throwing missiles.

 At      this    time I could only walk around totally shocked and physically

  exhausted.         I tried to console some supporters.                     One fan came to me and

  identified me as having pulled him from the crowd.                             I did not know whether

  I had or not, whether it was me or one of the hundreds of other policmen

  there.        In any event, he thanked me for saving his life and walked away.

 The whole scene was one of total shock.                          Police officers I have known for

  years who are very experienced men walked around with tears rolling down

  their cheeks.          Some stood in silent groups whilst others tried to help

  distressed fans.

 I remained on the pitch and there was an announcement that the game would

  be abandoned.         The crowd at the Leppings Lane end applauded whilst there

 was jeering from the Spion Kop.                   The crowd then started to disperse, I

  remained on the pitch until the majority of it had left.

 I found my helmet and tunic but could not find my anorak.                                  I returned to

  the Police room area behind the North Stand.                             It was there I heard over

  the radio that my serial was on Halifax Road with the buses the Liverpool

          supporters were to take back to the railway station.

          I made my way there and re-joined my serial.                       I remained with them until

          we were stood-down from the ground at about 7.00 pm that date.

          I then returned to Police Headquarters and went off duty at 9.00 pm that

          date.

At about 3 . 15pm                    (1515)      it became apparent                          to me how serious                                  the

incident        had become                1 went onto the Leppings Ln end of the pitch twice

and brouqht                injured        people        (one youth and one                                  little             boy)        off and              put

them     in the gym?                  I went         back onto the               pitch about 3.25pm                  -    —-    ‘
                                                                                                                                      (1525)

were     police            officers          everywhere             so    I returned to the gym area where                                                         1

started taking names                         and addresses                of eve ry bo dy who was                                    being        taken            m

                                                 I then handed all                          the        list                to an officer who

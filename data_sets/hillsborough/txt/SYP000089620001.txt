           3.   I have worked for SYMAS s           e June    1987 <000687) as a

           Assistant.     Pri         that I did not hav             full t         job

           are passed on where appropriate to the emergency desk or the out

           patient desk.        At night,   however,      the outpatient desks are not open

           and there will normally be one Control Assistant at the control desk

           and the emergency desk will also be manned.

                 brigade headquarte rs .          W h e n ^ call comes in on one of the direct      lines

                 & buzzer sounds and they^tppropriate light flashes,

                 6. On Spaturday       15 Apjsal (150489)    I was on duty from 1400 to

                 2200 I had worke d / C h e same shift the previous day.

                 7. At about       150<y a call    came from the police headquarters at

                 Snig Hill      i ip Sheffield on the direct line.       The Police

                 officer wanted to speak t-o a Superintendent            in charge at

                 control.       I put him through to Superintendent Ray CLARK^.             I
            -A
                 heard Mr C|LARKE say that there were duty officers at the ground, as

                 well as arj ambulance,          and that there was another ambulance standing by

^    I fl   u^not far f r om the ground.

                 8. Very shortly after               first call there was a second >erall via the

                 direct lir e from Snicr Hill.         I think   it was the same        iceman.

                  el ieve that the           'lice force control at Snig Hill As organised so

                  hat each officer at control has responsibility for a particular

                 area, and so it is quite likely that the call did come from the same

                 police officer.            He told me that they wantejjKa f^leet of ambulances

                 down to tfje Leppings Ln entrance at Hillsborough.                As I was taking

                 this cal1, Mr HOPKINS and H r          CLARK/E '>6re present and I told them that

                 the Police' wanted a fleet of ambulances to the L appings UrT end o f the
*7
                 ground.       Whilst this was happening I could hear

                 contacting one of the / l ^ o n         officers at Hi 1 lsty/rougj^

                 9. Mr CLAF: KE told me to open up a major incident           1/g which I did and

                 all of th^ ent r i#s in that log up to and i n c l u d e s        the entry at .1835

                 is in my handwriting,

                 10. Some tirfie between 1512 and 1 5 l X I mobilised the ambulance on

                 standby at, Middlewood by telbphfming Middlewo^d Station.                 I told the

                 ambulance to proceed on red to Hillsborough Leppings Ln where there

                      3 zari irufiHant, ,

                 11                    contacted all of ti~j/ casualty departments by telephone
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S3388

         to tell them there was an incident and to prepare for possible

         tasualties.     I know that he had difficulty getting through to some

         because the lines were being heavily used.

         •12. We have a major incident rj/om which is next door to the control

         room and which had been set/up a few weeks      prior to 13th April

         (150489).     S uperintendent/^LARKE and I moved to that room at around

         1515.     All of the ERC c</lls came into the incident room.

         Superintendent CLARKE ynad told all vehi cles to use the ERC channel.

         Any calls coming in o/i the other channels would have gone into the

         control    room and a message   passed to us in the incident room.

         Dated the     5th day of May 1989.

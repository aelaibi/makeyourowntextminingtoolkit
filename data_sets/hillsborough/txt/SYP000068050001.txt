 It w a s       obvious             t ha t     there          wa s      serious         afroblems          for       f a ns    attempting                    to

 enter         the       ground.              I would             estimate           Jme    crowd         to    be at         l east       1,500

 strong.             I got          out       of    the       Police         D </q    Van       and      other       t h a n PC       Twigg             and

 myself,            I could          only          see       2 Police           Horses          and      no mo re       than a do zen                     foot

 officers.                One       of    the       Mounted             Officers           w as    towards           the      front        of          the

 crowd        and        seemed          to    be    having             problems           steadying            his     horse.             It was

 obvious            at    o nc e     that          the       use     of    the P o l i c e         Dogs        in t h e s e      circumstances

 was      totally          out       of       the    question              and       in f a c t        would      have        created              more

 problems            and       / or       panic          in the           larg e      crowd.             One    has     to     realise                 t h at

 these        observations                    and    the          decision           not    to     use     th e      Police       Dogs             were

 taken         in    seconds.

...TTHE SCREAMING STARTED. TTHE FANS IN PEN 3 SEAMED ALL SQUASHED. I SAW TWO
FAN CLIMBING OVER FENCE ONTO THE PITCH, BUT A POLICEMAN PUSHED THEM BACK. IT
WAS TOTAL CHOAS. A FAN RAN ONTO THE PITCH AND THE GOAL KEEPER TRIED TO
CATCH HIM. EVEYBODY THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION, BUT WHEN THE GOAL KEEPER
LOOKED BACK INTO PEN 3 HE FROZE. MORE FANS THEN SPILLED ONTO THE PITCH. MORE
POLICE AND STEWARDS ARRIVED BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. YOU COULD
SEX THAT FANS WERE BEING QUASHED. THERE WAS LACK OF COMMUNICATION AS TO WHAT
WJ^kkPPENING. I HELPED FANS OUT OF THE PEN TO THE SEATED AREA OF WEST STAND.
BETWEEN PENS 3 AND 4 WAS A SMALL GATE ABOUT 3FT WIDE WHICH WAS OPEN, BUT WAS
TOO SMALL FOP FANS TO GET THRU WITH EASE.
             TRAVELLED WITH TWO OTHERS WHO WERE ALSO IN PEN 4, THEY LIVE IN
NORTHERN IRELAND, BUT NO INJURIES WERE SUFFERED.

AT THE SIDE OF THE TURNSTILES I SAW A SMALL BLUE GATE,I SAW THIS OPEN AND
PEOPLE WENT FORWARD, IT WAS THEN I SAW ONE OF THE MOUNTED OFFICERS CHARGE
AMONGST THE CROWD, I THINK HE MUST HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE FANS HAD OPENED THE
GATE, THE GATE DID CLOSE FOR AS LITTLE WHILE AND THEN OPENED AGAIN, I WENT
THROUGH THIS GATE WHEN IT WAS OPENED FOR THE SECOND TIME, I SHOWED AN OFFICER
MY TICKET BUT HE DIDN'T WANT IT. I COULD SEE THE TUNNEL WHICH LEADS TO THE
PITCH, BUT BECAUSE I HAD BEEN AT THIS GROUND BEFORE I KNEW I DIDN'T WANT TO
GO DOWN THE TUNNEL OTHERWISE I MAY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT UP IN THE MASS, BECAUSE
M ® * E WAS NO STEWARDS OR SIGNS.
THERE WAS A FEW SPACES IN THJE SHELF, BUT I COULD SEE IT WAS JUST A MASS IN
THE MIDDLE SECTIONS OF THE TERRACES, I SAW PEOPLE CLIMB OVERTHE FENCE ONTO
THE PITCH, ONE YOUTH SEEMED TO COLLASP AND WAS THROWN BACK OVER THE FENCE
INTO THE MASS BY AN OFFICER.
IT WAS SOMETIME BEFORE THEY WERE ALLOWED ONTO THE PITCH.

                                                     HE WAS NEXT TO MY FATHER
IN THE NORTH STAND THE SEATING AREA
                r WHO WAS WITH ME IN THE PEN AND IS BEING INTERVIEWED ON MONDY
                 DON'T KNOW HIS ADDRESS
WE ARRIVED OUTSIDE THE GROUND AT ABOUT 2.15PM A N D___      AND MYSELF WENT ONT
THE TERRACING AT ABOUT 2.25PM WE WENT INTO THE SECTION PART B BECAUSE THATS
WHAT WAS ON OUR TICKETS, THERE WERE NO POLICE OR STEWARDS INSIDE, ONLY
PROGRAMME SELLERS, WE THOUGHT THE TERRACING WAS FULL THEN, IT WAS MOR
CONCENTRATED THAN ON THE KOP AT ANFIELD, FROM THEN ON IT GRADULLY FILLED UP
MOg& AND MORE, I THINK I WAS ABOUT 15FT FROM THE FRONT IN THE CENTRE OF THE
P E ® L T ABOUT 3PM I WAS BEING FORCED FORWARD ANND FINIDHED UP A FT OR TWO FROM
THE FENCE, I THINK IT WAS AT ABOUT 20 PAST THREE I COULD FEEL THE PRESSURE
EASING AND I MANAGED TO WORK MY WAY BACK UP THE TERRACE THE POLICE WERE
SAYING MOVE BACK THERES ROOM THERE NOW, I SAW ANOTHER FRIEND AND I MADE MY
WAY UP TO HIM,                    NOT SURE OF ADDRESS, TEL NO              AND HE
AND ANOTHER MAN BEHIND HIM TOLD ME TO BREATHE DEEPLY BECAUSE I WAS IN
DIFFULTY, I KNEW MY FATHER WAS IN THE NORTH STAND, SO I MADE MY BACK TO THE
FRONT AND WAS PULLED THOUGH THE FENCE ONTO THE PITCH BY A POLICEMAN, I KNEW
THAT MY FATHER WAS NEAR GANGWAY 0 IN THE NORTH STAND , I WALKED ALONG THE
PITCH HEADING TOWARDS HIM, MY FREIND           SAW ME WALKING ON THE PITCH AND
MADE HIS WAY TO JOIN ME, MY FATHER SAW THE TWO OF US AND WE WERE PULLED INTO
THE STANDS BY MY FATHER AND SOMEONE ELSE, WE SAT THERE FOR A REST. THAT WAS
ABOUT IT.WE DID NOT ATTEND THE HOSPITAL.           AND I BOTH GO TO
                      LIVERPOOL.
I DID NOT SEE ANY STEWARDS AT ALL THAT DAY AND I WAS SUPRIZED AT THE LACK OF
REACTION BY THE POLICE, THEY JUST TOLD PEOPLE TO PUSH BACK THERE WAS NO
ATTEMPT FOR A START TO PULL PEOPLE OUT AT ALL, ANOTHER THING WHEN I MADE MY
WAY INTO THE STAND THE POLICE STOOD BY THE SIDE OF THE STAND KEEPING PEOPLE
IN INSTEAD OF DOING SOMETHING TO HELP, THEY ALSO FORMED A LINE ALONG THE
MIDDLE OF THE PITCH, THERE WAS A CHARGE MADE BY LIVERPOOL FANS ACROSS THE
PITCH TOWARDS NOTTS FOREST WHO WERE CHANTING AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING
ON.ALL I HEARD OVER THE TANNOY WAS FOR PEOPLE WHO KNEW FIRST AID TO COME ONTO
THE PITCH.THEN KENNY DALGLISH CAME ON ABOUT 20 TO 4 ABOUT.

WAS A MASS OF PEOPLE BEHIND ME, PUSHING FORWARD AND CLIMBING OVER PEOPLE TO
GET TO THE FRONT TO GET IN - I GOT KICKED IN THE HEAD, AND WAS ON THE GROUND

WAS WORSE AND IT WAS GETTING OUT OF HAND. THE GATE WAS STILL SHUT AT THIS
STAGE. THERE WAS POLICE OFFICERS TRYING TO CONTROL THE CROWD, AND THE CROWD

WHEN I GOT BACK INTO THE GROUND. WHEN THE ANNOUNCED THE NAMES OF THE TEAMS
YOU COULD SEE THERE WAS REAL TROUBLE IN THE TWO CENTRE SECTIONS MORE PEOPLE
WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OUT BUT THE POLICE THAT WERE THERE WERE PUSHING THEM
BACK BECAUSE THEY DI NOT REALISE WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEN THE RUSH CAME AND
LOADS OF PEOPLE CAME OVER THE FENCE AND I SAW ONE MAN WITH THE PRESSURE JUST
SHOT UP INTO THE AIR LIKE A CORK OUT OF      A    BOTTLE AND HE JUSTWALKED OVER
PEOPLES HEADS ONTO THE PITCH. THE POLICE WERE MAINLY WITH THE FOREST FANS.
THEN THEY WALKED UP TO THE WEST END JUST AMBLING NOT RUNNING OR ANYTHING.
I^OMPED INTO THE SEATED SECTION AND I PULLED PEOPLE UP FROM THE TERRACE. IT
TOOK AGES FOR THE FIRE SERVICE TO ATTEND.

WORKS A SHIFT SYSTEM. TO BE TELEPHONED FOR ARRANGMENTS.

I TRAVELLED TO THE MATCH WITH 8 OTHERS. I KNOW MOST OF THEM:
1.                                   LIVERPOOL
2.
3.                                           LIVERPOOL

5.                            ]BROTHER

                     2 YOUNG SONS
14m=
I ^ O N1
       "T KNOW ALL THEIR ADDRESSES.   THERE WAS ANOTHER MAN WITH
DON'T KNOW HIS NAME.
WE TAGGED ONTO WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS A QUEUE AND WENT FORWARD WITH THE CROWD.
AFTER ABOUT 5 MINUTES WE REALISED WE WEREN'T GOING TO GET IN BEFORE KICK-OFF.
 THERE WERE RAILING GATES IN FRONT OF US, AND WE COULD FEEL THE PRESSURE OF
THE BODIES BUILDING UP BEHIND US. I ENDED UP BETWEEN THE WALL AND THE
RAILINGS, AND MADE MY WAY TO THE GATE SO THAT IF THE PRESSURE GOT BAD I'D BE
PUSHED THROUGH THE GATE.
THEY OPENED THE GATE BRIEFLY AND ALLOWED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THROUGH. THEN
THEY CLOSED THE GATE, AND ABOUT A MINUTE LATER REOPENED THE GATE. I WAS IN
THE QUEUE FOR THE TURNSTILE, AND POLICEMEN SHOUTED AT US TO COME OUT BECAUSE
OF THE PRESSURE ON THE TURNSTILE AND DIRECTED US THROUGH A GATE ON THE RIGHT.
WE WENT THROUGH, WALKED ROUND THE BACK OF THE STAND TO THE TERRACES, THE WING
NEXT TO THE NORTH STAND. NO-ONE DIRECTED US, THERE WAS NO RUSH, IT WAS 2.50,
AND WE JUST MADE OUR WAY. THERE WAS NO PRESSURE INSIDE THE GROUND AT THIS
TIME.
THERE WAS SPACE ON THE WING WHERE WE STOOD. WE WATCHED THE TEAMS COME OUT,
AND THE FIRST WE NOTICED WAS THE CROWD SPILLING OVER ONTO THE PITCH, AND WE
REALISED SOMETHING WAS WRONG.
OUTSIDE THE GROUND, I THOUGHT IT ODD THAT THE POLICE HORSES WERE INSIDE
BETWEEN THE RAILINGS AND THE TURNSTILE, INSTEAD OF OUTSIDE GROUND.
THE PRESSURE OUTSIDE THE GROUND WASN'T SO BAD THAT I WAS FRIGHTENED, I'VE
BEES AT OTHER MATCHES WHERE IT'S BEEN WORSE.
THE SITUATION ON THE PITCH WHEN THEY SPILT OVER ONTO THE PITCH, IT TOOK 15
MINUTES FOR US TO REALISE THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM OF CRUSHING OCCURRING. WE
KNEW PEOPLE WERE HURT, BUT HAD NO IDEA IT WAS THAT EXTENSIVE. IT DIDN'T LOOK
AS BAD AS IT WAS.
WHEN WE WERE AT THE SEMI FINAL THE YEAR BEFORE THE POLICE HAD CHECKED THE
TICKETS BEFORE WE WENT THROUGH THE TURNSTILE. THIS TIME THERE WAS NO CORDON,
AND WHEN I TOOK THE TICKET OUT TO SHOW AT THE TURNSTILE THERE WAS NO-ONE TO
CHECK IT.

ORGANISATION AT TOP LEVEL, NO UNDERSTANDING OF SITUATION, WHEN THEY DID
REALISE, THEY DID A SUPERB JOB.

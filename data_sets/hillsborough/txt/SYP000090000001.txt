            On Saturday 15 April            1989 (150489),       I went to the FA Cup Semi Final

            between Liverpool arid Notts Forest played at Hillsborough.                            I am a

            I got my ticket from a friend at work.                   It was     £6 standing ticket for

            Leppings Ln.

            We all travelled in                     car,

            We took the wrong road and ended up in Rotherham.                       We did not stop on

            the way and we arrived in Sheffield at about 1345 hrs.                             We parked on a

            Garage Car Park about 20 minutes walk from the ground.

            On the way to the ground I saw some supporters being escorted to the

                 on the way to the ground.                I saw a f                                sat on the g rass

                 having a drink.         I did not see any disorder or drunkeness on the way

                 to the g ro und .

                 the turnstiles but I did              q& C    see any s te wa r ds . I entered through the

                 tur nst i1es and gave my ticket in.                  I did not see any unauthorised

                 entry to the ground.             I had not been to Hillsborough before .^ffid once

                 inside the ground all            I could see was the entranee to the t>*fine 1 and

                          and            Once into the pen it/was quite full but we could move

                 to where we wanted to go.               We wer^/in the centre of pen 3 near to the

                 back,                                 /
                                    said she could not/see.                 I took her down to the -front

                 about 6-10 feet away from the front fence.                                 1 seem to remember that

                 her back was by a crush barrier.                   I also think that there was another

                 barrier in front of her.

                         called me to go back with him.                   I asked                   if it was alright

                 for me to go back,          she said she would be alright

                 I told her to stop where she was and I would comejfcrsfck for her after

                              I thought at the                 that the pen was as full as it should be

                 and I had not been ir \y < u o r e      of a crush before.

             there was no way I could get through the crowd to her.

             We got to the side fence and ujafra helped over            into Pen 2.   As I got

             I could see people climbing on            to the pitch from the front of pen       3.

             I could hear a couple of lads at the front of pen 2 asking the police

             to open the gate.         I went down     to the gate.    I said to a police

             officer open the gate.        He was      saying to us all get back. Then a        few

             minutes    later he opened the gate.         Some one pulled me up onto the

             pitch,    it might have been the police officer,           I can not remember.         I

             went to pen 3 to see if I could see                      There wepe^a lot of police

              fficers by the fence.        Some were helping             e out of the pen and

             others were yelling at the supporters                 the back of the pen to move

             back to ease the pressure.         Because of all this I could not see into

             the pen and I could not see

             I went towards the North jstand where          I knew her sister and brother in

             law were to tell them about                   I could not see them in the stand

             when I was by the half way line           a Police officer told me to go back.

             I went back by the goal and I saw people lying on the floor.                   1 asked

             a couple of them if they were alright,            they said they were.     I

             also saw some who seemed unconscious,           they all had people with them.

             I went towards the pen again to see if I could see                       As I got

             there I saw a Police Officer pulling a man out of the pen he shouted

             to me to give him a hand and I helped him pull him into a clear space.

              The man we pulled was conscious.            I went then to see if I could see

                      again.   I could not see her.        I returned to the man I     had

             helped to pull out and asked him if he was alright,              he said he was

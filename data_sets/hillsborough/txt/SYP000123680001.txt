 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I W A S N ’T IN A POSITION TO SEE ANYTHING AS I WAS UNCONSCIOUS FROM BEFORE THE

ift-CH WAS STOPPED.     I REMEMBER S EEING THAT THE GATE TO PEN 3 (THREE) HAD BEEN

 OPENED AND THEN I BLACKED OUT

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I ’VE ALREADY SAID IT ALL.

 I FEEL THAT THE POLICE AT THE TURNSTILES COULD HAVE PUSHED THE PEOPLE BACK

 INTO THE ROAD TO RELIEVE THE CRUSH OUTSIDE RATHER THAN LETTING THEM INTO THE

 GROUND.

 JUDICIAL   INQUIRY?

 THE DESIGN OF THE GROjJWD IS POOR, THERE IS A LACK OF DI               flONAL NOTICES TO

 ENTRY POINTS.   ON COMING THROUGH THE TURNSTILES THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THf GROUND
                                      jtf'
 CLEARLY VISABLE IS THE TUNNGUr ENTRANCE TO THE TERRACE AREA. THE                 E I USED TO

 REFERENCE TO THE OPENING OF ANY GATE I HAVE BEEN GOING TO ANFIELD FOR 28 YEARS

 I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A GATE TO BE OPENED TO LET PEOPLE IN,              INA LL THOSE YEARS.

 THAT IS AN AUTHORISED OPENING.       I WOULD LIKE ALSO/TO SAY WITH REFERENCE TO

MERSEYSIDE POLICE AT A N F I E L D , IN MY O P I N I O N JfME MERSEYSIDE POLICE ALWAYS DO AN

EXCELLENT JOB AT ANFIELD,       USING P O L ICE OFFICERS ON HORSES TO DIRECT THE CROWD,

THEY CONTROL     THE CROWDS MOVEMENTS,

JUST THE FACT THAT THERE WAS TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE PEN.

 IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR ANYONE TO GET ANY WIRE CUTTERS TO CUT THE FENCE AND

 OBVIOUSLY LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED IF SOME WERE KEPT AT THE PITCH SIDE IN

 CASE OF EMERGENCY.    ALSO WITH THE SIDE FENCES IN PLACE THERE WAS NO ROOM TO

 MOVE WHEN THE CRUSH OCCURRED.

 THERE WERE PROBLEMS AND DELAYS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE HAD TO GET OUT THROUGH

 THE SAME GATE AND HOLES IN THE FENCE THAT THE POLICE HAD TO COME IN THROUGH

 TO HELP.

 054

 IS THER ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

       GATES WERE TOO SMALL ? NOT EVEN AS BIG AS THE DOORS IN OUR HOUSE.

 ALSO THERE SHOULD BE PROPER SIGNS TO TELL PEOPLE THAT THERE ARE OTHER

 ENTRANCES OTHER THAN THE TUNNEL ONTO THE TERRACE.     I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL LATER

 THAT THERE WERE ANY OTHER ENTRANCES.    ALSO THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN POLICE OR

 STEWARDS OR SOMEONE AT THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE TO DIVERT PEOPLE TO THE OTHER

ENTRANCES WHEN THE CENTRE PENS GET FULL.

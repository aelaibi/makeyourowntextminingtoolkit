for    the        Hillsborough                ground,,              we       got    into      the      Leppings                Lane          end       of

the    ground           at    approx imately                   2.05pm.              We     took       up    a    position                on       the

commented           to       my    son       that     it       was       lucky        that;      we    came          to    the       paddock                ws

Forest        supporters                and     it    looked             to    me    from        where          I stood             that          the       Hop

was    full.            Approximately                 five          minutes          after        arriving                in       the       paddock             my

son    asked        if       we    could        go    and       look          for    some        match          programmes                   as    we

were       unable        to       pur chase          any       outside             the     ground.              we    left          the       paddock

and    went        to    a    caravan           which          was       situated           beside          the       Leppings                Lane

turnstile.               Whilst          there        I observed                   that     the       majority             of       supporters

entering           the       ground          went     straight                to    the     centre          entrance                to       the

terracing.               I did          not     see       any       stewards              ushering          people             to    the          two

side       paddocks           where          I knew        the       left          side     had       plenty          of       room.              We

went       back     to       the    left        hand        paddock             and       took        up   a     position                at       therear

wall,       close        to       the    paddock            entrance.                     I was       able       to       sit       on       the

terracing           fa r about               15 m i n u t s s        until.         I stood           up    to       get       a    glimpse              of

the    Liverpool              team       who       had     come          out       onto     the       ground          in       training                gear

to    loosen        up       before          the     match.              A    steady        trickle             of    fans          came          into

the    paddock           up       until       the     teams          came          out     prior       to       kick       off.              At    this

time       approximately                 2.50        pm     I saw            young boys           climbing                up       onto       the

lifted       up    but       1 began             to       consider            that     the          stand          above       my       head       must

be    overcrowded             on    top          of       us,    but       I dismissed                this          thought             as    I felt

that    the       structure             would             allow       for       overcrowding.                       From       the       time       tns

teams       came    out       and       tbs' k i c k            off,       the       steady          trickle             became          heavier

out    not    unusually             peavy.                 I diu         observe           that       tjrte m a j o r i t y             o f /fans

speech       that       it    was       heavily                slurred.              1 spoke          to       a    couple          of       male    fans

who    jostled          my    son       ana       it       was      clear          from        their       demeanour                that       they

were    dr'unk J         At       the       t ime         of    the      k i ck      off       I asked             my    son       if    he    cou 1d

see    all    right          and    he       informed               me     that       he       could.              I was       considering

that    if    he    said          "Mo"       I would             have         taken        him       to    the          fence       as       I did

feel    at    that       time       that          there          was       sufficient                room          to    get       down       to    yiie

fr0 nt.           The    fans       in       our          paddock          were       dv       no    means          tightly             packed.

The    game       started          and       from          then       until          I observed                persons             e n e r / a c hi n g

onto    the       pitch       I    cannot             recall          any       other          fans       coming          onto          our

terracing,              I say       this          because             I was          standing             right          at    the       entrance           to

our    paddock.              At    this          time          1 felt         that     fans          had       invaded             the       pitch       for

some    reason          other       than          that          which         finally           unfolded.                 The        reason         for

my    thought       were          because             I    could         see       that        some       of       the    fans          behaviour

on    the    pitch       could          be       dec r i bed          as      nothing           less       than          disorderly.

Several       fans       were       fighting                   with      police        and          were       being          led       away,,

Other       fans    were          waving          scarves             in      the     air       and       singing             to    the       crowds

in    the    paddock          behind             the       goal.           I was       in       doubt          that       these          fans       were

Nottingham          Forest             end       and    lept       up       and       down     gesticulating                 and        waving

his    scarf       to    the           crowd,, H e       then            ran      back        to    the L e p p i n g s          Lane          end

and    persued          by    a        police officer.                      One       fan     got    up o n t o     the          crossbar

of    the    Liverpool                 goal       and    at       onest age            1 was       fearful        that           the        goal

might       collaspe.                  He    was f i n a l l y         pulled          down    by     a police          officer,,                 As

time       passed       it    was       p Ia i n t o         see       tha t      s o rne t h i ng    o th e r than              a     p it cn

invasion         was     taking             place       and       it    was       clear        that     it    was       unlikely                 that

the    match       would          be    restarted.                 I then             saw    the     goal     nets          on       the

Liverpool          goal       being          pulled          down       and       1 decided           that        it    was          time        that

I got       my   son     out       of       the       ground,,          1    left       the     ground        via       tne          ina i n     gate

on    Leppings          Lane       end.           I thought             I was          one     of    the     first          out        of      the

ground       out    there          appeared             to    me       to    be       hundreds        on     the       road          outside,,

I managed          to    make          my    way       back       to    the       Niagra        Sports        ground             arid

remained         there        until          7    pm    when       I got          a    taxi     to    Sheffield              Station              to

get    a    train       to    Manchester,,                   I would             consider           that     the       conduct              of    the

crowd       around       me       was       generally             good.           At    no    time      did    I see             any

fighting         taking           place          in    the    paddocks.                 On    my     arrival           at    the        ground

at    2.05pm       the       conduct             of    the    fans          in    the       centre      paddocks             behind              the

goal       was   good.            The       conduct          of    the       police          outside         and       inside           the

ground       was    excellent.

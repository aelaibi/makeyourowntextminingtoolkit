                                                              Date:              September 1997




As you will know, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been appointed by the Home Secretary to
conduct a scrutiny of possible new evidence in relation to the Hillsborough Football Stadium
disaster in 1989.

He will visit Liverpool in early October. During his visit Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will have
private discussions with the relatives of some of those who were killed and their legal
representatives. But he would like to hear from as many of the families who were affected
by the disaster as possible.

We have arranged an opportunity for all the families who wish to do so to put their points of
view directly to the Judge. This will take place in the Lecture Theatre on the 4th floor of the
Merseyside Maritime Museum, Albert Dock, Liverpool, on the morning of Monday 6th
October.

This letter invites you to attend. The session will begin at 10 oâ€™clock. But it would be
helpful if people who wish to come could arrive earlier and tea and coffee will be available
from 9.30.

There are restrictions on space in the Lecture Theatre. There can be no admission to the
Lecture Theatre without this letter, which gives entry to up to two people. The session is for
family members only.

If you would like to come, it would be helpful if you would let us know in advance by writing
to the address above or by telephoning Mike Ward on 0171 273 3612. If you come by car,
you should park in the main Albert Dock car park, which is two or three minutes walk from
the Museum.

We look forward to seeing you on Monday 6th. Please bring this letter with you.

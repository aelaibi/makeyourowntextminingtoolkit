There was a huge crowd outside the Lepplngs Lane entrance a t 2.55 pm.                       The
p o l ic e had formed a wall of two horses 1n fro n t of the g a te s , preventing
the e ntry of arriving fans to the already congested t u r n s t i l e s .                   The
police assured us th a t there was nobody a c tu a lly g e ttin g Into the ground at
t h i s end.        The horses moved apart cre a tin g a gap and we were In stru cte d to
move to a side gate which had been opened to allow fans in to the ground.
M yself and t h r e e o th e r members o f my fa m ily passed 1n th e d i r e c t i o n
I n s t r u c t e d and passed through the g a te s.       There were no groundsmen around
and a l l fo u r of us passed through without our t i c k e t s being taken.                   We
passed through a tunnel which o v e rsp llle d Into the Lepplngs Lane section
 1B‘ segment.            We were packed 1n lik e sa rd in es.       I l o s t both my parents
and g rim ly held on to my younger brother who was finding 1t very d i f f i c u l t
to breathe 1n the crush.           Nobody watched the game. We were more concerned
about keeping our f e e t firm ly fixed on the ground.                   A g i r l was g e ttin g
badly crushed and I helped pass her above the heads of fans towards the
narrow gate which had been opened by the p o lice.                      By now people were
s t r u g g l i n g to climb over the r a i l i n g s and get onto the p i tc h .    The police
were t e l l i n g us to move back but we c o u ld n 't, because people were s t i l l
coming 1n from behind.            People were f a l l i n g down a ll over the place, many
were trodden on.            People were being passed to the people 1n the seating
area above and behind and slowly space was forming 1n f r o n t of us.                   By now
my brother had disappeared and I considered searching through the blue
corpses which were p iled th re e persons high 1n fro n t of me.                  I spotted him
on th e r a i l i n g , climbing over onto the pitch a f t e r he had climbed out of
section ' B1 Into the less densely packed area to the r i g h t of th e goal.
Fans were weeping everywhere and we a ll comforted each o th e r .                   I found my
parents and escorted them out of the ground v ia the tunnel through which we
e n te r e d . My brother made his way o f f the pitch and we e v en tu ally met him
outside the ground.

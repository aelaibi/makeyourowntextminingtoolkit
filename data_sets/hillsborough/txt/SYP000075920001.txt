             At 11.50 pm on Saturday 15th April 1989 I was on duty at the Gymnasium

      f'^i   of Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield.  At this time I held a
                                 A/M-ST \
             conversation with PC1981 Butler, he showed to me the body of a young

             boy marked number 1 with no form of identification.             I took possession

             of the body and property reference 2/89.

             At 4.50 am on Sunday 16th April 1989 I accompanied the body no 1 to

             the Medico Legal Centre where it was handed over to DC Will jams. V**

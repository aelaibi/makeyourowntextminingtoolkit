                 Goodiso           I assisted in that arrest;                             was a Liverpool

         father,                   was extremley drunk and very abusive towards

         myself and other officers.            He was behaving   in a violent manner and

         had to be handcuffed.            He was   later taken to the charge office and

         deta i ne d .

         We then attended at West Bar for meal.

         At 3.10pm       <1510)   that day we were     called to attend Hillsborough in

         relation to ’Operation Support'.             We arrived at the ground at

         approximately 3 . 2 0 pm < 15205 where we went to the New Stand        <Po1i ce

         Room) and stood by.

         Further     instructions     led us onto the pitch where we formed a line

         across the field.

         It became apparent at this time that it was not a public order

         situation but one of a more serious nature.  Confusion and chaos set
                         y
                       S
         in.  I later/went into the Leppings Lane area to assist in further

         public orsfer duties before walking back into the City Centre with PC
           A/ I2J—
         1672 Thicker and several           of the football supporters who had already

         left the ground.          I subsequently became engaged on my normal duties

         for the remainder of the d a y .

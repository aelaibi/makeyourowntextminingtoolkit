            NOTE

            Facts on the Core Bundle

     1.     On 5th June, 1986 a letter was sent to the Chief Fixe Officer and others
            indicating that the redrafting would shortly be completed (312). The
            report to the Panel on 6th May says that the conditions are "a cause for
            concern...... inadequate or inappropriate in sore areas       " (314).

    2.      On 7th July, 1987 (387) the Fire Service was written to with a copy of the
            new draft Conditions and they replied on 13th August (409).

     3.      In September 1987 (417) the Panel received a report saying that the new
            draft Conditions were progressing steadily and it was hoped to submit them
            to the''Panel for final approval in October.

    4.      On 30th March, 1989 copies of the final draft circulated (481).        Therefore
            the apparent delay June 1986 to April 1989.

            Questions

            Why the delay? Do we accept "inordinate delay"? Why were the Club not
            involved earlier? Why did we not notify the Club that the conditions were
            subject to review? How far do we now think the draft is satisfactory?
            Any further review?

            Comments

            The wording of the report in June 1986 was unfortunate it would be more
            accurate to say that the conditions whilst giving no serious cause for
            concern did contain some matters which required looking at.

            The reviewing task took much longer than I originally anticipated owing to
            a~f5SrEer~oi'"lac-toss";1-'             ... ~~ ■— ■*■■■" .-...... — — mi...— .

            (a)    Between January 1986 and December 19-8R. there was an unusual amount
                     of legislation giving rXse to complex issues jnTthe-fieldl-of.
                    "licensing. Deallm^with newLegislation led to work over and above
                     routine work; Further, even with established legislation complex
                     andunusual ■problems can arise from time to time. For the sake of
                     convenience I term such work as "exceptional" and it is that
                     "exceptional" workload which was increased substantially no£jaoly
                     in rel^ipr^to SafetVof^Sgort^^ounds^JliiiiLstration but in

            (b)     I expected to receive at any time some indication of draft model

                   the drafting task. I finally confirmed at a Saninar organised by

     Other Comments

     The Club was not involved in the redraft of the certificate conditions as
     there would be no point in doing so until they were reasonably well
     finalised. I recall mentioning the redrafting of the conditions at the
     1986 inspections and inviting the Clubs to make comments on the existing
     conditions if they wished to do so although I cannot find any record in
     writing of this comment.

     The new draft which was circulated in 1989 needs by reference to the
     comments made by individual officers some further work and it is likely
     that no certificates will be issued until after the interim report of the
     Inquiry.

     The Council has always had the power to    take action immediately in the
     event of a perceived serious risk to spectators.

Number of Turnstiles at Leppings Lane -
Alleged failure to consider the number of turnstiles to
cope with any reasonable flow of spectators that might
be expected.  - See Green Guide Paras. 44-46.___________

COMMENTS :

Both the County Council and the City Council would need to receive advice
on the numbers of turnstiles required anywhere in the ground.  The
question of the provision of turnstiles hinges on crowd flows, behaviour,
plans of arrival etc. These factors can only be possessed on match days.
The advisers with the primary role on match days are the Police and I
believe that advice would come from them in relation to these matters.

I would not raise..jiitgflt,^^«                             inrippepflftniilv. Any such
consideration would need to be started bv someone normal ly the „EalJLce or
even the Club. According to the                          bundle of documents it is
clear that the Club wished to expand the number of turnstiles in 1985 but
refrained from doing so because of cost reasons.              The Police have not           /
indicated at any stage that the turnstiles are inadequate or that maybe *
c rowd problems occur at the Club. I wrote to the Police on 13th

The Police, have in the past commented upon problems at Penistone Road an

                      "BREACHES" OF THE GREEN GUIDE
       IN RESPECT OF THE CAPACITY OF THE PENS, THE CRUSH BARRIERS,
              THE WIDTH OF THE PERIMETER GATES AND THE TUNNEL


 Fact   Generally (a) the Guide is flexible — "breach" is inappropriate
 (b) the Green Guide is equivalent to "generalised guidelines",
 paragraph 2.17.

 (a)  Pens - Capacity j/h SE page 7 P e n ;3 1015, Pen 4 1036 equals 2051
 maximum, but Dr. Eastwood's drawing gives different measurements, the
 Green Guide recommends 1:200 plan (prior 218) HSE             1:50. Dr.
 Eastwood 14.2 x 13.8 which equals 10.58, 14.4 x 14 which equals 10.88
 equals 21 .46 maximum.

QUESTION                              ANSWER                                 Ci<v
Did anyone consider capacity          In 1981 and 1985 it only appears
in the pens?                          that the Fire Ser/vicedid so in
                                      relation to means of escape.   There
                                      is no record of any other
                                      consideration of capacity.   ^

Should they have done?                Seems to require consideration of
                                      capacity of terrace (paras. 218-
Does the Green Guide require          22!).        ‘
this?

Who should have considered it?        The Building Surveyor according to
                                      the division of responsibilities
                                      although it now seems that the
                                      Building Surveyor thinks that the
                                      Fire Service ought to have done it.

If it was never considered, why?      It appears not to have been
                                      considered in detail because there
Why didn't I consider it?             was some confusion over who should
                                      do it.  I didn't consider it
                                      because I was not aware of a
                                      problem in that area and the
                                      proposals had ajA^been approved
                                      before I took over the system.

 To what extent does the              Conditions 3 and 9(2).
^Certificate—m ake any provision?

Does the new Certificate make         See 12(a) p.484 of the Bundle, but
any different provision?              crowd limits are in Schedule 3.

Were self-contained pens ever          Nq., -it. appears that they were
provided?                              always intended to have Police

     To what extent does the            Conditions 25(i) and (ii), 28(4),
     Certificate make provision?        29 and 15.

    Why wasn't total renovation/       I understand that the Building
    replacement required in            Surveyor formed a view after
    1979/80?                           consulting with the Club's
                                       representatives and the other
                                       members of the Working Party
                                       that Dr. Eastwood's plans for
                                       installing new barriers and
                                       replacing those which did not stand
                                       up to the test were adequate.

    Was there ever any complaint/      None is recorded on the files, but
    accident involving the barriers?   see the 1981 incident.

    Did anyone ever notice non­        The slight variations from the
    conformity? If not, why "not?      Guide on the terrace were noted in
                                       19^9/80 and accepted as being

                                       examined in some detail bv the
                                       Building Surveyor on inspections.

    Causative?                                                iHpnro aSm
                                       This is a matter for evidence
                                       no doubt the Inquiry will form its

DISTRIBUTION OF FANS ON TERRACES AND ENSURING THE CAPACITY IS NOT EXCEEDED


See Green Guide, Paragraph 16 and the heading of Chapter 8. The
Certificate provides that the West Terrace holds 7,200 people, should
specific provision have been made for the pens? Should the numbers going
into the pens be mechanically noted? "Even Distribution" - should the
Certificate have made further provision for stewarding or use of Police in
this context, but see 6(2).

The capacity should have been considered both in 1981 and 1985, but there
is no written record to show that it was. Where there is freedom of
movement on the terraces, the numbers going into the pens^ana^'gta yTrig
t h ex.Pi w.cm-ld-be— m    a   — iio assess even if th e y were mechanically
c o u n te d in to start with.

As far as even distribution is concerned, I understand that fans often
have preferred spots and will crowd together near those spots.  It is in
the nature of a terrace that some vantage points are              others
but also that some freedom of movement is inevitable.  See F. Difference
of Seats as fixed positions.

Note also the availabilty of the crush barrier system which is a tried and
tested method of crowd control and which is designed to prevent unsafe
crushes as far as possible.

It   is highly unlikely that the Certificate can achieve more than it does
at   present in relation to conditions.        The problem of nvsrr.rnwi]jpg

             STATEMENT OF: DAVID MALCOLM BOWNES

             OCCUPATION;   CHIEF LICENSING OFFICER, ADMINISTRATION & LEGAL DEPARTMENT
                           SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL

                                             Introduction

             Background details

    1.       My name is David Malcolm Bownes.   I am employed by Sheffield City    Council

             in the Administration and Legal Department as Chief Licensing Officer.


    2.       I have been employed by Sheffield City Council since September, 1971 and

             have held my current post since 11th July, 1977.


    3.       I obtained a Higher National Certificate in Public Administration     from

             Sheffield City Polytechnic in June, 1976.


    4.       The responsibilities of my job are:-

             (a)   to manage the Licensing Section;


             (b)   to provide reports on licensing matters for departmental management

                   and committees and to institute, maintain and operate proper

                   p?ocedures to ensure that all relevant matters are brought to the

                   attention of any committee or officer of the Council required to make

                   a decision on any licensing matter;


             (c)   to liaise with Council members, other departments of the Council and

                   outside bodies on all matters affecting the Licensing Section;


             (d)   to maintain a service to the general public on licensing matters,

                   including dealing with enquiries and correspondence;


             (e)   so far as possible to ensure that the requirements imposed upon
                             *

                   licensees by law and by licence conditions are complied with, and in

                   this connection to co-ordinate the activities of the Council's

                   officers and the Police, Fire and other relevant authorities;


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                    -2-


             (f)   to be responsible for all monies received by the Licensing Section

                   and to maintain proper records to the satisfaction of the City

                   Treasurer;


             (g)   to take statements and prepare reports on any matters where legal

             (h)   responsibility for implementation of the Safety of Sports Grounds

                   licensing system;


             (i)   to assimilate and implement the increasing items of new legislation

                   relevant to the Council's licensing functions.


    5.       The Licensing Section deals with 33 licensing systems, for example,

             those involving taxis and private hire vehicles, operators and drivers,

             cinemas, theatres and places of public entertainment.


             Legislation and the Green Guide

    6.       On 1st August, 1975 Royal Assent was given to the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Act 1975 (Document 1, pages 1-16) which established a "Certification"

             system for sports grounds capable of holding more than 10,000 spectators.

             When a sports ground is designated by the Secretary of State an

             application needs to be made to the Certificating Authority for a General

             Safety Certificate under the 1975 Act.


     7.      At the time the Safety Certificate was granted in respect of Sheffield       ( /\

             Wednesday Football Club the South Yorkshire County Council (the
                                                                                           &
             Certificating Authority) was obliged to attach to the Safety Certificate

             such terms and conditions as they considered necessary or expedient to

             secure reasonable safety at the sports ground when it is in use for

             specified activities.     The terms and conditions at this time had to

             include



HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                       -3-


             (a)    The maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium and;

              (b)   Terms and conditions as to the number, size and situation of

                    entrances to and exits from the stadium or any part of it and the

                    means of access to any such entrances or exits and requiring those

                    entrances, exits and means of access to be properly maintained and

                    kept free from obstruction and as to the number, strength and

                    situation of any crush barriers.     (Section 2(2) of the Safety of

                    Sports Grounds Act 1975).


             Section 2(2) of the 1975 Act was repealed by the Fire Safety and
                                                          I
             Safety of Places of Sports Act 1987. However, Home Office Circular

             71/1987 (Document 2, pages 20-29) advised that those conditions should

             still be included.


     8.      Certificate conditions must also be framed with reference to the plan

             attached to the Certificate, where appropriate.


     9.      Section 10 of 1975 Act provided for an emergency procedure which could be

             used by the Council if it thought that there was a serious risk to

             spectators at a sports ground.     The procedure involved applying to a

             Magistrates' Court for an Order prohibiting or restricting the admission

             of spectators to. the sports ground.


    10.      Under Section 11 of the 1975 Act a person authorised by the Local

             Authority or the Chief Officer of Police, or the Building Authority, or

             the Secretary of State, could on production of his authority enter a

             sports ground to make inspections and examine records and make enquiries

             as he thought fit.   On local government reorganisation on 1st April, 1986

             (when the South Yorkshire County Council was abolished and its functions

             passed in the main to District Councils) the reference to the Building

             Authority was changed to the Fire Authority.

     11.     In 1976 the Home Office issued the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

             (Football)" which is a guide to measures for improving spectator safety at

             Football Grounds, i.e., at rugby union and rugby league grounds as well as

             at soccer grounds.   A revised edition of the Green Guide was issued in

             1986 following the Bradford Disaster and the Popplewell Inquiry.       The

             scope of the Green Guide was amended to cover measures for improving

             spectator safetj at existing sports grounds.    It is a voluntary code.      The

             Green Guide makes comments on such matters as the spacing of crush

             barriers, estimation of safe ground capacity, terraces, etc.    The

             Guide makes the point that deviations from individual guidelines are

             possible without necessarily detracting from the overall safety of the

             ground.   A flexible approach should be maintained to take account of the

             particular circumstances at individual grounds (paragraphs 6 to 8 of the

             Guide).


    12.      The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act, 1987 amended the 197 5

             legislation in a number of areas.    In particular, the old Section 10 of

             the 1975 Act (Document 1, page 8)    was replaced by a more wide ranging

             provision which gave local authorities the power to issue a Prohibition

             Notice in respect of either a whole sports ground or part of it.       A

             Prohibition Notice can only be issued where the Local Authority is of the

             opinion that there is a serious risk to spectators if they are admitted to

             the sports ground.   A Prohibition Notice may include directions as to the

             steps which will have to be taken to reduce the risk to a reasonable level

             and these may require alterations or additions to the ground or things to

             be done or omitted, which would contravene the terms or conditions of a

             Safety Certificate for the ground or for any stand at the ground.

             (Section 10(4) of the 1987 Act).    A prohibition or restriction contained

             in a Notice may take effect immediately if certain conditions are

             fulfilled, or after a specified period contained in the Notice.       An appeal

             may be lodged with the Magistrates' Court against a Prohibition Notice but


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                    -5-


             that appeal does not suspend its operation.     The Court may either cancel

             or affirm the Notice.


    13.      In the new Section 10B of the Act it is the duty of every Certificating

             Authority to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations made under

             it and also to carry out an inspection of each designated sports ground

             at least once every 12 months and to act in accordance with guidance given

             to them by the Secretary of State.


    14.      The 1987 Act also made provision for Safety Certificates for various

             stands at sports grounds.     Also, in order to give effect to various

             Popplewell comments on indoor sporting activities, the definition of

             public entertainments which require licensing was extended.


    15.      The Safety of Sports Ground Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrument

             1987/1941) sets out the prescribed form of application for a Safety

             Certificate and also refers to appeal procedures, etc. (Document 3, page

             30-35).

                                         Home Office Circulars

    16.      Home Office Circular 71/1987    (Document 2 , page 17-29) introduced the

             provisions of Part 2 of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the effects and

             operation of them.   There is also specific reference to the new

             Prohibition Notice procedure and a draft Prohibition Notice.


    17.      Home Office Circular 72/1987    (Document 4, page 36-43) sets out the

             Statutory Guidance on inspections which is mandatory.


                          Administration of the Certificating Function by
                                   South Yorkshire County Council

             Background to Certification

    18.      The County Council set up an   "Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)"

             which consisted of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the

             Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the South Yorkshire County

             Council Administration Department.     This Working Party was set up

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -6-


             following a report to the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee on

             8th January, 1976.   There were four such Working Parties, one covering

             Sheffield, one Rotherham, one Barnsley and one Doncaster.


    19.      In the early part of 1976 discussions took place between the South

             Yorkshire County Council and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about

             the possibility of certification in view of the commencement of the Safety

             of Sports Grounds Act on 1st September, 1975.   On 30th March, 1977 the

             South Yorkshire Police became involved in the discussions and wrote

             to the Home Office indicating that they felt certification should be

             considered when the matter was next reviewed, owing to the large scale

             events that were held at Hillsborough.


    20.      At a football match held on Saturday, 23rd April, 1977 there were

             incidents at Hillsborough involving some injuries and a number of arrests.

             This prompted further discussions about certification and the involvement

             of the Fire Service Committee of the County Council as well as the Police.

             At a meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council on 27th April, 1977

             questions relating to the problems at the football match were raised and a

             specific complaint was later made by a member of the public in connection

             with an incident that allegedly took place at the Leppings Lane end of

             the ground.


    21.      The Chief Constable subsequently agreed to take up    the designation

             question once again with the Home Office.   On 24th   August, 1977 the Home

             Office wrote to the Chief Constable stating that the case for designation

             of Sheffield Wednesday was not overwhelming at that time - but they would

             reconsider the matter later.


    22.      The County Council continued to press the case for    designation with the

             Home Office on the grounds that because of the importance of the games

             played there and the consequent crowd capacities, only if the Stadium had

             been designated could the Authorities satisfy themselves as to standards

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                    -7-


             of safety within the ground.     The Home Office once again declined to

             designate the stadium.


    23.      In April, 1978 the County Council prepared and submitted a lengthy paper

             to the Home Office on the case for designating the Hillsborough Stadium

             under the 1975 Act.


    24.      In August of 1978, the Home Office wrote to the County Council

             indicating that they would recommend to the Home Secretary that an order

             be made designating Hillsborough in due course.          The County Council then

             began the Safety Certificate drafting exercise.          The exercise was carried

             out in consultation with the Police, the Fire Service, the Building

             Surveyor and the Club.


    25.      The Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 1978 (Statutory

             Instrument 1978 No. 1091) designated the Sheffield Wednesday Football

             Stadium as requiring a Safety Certificate with effect from 1st January,

             1979 (Document 5, page 44).


    26.      The Club applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September, 1978

             (Document 6, page 45-48).


             Progress of the Safety Certificate Application with particular
             reference to the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

    27.      In support of the Club's application, a report was submitted to the County

             Council by Messrs. Eastwoods & Partners, Consulting Engineers, in January,

             1979 (Document 7, page 49—58) which dealt with the question of ground

             capacity at the stadium.    The report ".     .    .   deals in broad terms with

             the necessary strengthening and supplementation of the crush barriers on

             the terraces, and calculations are made of theoretical exit times .          .     ."

             All the stands and terraces were dealt with in the report.          Pages 4 and 5

             (Document 7, pages 53 and 54) of the report indicates that the west

             terrace (which is at the I^eppings Lane end) has a total area of some 1,480

             square metres, but there afije no gangways.       It is suggested that the full

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                     -8-


             area would justify about 8,000 spectators, but after making a 10%

             allowance as the equivalent of gangways, a capacity of 7,200 would be

             appropriate.     The report says that the barriers should be designed to

             match this figure approximately and that those barriers which could not

             withstand test load should be appropriately strengthened and extra ones

             provided where necessary.    Proposed extra barriers were shorn on drawing

             1610/2X.   The three exits from the west terrace have a total width of

             about 11.5 metres which would permit some 1,250 persons per minute to

             leave the terrace.    The terrace could, therefore, be emptied in about 6

             minutes.     The report goes on that the Guide suggests that everyone on the

             terrace should be within 12 metres of a gangway or exit.    As there are no

             gangways some spectators would be 25 metres from an exit.     The report goes

             on to say that this is felt to be of no consequence as movement

             horizontally along the terrace will be easy and quick.


    28.      The north west corner reinforced concrete terrace is also referred to in

             the report which is noted as covering a net area of approximately 535

             square metres.    The recommended number of spectators was 2,900, bringing

             the total standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.     It was also noted

             that the exits serving the north west terrace were adequate in width and

             emptying should take place within 8 minutes.    The significance of the 8

             minute time relates to the recommended maximum time for departure of

             spectators from a terraced area of a football ground.    This recommendation

             is contained in the original "Green Guide" at Paragraph 15.5 and the new

             Guide at paragraph 56.    The last page of the report, recommends a ground

             capacity of 50,100 spectators (consisting of approximately 24,000 seated

             spectators, 16,000 standing on the spion kop and 10,100 at the Leppings

             Lane end).


    29.      Following the submission of Eastwoods' report to the County Council there

             was a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) on 12th

             February, 1979 (Docoaent 8, page 62) at which the west terrace and north

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                     -9-

             west corner reinforced concrete terrace were discussed.      As far as the

             west terrace was concerned it was agreed that ".     .   .   In view of the

             lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the spectator

             limit to 7,200, and the discharge time of 6.6 minutes, the Working Party

             agreed that it would be unreasonable to insist that gangways or additional

             exits must be provided." The Working Party also noted that special

             attention would be required to the crush barriers in addition to      the

             ordinary testing in view of the apparent sharp edges, corrosion, etc.         The

             Working Party agreed that there were no real problems with the north west

             terrace but reference is made to the corrugated sheeting which would be

             required to pass the appropriate tests, along with the crush barriers.


    30.      On 30th March, 1979 (Document 9, page 66) the Officer Working Party

             considered further the question of the west terrace and the north west

             terrace.   As to the west terrace it was noted that the terracing in small

             areas near to the stand was in poor condition and that the cross-fall on

             the steps on the north west corner exit would also require attention as it

             tended to throw people forward.     The height of the crush barriers was also

             mentioned as being below the Guide    recommendations.   The Working Party

             agreed that these points should be    drawn to the attention of the Club.     As

             far as the north west terrace is concerned, the Building Authority now

             took the view that the corrugated sheeting would require alteration in

             order to meet the requirements of the Green Guide.


    31.      On 2nd April, 1979 (Document 10, page 71) the Officer Working Party

             visited Sheffield Wednesday and a joint meeting was held with the Club

             representatives.   The Working Party agreed that the Club's proposals

             (including a capacity limit of 7,200 spectators) was acceptable, without

             the need for additional gangways.    It was also agreed that the question of

             the cross-fall on the steps on the north west corner exit, the height of

             some of the existing crush barriers as well as their corrosion and sharp

             edges in places, should be the subject of detailed discussion between Dr.

             Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.      The Club's proposals in respect to

             the north west terrace were also accepted, with a capacity limit of 2,900

             and the improvement of existing barriers and addition of some new

             barriers.     It was also agreed that the improvement or replacement of the

             existing corrugated sheeting should be subject to discussion between the

             Building Surveyor arid Dr.   Eastwood.


    32.      On 18th April, 1979, (Document 11, page 75) a joint meeting of the Officer

             Working Party was held at Sheffield Wednesday.      The meeting was held to

             discuss further the proposals in relation to the Hillsborough Stadium.

             The comments made on the west terrace were that the Club accepted that in

             view of the cross-fall on the north west corner exit, the steps should be

             rebuilt and that the other matters previously raised would be reconsidered

             after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.     Whilst

             accepting the need for improvement or replacement of the existing

             corrugated sheeting on the north west corner terrace, the Club wished to

             consider whether to carry out more extensive works so as to bring an

             existing unused area into use for the accommodation of further

             spectators.


    33.      On 1st May, 1979 (Document 12, pages 78-80) the Sheffield City Council's

             Building Surveyor wrote to the County Council indicating that as far as

             the west terrace was concerned, the downward slope of the exit steps

             needed to be corrected and that the limitation in capacity should remain.

             It was noted that, on the north west terrace, the replacement of the

             corrugated sheeting at the rear was required, as was the removal of

             understrength barriers and their replacement by new ones constructed to

             Guide recommendations.


    34.      On 16th May, 1979 (Document 13, page 82) the Chief Fire Officer wrote to

             the County Council with a work schedule in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.

             It is noted that the west and north west terrace exit routes were regarded

                                                   -11-

                                                                                 /   0 ,   I (K >



             as satisfactory.   It was noted that the capacity of the west terrace was

             7,200 persons and that of the north west terrace 2,900 persons.


    35.      As a result of these consultations between the Working Party and the Club

             on 8th June, 1979 (Document 14, page 85 and Document 15, pages 86-92) a

             list of "Matters requiring attention at the Sheffield Wednesday Football

             Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield" was sent to the Club for its attention.


    36.      On 15th August, 1979 (Document 16, page 93) the Officer Working Party met

             again to consider matters relating to Sheffield United, and also to review

             the progress of work at Sheffield Wednesday since the last meeting on 12th

             July.   It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

             corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.


    37.      On 19th September, 1979 (Document 17, pages 96 and 97) Eastwood & Partners

             wrote to the County Council about the emergency lighting installation in

             the stadium.   Eastwoods proposed in the letter that new emergency circuits

             and fittings be installed in areas of the stadium including the north west

             terrace, the south west terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.


    38.      Between 31st October, 1979 and 12th November of the same year, there was

             correspondence between Eastwoods and the County Council about the

             corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace.     It was finally

             agreed that a continuous horizontal timber member should be fixed to the

             front of the corrugated sheeting at a Working Party visit to the ground

             to assess the progress of works.     (Document 18, page 99).

             Grant of the Certificate

    39.      The County Fire Services Committee of the South Yorkshire County Council

             at its meeting on 29th November, 1979 approved the issue of a General

             Safety Certificate and the terms and conditions of that Certificate to

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.     This decision was ratified by the full

             County Council meeting on 19th December, 1979.     Prior to the grant of a

             certificate the Working Party visited the ground on 18th December, 1979

             (Document 97, pages 299-301).    The grant of a Certificate was made subject

             to remedial works to the south stand steel columns and the emergency

             lighting system being carried out.       The Safety Certificate document itself

             was issued on 21st December, 1979 under the signature of Mr.        F.   A.

             Mallett, the Chief Executive of the County Council.


    40.      The Certificate is attached to this Statement:- (Document 19, pages

             The Inspection System operated by South Yorkshire County Council

    41.      The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) carried out regular

             inspections of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in accordance with the

             South Yorkshire County Council policy of twice yearly visits to football

             league grounds in South Yorkshire.       A list of the dates of inspections

             carried out under South Yorkshire County Council are set out below:-

             Example of Inspection

   42.       At the Working Party inspection on 11th August, 1983 (Document 20, pages

             113-116) there were two representatives from the Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club (Dr.   Eastwood and Mr.      E.   England), two from the South

             Yorkshire Police (              and C.    Calvert), one from the South

             Yorkshire County Fire Service (I                , two from the Sheffield City

             Council (Building Authority) (                  and               and one from

             the South Yorkshire County Council Administration Department (| |

                     .   For illustrative purposes, I would refer to the last two

             paragraphs on the first page of the notes of the Working Party visit.      In

             the first of the two paragraphs it is clear that a problem in relation to

             the brickwork at the rear corner of the stand nearest the north west

             terrace had been raised at the previous meeting of the Working Party and

             this was further explored at the meeting on 11th August.   In the second

             paragraph, Dr.   Eastwood (the Club's Consulting Engineer) gave details of

             testing of the crush barriers on the terrace and indicating that

             appropriate remedial action had been taken, where necessary and that the

             first cycle of the barrier testing had thus been completed.


             Issues arising other than on inspections

    43.      The County Council was made aware of various problems in connection with

             the use of the stadium.   An example as to how these matters were dealt

             with can be seen by reference to a letter from the South Yorkshire County

             Fire Service (Document 21, pages 117-118) to the Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club regarding a test which the Fire Service did of the emergency

             procedures at a match on 4th October, 1983.   There was particular concern

             that stewards could not hear the emergency procedure announcement on the

             public -address system, which resulted in stewards failing to carry out

             their emergency procedure duties.   Consultations then took place between

             the Club and the Fire Officer (with reference to the County Council) which

             resulted in the system being checked and found satisfactory by the County

             Fire Service on 29th October, 1983, (Document 22, page 119, and Document

             23, page 120).


                          Sheffield City Council as Certificating Authority
                                  (with effect from 1st April, 1986)

             Initial Administrative System

    44.      At the meeting of the General Purposes Panel on 3rd March, 1986 (which is

             a Sub-Committee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -14-


             Committee of the City Council) a report was considered from the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department on Safety of Sports Grounds

             (Docuaent 24, page 122). The Panel adopted the recommendations contained

             in the report which were:-


             (a)   All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports

                   Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel.


             (b)   The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be

                   delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in

                   consultation with the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the Panel or of

                   the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as

                   appropriate.


             (c)   The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be

                   delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.


             The Panel's decision was subsequently confirmed by a full meeting of the

             City Council which took place on 9th April, 1986.


    45.      The General Purposes Panel considered a more detailed report on the Act at

             its meeting on 6th May, 1986 (Document 25, pages 123-127).


             Review of the Administrative System

    46.      At its meeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel

             considered a report (Document 26, pages 128-130) on the future

             administration of the Council's Certificating function.


    47.      As the report accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority,

             will act on the basis of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service),

             the question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.      In this

             respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

             Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

             the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -15-


             Department of Health and Consumer Services.    Both the Building Surveyor's

             Division and the Department of Health and Consumer    Services are part of

             existing Council structure.   It was envisaged that the Advisory Group

             would function as a forum for discussion between Officers and its most

             regular use would probably be the discussion of advice to the Council

             before recommendations were finally formulated by the appropriate

             Authority.


   48.       It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would be held at the

             request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

             Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a

             list of items to be discussed.   At the conclusion of the meeting a further

             list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be

             taken by each Authority would be noted.     It was then envisaged that

             detailed written advice would be provided by each discipline and acted

             upon as appropriate.


   49.       The report went on to suggest various areas of responsibility for each

             Authority:-


             Authority                         Area of Responsibility

             The Building Surveyor,            All matters relating to the structure
             (Sheffield City Council)          of stadia, including crush barriers,
                                               walls, etc.

             South Yorkshire County            Fire precautions, fire alarms, means
             Fire Service                      of escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                                capaci ty.

             South Yorkshire Police             Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
                                                access of emergency vehicles and
                                                emergency planning.


             It should be noted that there is, of course, an independent duty in

             relation to safety at the sports ground which falls on the club as

             certificate holder and the management of the business carried on at the

             ground as occupier.




HB5AAA/JJJ
                                           -16-


50.    It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

       would have an input into the Advisory Group on:- aspects of general

       safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items

       such as first aid requirements.   These lists were of course not

       exhaustive and several of the functions overlapped.


51 .   The report considered the question of inspections and it was suggested

       that one large scale inspection per stadium should be carried

       out each year.   It was also envisaged that some additional inspections

       would take place during events.   It was noted that the proposal was in

       line with the Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other

       areas.


52.    The Panel approved the revised administrative system which therefore came

       into effect immediately and delegated all routine matters in connection

       with that system to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.       The

       system remains in effect.


53.    The report was seen in draft by all the    interested officers and its

       proposals modified in the light of comments made.     Prior to the

       preparation of the report the administrative system was discussed at

       length at both a meeting and in correspondence with proposed members of

       the Advisory Group.


       Comments on the New Administrative System

54.    Basically, the Council's responsibility    divides into three parts, i.e. (a)

       inspections of sports grounds; (b) dealing with proposed alterations to

       sports grounds and (c) dealing with serious risks to spectators.     The

       inspection system is dealt with at paragraphs 61 to 78.


55.    Sports ground management sometimes wish    to alter or improve their facility

       and usually these proposals involve the Council as Certificating

       Authority.   Recent examples of such developments include the extension and
                                                        -17-


             roofing over of the Kop and also the installation of facilities for people

             with disabilities in the North Stand at Hillsborough.           The administrative

             system for dealing with those alterations is that copies of the proposals

             are circulated to all the members of the Advisory Group for comment.

             Where comments are received, they are collated and passed on to the Club -

             if necessary following discussions between officers either informally or

             via the Group itself.    This system works reasonably well where proposals

             are straightforward and there is no disagreement between the officers and

             the Club about individual items.          An example of a relatively

             straightforward alteration to the Hillsborough Ground is the "Gate '0'

             Development" (Document 86, pages 269-270) which involved the creation of a

             new entrance to the Ground on Penistone Road.


   56.       Unfortunately, some developments are not quite so straightforward and an

             example of the sorts of problems that can arise are contained in the large

             volume of correspondence in relation to the proposed facilities for people

             with disabilities in the North Stand at Hillsborough.           In that

             particular instance, a considerable amount of time was expended on what

             was essentially a fairly straightforward development.           The amount of

             officer time spent on dealing with alterations to sports grounds obviously

             has to be included in the total amount of time applied to the Safety of

             Sports Grounds system.


   57.       If the Council were of the opinion that admission of spectators to the

             Sports Ground involved a serious risk then immediate steps would be taken

             to secure rectification of the problem.           If rectification was not

             possible prior to spectator admission          then if appropriate steps would be

             taken to issue a Prohibition Notice.

    58.      The administrative system has not yet          been in operation for   a long enough
    'O       time to enable a true assessment of it totake place and it             will, as with

      imp rove its efficiency.   It is and has been my practice to review

      administrative systems after they have been in operation for a reasonable

      time (for example in this case perhaps a period of two years would be an

      appropriate time to review it).


      Role of the Administration and Legal Department
      in the Certification System

59.   The basic role of the Department is to co-ordinate the administration of

      the Certification System and also to keep the records of it.


60.   An example (Document 27, page 131-132) of an Agenda and notes of a meeting

      are attached, dated 28th April, 1988, which shows the sort of items

      discussed at the Advisory Group.


      The Inspection System operated by Sheffield City Council

61.   Every year inspections of stadia are fixed by the Head of Administration

      and Legal Department in consultation with the clubs and the interested

      authorities.   Inspections have taken place on the following dates:-

      7th August, 1986; 6th August, 1987; 19th May, 1988.


      The Inspection System

62.   The inspection system basically consists of six stages:-

      Stage                       Action

      1                           Arrange the inspection

      2                           Carry out the inspection

      3                           Receive comments from Advisory Group members
                                  in writing

      4                           Co-ordinate the comments if necessary via an
                                  Advisory Group meeting

      5                           Send the co-ordinated list to the sports
                                  ground management

      6                           The Advisory Group Officers check that work is
                                  done either on the next inspection or at some
                                  earlier stage if appropriate.
                                                  -19-


    63.      This procedure is of course much simplified in the table above and many

             variations of it can occur.   The system itself should in most

             circumstances work well but in practice some difficulties do occasionally

             arise.


    64.      Inspections are attended by persons representing:- the County Fire

             Service, the Police, the Council's Director of Health and-Consumer ______ -

             Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.     Often, the Club is

             represented at the inspection by a consultant engineer, together with

             another representative, usually the Club Secretary or similar Officer.

             The inspection is carried out by the various officers who meet at the

             ground and then disperse to various areas in which their particular

             interest lies.


    65.      The Officers can draw points to each other's attention during the

             inspection and Club representatives are sometimes asked for

             information.


    66.      If Officers discover a serious safety defect then the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department is informed and immediate steps are

             taken to secure its rectification.   If rectification is not possible prior

             to spectators being admitted into the stadium, then steps would be taken

             to issue a Prohibition Notice, if appropriate.


    67.      Officers at the conclusion of the inspection write to the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department setting out their comments on matters

             which ought to be raised with the Club.     These are then collated and

             discussed with the officers (when necessary at an Advisory Group) and

             finally formulated into a list which is sent to the Club for action.


    68.      As an example, a copy of Officers' comments following the 1987_inspection

             are attached to this Statement (Document 28, pages 133-134).

    69.      The actual time spent on each ground inspection alone usually exceeds two

             man days per year.     This does not include the subsequent administrative

             work or the consideration of proposals submitted by sports ground owners.

             Home Office Circular 72/1987 (Docuaent 4, pages 36-43) states that

             inspections are not expected to take more than about two man days per

             ground on average.


             Details of the Inspections at Hillsborough in 1986. 1987 and 1988

             7th August, 1986

    70.      There is no written record of the inspection on 7th August, 1986.There are

             two reasons for this.    The first is that no significant problems were

             discovered on the inspection and the only point of significance raised was

             that in relation to barrier 144 which is referred to in paragraphs 174-175

             of my statement.     The second reason is that at the same time as the

             inspection was being carried out, the lengthy and complex debate in

             relation to the Spion Kop was fully underway and by far the majority of my

             own efforts and those of the other participants in that debate were

             concentrated in that area.     I do, however, recall that the inspection

             followed the County Council system and it helped firm my views in that

             area.


             6th August, 1987

    71.      The Building Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services

             made a number of comments on the annual inspection.     These comments

             were considered and discussed between officers and a consolidated

             list was drawn up and sent to Sheffield Wednesday on 4th December, 1987

             (Document 28, pages 133-134).     No comments were received from the Fire

             Service or the Police.    The list was circulated to the Fire Service, the

             Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building Surveyor, the Police

             and Messrs.   Eastwood & Partners.

   72.       Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote back to the Council (Document 82, pages

             242-245) on 15th January, 1988, indicating that the majority of the points

             raised from the list of comments had been completed but raising one or two

             questions on some of the items.    Copies of Eastwoods letter were passed on

             to the Health and Consumer Services Department and the Building Surveyor

             but owing to the impending May inspection no further action was taken at

             that stage.   I should explain that it had been decided to move the annual

             inspection from August to May, in order that any work that needed to be

             done could be identified and carried out during the close season.


    /3.      As already noted, the Fire    Service did not make any comments in relation

             to the inspection.   The Fire Service sent a letter to the Council on 18th

             February, 1987 (Document 91, pages 279-284) containing a large number of

             comments on Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.     After discussions with

             the Fire Service, the City Council sent a copy of the Fire Service letter

             (along with various comments) on 22nd April, 1987 (Document 92, pages

             285—286) to Sheffield Wednesday.    After being reminded, the Club via

             Eastwood & Partners responded to the County Fire Service letter on 3rd

             February, 1988 (Document 93, pages 287— 293).    The letter was very detailed

             and was passed on to the Police, the Health and Consumer Services

             Department and the Building Surveyor on 8th February.     The letter was sent

             to the Fire Service on 8th February, 1988, with a covering letter

             (Document 94, page 294).     In view of the comments in this letter, the Fire

             Service were invited to respond directly to Eastwood & Partners.     The

             letter also requested comments on the remainder of the points raised in

             Eastwoods letter.    A Senior Fire Officer rang me in February, 1988,

             indicating that the Fire Service did not wish to reply to the letter at

             that time.

              19th May. 1988

              The inspection was attended by representatives of the Police, the Fire

             Service, the Building Surveyor and Health and Consumer Services

             Department.


             The Fire Service and the Health and Consumer Services Department both

             commented on the inspection by letter dated 25th May, 1988 (Document 95,

             pages 295-296) and memorandum of 3rd June, 1988 (Document 96, pages

             297-298) respectively.


             The Fire Service had not yet replied to Eastwoods letter (Document 93,

             pages 287-293) referred to above.    I was therefore reluctant to send their

             further letter (Document 95, pages 295-296) to the Club before the

             previous issue had been resolved.    I had thought to write back to the Fire

             Service in this way but unfortunately time simply did not permit owing to

             other commitments within the Licensing Section.    I should say that at no

             time has the Fire Service indicated that any of the points mentioned in

             their letter required immediate attention or presented any serious hazard

             to the public.



             The Director of Health and Consumer Services made a number of points

             similar to ones raised previously.


             Ideally, what should have happened in June or July 1988 was that the

             outstanding Fire Service issues should have been resolved and that a

             co-ordinated set of comments submitted to the Club.   This did not

             however happen owing, as I have mentioned previously, to pressure of work

             within the Licensing Section.   As I have already said, none of the points

             raised by either the Fire Service or the Health and Consumer Services

             Department had been highlighted as being of a serious nature.

             Why were the Administrative and Inspection Systems changed when
             Sheffield City Council became the Certificating Authority?_____

    79.      In April, 1986, I recall visiting the South Yorkshire County Council

             Offices in Barnsley and collecting the large number of files in relation

             to both designated sports grounds in Sheffield.      In addition to applying

             some time to reading the files, I talked to officers who had

             been involved with the system for some time.


   80.       It seemed to me that the key test of the South Yorkshire County Council

             administrative system was whether or not it achieved a reasonable degree

             of public safety within the sports grounds which were subject to the

             certificating system.   Bearing this principle in mind, I formed a number

             of tentative views about the County Council's administrative system.      The

             first and most obvious point was that the issues at sports grounds were

             complex and required the allocation of a considerable amount of time in

             order to deal with them.   Also, although it appeared on the face of it

             that the system itself worked well, it struck me that there were a number

             of points which required clarification.      For example, it was not clear who

             made what decisions.    There were plenty of "agreements" on the file and a

             lot of letters to the Clubs but there was no evidence to indicate who had

             the authority to make requirements, etc.      It was also difficult to pick up

             from the files exactly where the technical responsibilities lay and often

             "agreements" were noted as having been arrived at without an indication as

             to who contributed to them.   There was also no clear indication in a lot

             of cases as to the basis on which agreement was reached.      The constitution

             of the Working Party was also rather confused as evidently Club

             representatives were present and made comments at various meetings at

             which agreements were reached.


   81 .      I also looked at the question of inspections of the sports grounds and

             wondered about their thoroughness.    The inspection records did not

             clearly show which areas of the sports grounds had been looked at and it


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                    -24-


             seemed to me that in view of the size of sports grounds quite a number of

             points would be raised on an inspection - although these points would

             obviously vary in importance.    The question of the time taken on

             inspections was also a matter which I thought about.     I also noted that

             the Safety Certificate had now been in force for seven years and perhaps

             should be reviewed.     Obviously, this review process would take a

             considerable time.


   82.       I also looked into the question of the amount of time which should be

             spent on safety of sports grounds and took particular note of paragraph 10

             in the letter accompanying the Home Office Circular 136/78 (dated 23rd

             August, 1978) which stated that "... Local Authorities should not in the

             normal course find it necessary to charge fees representing more than 17
                                                                                >
             man/days work      .   This statement is in relation to charging fees for the

             grant of Safety Certificates and is a clear indication that from the point

             of view of the Home Secretary, even the work prior to Certification which

             the Council would need to carry out should not exceed the rather limited

             17 man/days.    It should be noted that Home Office Circular 72/1987

             (Docoaent 4, page 37) indicated that inspections are not expected to take

             more than about 2 man/days per ground on average.     It seems to me that far

             more than 2 man days per ground are required.


    83.      It is, in my opinion, vitally important that a licensing authority should,

             whilst arranging adequate systems of communication, also be completely

             independent of licensees themselves.     Such independence is crucial in

             order that the Authority can form properly balanced views which are based

             on adequate information and which are not unduly influenced by the view of

             licensees themselves.     I should emphasise once again, however, that

             licensees have a part to play in discussions but decisions finally rest

             with the Authority.     Carefully maintained independence also tends to breed

             objectivity whereas inter-dependence (i.e.     relationships which become too



HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                    -25-


             close) tend to obscure it.     In the area of public safety, independence

             must be maintained.


    84.      In March/April, 1986, having formed the tentative views I have set out

             above, I then decided to see exactly how the system worked in practice.        I

             had no wish to interfere with what appeared to be a smoothly running

             system unless significant factors emerged which required immediate

             attention.


    85.      In relation to the administrative system, the matter was first considered

             by the Council on 3rd March, 1986 (Document 24, page 122) when all powers

             and duties under the Act were delegated to the General Purposes Panel and

             various powers were then delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

             Department (paragraph 44).     A further report was considered on 6th May,

             1986 (Document 25, pages 123-127) when it was agreed that the old system

             should continue for the time being and that the certificate conditions

             should be reviewed.     Finally, at its meeting on 7th September, 1987

             (Document 26, page 128—130) the current administrative system was approved

             (paragraph 46 to 53).


    86.      The inspections in 1986 followed the pattern of the previous County

             Council inspections where Officers of the Working Party accompanied a Club

             representative around the sports ground over a period of possibly two

             hours.   Two things struck me about these inspections.    The first was that

             they were not particularly efficient as Officers representing the various

             disciplines were not all interested in the same items and therefore much

             time was wasted while discussions took place between a particular

             specialist and the Club.     Secondly, the lead appeared to be taken by the

             Club in directing the inspection.     I am quite sure that if officers had

             said that they wished to visit a particular area of the sports ground or

             to take more time with their inspection this would have been allowed by

             the Club.    There is no suggestion that the Club or its representatives


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -26-


             either attempted or intended to control the areas of the sports ground

             which the officers visited.


   87o       However, during the 1987 and 1988 inspections of the sports grounds, I

             attempted to encourage Officers to feel free to visit all parts of the

             sports grounds and gradually this did indeed happen.     I recall that

             initially the Clubs were perhaps somewhat concerned about this move as

             were some of the officers, but its value has been demonstrated several

             times.   For example, during the 1987 inspection of one of the sports

             grounds in Sheffield it was discovered that there was an accumulation of

             combustible material beneath a wooden stand.    This situation was dealt

             with most promptly by the Club concerned in consultation with the relevant

             officers.


    88.      One of my suggestions was to involve officers of the Council's Health and

             Consumer Services Department in the Safety of Sports Grounds System.     This

             stemmed from recommendation 9 in the Popplewell Report which related to

             the Health and Safety experts.     I recognised that unlike other similar

             licensing systems (for example, public entertainments, theatres and

             cinemas), there was no input in the old County Council system from

             appropriately qualified Health and Safety experts.     There were some

             resistance to the idea of their inclusion, but I believe that their

             contributions have been and will continue to be most valuable.


    89.      Obviously, any system can be improved in the light of experience but I

             believe that any serious safety problem would be discovered and dealt with

             under the current system.     In the light of the tragic events at

             Hillsborough and with the benefit of the Inquiry report these issues will

             be reconsidered.


                                     The role of the Home Office

    90.      The Home Office is the Central Government Department which is responsible

             for safety of sports grounds.     Its functions can be described in brief as

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                      -27-




             follows:

             (a)   To advise Parliament on legislation;

             (b)   To issue circulars informing interested persons about legislation
                   and to offer guidance;

             (c)   To issue Statutory guidance (for example, in relation to

                    The Certificating Authority's response to the Bradford Disaster
                                      and the Popplewell Report

    91.      The South Yorkshire County Council issued a press release on 10th May,

             1985 (Document 29, page 135) outlining the certification system in

,            operation throughout the County.      The press release went on to say that

             the forthcoming "Summer" inspections will take into account the lessons of

             the recent tragic event at Bradford and any revised advice and

             requirements which may be issued by the Home Office.      On 13th May, 1985

             the South Yorkshire County Council sent a letter to the Secretary of

             Sheffield Wednesday (Document 30, page 136) enclosing a copy of the press

             release and stressing that it is vital necessity for safety stewards to be

             fully aware of and trained in their duties on the manning and opening of

             doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire fighting

             equipment.


    92.      The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again to Sheffield Wednesday on

             9th August, 1985 (Document 31, pages 137-138) indicating that the Interim

             Report of the Popplewell Inquiry had been produced and advice had been

             received from the Home Office.       The letter drew attention to a review of

             the evacuation procedures in consultation with the Police and the F$rf

             Service and also to the duties of safety stewards.       It also indicated that

             the Police and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in these
                                              \

             matters.     Detailed comments wet^ also made about the first aid facilities
                                                             "

             at the stadium and the requirements of the Certificate in respect of them.

             There was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

             materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently

             displayed.   The Club responded (Document 32, page 139) to the County

             Council's letter of 14th August 1985 and comments were made about steward

              training procedures.


    93.      The Sheffield City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday on 15th October,

             1987 (Document 33, page 140) referring to the revised Green Guide which

             had been published by H.     M.   Government following the Popplewell Report

             drawing attention to the new Guide and     particularly toChapter 2, which is

             entitled "Management Responsibility".      The letter asks Sheffield Wednesday

             to confirm in writing that the Club intends to retain a copy of the

             revised Green Guide on the premises and that they should take immediate

             steps to appoint a safety officer as defined in Chapter 2.      The Club

             responded to that letter on 23rd October, 1987 (Document 34, page 141) and

             Mr.   Mackrell stated "I confirm that I do have a copy of the Guide to

             Safety at Sports Grounds — 1986 edition and have had such for many months.

             With regard to the appointment of a Safety Officer, my duties encompass

             those of the Safety Officer and I would be grateful if you could amend

             your records to note that I am responsible for all matters of safety

             within the ground".


                                          The Semi-Final in 1981

    94.      On 7th April, 1981 the Officer Working     Party (Document 35, pages 142-143)

             inspected the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium, bearing in mind that an F.A.

             Cup Semi-Final was to take place on 11th April, 1981.


    95.      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club wrote to the County Council on     15th

             April, 1981 (Document 36, pages 144-145) outlining an incident which took

             place at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at the Semi-Final Match on

             11th April, that year.     It is noted that there were injuries to spectators

             because of crushing.     The Club goes on to say that from its enquiries it


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -29-



             appears that the crushing was caused by Tottenham supporters arriving late

             due to travelling problems and rushing to their places after the game had

             commenced, thereby causing problems to spectators at the front of the

             terracing who had been in the ground for a considerable length of time.

             The turnstile readings indicated 335 persons in excess of the

             capacity for Leppings Lane end which was the result of Tottenham fans

             having purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival at turnstile

             'N' (in Penistone Road) which was the Wolverhampton standing area, were

             directed by the Police to the other end of the ground where Tottenham fans

             were standing.   Apparently, 30 spectators were treated by St. John

             Ambulance for minor ailments and 8 spectators were treated at the Royal

             Hallamshire and Northern General Hospitals.     According to the Police,

             three people had broken limbs, one had head grazing and another had

             unspecified injuries.    The Club finally commented that the crowd behaviour

             both inside and outside the stadium was very good.


    96.      On 22nd April, 1981 the Chief Executive of the County Council wrote

             (Document 37, page 146) to the Police asking for a copy of their report on

             the Semi-Final incident.


    97.      Mr. Brownlow, the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, wrote to the

             Secretary of the Football Association on 3rd June, 1981 (Document 38,

             pages 147-148) commenting in detail on the incident at the match on 11th

             April.   The Chief Constable starts by noting the basic facts relating to

             the stadium and indicating that there had been many similar Semi-Final

             matches at Hillsborough without previous incident.     The Police apparently

             envisaged difficulties prior to the match because both sets of supporters

             would need to use the Ml motorway.    There were a number of problems which

             slowed dowii the arrival of spectators, namely a major road accident, a

             coach breaking down and extensive road works.     These resulted in Tottenham

             Hotspur fans being held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes.     This all

             resulted in " . . .     a sudden influx of large numbers of football

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                    -30-


             supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the start of

             the match .    .


    98.      Mr. Brownlow went on to indicate that Tottenham Hotspur supporters managed

             to obtain tickets from Wolverhampton.     He noted that this completely

             defeated the spectator policy which places the largest groups of standing

             supporters at opposite ends of the football ground.     Apparently, neither

             participating football club told the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield

             Wednesday, or the Football Association about this situation and the mixing

             of supporters was not properly catered for.     Some 400 Tottenham fans had

             to be removed from the kop and accommodated in the Leppings Lane end.


    99.      According to Mr. Brownlow the Tottenham Hotspur fans who had arrived early

             took up advantageous viewing points and refused to move to the centre of

             the Leppings Lane enclosure ". . . thereby creating a jamming effect at

             the extremeties of it . . ."   The late arrivals then caused a problem

             because they rushed forward immediately upon entering after Tottenham

             Hotspur had scored an early goal.    The resulting injuries included broken

             arms, legs and crushed ribs.    It is noted that some 38 people received

             treatment.    The pitch perimeter gates at the front of the Leppings Lane

             enclosure were opened and spectators were allowed to go on to the

             perimeter track to relieve pressure.    Police Officers also refused access

             to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to get in, in view of

             the crushing problem.   In Mr. Brownlow's view, no other course of action

             could have been adopted in the interests of public safety.


   100.      Mr. Brownlow does note that the circumstances he outlines in the letter

             had been discussed at length and would be borne in mind in planning other

             similar events.

                      The installation of, and alterations to, the radial fences
                                     on the Leppings Lane terrace


             The 1981 Proposals

   101.      Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 2nd September,

             1981 (Docvaent 39, pages 149-150) indicating that ".     .   .   we have been

             instructed by the Club to organise the installation of two radial fences

             on the terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground .      .   .".   It was

             noted that the intention of these fences was to divide the terrace into

             approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance.        The

             object of dividing the terrace was to exercise more control over

             supporters and for example, a visiting team with only a few followers

             would be allocated one section with the other two sections retained for

             home supporters.     A 1.15 metre wide gate was proposed at the rear of each

             fence, to give access for maintenance and also policing during the game.

             The gates could be left open, but fastened back to connect the areas

             during the game if appropriate.     In order to preserve spectators' views

             Eastwoods recommended that the top of the fence should be approximately

             1680 mm above the terrace.     It was noted that a fence of this height would

             not prevent individual spectators from climbing the fence, but it should

             eliminate a mass "invasion" from one area to another.     Apparently, fences

             of this height worked successfully at St.    James' Park (the Newcastle

             United ground).    The plans referred to in the letter are 3563/1 and 3563/2

             and 3.


   102.      On 9th September, 1981 (Docuaent 40, page 51) Eastwoods wrote to the

             County Council indicating that radial barrier work is likely to begin in

             early October, subject to their being no objections from the Council.

             Eastwoods indicated that major changes to the proposed scheme should be

             received by 23rd September.


   103.      The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 11th September 1981 (Docuaent

             41, page 152) considered the question of the proposed new radial barriers

HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -32-


             on the west terrace.     It was noted that there were drawbacks to the

             division of the terrace into approximately three equal areas, but the

             Working Party felt that increased control on the terrace should result.           A

             "for instance" was quoted in that there could well be problems with

             opposing fans mixing at the rear of the west stand and/or the final exit

             gates, but the Police considered that they could cope with these

             ■problems.


  104.       The adequacy and positioning of the gates at the rear of the radial

             barriers was discussed as well as the use of the existing gates in the

             pitch perimeter fence.     It was noted that the plans did not indicate the

             headroom which would be available at the rear of the terrace should the

             radial barriers and gates be installed.       Hie Working Party agreed that

             there was no objection to the proposals subject to further calculations as

             required by the Building Authority being satisfactory, confirmation of

             adequate headroom at the rear of the terrace and those gates being under

             Police control.   The County Council wrote to Eastwoods confirming the

             Working Party views on 14th September (Document 42, pages 154-155).         In a

             letter of 14th December, Eastwoods indicated that the works were now

             substantially complete (Document 43, page 156).


   105.      The South Yorkshire Police wrote (Document 44, pages 157-158) to the

             County Council on 18th January, 1982 about, amongst other things, the new

             radial fencing at Leppings Lane.     It is confirmed in the letter that the

             fences are working well.     It is commented that since there have been no

             games resulting in the whole of the terracing being occupied by one group

             of fans, the Police are unable to comment in that respect, but they

             foresee no problems.     The Chief Constable goes on to say that as existing

             barrier rails have been extended up to and completely through the new

             radial fencing, fans could climb over from one pen to another.         Also, it

             was noted that there were some ".     .   .   dangerous pieces .   .   ."

             protruding from the cut off ends of some barrier rails.       The County

HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -33-


             Council wrote (Document 45, page 159)     to Eastwood and Partners indicating

             that the radial fences appear to be working satisfactory and also

             outlining the Police views on them.     Messrs.   Eastwood and Partners wrote

             back to the County Council on 26th January, 1982 (Document 46, pages

             161-163) accepting the possibility that fans could climb over the radial

             fence, but stating that it would be unacceptable to leave a gap al.ong side

             each radial fence completely free of crush barriers as that would present

             a major hazard.   The Police comment on the dangerous pieces of rails is

             noted.


   06.       At an Officer Working Party meeting on 4th February, 1982 (Document 47,

             page 164) the Police views on the barriers was again discussed.      It was

             however, agreed that the existing arrangement was, on balance, preferable

             from a safety point of view to prevent crowd surge.      It was agreed to

             review the issue at the end of the current season.


             The 1985 Proposals

  107.       Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 9th April, 1985

             (Document 48, page 167) indicating that the Club was anxious to segregate

             visiting teams' supporters as they entered the ground and also to enable

             the Police to control their exit at the end of the game.      A scheme showing

             a possible modification to the Leppings Lane end was prepared and shown on

             drawing 6705/2 which involved the construction the two new banks      of

             turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates.


  108.       The Officer Working Party considered    these plans on 18th April

             1985 (Document 49, pages 168-169). They were agreed, subject to a number

             of conditions.


   109.      Particular reference was made by the Working Party to the inclusion of two

             gates in the new central radial fence and a second gate      in theradial

             fence dividing the neutral area and home supporters.

  HO.        On 30th April, 1985 (Document 50, page 170) the Fire Service wrote to the

             County Council indicating that from a means of escape point of view, the

             scheme was satisfactory, providing the gates had minimum widths as

             indicated on the plan enclosed with the letter.     Hie Fire Service also

             stated that it was understood that these gates will be supervised either

             by the Police or Club officials.     The County Council on 2nd May

             transmitted its views to Messrs.    Eastwood & Partners by letter.

             (Docuaent 51, pages 171-172).


  111.       Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 8th May

             1985 (Docuaent 52, page 173) and indicated that several of the points made

             had already been incorporated into the latest scheme.     Eastwoods say in

             the letter:- ".   .   .   However I would ask that further consideration
                                                                                        }
             should be given to the request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a

             second gate to be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial

             barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.     If these gates are

             meant for use in emergency it would mean having a steward in attendance on

             each occasion, the expense of which would hardly be justified.       It is our

             view that in the event of emergency, spectators can be evacuated quickly

             enough by the gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the

             rear.   We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the Fire

             Officer's staff should you so wish .     .   ."


   112.      The County Council sent a letter to Eastwoods on 10th May, 1985 (Docuaent

             53, page 174) indicating that the Police were prepared to concede the

             request for two gates per radial fence in the right hand area of the

             Leppings Lane End Terrace, provided that the remainder of the points

             raised by the Officer Working Party were incorporated.


   113.       Subsequently, Eastwood & Partners submitted a further detailed proposal

              for a revised layout of the Leppings Lane end and related works on 25th

             July 1985 (Document 54, pages 175-176). Fourteen plans were included in


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -35-


             the submission and it was considered by a meeting of the Officer Working

             Party on 29th July 1985 (Document 55, pages 177-178). Hie Working Party

             accepted the proposals in principle, but made a number of comments which

             were transmitted to the Consulting Engineers by a letter of 30th July

             (Document 56, pages 179-180). The comments were made by reference to the

             plans submitted

             "(a)   Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress
                    purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

             "(b)   Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by turnstile 23 to be either
                    shortened or realigned so as to maintain the exit width between the
                    outer (river) wall and turnstile 23, and the exit width between
                    turnstile 16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of
                    the roller shutter gate between turnstiles 16 and 17";

             "(f)   Plan No. 6705/12 -   . . . no objection in principle, but no barrier
                    height indicated .   . .";

             "(i)   Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
                    purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

                    Stewarding of new gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
                    1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
                    stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained".


   114.      Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 1st August (Document

             57, pages 181-182) and indicated that it might be easier for discussions

             to take place when the works are under construction.     Eastwoods' letter

             made the following comment on (a) above "We are not sure of the location

             on the West terrace of the proposed extra security gate.      There is already

             a gate in the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the

             police.   This same gate will still be available for the spectators in

             emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace which will

             be under the control of the police.     Hiis point may perhaps be clarified

             during the Working Party's visit on 7th August".     It is also noted in the

             letter that the stewarding would "...    no doubt be taken care of by Mr.

             Chester ..." (the Sheffield Wednesday Club Secretary at that time).      A

             copy of the letter was sent to Mr.    Chester by Eastwoods.

   115.      The Officer Working Party visited Hillsborough on    7th August 1985

             (Document 58, pages 183— 184) and noted the progress of works to segregate

             supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the ground    and on the terrace.     The

             note states "On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an

             existing gate in the new 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for

             use by the Police.    This gate would still be available for the use of

             spectators in an emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under

             the control of the Police would enable spectators to be directed down the

             2m wide gap.    However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be

             required.     It was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the

             new South Central Terrace Pen."    The Working Party agreed "(b) that the

             existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be extended or

             have steps to provide easier access from the new two metre wide gap formed

             by the new radial fence; (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence

             should be provided from the south central terrace pen".     There are several

             other comments about general matters in the west terrace.


   116.      At a meeting at the Police Sports and Social Club    at Niagra, Sheffield,

             the Officer Working Party on 13th November 1985 (Document 59, page 187)

             considered the Club's proposals in relation to various projects at the

             stadium.    It was also noted that the Police reported on the continuing

             problems caused by the merging of spectators at the Leppings Lane end of

             the ground.    The Working Party noted that it was difficult to see how this

             could be overcome as the physical restraints to achieve this could

             conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present situation to

             continue.


   117.      When Eastwoods were notified of these problems by the County Council in a

             letter of 14th November 1985 (Document 60, page 190)     in a response dated

             29th November, 1985 (Document 85, page 268) it was stated that they found

             it very difficult to envisage anything more which could be done at



HB5AAC/JJJ

              reasonable expense, as major work had been undertaken during the last

              close season.


   118.       The Officer Working Party at its inspection of Sheffield Wednesday on 22nd

              January, 1986 (Document 61, page 193) next considered the segregation

              arrangements at the Leppings Lane end.        The Police confirmed that the new

              arrangements worked well on by far the majority of occasions.        Other minor

              matters were referred to in relation to advertising hoardings, spalling

              concrete and the north west terrace.


              Other references to the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium 1980 to 1988

              1980


       119.   On 11th September, 1980 a report from Dr. Eastwood as to an inspection of
   i


              the Hillsborough Football Stadium indicates that in the north west corner

              of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks which have grown more

              pronounced in the past year. The recommendation is that the cracks should

              be sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.        (Document 62, pages

              194-195).


              1981

       120.   On 10th February, 1981 the Officer Working Party met (Document 63, pages

              196— 198) to inspect the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.      It was noted that

              the Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the

              concrete at the north west terrace, which would be considered shortly.

              The Working Party also heard the Club outline the consideration it was

              giving to the siting of caravans outside the Penistone Road and Leppings

              Lane ends of the ground to sell tickets.       It was hoped that if this took

              place, increased entry flow of spectators to the ground would result by

              reducing delays at the turnstiles;


       121.   On 7th April, 1981 (Document 35, page 143) the Working Party noted that
                                               \

              the cracking of the concreting at^the north west terrace had been attended

                                                   -38-


             to by injecting material from the top.       The results had been satisfactory,

             except in two small areas where water seepage had taken place and

             they were to receive further attention.


    122.     The next entry on the file relates to a visit of the Officer Working Party

             to Hillsborough on 8th June, 1981 (Document 64, page 200) at which some

             water seepage was again noted at the north west terrace.       There was also a

             note that the tie bars through the upper level concrete area to the rear

             had been protectively wrapped.


             1982                                                          -   ..... ...— -..

   123.      The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 24th August, 1982 (Document 65

             pages 201-203) and a letter from Messrs.      Eastwood & Partners of 27th

             August, 1982 (Document 66, page 204) deal with some minor problems which

             did not apparently involve visitor spectators in the concrete at the north

             west terrace.   Similar problems were alluded to on 21st February, 1983 at

             a Working Party meeting.    (Document 67, page 206) On 8th September, 1982,

             Eastwoods submitted a certificate relating to their annual inspection of

             the Hillsborough Stadium (Document 68, pages 208-209) and it was noted

             that the two radial fences had been installed on the Leppings Lane

             terrace.


             1983

   124.      The fact that the crush barriers on the Leppings Lane terrace had been

             tested was noted by the Officer Working Party on 11th August, 1983

             (Document 69, pages 210-213) which testing had completed the first cycle

             of crush barrier testing at the stadium.      There was also mention of water

             seepage again at the north west terrace.      On 29th August, 1983 (Document

             70, pages 214-215).   Dr.   Eastwood copied a letter to the County Council

             confirming the testing of crush barriers at the Leppings Lane End of the

             ground and amongst other things, certified that in his opinion "...         the

             various structures on the ground are in a satisfactory condition and are


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -39-


             appropriate for the stadium to be used to the full capacity laid down in

             the Certificate of Ground Safety..."


             1984

   125.      The former A.R.P.    building adjacent to the boundary wall (near to Gate

             'C') of the Leppings Lane entrances to the stadium was in the process of

             being demolished when the Officer Working Party visited the stadium on

             29th February, 1984 (Document 71, pages 216-217). Once again, water

             seepage was noted on that day at the north west terrace.     In June, 1984

             the crush barriers at the north west corner were tested by the Club's

             Consulting Engineers (Eastwood & Partners) (Document 72, page 218 and

             Document 73, pages 219-228).


    126.     It was noted that there was some cracked brickwork at the rear of the west

             stand and that there were damaged     angled supportbrackets to the pitchside

             security fence at the front of the     Leppings Laneterrace, at an Officer

             Working Party inspection of the stadium on 9th August, 1984 (Document 74,

             page 229).   It was also noted that    the wire mesh barriers on the north

             west terrace had been successfully test loaded.

             1985

     127.    There was some discussion at an Officer Working Party meeting on 23rd

             January, 1985 (Document 75, pages 232-233) about the segregation of home

             and visiting supporters at the rear of the west stand at certain matches

             by erecting temporary barriers.     It was noted that it was the policy of

             the Police to aim for the exclusive use by visiting supporters of the west

             stand and terrace.     The Working Party agreed that the Club would consider

             a scheme for permanent barriers at the rear of the stand subject to the

             necessary approvals.     It was also noted that the cracked brickwork

             previously mentioned should continue to be monitored and that the apparent

             rusting of steel columns at the rear of the stand should receive

             appropriate treatment.

             1986-1988

     128.    There are no other file references in respect of the Leppings Lane End of

             the sports ground other than those dealt with elsewhere in the statement.

             It should also be noted that inspections were taking place on a

             regular basis throughout this period.


                              Further Comments on the Certificating System

             Further comments

     129.    At the time the current Safety Certificate was issued, the terms and

             conditions contained therein were those thought by the South Yorkshire

             County Council on the advice of the various interested parties to be

             necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety of spectators at the

             sports ground.     There is no evidence from the files that the Certificate

             Holder or any other interested party has appealed to the Secretary of

             State (up to 1st January, 1988) or to a Magistrates' Court (thereafter) in

             respect of the Certificate Conditions.


     130.    Section 2(4) of the 1975 Act (as amended) states that the Safety

             Certificate must have attached to it a plan and the terms and conditions

             shall be framed by reference to it, where appropriate.       Paragraph 5 of the

             General Safety Certificate refers to plans.       Under Schedule 1 of the

             Certificate, the definition of plans is "document or documents attached to

             and forming part of the General Safety Certificate and signed by the

             person signing the Certificate ...".     When the files were handed over to

             the Sheffield City Council in April, 1986 a copy of the General Safety

             Certificate for Hillsborough was in an envelope, together with a number of

             plans, none of which were signed by Mr.       Mallett (the original signatory

             of the Certificate).    The original Safety Certificate and plans are lodged

             with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited (the Holder).


    131.     Under Section 3(3) of the 1975 Act applications for Certificates had to be

             copied to the Police and the Building Authority.       Sheffield Wednesday


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -41-


             applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September, 1978 (Document 6, pages

             45-48).   Copies of the application were sent to the Building Authority,

             the Police and the Fire Service on 13th September, 1978 (Document 76, page

             235, Document 77, page 236, Docuaent 78, page 237).        There was no formal

             notice issued by the County Council requiring the Holder to supply further

             information to enable it (the Council) to determine the terms and

             conditions of the Certificate.     The matter was dealt with in lengthy

             correspondence and by consultation.


    132.     The amendment and replacement of Certificates is governed by Section 4 of

             the 1975 Act (as amended) and the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations

             1976, which were superceded on 1st January, 1988 by the Safety of Sports

             Grounds Regulations 1987 (Docuaent 3, pages 30-35).


    133.     The 1975 Act (as amended) provides that a local authority may, if it feels

             it appropriate to do so, amend a Safety Certificate by notice in writing

             to its holder or replace it.     A Safety Certificate may be amended or

             replaced either with or without the application of the Holder of the

             Certificate.   Section 4(4) of the 1975 Act (as amended) indicates that a

             notice under Section 4(1)(a) amending a General Safety Certificate shall

             specify the date on which the amendment to which it relates is to come

             into operation, and the date so specified may be a date later than the

             date of issue of the notice.     The Regulations make further provision with

             regard to the amendment of the Certificates.       Regulation 5 provides that

             where a local authority issues or amends a Certificate it shall as soon as

             practicable give notice in writing of the issue or amendment . . .          to

             every interested party.   In addition, the local authority in giving

             notices must inform the persons to whom notice is given that a copy of the

             Safety Certificate and the application may be inspected and where and at

             what time such inspection may be made.        In addition, the local authority

             must publish a notice in a newspaper as soon as maybe after the

             decision including certain information.

                                        \


    134.     On 3rd September, 1981 the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee

             resolved to amend the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club General Safety

             Certificate by replacing Conditions 10 and 26 of the Safety Certificate.

             The amended Condition 10 contains slight wording differences to the

             original.   Condition 26 varied the time limits in relation to

             electrical certificates.   There is no evidence from the file that these

             revised conditions were in fact properly brought into effect.


    135.     At a meeting on 21st August, 1986 (Document 79, pages 238-239) the City

             Council's General Purposes Panel resolved to amend the capacity of the

             Spion Kop at Sheffield Wednesday to 21,000 spectators.    The Panel agreed

             to amend the Certificate subject to a number of conditions, one of

             which related to temporary additional stewarding to be provided until

             certain works on crush barriers on the new Spion Kop were completed.      This

             condition related to two matches.   The amendment to the Certificate only

             affected the capacity at the Spion Kop end of the ground.    The Inquiry has

             prompted a review of this amendment and it transpires that no notice was

             inserted in a newspaper in connection with this amendment.    The Panel's

             deliberations attracted considerable publicity and copy of a report in the

             'Star' newspaper of Friday, 22nd August, 1986, is attached to this

             Statement (Document 80, page 240). Additionally, the General Safety

             Certificate is regarded as a public document and therefore the spirit of

             the legislation has been met.


    136.     On 1st December, 1986 the General Purposes Panel resolved (Document 81,

             page 241) to amend Schedule 1 of the Certificate so as to extend the

             definition of specified activity to include Royal visits.    Again, the

             notice provisions of the legislation were not observed.


    137.     Under Section 5 of the 1975 Act (as amended) interested parties may appeal

             against or about the terms and conditions in a Certificate and the




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -43-


             Council's refusal to amend or replace it.   According to the files, there

             have been no appeals.


    138.     Under Section 8 of the 1975 Act (as amended), the Certificate Holder must

             give notice to the Council if he intends to alter or extend the sports

             ground or any of its installations (if that alteration or extension is

             likely to affect the safety of persons at the ground).        To the best of my

             knowledge, this Section has been complied with by Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club; the developments which have taken place have been the

             subject of lengthy correspondence in each case.
                                                                      I.




    139.     The Council as Certificating Authority may issue a Prohibition Notice

             under Section 10 of the Act if it feels there is a serious risk to

             spectator safety.   No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of

             Sheffield Wednesday.


    140.     It is the duty of the Council under Section 10B(1) of the Act to arrange

             for the inspection of stadia at least once every 12 months.       At its

             meeting on 7th September, 1987 (Document 26, pages 128-130) the General

             Purposes Panel noted the details contained in a report by the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department about the operation of the Council's

             certification function for the safety of sports grounds.       One of the

             details mentioned in the report relates to inspections and the proposal

             that one large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out.          In

             fact the report itself does not make clear my intention that these

             inspections should be annual.   My intention at the time, and the Council's

             practice since has been to arrange annual inspections of sports grounds.

             The report goes on to indicate that these inspections would be backed up

             by a series of "during event" inspections which proposal was in line with

             both the Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other areas.           I

             am aware that the Fire Service visit the sports ground during events and

             of course the Police are present during most specified activities.

             The Safety Certificate

    141.     Under Condition 1(1) of the Safety Certificate, the Holder's nominee must

             be approved in writing by the Council.


    142.     Currently, the nominee is the Club Secretary.    On the 15th October, 1987,

             the City Council wrote (Document 33, page 140) to Sheffield Wednesday

             pointing out various provisions of the new Green Guide and making

             particular reference to the appointment of a Safety Officer as defined in

             Chapter 2 of'the Guide.    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic responded

             to this letter on 23rd October (Document 34, page 141) and confirmed that

             Mr.   Mackrell's duties encompassed those of the Safety Officer and

             requesting that the Council's records    be amended to note that he is

             responsible for all matters    of safety within the ground.


    143.     Under Condition 8(1) of the Certificate the Holder is required to provide

             and maintain at the sports ground, to the satisfaction of the Council, a

             suitably equipped first aid room.   The first aid room was installed and

             noted by the Officer Working Party to be in use on 21st February, 1983

             (Document 67, page 207).   The question of first aid facilities was raised

             and discussed during 1987 and 1988 (Document 28, page 134 and Document 82,

             pages 243-244).

             Sheffield Wednesday - The Up to Date Position

    144.     On Wednesday, 10th May, 1989 the pre-planned annual inspection of the

             ground commenced involving Police Officers, Fire Officers and Council

             Officers from the Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building

             Surveyor's Division and theAdministration and Legal Department.      Detailed

             enquiries are being made of    Sheffield Wednesday pursuant to the

             inspection.

                                       FURTHER GENERAL COMMENTS


             General Safety Certificate Conditions

   145.      A copy of the Safety Certificate and the Conditions which form part of it

             is attached to this Statement (Document 19, pages 103-112).      There are

             some 31 terms and conditions contained in Schedule 2 to the Certificate.

             The Holder is required to comply with various terms and conditions

             to the satisfaction of the Council, the Fire Officer or the Chief

             Constable as provided for in the particular condition.    Generally, for

             monitoring the ground the Council relies on annual inspections, during

             activity inspections and being notified by, for example, the Club of any

             proposed development or the Police (as they are present during most

             specified activities) of any matter which causes them concern.     In

             addition, following the Home Office Circular 72/1987 (Document 4, pages

             36-43) the Council would (where practicable) obtain copies of relevant

             certificates of testing, etc.   on annual inspection.    I set out below my

             comments on certain of the conditions.


             Condition 3

   146.      This condition relates to the number of spectators who may be admitted to

             the various areas of the Stadium.   These restrictions on the numbers of

             spectators admitted to the Stadium are also referred to as capacities.


   147.      At the 1989 inspection a sample of the turnstile records was obtained.        It

             is understood that these records are available from the Club for past

             events.   There is reference on the file to individuals obtaining access to

             the ground with forged tickets (Document 38, page 148) and reference to

             numbers of people with tickets for the "opposing" end of the ground being

             removed to "their" end of the ground (Document 38, pages 147-148).      There

             is no evidence on file to suggest that the Club deliberately allow more

             people into the ground than is provided for in the certificate.

             Paragraphs 27-29, 31, 34 and 95 of my Statement refer to capacity on the


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -46-


             Leppings Lane Terrace and there are other references to capacities on the

             Spion Kop.    There have been no amendments to spectator capacities in

             respect of any part of the ground since the Spion Kop development in

             1986.


   148.      Questions have been raised about the adjustment to capacities in relation

             to the alterations to the Directors' Box in the South Stand and also in

             relation to the incorporation of facilities for people with disabilities

             in the North Stand.     There is no reference on file about any changes to

             the Directors' Box on the South Stand.        At no time during the discussions

             in relation to the new facilities for the disabled was any mention made of

             changes in capacity for the north stand.        Had the question of capacity

             been an issue I would have expected the Advisory Group members to raise

             it.


             Condition 8

   149.      This Condition relates to first aid facilities and associated matters.


   150.      The County Council, in 1979, approached the Area Health Authority for

             advice on first aid facilities at Sheffield Wednesday.        The Area Health

             Authority responded on 31st May, 1979 (Document 87, pages 271-273) with a

             list of requirements.     References are made in the list to two or three

             treatment couches; six stretchers, two sets of stretcher wheels, 20

             blankets, six pillows and one "minute man" resuscitator.        Other comments

             are made about water requirements, lighting, etc.       On 15th August, 1979

             (Document 16, pages 93-95) the Officer Working Party requested the Club to

             provide a permanent first aid structure during the 1980 close season,

             subject to the Club agreeing to provide the recommended first aid

             equipment immediately.


   151.      On 21st December, 1979 (Document 88, page 274) the County Council wrote to

             Sheffield Wednesday indicating that the existing first aid facilities were

             accepted on an interim basis only pending the erection of purpose built

HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -47-


             facilites in the 1980 close season.     On 20th April, 1982 (Document 89,

             pages 276-277) the County Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday following

             an Officer Working Party meeting at which the Club's outline drawing for

             new Police and first aid facilities was considered.     As far as the first

             aid facilities were concerned, four comments were made in particular:-

               (a)   The walls of the first aid room should be lined with a suitable
                     non-combustible and easily cleaned material, which would not need to
                     be redecorated.

               (b)   Lockable storage facilities for blankets, stretchers, etc. were to be
                     provided.

               (c)   A telephone point was to be provided in the first aid room.

               (d)   The floor was to be of easily cleanable material (such as quarry
                     tiles, etc.)


   152.      The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 21st February, 1983

             (Docuaent 67, page 207) noted that the new Police and first aid facilities

             under the north stand had been welcomed by the users and were proving to

             be most useful.


   153.      Following the interim Popplewell report, the County Council wrote to

             Sheffield Wednesday on 9th August, 1985 (Document 31, page 138) and drew

             attention to the necessity of providing adequate first aid and first aid

             room facilities.   Attention was also drawn to Condition 8 of the Safety

             Certificate.   In December, 1987 (Document 90, page 278 and Document 28,

             page 134) the City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday in response to the

             annual inspection which took place on 6th August, 1987.      It was noted on a

             schedule attached to the notification letter to Sheffield Wednesday that

             "The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate first aid

             equipment for the treatment of spectators .     .   ." It was also mentioned

             that the provision of qualified first aiders was being reviewed and the
                                                   VC-,
             views of the Club on this subject were sought.


   154.      In a letter dated 15th January, 1988 (Document 82, pages 243-244) Messrs.

             Eastwood & Partners responded to th^Council's comments and noted the


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -48-


             views expressed on first aid equipment.     They went on to say that the Club

             regularly liaise with St.   John Ambulance about manning levels and a

             sufficient number of first aiders is provided for each game in line with

             the recommendations given by the football league.


   155.      The Green Guide deals with the question of first aid in paragraph 29

             (Management Responsibility).   Paragraph (x) is "to provide first aid

             facilities and first aid staff".


             Paragraphs 50 and 143 of my Statement also refer to first aid facilities.


             Condition 8(2) requires that during every specified activity a doctor

             shall be available to attend at the first aid room if required.


             Condition 8(3) relates to the number of first aid assistants required to

             be in attendance at specified activities and the condition states that

             there must be one first aid assistant for every 2,000 spectators.    Neither

             the County Council nor the City Council have varied that ratio.


             Condition 9

   156.      This condition relates to stewarding and makes particular reference to

             fitness and capability to carry out their duties, training and

             instruction, identifiable dress and written instructions as to their

             general duties.


             A schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities of safety stewards

             was handed to Club representatives on 10th April, 1980 at a meeting of the

             Officer Working Party (Document 98, page 302).


             At a meeting of the Officer Working Party on 13th November, 1985 (Document

             59, page 187) it was agreed that a draft booklet which had been prepared

             by the Police outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and

             that it should be distributed to designated grounds for the information

             and guidance of stewards employed there.    Factors peculiar to particular


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                     -49-


             grounds could of course be added if considered appropriate.

             Unfortunately, there is no copy of the booklet (which is identifiable as

              such) on the file.    The Police and the Fire Service are involved in annual

             briefing exercises for stewards and in addition there are tests of the

             emergency procedures which include the stewards duties.      I also understand

              that there are pre-match briefings of stewards.     There are two emergency

             evacuation procedure drills particularly referred to on the files; the

             first being mentioned at Paragraph 43 of my Statement.      This relates to a

              test on 4th October, 1983 by the Fire Service.     The Fire Service stated

              that " . . .   the stewards they questioned would have known what to do if

              this message had been heard . . ." (Document 21, page 118).


   157.      On 14th November, 1987 (Document 99, pages 305-306) the Police instigated

             a trial of the emergency evacuation procedure during a match and found

             there to be some deficiencies in the Public Address System which were

             subsequently reported to the Club.     Again, there is no comment that the

             stewards' responses were in any way inadequate.


   158.      Paragraphs 43, 91, 92, 111, 113, 114, 171 and 191 of my Statement refer        to

             stewarding.     There has been no concern recently expressed about stewarding

             at the Leppings Lane end of the sports ground, but the Building Surveyor

             did comment on the Spion Kop stewarding in a memorandum dated 2nd

             February, 1988 which was considered by the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Advisory Group on 23rd March, 1988.     It was indicated by the Police

             Representative at that meeting that the point had been taken up with

             Sheffield Wednesday.     Some records of steward training were produced at

             the 1989 inspection of the ground and further details are being obtained.


             "Condition 10

   159.      Condition 10 refers to the immediate and easy opening of final exit

             doors/gates, the manning of those doors/ gates by stewards and the opening

             of them at appropriate times.     The Police determine which doors/gates are

                                                      -50-


                 opened/closed on match days and no complaints have been received from the

                 Police or the Fire Service about this procedure.    Neither have there been

                 complaints about the manning of doors/gates by stewards.    The final exit

                 gates are subject to at least annual inspection by the Fire Service and

                 occasionally by the Building Surveyor.    Other references in my Statement

                 to the type of items covered by Condition 10 can be found at paragraphs

!
                 43, 92, 103, 110 and 134.



                 Condition 11(4)

I      160.      This Condition refers to the maintenance of all means of ingress to and
i
                 egress from the sports ground in good condition and free from obstruction.

                 Generally these routes are checked both on annual inspection and during

                 specified activities by the appropriate Advisory Group members.


                 Condition 15(1)

       161.      This Condition relates to the structural parts of the sports ground which

                 are required to be maintained in sound order and to the appropriate and

                 relevant standards in the Guide, and in all cases to the satisfaction of

                 the Council.


                 Presumably when the County Council issued the Safety Certificate to

                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd in December, 1979 it was satisfied

                 (subject to compliance with certain conditions) that this ground was

                 reasonably safe (Document 14, page 85).


                 Various structural parts of the sports ground are also checked on

                 inspection. It should be borne in mind that full structural surveys of

                 buildings at the sports ground is rarely practicable in- view of their

                 considerable size.   Separate consideration is, of course, given to

                 structural alterations at each sports ground as and when they are

                 proposed.




    HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -51-


    162.     Jfy Statement refers at some Considerable length to structural matters.


    163.     As far as the Leppings Lane Terrace is concerned, it was subject to a

             visual inspection by the Building Surveyor on the 1988 inspection.      The

             tunnel (connecting the Leppings Lane Terrace and the open area at the

             back of the West Stand) and the turnstile wall were inspected at that

             time.


             Condition 16

   164.      This Condition covers the maintenance of emergency equipment and the

             maintenance, repair or renewal of any items within the Stadium as may from

             time to time be necessary.   There is also a requirement to maintain the

             operational parts of the Stadium in good and efficient working order.      The

             matters covered by this Condition are generally dealt with on annual

             inspections and by during event visits where appropriate.


             Condition 18(2)

   165.      Emergency vehicle access routes are covered by this Condition.       The Fire

             Service has commented on 16th May, 1979 (Document 13, page 84) that

             adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct access

             can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of the

             stadium.   They also mentioned that it was necessary to ensure that parked

             vehicles would not obstruct this access.    I understand from this

             letter that the Fire Service only require vehicular access to the exterior

             of each building in the football ground.    The emergency access routes are

             shown on plan 1610/llA.   The Officer Working Party at a meeting on 12th

             November, 1979 (Document 18, page 101) agreed that whilst no real problems

             had occurred in the past the Club would in consultation with the Fire

             Service and the Police mark^out a lane from the main gates to the south

             stand in which parking would not be allowed.   It was also agreed that the

             hydrant outside the south stand would have to be kept clear.    The Police

             noted on 26th March, 1980 (Document 84, page 264) that they did not have


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -52-


             any current problems in respect of the access for emergency vehicles.

             Access for ambulances is referred to at Document 87, page 273 and Document

             86,. page 269.   The reference in Document 86 is set out in greater detail

             be low.


  166.       During the planning stage for the redevelopment of the kop, the Club

             offered (letter from Eastwoods 29th November, 1985 - Document 85, page

             268) to widen the gangway between the North Stand and the retaining wall

             of the kop to enable fire engines to get to the front of all stands.     The

             Fire Service responded to this at an Officer Working Party meeting (22nd

             January, 1986 - Document 61, page 193) by saying that whilst they felt

             that such a facility was not essential for their purposes it could be

             useful for use by emergency vehicles in certain situations and generally

             should be supported.     In a letter from Eastwoods dated 18th December, 1986

             (Document 86, pages 269-270) proposals were submitted for creating a new

             entrance to the Sports Hall off Penistone Road so that the public would no

             longer have to use gate 'O', (Plan numbers 7593/1 and 2).     Another purpose

             of the development was to provide separate access for Police vehicles,

             ambulances, etc.    on match days; the proposal effectively reduced dangers

             which could result from vehicles having to pass queueing spectators to
             gate
             'O'. This development did take place.


   167.      It is the responsibility of the Club to maintain these access routes, free

             of obstruction, and the emergency services have never indicated that there

             have been problems with them.     I would expect the Police (who are present

             during the majority of specified activities) to make appropriate comments

             should the need arise.


             I   understand that meetings have taken place between the Police, the Fire

             Service and the Ambulance Service on the emergency evacuation procedures

             at Sheffield Wednesday.     I assume those discussions dealt with the

                        emergency access of vehicles to the sports ground.     The City Council has

                        had no direct contact with the Ambulance Service on this matter.


                        Condition 24

      168.              This Condition relates to the engineers' annual inspection of the sports

                        ground.     There is no record of any copies of Certificates being submitted

                        in 1984-1987, but a copy of the 1988 Certificate (dated 2nd August 1988 -

                        Document 100, page 307) was submitted on 10th May, 1989.     Previous

                        Certificates were submitted for 1980 to 1983 - see Document 68, pages

                        208-209 and Document 70, pages 214-215 for examples.
                                                                                    t

                        Condition 28

      169.              This Condition prescribes the various records which need to be kept by the

                        Holder and produced to authorised officers on request.     The records kept

                        under Condition 28(1),(2) and (3) were checked on 10th May, 1989 and

                        subsequent enquiries about them are being made.     The checking of records

                        under Condition 28(4) is not practicable^     due to the wide ranging scope

                        of the condition.    However, all major work is inspected through specific

                        applications or inspections.

                        THE LAYOUT OF THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE
                        WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO PENS 3 AND 4

      170.              In the earlier part of my statement (see paragraphs 101-118) I refer to

                        the full history of discussions and decisions between the interested

                        parties (the Police, Fire Service, the Building Authority and the Club,

                        and its Consulting Engineers) leading up to and following the installation

                        of the radial fences on the Leppings Lane terrace.     It will be recalled

                        that the installation of fences took place in two distinct stages in 1981

                        and 1985.     In relation to the 1981 proposals it is clear from the

                        correspondence on file, which is particularly referred to in my statement,

                        that the fences were erected only after careful and thorough consideration

                        by the appropriately qualified experts.

   171.      In early 1985 the Club, via their Consulting Engineers, Messrs.

             Eastwoods & Partners, submitted proposals to alter the Leppings Lane end

             of the ground and to construct two new radial fences on the Leppings Lane

             terrace.   The reasons for the additional fences on the Leppings Lane

             terrace involved the better control of supporters.     Once again, full and

             careful consideration was given to the proposals by the County Council

             involving the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Authority, the Club

             and its Consulting Engineers.     Full details of the discussions dealing

             with the positioning, width and proposed stewarding of the gates in the

             radial fences are related in the earlier part of my statement.


   172.      As far as the Green Guide is concerned, paragraphs 101 to 103 (in

             Chapter 8) refer to the division of spectator accommodation.     These

             paragraphs of the Guide are drafted in general terms.     There is no

             evidence on the file to suggest that the penning arrangements at Leppings

             Lane conflict with the general statements contained in the Guide.

             Obviously, the pens were constructed over a number of years, and were

             installed and approved in that situation by all the interested parties I

             have already listed.


             Crush Barriers on the Leppings Lane Terrace
             Layout

   173.      The layout of the barriers was approved when the Certificate was issued on

             21st December, 1979.   The barrier layout must have been reviewed when the

             radial fences were installed in 1981 and 1985.


   174.      On 7th August, 1986, the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was subject

             to an annual inspection.     During the course of this annual inspection I

             recall that the Police representative requested that crush barrier number

             144 be reduced so that the persons entering the terrace from the tunnel

             would not be obstructed by it.    Apparently, there had been some

             difficulties in this area.     The barrier itself penetrated the central



HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -55-


             radial fence immediately in front of the tunnel.     The barrier was indeed

             reduced with the result that barrier 144 now contains only one section,

             that is in the north central pen (see plan 1610/64E).     This issue was

             considered at the time of the inspection in the presence of

             representatives from the Fire Authority, the Police, the Building

             Authority and Messrs.    Eastwood & Partners, the Club's Consulting

             Engineers.    No problems with this revised barrier arrangement have been

             brought to my attention.


   175.      I should, however, point out that no written record of the decision to

             reduce the barrier is noted on the file.     I can, however, say that I

             remember the discussion and that none of the persons present objected to

             the reduction of the barrier.


             Strength

   176.      As far as the strength of the barriers is concerned, they were tested

             by Messrs.    Eastwood & Partners on 14th, 15th, 18th and 19th July, 1988

             and the report (Document 83, pages 246-249) is attached to this statement.

             There were one or two defects discovered on the test which are noted in

             Eastwoods' letter which were remedied during 1988.    The barriers had also

             been tested in 1979 and 1983.


             Height

   177.      Prior to certification, it was brought to the attention of the Working

             Party (Document 9, page 66) that many of the barriers were below the

             height recommended in the Guide.    This was brought to the attention of the

             Club at a meeting on 2nd April, 1979 (Document 10, page 71), and was the

             subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building

             Surveyor.    As the ground was subsequently certificated by the County

             Council without requiring all the crush barriers to be replaced, I

             conclude that the Guide was applied flexibly as advised by the Home Office

             and that the Council were satisfied that the ground was reasonably safe.

             The Access Tunnel to the Leppings Lane Terrace

   178.      This tunnelwhich runs beneath the west terrace    is   not of a constant

             gradient and at   the end increases to a gradient of   1:6 on the approach   to

             the terrace itself.


   179.      The files in my possession indicate that there have been no

             discussions about the tunnel itself.     No complaints have been received

             about the tunnel.     As far as I am aware there have been no problems with

             the tunnel and as it has been used for many years by many thousands of

             spectators without apparent difficulty or incident.


             The Wall at   theLeppings Lane Turnstiles

   180.      The wall at   the turnstiles is approximately 14' high from ground level     to

             the coping stones and should prevent persons climbing into the ground in

             the majority of circumstances.


             Prohibition Notices in respect of Sheffield Wednesday

   181.      No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday as there was no indication that there was a serious risk to

             spectators warranting such action.     The Inquiry will be aware that since

             the tragic events at Hillsborough the Leppings Lane end of the ground has

             been largely closed and certainly no spectators have been admitted to the

             terrace or to the west stand.


   182.      On 25th April, 1989 a meeting was held between the Club and the various

             officers and it was agreed that the next two football matches would be

             postponed as the Leppings Lane end of the ground was closed which

             prevented the efficient segregation of spectators and emergency

             evacuation.   It was agreed that reserve matches could go ahead as they

             have a limited number of spectators.


   183.      On 2nd May, 1989 there was a meeting held to discuss future games and

             on 4th May, various officers visited the sports ground to look at the


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -57-


              proposed plans for segregation, admission and evacuation of spectators

              for football matches.    It was agreed that matches could go ahead using

              part of the Leppings Lane end, but not the terraces or the stand.            The

              Leppings Lane end remains closed and will not be used for the time being.

              If it appears necessary to do so, the Council will consider issuing a

              Prohibition Notice to prevent the opening of the west terrace prior to the

              interim report of the Inquiry, as extra works required at the ground may

              then be determined.


              The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987

   184.       Following the commencement of the Act, the existing delegations, etc.

              were felt to be sufficient and the matter was fully reviewed in a report

              to the General Purposes Panel in January, 1989.           The various delegations
          i



              were then restated as far as it was necessary to do so.           On receipt of

              Home Office Circulars 71/1987 (Document 2, pages 17-29) and 72/1987

              (Document 4, pages 36—43) were circulated to all members of the Advisory

              Group.


              The Safety Certificate

   185.       The original 1979 Certificate is still in force in respect of Sheffield

              Wednesday.   Amendments to it are dealt with by letter and do not as such

              feature in the body of the Certificate.           Amendments to the Safety

              Certificate are dealt with in paragraphs 133-136 of my Statement.


              Directional Signs in relation to access to the ground

   186.       There has been criticism about the adequacy of directional signs within

              the sports ground which would direct people to pens other than the two

              central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace.           The point has been made that

              fans entering through turnstiles A to 6: or Gate C could only see the

              tunnel which leads to the two central pens and no other signs.           There is

              in fact one small directional sign to the right of the west stand which
                                                     \

              says "standing".
                                                         \V .
                                                         V' ..     ■

   187.      It is appropriate to point out that spectator flow on match days is a

             matter on which the Council would need to take advice, from the

             Club and members of the Advisory Group.       There is no record on any of the

             files that there was any suggestion of inadequacy in signing arrangements

             for the terrace at Leppings Lane and had it been a significant factor I

             would have expected that the matter would have been raised.       The provision

             of signing is not usually a complex or expensive task.


             Means of egress onto the pitch from Leppings Lane Terrace

   188.      There is no clear record on the files as to when the pitch perimeter

             fence at Hillsborough was in fact installed, but it appears to have been

             in -place when the County Council first looked at the sports ground from

             the point of view of a Certificating Authority.


   189.      According to the files, the pitch perimeter gates at Leppings Lane were

             considered in 1985 when the second radial barrier development plan was

             submitted.     It was agreed by the Officer Working Party and the Club and

             its representatives that one pitch perimeter fence gate was to be provided

             per pen.     (Document 49, pages 168-169, Document 55, pages 177-178 and

             Document 58, pages 183-185).


   i90.      There is no information on the files relating to whether or not the

             pitch perimeter gates should be signed.


   191.      The means of access laterally between the pens on the Leppings Lane

             terrace are the gates at the top of each radial fence immediately adjacent

             to the west stand wall.    The gates are designed so that when they are

             open a clear 1.15 metre opening remains.      Manning of gates is dealt with

             in Document 50, page 170, Document 51, pages 171-172, Document 52,

             page 173, Document 53, page 174, Document 55, pages 177-178, Document 56,

             pages 179-180, Document 57, pages 181-182 and Document 58, pages 183-185.

   192.      There are no gangways as defined by the Guide on the Leppings Lane

             Terrace.   Annex 'A' of the Green Guide defines gangways as being channels

             for the passage of spectators througi a terrace running across the slope

             (lateral gangway) or running with the slope (radial gangway).   Paragraph

             96 of the Guide indicates that the aim should be to ensure that every

             spectator on the terrace is within 12 metres, of a gangway or exit so that

             they can move quickly on to exit routes at the end of an event or in the

             event of an emergency.


   i 93.     All the proposed major alterations to the terraces have been considered by

             the Working Party and therefore subject to full and careful consideration

             by the interested parties.

             of that body, in the case of a partner of a

       HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 71/1987
        FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987:-
        IMPLEMENTATION OF PART II (SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS)

        Introduction
        1.    As foreshadowed by HOC No 42/1987 the Secretary of State has
        now made a commencement order under section 50(2) of the Fire
        Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act)
        bringing in Part II of the 1987 Act with effect from 1 January
        1988.      - ---   — -- —      ^
       HT* This circular, together with Annex A, introduces the
        provisions of Part II of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the
        effects and operation of them. Advice on those provisions of
        Part I of the 1987 Act (fire safety) which are to be brought into
        force by the first commencement order is the subject of Fire
        Precautions Act Circular, 14/1987.
        Implementation of Part II (Safety of Sports Grounds)
        3.   Part II of the 1987 Act, consisting of sections 19 - 25,
        amends the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) in
        line with the Government's proposals contained in the
        Consultative Document published in June 1986 in response to the
        safety recommendations of the Popplewell Inquiry set up following
        the fire tragedy at Valley Parade on 11 May 1985. Tho main
        changes effected by Part II are as follows
        Section 19: - removes the distinction between sports '•ground*' and
        sports "stadium" with consequential modifications to section 2(2)
        of the 1975 Act dealing with the contents of safety certificates.
                                                                                   V /'v
        Section 20:- empowers the Secretary of State to vary the
        designation threshold of 10,000 under section 1 of the 1975 Act.
Section 21:- precludes'conditions in safety certificates
relating to police presence unless the extent of the presence is
reserved for the Chief Officer of Police.


Section 22:-   directs appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act to
the courts.

Sections 23 and 24:- replaces the existing emergency procedure
under section 10 by introducing prohibition notices in the case
of serious risks to spectators; and provision to appeal against
them.

Section 25:- places a duty on local authorities to enforce the
1975 Act and to arrange for annual inspections of designated
sports grounds in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of
State.

4.   Annexes A and B to Home Office circular No 7/1986 which
gives advice on the 1975 Act should be noted as necessary and
cross referenced to this circular. Particular attention is drawn
to the latest guidance on the new procedure for the issue of
prohibition notices to deal with serious risks to spectators.
Local authorities are asked to copy all such notices to the Home
Office for information until further notice. To assist local
authorities to draw up a prohibition notice a suggested format is
reproduced at Annex B to this circular.

Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1987

5.   A copy of the revised regulations is also enclosed with this
circular. The regulations reflect the changes brought about by
sections 22 and 24 of the 1987 Act and lay down time limits for
appeals. Provisions on procedures for applications for safety
certificates, their issue, amendment, transfer and replacement
are incorporated in the regulations which also authorise the
determination of fees to be charged in respect of applications
for the issue, amendment, transfer and replacement of safety
certificates.

Transitional

6.   Under the provisions of. Schedule 5 of the 1987 Act any
existing court order made under section 10 of the 1975 Act
remains in force. Similarly any appeal lodged prior to 1 January
1988 and still extant on that date will remain subject to the
appeal procedures of the Safety of Sportr. Grounds Regulations
1976 (SI 1976/1263).


Resource and manpower implications

7.   The contents of this circular do not result in any cost or
manpower implications other than those arising from the
inspections to be carried out on designated sports grounds under
section 10B(1) as introduced by section 25 of the 1987 Act.

          advice is being done separately and will cover, as necessary, any
          resource implications arising therefrom.


          Supplementary
          8.   The information and advice in this circular and in Annex A
          on the 1987 Act are given in good faith but it should be
          understood that ultimately only the courts can rule
          authoritatively on points of law.
          9.   Any enquiries about the contents of this circular should, be
          directed to Mr D Macnamara 01-213 7338.                       _

ANNEX A TO HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR NO 71/1987
FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987
Advice note by the Home Office on Part II of The Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (The 1987 Act) amending The
Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 (The 1975 Act)

Introduction
1.   The general background to the 1975 Act together with a
summary of local authority powers and functions under that Act,
and procedures for the issue of safety certificates is set out in
Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986 issued 7 February
1986 (taken from earlier Home Office circulars 150/1975, 130/1976
and 187/1976). This guidance should therefore be read in
conjunction with Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986
which will need to be cross-referenced.
2.   The Popplewell Inquiry set up after the fire tragedy at
Valley Parade concluded that the 1975 Act had worked
satisfactorily at designated grounds but recommended changes to
improve its operation. The Government's response was contained
in a consultative document published in June 1986. Parts II and
III of the 1987 Act implement these proposals and introduction of
Part II as from 1 January 1988 is the first phase of this
implementation.
3.   The main mechanism for securing safety at sports grounds
remains the safety certificate. Guidance on safety standards is
contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (The Green
Guide) revised in October 1986. Local authorities are reminded
of the advice contained in paragraph 5 of Annex B to Home Office
Circular 7/1986 highlighting the need to maintain flexibility in
order to take account of the different circumstances at
individual grounds.
SUBSTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS EFFECTED BY PART II OF THE 1987 ACT
Section 19: Application of the 1975 Act to all sports grounds
4.   Section 19, together with the textual amendments of Schedule
2 to the 1987 Act removes the distinction in the 1975 Act between
a sports "ground" and a sports "stadium". As amended the
provisions of the 1975 Act apply to all sports grounds as defined
in section 17(1) of that Act. The Secretary of State may thus
designate any category of sports groind witheut first having to
make an order extending the provisions of the Act to that
particular class of ground.
5.   In consequence of this wider power, section 2 of the 1975
Act (originally formulated with "stadia" in mind, particularly -
football stadia) has also had to be amended, by section 19 (2) of
the 1987 Act, so that safety certificates are no longer required
to contain certain obligatory terms and conditions. The
Secretary of State is however empowered to stipulate by order the
contents of a safety certificate for any class of sports ground.
f   ^    0    $       .      & > ■                            >    •     '   ;' ;;X


         In this way those grounds of a particular, type, or grounds used
         for a particular sport need not be subj ect to requirements which
         would be inappropriate to them.

         6.    As there are no present plans to extend designation to other
        classes of sports ground it is not envisaged that an order under
        this new power will be necessary. The discretion given to local
        authorities under section 2(1) of the 1975 Act means that with
        the possible exception of clauses in safety certificates relating
        t o P°lice Presence (see paragraph 9 below) the contents of safety
                      will not automatically require amendment as a result
        of the removal of the obligatory terms of section 2 of the 1975
        Act. Safety certificates should continue to specify maximum
        spectators; include terms and conditions as to size, situation
            entrances/exits to and from the ground and parts of it
        (including means of escape in the case of fire or other
        emergency) plus means of access to any such entrances and exits?
        terms and conditions should continue to require those entrances,
        exits and means of access to be properly maintained and kept free ~-r
        from obstruction; and terms and conditions should continue to
        deal with the number, strength and situation of any crush
        barriers.                                          J
                                                                             )
        7*   Section 19(2) also widens the regulation powers given to
            Secretary of State by insertion of a new subsection (1A) to
        section 18 of t h e 1975 Act thereby enabling regulations to make
         1^^eren^" provision for different classes of sports grounds.

        Section 20:       Designation of grounds - variation in qualifying
                          spectator capacity

                     2° i ?SerJ® subsections (1A) and (IB) in section 1 of
        the 1975 Act to give the Secretary of State power to vary bv
        order the numerical threshold above which grounds may be
        designated as requiring a safety certificate. The threshold is
        at present set at 10,000 by the Act.


        Section 21:       Safety certificates — police presence

        9.    Section 21 adds subsection (2A) to section 2 of the 1975
        Act. Where the local authority includes in a safety certificate
        a provision which requires the presence of the police, the
        subsection requires that determination of their number is to be
        left to the Chief Officer of Police. This is already the usual
        if not invariable practice and this provision does no more than
        9lvf statutory force to existing arrangements. Safety
        eertiricat6 conditions which do noc comply with this provision
        will however be void and local authorities are advised to ensure
        that any such conditions comply with the new provisions.
        Section 22:       Safety certificates — appeals

        1®* Section 22 of the 1987 Act directs appeals under section 5
        of the 1975 Act to the courts instead of to the Secretary of
        State as hitherto. Such an appeal is to the Magistrates Court by
        way of making a complaint (new subsection (3A) of section 5) .
        There is also provision for an appeal to the Crown Court against
          an order made by a Magistrates Court on determining a complaint.
          Such an appeal may be made by the local authority or by any
          "interested party" as defined in section 5 of the 1975 Act.
          11. Subsections (4), (6), (7) and (8) of section 5 are repealed
          in consequence of the removal of the Secretary of State's
          functions in respect of appeals. However the Secretary of State
          is given the power to prescribe by regulation the time within
          which appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act are to be brought.
          These regulations will also come into effect as from 1 January
          1988. There is however transitional provision contained in
          paragraph 6 of Schedule 5 to the 1987 Act to preserve the
          existing appeal procedures/powers in respect of appeals made to
          the Secretary of State before 1 January 1988 and which are still
          extant on that date.
          12. Section 22(8) of the 1987 Act makes a number: of
          consequential amendments to section 7 of the 1975 Act
          (determinations and appeals/supplementary). Subsection (8)(a)
11        amends section 7(1) of the 1975 Act so that it provides for an
          application to be deemed to be withdrawn if the local authority
          serve a notice under section 5(1) that an applicant is not
     .3   qualified for the issue of a certificate, once the time limit for
          an appeal has expired. It also removes from the 1975 Act section
          7(1)(b) which misleadingly implies that the local authority can
          determine without an application having been made that an
          existing holder of a safety certificate no longer qualifies to
          hold it.   Subsection (8)(b) amends section 7(2) to make
          provision to suspend the effect of the local authority decision
          that an applicant is not a qualified person if an appeal is made
          in the prescribed time limits. This suspension has effect until
          the appeal is either withdrawn or determined by the court in
          favour of the authority. Subsection 8(c) amends section 7(3) of
          the 1975 Act and subsection (8)(d) repeals the provision in
          section 7 of the 1975 Act by which a court could, on the
          application of the local authority, give immediate effect to a
          term or condition of a safety certificate which had been
          suspended as a result of an appeal.
          Section 23: Special procedure in case of serious risk -
          prohibition notices: and
          Section 24: Prohibition Notices: appeals
          13. Section 23 of the 1987 Act replaces the existing section 10
          of the 1975 Act with provision for a system of prohibition
          notices. Section 24 of the 1987 Act provides for appeals against
          a prohibition notice.
          14. A prohibition notice may be served in respect of any sports
          ground as defined in section 17(1) of the 1975 Act or part of
          such a sports ground. The criteria for issuing a prohibition
          notice are set out in the new section 10(1) and local authorities
          should not feel inhibited from using the new powers when
          necessary. These powers are nonetheless potentially far reaching
          (see also paragraph 20 below) and local authorities are therefore
          asked to ensure that they are used with due discretion. In
          practice, the considerations leading to the issuing of a
          prohibition notice are likely to be comparable to those which now

suspend the operation'of the notice or of any amendment to it
(section 10A(6)) so, particularly if the notice is to apply to a
"one-off" fixture, it is important that it is served, wherever
possible, well in advance so as to enable the recipient to
exercise effectively his right of appeal. The appeal procedure
is by way of complaint to a Magistrates Court. On appeal the
court may cancel the notice or affirm the notice, either in its
original form or as amended, or with such modifications as the
court thinks fit. There is provision for a further right of
appeal to the Crown Court against the decision of the Magistrates
Court. Persons entitled to make such an appeal are listed in new
section 10A(7). "An aggrieved person" referred to_ in sub-section
(7)(a) is defined in sub-section (9).                  ...
Section 25:   Enforcement : Inspections and offence of obstruction
21. Section 25(1) of the 1987 Act adds a new section 10B to the
1975 Act which provides for local authorities to enforce the
Act's provisions and, for that purpose, to arrange for the
inspection of designated grounds at least once every twelve
months in accordance with any guidance from the Secretary of
State.
22. Section 25(2) updates section 12(6)(d) of the 1975 Act by
amending the term "wilfully" to "intentionally".

Offences

1.    Contravention of any prohibition notice or restriction
imposed by a prohibition notice is an offence provided by section
12(l)(e) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act)
as amended by the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
1987 (the 1987 Act) and renders the offender liable, on summary
conviction, to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum
(currently £2,000) or, on conviction on indictment, to an
unlimited fine, or imprisonment for not more than two years, or
both.
2.   Where any person is charged with an offence under section
12(1)(e) of the 1975 Act it shall be a defence to prove
(a)   that the admission of spectators in contravention of the
      notice was without his consent; and
(b)   that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all
      due diligence to avoid the commission of such an offence by
      himself or any other person under his control.
3.   Section 12(7) of the 1975 Act provides that where an offence
under that Act which has been committed by a body corporate is
proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of,
or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, a director,
manager, secretary or other similar.officer of the body
corporate, or any person who was purporting to act in any such
capacity, he, as well as the body corporate, shall be guilty of
that offence and be liable to be proceeded against and punished
accordingly.

4.   Where the affairs of a body corporate are managed by its
members, section 12(7) of the 1975 Act shall apply in relation to
the acts, and defaults of a member in connection with his
functions of management as if he were a director of the body
corporate.
5.   The validity of a prohibition notice served on any person
shall not be affected by a failure to serve another person
required to be served with such a notice.

Appeals
6.   Your attention is drawn to the provision for appeal to a
magistrates' court against this notice in section 10A of the 1975
Act as inserted by the 1987 Act.
Regulations made under section 10A(1) of the 1975 Act stipulate
that a person on whom a prohibition notice is served may appeal
to the court within 21 days after the day on which the notice is
served on him.

                                               (This note is not part o f the Regulations)
     These Regulations, which apply throughout Great Britain (except the Isles of Scilly),
  replace the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 (“ the 1976 Regulations ”) and the
  Safety of Sports Grounds (Amendment) Regulations 1986 (which apply in England and
  Wales, except the Isles of Scilly) and the Safety of Sports Grounds (Scotland) Regulations
  1976 (“ the 1976 Scottish Regulations ”).
     Regulations 8 to 13 of the 1976 Regulations and regulations 9 and 10 of the 1976 Scottish
  Regulations made provision for the procedure for appeals to the Secretary of State in
  respect of safety certificates under section 5 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (“ the
   1975 Act ”)• When the amendments made by section 22 of the Fire Safety and Safety of
  Places of Sport Act 1987 (“ the 1987 Act ”) come into force, those appeals will be made to
  magistrates’ courts in England and Wales and by summary application in Scotland and
   regulations 8 to 13 of the 1976 Regulations and regulations 9 and 10 of the 1976 Scottish
   Regulations will no longer be necessary. By virtue of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places
   of Sport Act 1987 (Commencement No. 1) Order 1987 (S.1.1987/1762), Part II of the 1987
   Act (in which section 22 is contained) comes into force on 1st January 1988, the same date
                                                                                     5
as the coming into force of these Regulations. Accordingly, these Regulations no longer
include provision corresponding to regulations 8 to 13 of the 1976 Regulations and
regulations 9 and 10 of the 1976 Scottish Regulations (the enabling power for which is, in
any event, replaced by section 22 (7) of the 1987 Act) but provide instead (in regulation 6)
for the time within which an appeal must be brought before a magistrates’ court in England
and Wales or by summary application in Scotland.
  These Regulations also differ from the 1976 Regulations and the 1976 Scottish
Regulations in that they no longer prescribe a minimum time before the event for which
the application is made for the submission of an application for a special safety certificate.
They also do not require the local authority to have made decisions in respect of such
applications by specified periods.
  Regulation 5 of these Regulations requires certain notices to be given to interested
parties (as defined) and a newspaper notice to be published. Regulation 8 of these
Regulations differs from regulation 14 of the 1976 Regulations and regulation 11 of the
1976 Scottish Regulations in that it allows local authorities to charge fees in respect of
applications for the replacement and transfer of safety certificates as well as for
applications for their issue and amendment.
  These Regulations also differ from the 1976 Regulations (as amended) and the 1976
Scottish Regulations in that they refer only to sports grounds and not to sports stadia in
consequence of the amendments made to the 1975 Act by section 19 of, and Schedule 2 to,
the 1987 Act (which provisions also come into force on 1st January 1988 by virtue of the
Commencement Order referred to above).
  Regulation 7 of these Regulations is a new provision which prescribes the period within
which appeals in respect of prohibition notices (and amendments to those notices) issued
under section 10 of the 1975 Act (as substituted by section 23 (1) of the 1987 Act) must be
brought under section 10A (l)and(2)ofthe 1975 Act (as inserted by section 24 of the 1987

       IMPLEMENTATION OF PART II (SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS)             SECTION 25

       INSPECTIONS UNDER SECTION 10B OF THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT




       Introduction

       Further to HOC/71/87 giving advice about the effects of changes
       brought about by implementation of Part II of the Fire Safety and
       Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (the 1987 Act) this circular
       introduces Statutory Guidance given by the Secretary of State on
       inspections of designated sports grounds under section 10B of the
       Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) as inserted bv
       section 25 of the 1987 Act.
       General

      The Statutory Guidance, drawn up following consultation with the
      local authority associations, has effect in respect of any
      inspection carried out under section 10B of the 1975 Act after 1
      January 1988 when, by virtue of the Commencement Number 1 Order.
      Part II of the 1987 Act comes into effect.

       Local authorities should bear in mind the mandatory nature of the
       Statutory Guidance on inspections carried out under section 10B
       of the 1975 Act whereas the supplementary, explanatory memorandum
       enclosed with the Statutory Guidance is not binding.
Resource Implications -

Whilst it is not intended to restrict the time local authorities
may feel should be devoted to this task, inspections under
section 10B (when taken with existing commitments to inspect
designated sports grounds) should not result in significant
resource implications. The scope of inspections under paragraphs
3 and 4 of the Statutory Guidance, together with associated
report work, are not intended to be as detailed or extensive as
that often required of the holder of a safety certificate, or
that which may sometimes be necessary prior to the issue of a
safety certificate. In general, inspections are not expected to
take more than about 2 man days per ground on average.
To assist local authorities prepare a report and record of
inspections a suggested basic format which can be adapted
according to preference is enclosed at Annex A.

Supplementary

Any enquiries about this circular or the statutory Guidance
should be directed to Mr Macnamara 01-213 7338.

                                        Yours faithfully

HOC 72/1987


STATUTORY GUIDANCE TO IOCAL AUTHORITIES ON INSPECTIONS TO BE
CARRIED OUT UNDER SECTION 10B OF THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT
1975


The following guidance is given by the Secretary of State in
pursuance of section 10B(2) of the Safety of Sports Ground Act
1975 (as inserted by section 25(1) of the Fire Safety and Safety
of Places of Sport Act 1987).


General
1.   The local authority should be satisfied that inspections
under this guidance are carried out by a person or persons
qualified for that purpose.
Scope of inspection
2.    Inspection of the ground should, where practicable, include
inspection of the following certificates of testing and records
as required under the terms and conditions of the safety
certificate to be kept by the holder and/or submitted to the
local authority.

(a)   any certificate covering testing of
(i) strength/loading tests carried out on crush barriers, guard
rails, hand rails, balustrading, walls or fences;

(ii) strength, stability of buildings or other structures;
(iii) inspections and condition of electrical installations.

(b)   records of the following
(i)   spectator attendances;

(ii) accidents involving spectators;

(iii) maintenance and other inspections of buildings, components
     anc installations, together with identified deficiencies and
     recorded remedial measures taken;
(iv) tests and checks on emergency lighting, public address
     system, fire fighting equipment, fire warning system (if
     installed);
(v)   emergency evacuation procedures and steward training
      sessions.




                                 m
 3.   The inspection of the ground should normally include
 inspection of the following items:- " --- -— — — —

 (a) any part of the ground where an accident or incident
 resulting in serious injury to spectators has occurred since the
 last inspection?

 (b) any recorded defect or deficiency which has arisen since the
.last inspection and which, in the opinion of the inspecting
 officer would be likely to lead to an accident which could result
 in serious injury to spectators;

‘ (c) major remedial work carried out since the date of the last
 inspection to ascertain that it has been satisfactorily carried
 out?

(d) all public stairways for their general condition, slip
resistance, condition of hand-rails (see also (j) below), trip
hazards especially at the head of stairways,' adequacy of lighting
and structural fire separation?

(e) all egress routes used by the public, including emergency
exit routes, for obstructions, operation of exit gates, adequacy
of sign-posting and lighting, presence of any uncleared litter?

(f) fire fighting equipment and fire warning system (if
installed)?

 (g)   for the presence of any accumulation of litter,

(h) the emergency lighting system including any generator or
batteries

(i)    first-aid facilities and equipment?

(j) 10% of any crush barriers, balustrading and hand-rails for
overt signs of weakness which might signal the need for further
testing,, remedial action or (additional) restriction on the
number of spectators allowed to occupy that part of the ground?

(k) 10% of the terraces or viewing slopes for general surface
condition, even-ness and slip resistance?

(1)    anchorage and fastening of 10% of any fixed seating.
(m)    any provision for the disabled.

Where the inspection of a sample as in paragraphs (j), (k) and
(1) reveals matters giving rise to serious concern for the safety
of spectators, the authority should go on to inspect all the
crush barriers etc, terracing or seating in that part of the
ground where the sample indicated that there were deficiencies.
Testing of equipment

4.   Tests should if possible be carried out to confirm that the
following is in working order:-
(a)   lighting, particularly on stairways and exit routes?
(b)   emergency lighting?

(c) public address system, including the proper functioning of
zoning where this facility is part of the requirements of the
safety certificate?
(d)   fire warning system (if installed)?

(e) 10% of any metering system for recording the- admission of
spectators to parts of the ground.




Home Office
25 November 1987
Supplementary advica and explanatory notes to the statutory
Guidance to local authorities given by the Secretary of State
under section 10B(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

Introduction

1.   The following advice does not form part of the Statutory
Guidance given under section 10B of the 1975 Act. The following
advice is given in good faith but it should be remembered that
only the courts can rule authoritatively on interpretation of
points of law.

Objective of Inspections
2.   The object of the inspections is to monitor.the suitability
of the terms and conditions of the safety certificate (where
issued) in the light of any change in the condition of the ground
and secondly, to assist local authorities in enforcing compliance
with the terms and conditions of the safety certificate or other
notice served on the ground occupier.

3.   Local authorities may wish to note that the inspection is
not intended to shift responsibility for spectator safety away
from the holder of any safety certificate or ground occupier, but
rather to help see that he succeeds in achieving (and
maintaining) the safety standards intended to be set by any
certificate for the number of spectators authorised to enter the
ground for a specified activity.
General

4.   As the size, age, configuration, condition and usage of
designated sports grounds as well as the attitude of management
can give rise to different inspection needs, the discretion of
local authorities to carry out more frequent or more extensive
inspections than is laid down by section 10B of the 1975 Act is
not restricted. The requirements of the Statutory Guidance have
been set at what is seen as the desired minimum likely to achieve
the objective described above leaving authorities free to add to
the content of the inspections or increase their frequency
according to locally determined needs. In this context local
authorities may wish to bear in mind that inspections carried out
under section 10B of the 1975 Act are in addition to, not a
substitute for those required to be carried out under the terms
and conditions of the safety certificate by or on behalf of the
holder.

Inspection frequency
5.   As section 10B(3) of the 1975 Act stipulates that an
inspection should take place of a "designated" ground at least
once every twelve months, this frequency must be observed even if
the issue of a safety certificate is delayed* Where a safety
certificate has not been issued, the inspections carried out
prior to its preparation and issue should be such as to fulfil
the requirements of the Statutory Guidance. Once a safety
certificate has been issued at least one further inspection of



                            QJ
 the ground should be carried out either:-
 within a year of its issue, or

 within a year of the last inspection, whichever is the earlier.

 Thereafter, inspections should take place at least annually from
 the date of the last inspection.

  Where an inspection of a sports ground takes place at the
  discretion of the local authority for some other reason, for
  example as a result of proposed alterations or an application for
• amendment to the safety certificate, that inspection can be
  regarded as an inspection carried out under section 10B of the
  1975 Act provided the criteria of the Statutory Guidance are met.
 Inspection Team                                ir   :; :

6.    The Statutory Guidance allows the local authority to
determine how best to arrange and effect inspections under
   ct*°n 10B of the 1975 Act and does not stipulate that they
should be carried out by a particular professional discipline.
As it is nonetheless important that inspecting officers are
qualified t o r that purpose, the guidance places an onus on the
local authority to be satisfied on this account.    (The Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (paragraph 36) envisages that
inspections arranged by ground management will be carried out bv
someone who is professionally qualified. Local authorities may
wish to consider whether inspecting officers should also be
professionally qualified.)

7.   Local authorities are also asked to bear in mind the
potential advantages of a team approach to inspections under the
Statutopr Guidance and the role of the fire authority, building
authority and the police. Local authorities in London and
metropolitan counties may therefore wish to arrange at least one
inspection per year to be carried out with a representative of
the fire authority in attendance. Elsewhere, local authorities
     no doubt wish to consider inclusion of a member of the fire
service as well as a representative of the building authority.
Local authorities may also wish to consult the Chief Officer of
Police so that the opportunity can be given for a police officer
J? f      at le*®t on® inspection each year.  (It is not intended
that these considerations should interfere with any internal or
locally agreed arrangements between the local authority, fire
authority, building authority, police and any other agency with
an interest in safety at the ground.)
Scope of Inspections

®*    Where possible all the items listed in paragraphs 3 and 4
of the Statutory Guidance should be inspected and tested. It is
recognised however that there may be occasions when one or more
   these elements cannot, for some reason, be inspected. For
this reason there is a degree of discretion within paragraphs 2 -
 4 of the Statutory Guidance. In this way it is hoped to avoid
the ^situation where the local authority has to pay repeated
visits to a ground in order to comply with the Statutory
Guidance.

 9.   The Statutory Guidance does not require that an inspection
 should take place at any particular time so the local authority's
 discretion to carry out an inspection whilst the ground is in use
 is not restricted. An "in-use" or "during performance"
-inspection could therefore constitute part of the inspection
 required by section 10B of the Act even though it might not be
 sufficient (having regard to the requirements of the Statutory
Guidance) to be an inspection itself.
Records

10. Local authorities will doubtless need to keep a record of
all inspections carried out under the Statutory Guidance and may
wish to consider whether a copy of any report/record should be
sent to the holder of the safety certificate. Local authorities
are also asked to consider affording a reasonable opportunity for
any such report to be made available for inspection, if so
requested, by members of the public.

                   This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
     which is attainable.
            It deals in broad terms with the necessary strengthening
     and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
     calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
            Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
     the stands and reference is made to the observations which were
     made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                   The green guide has been used as a basis fot our cal­
     culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
     will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
     guide.             Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
     fire officer and the police.

    Standing Accommodation
    (a )    Spion Kop
                    The general layout of Spion Kop is good.      It
            has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
            well below the maximum laid down in the guide.      The
            slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
            for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                   The~only~questions therefore are the adequacy
            of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
            permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
            the exits.
                    Where the barriers are adequate in strength
            and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
            of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m2 of plan
            area.    Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
           Kop is approximately 3120m2 which would provide,
            accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                    Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
           standards.     Category A must be able to withstand a
           test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
           and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot)
           In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
           and Brocklebank Ltd.     Of the 101 barriers on Spion
           Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
           a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
           incipient defect which needed attention.     Most of
           those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
           would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
           On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
           long barrier which was weak.    It should be emphasised
           that the general situation was satisfactory compared
           with most grounds.
                    Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                             SHEET   3.

               barriers up to a uniform category A standard.            It
               should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
               the tests and there may have been some deterioration
               due to rusting.         Most of the barriers are made from
               2§" diameter tube which only has a thickness.of 0.192
               inches when new.         Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
               atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
               to more rusting than others and it is possible that
               there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                         Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/in, the
               maximum distance between barriers recommended ih the
               guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5? to 2.9m
               for slopes of 30°.         These figures apply to ’peak viewing’
               areas.      Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17°
               for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m.            The slope of the
               upper part     changes to 2 5° for which the spacing is
               3.1m.                                             *
)                        Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
               Spion Kop could be considered as not being ’peak
               viewing areas’ we are prepared to accede to the police
               view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
               This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
               ground.                    .
                         We propose that the existing barriers should be
               supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
               drawing 1610/1X.         The green shaded area behind each
               barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be
                                                             2   •
               available for spectators.   This area is 2958m which
                                   o
               at 54 persons/lOm        gives a capacity of 15,973. , It
                                                                 i
               should be kept in min'd that as many as 20,000 spectators
               have been admitted to the Kop in the past.

                 Spion Kop has three exits, one near each
            end and one at the top.            The total width of
            these three exits at their narrowest points is 12. 5m.
            The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
            exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
            width.     Thus the theoretical time to discharge
            16,000 spectators from Spion Kop would be Ilf minutes,
            compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
            guide.     We do not consider this to be a serious                         j/,       O
           ^matter.      Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) is very                         —
            desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
            fire, or explosion, or structural failure.                  In the
            case of terracing it is only the impatience:o f .spectators
            which might create danger.           We believe that for an
            interim period at least the evacuation time'of*Ilf
            minutes should be acceptable.
                      The exits at each end of the terrace are
            reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
            end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
                                           Ck'Vi"*              '
            recommended value of 8ft.         * This defect could be
            removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
            it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
            and the cost of modification is not justified in an
            existing structure.
                      The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit’
            from handrails dividing it into lanes.              Some remodelling
            of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
            desirable.

     (b)    The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
                                   :                        ™       ;       2
                      The west terrace has a total area of; 1480m   i

            there are no gangways.          We feel that some allowance should

                                                                     SHEET

            be made for circulation space as spectators have
            to move      quite considerable horizontal distances
            to achieve good packing.        The full area would
            justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
            probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
            of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
            The barriers should be designed to match this figure
            approximately.      Those barriers which cannot_withstand
            6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened, and extra
            ones provided where necessary.
                       The extra barriers required to achieve
            approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
            attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
                       The three exits have a total width,of about
            11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
            to leave the ground.      Thus the terrace could be
            emptied in about six minutes -which is very satisfactory.
                       The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
            should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.       There are
            no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
            exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as
            movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
            and quick.

     (c)    The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                       This area is also illustrated in the drawing
            1610/2X.       The gross area available (there are no
                                        2
            gangways) is about 56 5 m .       Thus if the crush barriers
            were adequate and the whole area is included the number
            of spectators could be about 3,050.
                       Provided the existing crush barriers are
            brought up to standard and supplemented in red as

           shown on our drawing 1610/2X, the area which can
           be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
                                                        2
           shown in green.    This area is about 535m       corresponding
           to about 2900 spectators.     This would bring the total
           standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                   The exits serving this part of the terraces
           are very adequate in width and there will be no
           difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.     C             J
    Seating Accommodation
    (a)    The North Stand
                   The form of construction of this stand is
           such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.-        The
           exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
           the recommendations of the guide.
                   The exits are very marginally below the .
           recommended l*lm width, but we do not consider this
           to be of great consequence.
                   Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
           length (they widen round the exit).     This is well
           below the green guide recommendation.      However, it
           is clearly appropriate to take into account the
           general nature of the stand, the number as well as
           the width of the gangways, and above all the .ease and
           speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                   On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
           leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
           The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.     Thereafter
           the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
           This established that in an emergency the green guide
           figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l*lm gangway)
           can be achieved.    With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators
                                                                           SHEET   7

EASTW OOD £r PARTNERS




            the average is 556 per exit.    Thus the stand wou^d
            empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
            recommended limit of eight minutes.
                   Our observations in company with the fire
            officer^ staff on 6 January showed that everyone
            had left this stand, apart from some people who were
            in no hurry, in about six minutes, although we also
            counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
           whistle.     The overall picture appears very satisfactory
            and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
            as not needing any significant modification.

    (b)     The West Stand
                   This stand is very similar to the north stand
            in its construction.     We were not able to accurately
            assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
            January because there were many seats which were unsold.
                                                           '   '^L
            However, there is every reason to believe that there
           will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
            eight minutes also.     There should be no need for
            significant modifications.

    (c)    The South Stand
                   The structure has been surveyed and appended
            are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
            show the plans and cross-section.     Also attached is
           a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
                   The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
            has 5710 seats.    These are served by 12 exits (excluding
            those serving the directors box) so that an average
           of 476 people need to pass through each exit.             The
            count by the fire officer’s staff on 6 January showed
           an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
            exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
            seven minutes.    Indeed there were very few people

    |               still trying to get out six minutes after the final
                    whistle.    A few had no doubt left early and a few
    ^              were still standing around, but the stand had
    j              substantially emptied in about six minutes.
    |                      Having left the top of the stand the spectators :
•   ?5
                    have to make their way from the first floor landing
                    via one of three staircases.        Two of these are 3.6m
                    wide and the other 2.4.    This is equivalent to                               n\
                    ’lanes’ of 550mm.    At 40 people per lane, 700 people
                    pass per minute.,   To discharge 5710 people (less
                    those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
    |              exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                           At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
                    almost straight to the open air, through a. compartment
                    which is separated from the main part of the building.
                    The third staircase passes through a wide lobby' which
                    will probably need three sets of self closing fire
                    doors to separate it from the remainder of the building,

-jj                        The front, open-air part of the south stand is
                    well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
1                  one passage.This passage has a theoretical capacity
                    of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.’
                    This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.                          Because
**                 the stand is    open to the air and there is very
-j                 ready access    to the pitch we do not think this rather
HI                 long emptying time is of any    great consequence.

    will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
     further visit.    We would like to be present when any
     further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
    being made with Dr. Wood during Dr. Eastwood’s absence
    which will extend to 15 February.
            If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
     post they would like, this can be considered by the club
     and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
            A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
    might be held around say 16 February.
            In the meantime Eastwood & Partners will be ^checking
     the various electrical services so that we shall be in a
     position to discuss these at the meeting.             j


    Future Ground Capacity
            Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
    out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
    ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows
                                                               *

            Standing on Spion Kop                16,000
            Standing at Leppings Lane end
            (total including N.W. corner)        10,100

                                                 50,100

            It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
    has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
    be admitted to the ground.      This involved of the order of
    19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.        Indeed, it
    is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
    70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
    Kop probably approached 30,000.
            It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
    excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

1 .____ Purpose of Meeting

Following the Working Party's meeting with the representatives of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. on 13th December, 1978, the
Secretary of the Club had (by letter dated 22nd January, 1979) circulated a
Beport, together with Plans, drawn up by Dr. W . Eastwood of Eastwood
and Partners. The Secretary had also suggested a meeting on Friday,
16th February, 1979, to discuss the documents.

The purpose of today's meeting w a s to consider the views which the Working
Parly should put to the Club on the 16th February.

2.     Plans

(a)     Whilst the "Notes for the Guidance of Applicants" stated that detailed
plans at 1:100 scale should be supplied of all buildings and other accommodation
for spectators, s ome of the plans supplied were to 1:200 scale. The Fire
Service felt that the latter size were acceptable provided all of the plans were
to the s a m e scale, and it w a s A G E E E D that the "Notes for the Guidance of
Applicants" should be am ended to read plans to 1:200 scale.

(b)     The site plan at 1:500 scale had not been supplied as required by the
Notes, but Eastwood and Partners had undertaken to prepare this in time for
Friday's meeting. The firm had also promised that all site fixtures would be
indicated on that plan.

                                              1.
(c)    It w a s A G B E E D that the plans supplied had inaccuracies and
inadequacies. In particular, thsy lacked indications of cross sections,
profiles, structural stability, position of handrails and balustrades, width
of stairways, etc. W h e r e appropriate, these could, as an alternative, be
described in a Keport.

(d)    T h e County Council’s hope w a s that, in view of limited resources in
the Architectural & Building Services Division, the plans supplied and finally
accepted by the Working Party could form the basis of the Certificate
Drawings.

3.       Beport     .                                                      ■       -

(a)      General                                                                           -

It w a s recognised that the criteria set out in the H o m e Office "Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds (Football)" required n e w wor k or reconstruction
to be to a standard not lower than the standard set out in the Guide, and that
in existing situations the criterion w a s that of a reasonable degree of safety.
A s the Guide stated, it would be unreasonable, even if it w ere practicable,
to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending a ground.

With these factors in mind, both the Fire Service and the Police felt that
the flow of spectators w a s the m ost important criteria to be adopted*
Whilst not disagreeing with this viewpoint, the Building Authority suggested
it would be useful to know the reasoning behind the recommendation in the
Guide that gangways should not be less than 1.1 metres wide. The County
Council A G R E E D to try to find this information out, and the Fire Service
A G B E E D they'would contact their colleagues in other areas wh o had been
involved in the Certification process to ascertain how nearly the 1.1 metre
gangway recommendation had been observed in existing situations in their
respective areas.

At the request of the Fire Service, the County Council also A G R E E D to try
and find out if there was any general recommendation on reduced
admission if a ground were used at a night time instead of during the day
time.

(c)     Spion Kop    (pages 2,3 & 4)

The Working Party agreed with the Club’s view that, with the existing three
exits, there w a s no w a y that the r e c o m m e n d e d discharge time of 8 minutes
could be met. Whe re they disagreed w a s that an evacuation time of Ilf
minutes should be regarded as acceptable. If no m o r e exits were to be
provided, the Working Party A G R E E D that a crowd limitation of 11,040
on the Spion K o p should be imposed.

The existing exit at the North end passed under a bridge with a headroom
below agreed by the Club to be less than the recommen ded value of 8ft.
A s this w a s in fact s o m e 6’6” , the Working Party A G R E E D that the Club
be informed that in their view it is essential that the floor be lowered to
remove this danger to spectators.

The exit at the South side would also require widening, and possibly flow
barriers would need installing.

The area at the back of the K o p would also require close attention.


If n e w exits were to be provided by the Club, it was A G R E E D that at least
T W O would be required. The most economical w a y of providing one would
be to use the gates in the existing barrier, provided these were lined up with
the gangways, with discharge onto the pitch surround, and the other ■would
require to be a completely n e w exit.

The Building Authority felt that the majority of the crush barriers would fail
the tests, and consequently any necessary re-siting would probably not be
too m u c h of a problem. Certainly the suggested additional barriers would
require careful consideration.


For the purposes of crowd control, the Police suggested there should be s o m e
form of lateral separation. The Working Party A G R E E D , and it was suggested
that three metal fences sited centrally in the blocks (as opposed to adjacent
to the gangways) should be provided, with access between each limited to a
padlocked gateway under the control of the Police.

A s recent adverse weather conditions had proved, ice and snow on the K o p
could cause problems, and it was A G R E E D that Paragraph 11 (4) of the draft
Certificate should be amended so as to require the Club to take steps to
clear the Kop of ice and snow before a g a m e w a s played.

The Building Authority pointed out that information w a s still required from
the Club on profile and step dimensions and the slope of the Kop.

 In view of the lack of depth of this terrace, the Club’s offer to reduce the
 spectator limit to 7,200, and the discharge time of 6.6 minutes, the
 Working Party A G R E E D that it would be unreasonable to insist that
 gangways or additional exits m u s t be provided.

However, even if the existing crush barriers were to pass the tests, the

 In view of the apparant sharp edges, corrosion, etc.

 (e)     The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace         (pages 5 & 6)

 The Working Party A G R E E D there were no real problems here, but the
 Building Authority pointed out that as well as the crush barriers, the
 existing corrugated sheeting would require to pass the appropriate tests.

 (f)     The North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

.Whilst the flow rates and discharge times were probablysatisfactory (the
 construction and width of the r a m p s being such that they could quite properly
•be regarded as elevated roadways), the fact remained that the gangways in
.the North Stand were only 6 4 0 m m wide for m u c h of their length, compared
 with the r ecom m e n d e d width of 1.1 metres.

 Additionally, observations had shown that two-thirds of the spectators used
 the upper exit, whilst the remainder used the lower exit. A n ideal would be
,to provide additional exits at the top of the stand but, in view of its cantilever
 construction, the cost would be prohibitive.

  A s an alternative, the Working Party A G R E E D that consideration might be
. given to removing a row of seats frpm the top of the stand down each gangway
  to the upper exits, with a physical barrier across the stand below the upper
  exits to ensure m o r e equal use of both upper and lower exits by spectators.
  If this would cause difficulties, a barrier in the gangways only below the upper
  exits might be considered.         ’                          -

 So far as the Wire M e s h barriers under the stand were concerned, the
 Working Party A G R E E D that these must either be removed or m a d e of a
 permanent construction.

 (g)    The West Stand

 Whilst the exits were adequate and well spaced and the discharge times
 were acceptable in view of the type of stand, the Fire Service felt that

                                   - 4 -




                                    SJ
the m e a n s of escape were not adequate as the only mea n s of egress w a s
by way of two staircases.^ The Working Party A G B E E D that it wa s essential
that another staircase be provided, and one on the south-west corner w a s felt
to be the mo st acceptable.                     ,

(h)     Th e South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

So far as-the seating arrangements were concerned, the Working Party
felt that it w a s the front, open air part which caused the concern. Because
of the bad ingress/egress, the Working Party A G B E E D that two additional
exits would be required. It w a s suggested that the most economical w a y of
doing this w a s by m e a n s of one discharging at the Spion Kop end and the
other by breaking through the wall by the Tea Bar.

Additionally, the penning arrangements of the seating would need to be
looked at closely.    •

A s the balustrades and handrails were constructed of timber, the Building
Authority considered they would be likely to fail the appropriate tests.
 Also, as the staircase was a 24 instead of the m a x i m u m 12 riser r e c o m m e n d e d
 In the Guide it was probable that this would have to be reconstructed.

Contrary to their initial reaction, the Fire Service felt that, provided that the
necessary increased fire resistance measures were carried out, the stand
would not be the problem from a combustability point of view that they had
anticipated.

The Building Authority expressed concern as to the corrosion of the steel
w o r k of the stand, and considered that this would require investigation.

 The Police expressed concern about the use of the car park behind the
 Stand. Persons entitled to use this car park frequently arrived just before
 the start of a match and drove through the spectators attempting to gain
 access to the ground. A s they left immediately afterwards, the s a m e thing
 occurred at the end of a match.. This practice had to be stopped, either by
 banning the use of the car park entirely on match days or imposing some sort
 of time restriction on its use before and after a match.

 (h)     General Requirements

 These were not discussed by the Working Party at this stage.
(I)    Future Ground Capacity


If additional exits are not provided on the Spion Kop, this will have the
effect of reducing the ground capacity to 45,140, m a d e up as foilows:-

1.   '     Purpose of Meeting                                     ^


Following the postponement of the meeting with the Club because of adverse
weather and the difficulty in agreeing a mutually convenient alternative
      ^ purpose of & e m e e « n g was to review the position since 12th February
1979, prior to the re-arranged meeting with the Club which was now to take
place on 2nd April, 1979.

2._____ Plans


The plans at 1:500 scale and indicating all site fixtures were, it was still understood
to be supplied by Eastwood & Partners at the meeting with the Club.

.3^_____ Report
 (a)     General


Th e County Council had contacted the H o m e Office, but had been given little
information additional to that contained in their various Circulars. Basically,
they had said that any new work or reconstruction had to be to a standard not ’
 ower than that set out in the Guide. However, the m a x i m u m flexibility had
to be maintained in the case of existing structures and differences in such
matters as age, size and m o d e of construction had to be taken into account.

The Fire Service had contacted four other Brigades with designated grounds,
and only in one case had the recommendations of the Guide been strictly
adhered to.


                                      1.
(b)       Spion Kop (pages 2, 3 & 4)

Additional to the points mentioned on 12th February, 1979, concern was
expressed by the Building Authority as to the general maintenance of the Kop
and the loose and broken concrete at the bottom in particular. If attention
was not given to this, it was A G R E E D that it would be necessary to restrict
admission to the Kop, additional to the restriction to 11, C40 if the extra
exits are not provided.

On-the question of exits, it was again A G R E E D that it was essential to line
up the gates in the existing barrier with the gangways. Of the existing two
exits, concern was expressed as to the effect of the right-angled turn on
the e m b a n kme nt at the exit at the rear. After discussion, it was A G R E E D
that the best compromise was to leave things as they existed, provided
handrails are provided on the stairways, taking into account the........
desirability of maintaining a smooth flow.                                      1

The Fire Service queried the exact form of the lateral separation discussed
at the meeting on 12th February, 1979, as this would naturally have a
bearing on the means of escape recommendations. After discussion, it
was A G R E E D that the metal fences should not be of the climb-proof type,
that it was not intended that they should obstruct the gangways, and that
in consequence the padlocked gateway recommendation should be dropped.
However, it was A G R E E D that it was still desirable to seek 3 x 2 central
barriers but, if the Club really resisted the suggestion, 2 x 2 could
reluctantly be conceded. T he Building Authority stressed that whatever
barriers were provided would have to pass the appropriate strain tests.

T h e fact that the height of m a n y of the existing crush barriers was below the
recommendation in the Guide, in s o m e cases well below, was pointed out by the
Building Authority. The corrosion point mentioned at the last meeting was
also reiterated. It was A G R E E D that these points must be drawn to the
Club's attention, as must the condition of the Score Board Structure.

(c)      T he West Terrace (pages 4 & 5)

A s well as the condition of the crush barriers mentioned at the last meeting,
the Building Authority drew attention to the poor condition in places of the
terracing in small areas near to the stand. T he cross-fall on the steps on
the north-west corner exit would also require attention as it tended to throw
people forward. The height of the crush barriers mentioned in regard to the
Spion Kop also applied. It was A G R E E D that all these points must be drawn
to the Club's attention.

(d)       T he North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace (pages 5 & 6)

Having n ow had the opportunity of having a closer look at the existing corrugated
sheeting, the Building Authority confirmed that it would require alteration to
meet the requirements of the Guide.
                 I




(e)      T h e North Stand (pages 6 & 7)

The removal of a row of seats from the top of the stand down each gangway
to the upper exits and the removal of four seats at those exits was
confirmed as being a reasonable compromise to put to the Club.

A s the asbestos sheets at the top of the stand were protected, the Building
Authority felt that these could be accepted, and confirmed that the glazing
at the ends of the stands was not glass and so would not shatter.

(f)     T h e Wes t Stand (page 7)                                             —

Consideration was given to the Building Authority's suggestion of lateral
gangways and the segregation of exits but, after discussion, it was A G R E E D
that the additional staircase agreed at the last meeting should be confirmed.
So long as it was of 4-unit exit width, it was A G R E E D it was not necessary
to insist it should be on the scath-west corner. Such staircases could be
bought "off the peg" and, if not installed in the close season, it was
A G R E E D that a ^ reduction in capacity would be neeessarj’-.

(g)     The South Stand (pages 7 & 8)

A s mentioned at the last meeting, the penning arrangements of the seating
and the numbers of seats in the rows caused problems. Bearing in mind the
need for reasonableness and to m a k e the situation better, it was A G R E E D
that, even though not strictly in accordance with the Guide, that the best
compromise was to seek the removal of the existing barriers and their
re-alignment, together with the widening of the gangways at the position
of the wings.

The Fire Service pointed out and it was A G R E E D that Fire Resisting Doors
would be required leading to the Directors' seating, and 1 hour fire
resistance would be required for all problem areas under the stand. This
could be reduced to \ hour if automatic detection equipment were to be
installed.

For their part, the Building Authority reiterated their concern as to the
corrosion of the steelwork of the stand, and also pointed out the concrete
spalling which was occurring. Again, the likelihood of the balustrading,
barriers and guardrails needing to be reinforced or replaced was mentioned.
It was A G R E E D all would need to be given attention by the Club.

(h)      General Requirements (pages 8 & 9)

A s well as the Fire Service pointing out that the present temporary
structures used for police and first-aid purposes would need removal
fr om a m e a n s of escape point of view if the capacity of the North Stand


                                     3.




                                            0
w a s not to be reduced, the Police stated that they were ready to discuss
with the Club the facilities they would require. Briefly, they envisaged
a permanent structure almost twice as large as the existing temporary
structure, and expected communications, detention, toilet, parade room,
etc., facilities.

So far as First-Aid was concerned, the Sheffield Area Health Authority
had confirmed their willingness to provide advice on First-Aid and
Medical Facilities, but the person nominated (Dr. H. Bailey - Specialist
in Com mun ity Medicine (Social Services)) was on holiday until
2nd April, 1979. H e had been invited to the meeting, with the Club on
2nd April, but it was recognised that possible practical difficulties might
prevent his doing so.

1.     Scope and Objectives of Discussions

Mr. H„ E. M c G e e welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the Club were
ambitious and wanted to m a k e the Stadium the best in Europe. Crowds had been
averaging 11,000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing m o n e y since 1967. Commercial ventures had m a d e the Club
viable, and it was hoped to expand this side of the Club’s activities. The Club’s
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

1.    That, whilst Designating Orders did not specify time limits for the issue of
General Safety Certificates, it w a s essential to aim for the Certificate to be issued
by the start of the 1979/80 Season.

2.    That, as the Club wanted to attract representative games, the ai m should
be for the Stadium to be certificated for m a x i m u m crowds.

3.    That as m u c h w ork as possible should be carried out in the close season,
bearing in mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
will be m o r e restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah’s Witness Bally had
also to be borne In mind.

2.    Discussion on Standing Areas

2.    That the Club consider the installation of simple lateral barriers (not of the
climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
central block (but not so as to obstruct the gangways).

3.     That, in view of the clearance time of Ilf minutes compared with the
8 minutes specified in the Guide, the m e a n s of escape be discussed in detail
between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (including the re-siting of the gates
in the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
an Increase in their number).

4.      That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be increased to the
m a x i m u m possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

5.    That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
be tested to the appropriate standards.

6.    That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of s ome of the
crush barriers and the scoreboard structure be the subject of detailed discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

7.   That the Club’s longer term proposals for the improvement of the m e a n s of
egress be unanimously welcomed.

8.    That the m a x i m u m capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
points have been resolved.

2.    That, to overcome the m e a n s of escape problems in the upper part of the
Stand (the covered area), the existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
to deal with any problems about different admission charges by w ay of coloured
seats or s om e such alternative.


3.     That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
Fire resistance in the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
handrails down the stairways.


4.    That the m e a n s of escape problems in the front open air part of the stand
be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
side consideration be given to providing an addi tional gangway to exit on to the
derelict land adjoining the Spion Kop.


5.    That no immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
limitation on the use of the car park behind the Stand by entitled persons immediately
before a match, even though police had control of its use after a match.

S.    Ground Exits


Dr. Eastwood apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
already supplied s o m e time ago. H e undertook to ensure that copies were

                        Representing the Working Party


                                    (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)
                                   (South Yorkshire Police)

                                  r (South Yorkshire Police)
                       D. Sher riff(City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)

                       D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council - Admin. Dept.)

       Apologies for absence were received from Dr. H. Bailey (Sheffield A r ea Health
       Authority) and H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).

       Th e Note (previously circulated) of the meeting held on 2ndApril, 1979, wa s considered
       in conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
       and Partners, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the City of Sheffield
)j   - Metropolitan District Council Building Surveyor’s Department held on 13th April, 1979.

       The Note of the meeting held on 2nd April, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
       a m e n d m e n t s and additions in the light of the further investigations and discussions:-

       2A      Spion Kop


       Paras. 1 & 2 - Revised copies of drawing no. 1 6 1 0 /IX were circulated at the meeting
       showing the proposed n e w crush barrier layout, including the two lines of radial
       barriers. This was A G R E E D in principle.

       Para. 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the K o p as existing would m e a n an unacceptable
       evacuation time of s o m e 12| minutes. Larger and re-aligned gates in the barrier
       and improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce this time to s o m e 10 minutes,
       but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a n e w exit of 3 metre overall width.
       This could be Integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and roofing the
       Kop.   T h e Club A G R E E D to give consideration to the proposals.



                                                   1.



                                                 □
Para. 4 - T h e exploratory w o r k regarding the Improvement of the headroom had
still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major item.

 Para. 5 - Because of the difficulty in devising a suitable method of testing in places
'(such as the top of the Kop), It was A G B E E D that proposals should be formulated
after further discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

Para. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
structure should be looked at. It was A G B E E D that the question of the height of s o m e
of the crush barriers be considered again after it was seen which of them failed on
testing.

Para. 7 - T h e Club stressed that their proposals for the improvement of the m e a n s of
egress would hopefully be carried out in the shorter rather than the longer term future.

Para. 8 - T h e Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with; ~
the installation of the n e w crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates In the existing
barrier, could all be carried out in the close season. Their a i m was to achieve a
16, 850 crowd capacity.                                           —

2B    . W e s t Terrace

Para. 2 - The Club accepted that in view of the cross-fall on the north-west corner
exit, the steps should be re-built. It was A G B E E D that the other matters would be
considered again after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

2C     North We st Corner Terrace

Para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the Improvement or replacement of the
existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
out m o r e extensive works so as to bring the existing unused area into use for an
additional 250/300 spectators.

3.     North Stand

Para. 1 - Dr. Eastwood, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
agreement on a s c h e m e which could be r e c o m m e n d e d to the Club. This would
Involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from in
front of each of the 9 upper exits. The result would m e a n a loss of 126 seats
compa red to the 225 in the original proposals. Th e Club A G B E E D to give
consideration to the proposal.

Para. 2 - The word at the end of the first line should have been ’T e a 1 and not ’T e a m ’.
It w a s A G B E E D that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss In detail any
fire protection works considered to be necessary.

 4.      W e s t Stand

 T h e Club A G B E E D that additional exits of simple steel construction should be
 provided from each end of the upper stand.

 5.      South Stand

  Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor timber.
  Whilst rusting was not excessive, it was A G B E E D    that all bases would be exposed for
  inspection and, If necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts, before
  encasing in concrete for permanent protection. Because of the apparent accumulation -
‘ of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the        :
  Club also A G B E E D that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.'

 Para-. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were rem ove d entirely,. It w a s A G B E E D that
 ft would not be necessary to r e m o v e any seats for escape purposes In the upper part:
 of the stand (the covered area).                                                          -

 P a r a . 3 - It was A G B E E D that timber handrails should be provided d o wn each of the
 outer edges of the main staircase; that the existing iron centre railing should remain,
 and that a n e w handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be Installed.
 It was also A G B E E D that the brick staircase walls should .be buttressed where crowd
 surge pressure could be generated.

 Para. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, it was A G B E E D
 that on the west side a n ew exit through a n e w 1.2 metre wide door adjacent to the existing
 snack bar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance meas ure s in the
 surrounding area. On the east side, consideration was given to an extension of the
 footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the n e w exit was
 Isolated from the Ko p exit. It was A G B E E D that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
 should consider precisely what measures could be considered satisfactory so as to
 avoid any loss of seats.

 6.     Ground Exits

 The 1:500 site plan was in the process of being circulated.

 7.     Communications

 The Club stressed they were thinking in terms of an upgrading of the existing public
 address system. It was A G B E E D that the Police should have an over-ride facility
 from their Police Boo m, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility of
 achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

 8. >    Police and First Aid Facilities

 Paras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that it was essential that there was no gap in
 the provision of Police Facilities when the temporary structure was replaced by
 the permanent structure. With this in mind, they were happy for the safety aspects


                                         3.


                                           0
to receive first priority and to wait for the 1980 close season for the w o r k to be
carried out. It was understood that Dr. Bailey had not yet completed his investigations
into the first-aid and medical facilities.

d.     A n y other Topics

Th e evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to test the existing
emergency lighting equipment.

10.    Future Action                                            1       _ __^

M r . M c G e e stressed that it was essential for decisions to be taken'urgently If the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and practical point of view.

The Club were to m a k e application for financial assistance under the Football       ~   _
Association’s Ground Impro vem ent Scheme, and had to have over 50, 000 crowd            *
capacity if the a i m of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latest
proposals, If implemented, appeared to give a capacity of s o m e 50,750.

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
Fire Service and the Building Surveyor.

M r . M c G e e requested that he be advised if it appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.

 I refer to recent meetings with regard to the improvements required at the above
 ground and now append a summary of matters, in relation to the Building Authority
 requirements, which require attention and have been discussed at the various
 meetings.

 West Terrace

  1.     The downward slope of the exit steps to be corrected.

 2.      Limitation of numbers as agreed between Police representatives and club.

 West Stand

 Provision of additional stairways for egress purposes is required.  Subject to
 this provision the slight shortfall on headroom in certain cases can be accepted.

South Terrace

Provide, new means of egress to South-East area as discussed in detail. ••

North Stand

1.     Radial gangways to he improved to 1.1 m in width for at least half.the
       gangway length above each central exit, and remove 4 No. seats immediately
       below each exit to allow for barrier erection. . ..... ............ .......

2 .   . Replace existing wire mesh barriers by suitable substantial barriers    ..
        complying with guide recommendations.

It is noted that there are no handrails to the stairs from the stand, but in
view of restricted width and length it is not proposed to require.these.

North-West Terrace                                                • -

1.     Replacement of the corrugated sheeting at the rear is required.

        constructed to guide recommendations.

Spion Kop
                                            ...

1.     The arrangement for crush barriers as produced by the consultant, whilst
       not complying fully with the guide recommendations, is considered adequate
       if the other requirements are fulfilled.  These other requirements include
       the 2 No. radial barriers indicated on Plan 1XA and the provision of an
       additional 3 m wide egress route to South-East area, and of gated openings
       to give access from the radial gangways to the ground perimeter area.

2.     Make- good all broken and spalled concrete terracing. :

3.     Increase headroom to North-East egress route to a minimum of 2.1 m.

4«     Check and carry out any necessary work to ensure safety of score-board
       building. -                                                     (

5.     Replace corroded perimeter rails by construction complying with code
       recommendations.      •

6.     Improve egress conditions•at rear by provision of balustrades, rails, etc.
       as indicated on the plan.

General

1.     All crush barriers, balustrade walls, fences and railings to be tested and
       replaced, or strengthened, where necessary.

2.     Provision of handrails and suitable headroom to egress routes to be re­
       assessed after re-routing of gangways etc. has been carried out.

3.     Fire resistance and restriction of flame spread to be improved to all areas
       as discussed; the consultant is to confirm the work proposed to be carried
       out. Arrangements to be made for the clearance of all combustible material
       from under stand areas.




                                           fa
With regaa?d to future meetings I think it is essential that all matters agreed
be recorded, as we are now approaching finality in many areas and it is necessary
that we have recorded exactly the agreed matters.

I-would also suggest that in view of the approach of certification it would,
perhaps, be advisable to hold future meetings away from the ground, and that
Mr. Vaughan, as the co-ordinator, should chair such meetings.

Yours faithfully,____________________

                                           G3
E m e r g e n c y Procedure

E m e r g e n c y procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout
the ground.

Access for E m e r g e n c y Vehicles

1,      Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct
        access can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of
        the stadium.

2,      Ensure that parked vehicles will not obstruct emergency vehicles on
        these access roads.

Public Address System

The existing public address system to be upgraded, with the Police having an
over-ride facility from their Police R o o m .

Police Facilities

A suitable permanent Police R o o m (with facilities as shown on the sketch plan
m a r k e d A A ) to be provided in the 1980 close season.

First Aid Facilities

(i)     Structure
                                                                                -•l


         T h e existing facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
         and it is suggested the Club consider providing a m o r e permanent
         structure which is not likely to require up-grading for a very long time.
         T h e internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
         impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered fairly
         sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the use of
         tiles or formica type finish etc....

(ii)    Waiting A r e a

         T h e Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
         the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

(iii)   .Treatment A re a

         T he Treatment A r ea should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
         patients at any one time, and consideration should be given to the needs
         for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
         patients m a y well be lying on couches.
(iv)     Lighting'

         Good lighting is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory.   T he
         provision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.

(v)      Water

         A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
         for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
         be provided. Th e Club might consider whether it would be cheaper in
         the long run to provide stainless steel basins which are not subject to
         chipping.

(vi)     Toilet Requirements

         T he Club should provide at least one male and One female toilet, for
         the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide            /-
         an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

(vii)    Storage

         Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
         wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
         be lockable.

(viii)   Equipment

         The following is a m i n i m u m list to provide a basic service:-
                       S                                            -
         Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in n u m b e r depending
         on space available and/or n u m b e r of cubicles, if the accommodation is
         cubicled.

         Six Stretchers.                                                               ^

         T w o sets of stretcher wheels.

         20 Blankets.

         Six Pillows.

         One Minute-Man Resuscitator.

(ix)     Telephone Facilities

         A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. This could be
         achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
         police.




                                      6.



                                           E3
(x )      Car Parking

          T he Club might also consider what facilities could be extended to the
          St. John's personnel for the parking of staff cars.

C r ow d Capacity

T he following numbers will be considered to be satisfactory, provided that the

1.     Sheffield United Football Ground

T h e Working Party considered Preliminary Drawings nos. 1917A , 2, 3 and 4 forwarded
by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners relating to the Club's proposals to erect a n e w
security fence around three sides of the pitch at Bramall Lane.

Superintendents Gavins and Johnson confirmed that the proposals followed recommendations
which they had m a d e to the Club on security grounds.

IT W A S A G R E E D that the proposals w e r e generally acceptable, provided that the security
gates in the fence were not regarded as mea ns of escape and that the necessary stress
calculations w er e supplied and w e re acceptable.

A s they were primarily concerned with only the Bramall Lane ground, Superintendents
Ckvins and Johnson left after this item.

2.     Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground

The Working Party considered the progress of w o r k at the Ground since their last
meeting on 12th July.

Whilst it w a s agreed that the Club had done m u c h of the outside w or k referred to in the
Schedule of Matters Requiring Attention (dated 8th June), the Building Authority
expressed particular concern about the possible stresses on the extensions at each end
of the We st Staircase to link with the simple steel construction emergency staircases
to be erected. It w a s also pointed out that, at the present time, no strengthening of the
corrugated sheeting on the North W e st Terrace had been carried out and that the Fire
Prevention W o r k s and Structural and Rectification W o r k s in the South Stand had not
yet been commenced. Th e urgent need to carry out the South Stand w o r k w as stressed.

It w a s noted that Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had by letter dated 10th August received by
the County Council yesterday sent revised drawings, calculations for the steel staircase
and cantilever slabs on the West Stand, and details of the prqp osed works to upgrade fire
resistance.    C o m m e n t s had been requested by 3rd September.

Whilst m a n y detailed preliminary plans had been provided by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
these were not suitable for including as part of the Certificate. Th e conditions and
date of issue of the Certificate wele also discussed, as was the provision of the
First-Aid Facilities re commended by the Area Health Authority.

A letter had also been received that morning from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners                 -   ..
requesting alterations to the previously agreed barrier arrangements in the North
Stand.                                                          -

IT W A S A G R E E D

(a)     that the a i m be to issue the Certificate at the beginning of December; that the - ^Y~
         Club be advised of this a i m and asked to state their p r o g r a m m e for the ■ • I,
         completion of the required works, any works not completed by that date to
         be included in a Schedule of C rowd Capacity Limitation to be incorporated in
         the Certificate;

(b)     that particular emphasis be placed on the necessity of carrying out the required
         works to the South Stand as soon as possible and that' provided that it is feasible
         the Building Authority and the Fire Service be requested to let the County Council
         have their observations on the structural and fire resistance aspects for
         incorporation Into a reply by 3rd September as requested by Messrs. Eastwood
         and Partners' letter dated 10th August;

(c)     that the question of plans to form part of the Certificate be re-considered w he n
         all the preliminary detailed plans being submitted have been agreed;

(d)     that, as with the proposed Police permanent structure, the Club be requested
         to provide the proposed First-Aid permanent structure in the 1980 close season,
         subject to the Club agreeing to provide the r ecommended equipment immediately;

(e)     that Messrs. Eastwood and Partners be advised that the alterations to the
         previously agreed barrier arrangement in the North Stand set out in their letter
         dated 14th August cannot be agreed, the alternative to their suggestions being
        the retention of the 1.1 metre height (as re c om m e n d e d by the Guide) in line
        with the stairs but with a possible reduction in height of the returns to 1 metre;

<f)     that the following amendments be m a d e to the Draft Certificate -

         (i)     paragraph 8 to be deleted and replaced by the following n e w paragraph -

                 »8(1)   The Holder shall provide and maintain at the Stadium to the

               activity of such numbers of qualified First Aid assistants as
               the County Council shall require but without prejudice to the
               foregoing the Holder shall ensure that at every specified activity
               there is at least one First Aid assistant for every 2,000
               spectators."

(ii)    paragraph 17 to be deleted and replaced by the following n e w paragraph -

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


 Dear Sirs,
                                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                                           Emergency Lighting Installation
             Further to our discussions with Mr.^                                                                 we would
 like to set down in detail our proposals for the upgrading of
 the emergency lighting facilities at the above Club.
             At present there is a large central battery system
 providing 240 volts D.C. which is arranged to serve the West
 and South Stands, and adjacent areas.                                                          This is achieved by an
 automatic changeover on mains failure, from AC mains to the
DC battery supply for those circuits providing the essential
 tungsten lighting.                                    For the North Stand and adjacent areas,
there is available a second YEB supply to act as a back up in
the event of a loss of the normal supply.
             We are proposing at this stage that new emergency circuits
and fittings be installed to serve the Penistone Road exits,
Spion Kop, the North Stand, the North-West Terrace,, the West
Stand, the South-West Terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.
The existing normal lighting for the West Stand will be excluded
from the battery load, and the spare battery capacity made
available will serve the new emergency
                               lergenc installation.

                                                                          U3*
                                                          Registered in Engr* i * J N   o.   1134531
EASTWOOD £r PARTNERS




          The duration of the battery supply will be substantially
   unchanged by this redistribution of load, and will give more
   than adequate time for clearing the ground.     As these are
   existing grounds, we would not recommend to the Club that
   their installations should comply in all respects with the
   standards set for new premises, especially as the 3-hour
   duration recommended for emergency battery capacity is quite
   inappropriate to the particular needs of safety.
          We are not proposing at this stage to recommend improvements
   to the South Stand emergency lighting.     Subject to approval,
   we would suggest that the system be reviewed when the time
   comes for replacement of the central battery.      At thix^Ttime
   the load reduction which could be achieved with a new emergency
   Lighting layout would permit a considerable saving in the battery
   replacement cost, and this would offset the cost to the Glub of
   the new emergency lighting installation.
          We are enclosing a set of drawings corresponding to
   these proposals (1610/101 to 106) for which we are now seeking
   tenders.     We would look forward to your comments and suggest
   that it may be appropriate to arrange a meeting with the Fire
   Prevention Officers concerned if further discussions are required.
          We would also wish to have their comments on the proposed
   Locations for the Fire Alarm call points shown on the drawings.


                                       Yours faithfully,

 Mr . Whitehead welcomed the representatives and explained that delays caused primarily
 by the wet weather, had meant that all of the required work had not been completed by
 today's meeting as the Club had originally envisaged.

 The Schedule of Matters requiring attention (dated 8th June, 1979) was considered, with
 the following results (after site inspection where necessary):-

 A.      Spion K op


 \       W o r k carried out.
 & (b)                                                                         ’

 2 (a)   W o r k carried out.

  (b)    The additional exit from the top of the Ko p was well under construction and
         should be completed by the end of the month.

 3.      W o r k carried out.

 4.      Except for one or two areas on the steps, all of the concrete terracing had been,
         m a d e good.
The future of the score-board building was still undecided but, if a decision
to be m a d e shortly was to retain it, supporting calculations would be forwarded
to the Building Authority.


W o r k carried out. Test report to be forwarded to the Building Authority.

W o r k carried out.

North Stand

W o r k carried out,

North Stand (Lower Level Access) (Upper Level Access)

W o r k in hand.   Should be completed in next few days.

North W e s t Terrace

To prevent local damage to the sheeting, particularly at the joints and to
spread the anticipated load over a larger area than at present, it was agreed
that a continuous horizontal timber m e m b e r should be fixed to the front of the
sheets at a height about one metre from terrace level.

W o r k carried out.

West Stand

It was agreed that, whilst the only positive way of proving the adequacy of the
joint between the ne w and existing construction was by means of a test load,
the calculations provided would be regarded as acceptable.

W es t Terrace

       closed season.

           D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

L ._____ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting w as primarily to carry out the "summer"
inspection o f the Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly
visits to Football League grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate
Officer Working Party.

In particular, the Officer Working Party wished to see the position with
regard to the effect of the carrying out of the improvements at the
Penistone Road end of the Ground (considered by the Officer Working Party
on 28th June, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
a letter to the Club dated 29th J u n e ) .      P.eports being received from the
Building Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
material, a p p a r e n t l y of sufficient magnitude to impair the stability of the
adjacent access ramp and associated perimeter walls and barrier rails.

2.      Ground Inspection

A.      Electronic Score and Message Board

It was noted that, since the agreement indicated at the "winter" inspection
of the Stadium on 21st February, 1982, the electronic score and message
board had been erected between the South and West Stands. Evidently, it
was proving tc be a most welcome feature.

B.      West Stand and Terrace

The Club's intentions with regard to the brick built former A.R.P. building
at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (now used as a
store) were again discussed in view of its condition.

The condition of the crack in the brickwork at the rear corner of the Stand
(nearest to the North West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

Dr. Eastwood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium.  One had
failed and been renlaced.




                                     m
IT WAS AGREED -
(i)      That, if the Club intend-* to continue to use the former A.R.P. building
adjacent to the boundary wall, the lintel over the door would require attention
in particular,' as would the general maintenance of the building.
(ii)    That the condition of the crack in the non load bearing brickwork, at
the rear corner of the Stand (nea-ast to the North West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.
(iii)   That the Club would give attention during normal maintenance to the
loose concrete rendering apparent in places.
C.     North West Terrace
As the Terrace and the West Stand were separate structures, the Club were of
the opinion that there would continue to be movement between the structures
caused by changes in weather conditions, thus making it difficult if noc
impossible to achieve a seal sufficient to permanently prevent the seepage of
water between the two.
IT WAS AGREED that this was not a matter of safety and that the Club would
continue to monitor the position.
                                        t                t


D.      North Stand
The Club reported that the further attention to the crack at the expansion
joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" requested at the last meeting was in hand
as a matter of maintenance.
E.      Spion Kon
As requested at the last meeting, the Club had investigated the spalled concrete
and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Splcn Kop (towards the
North Stand end). Acii.cn would be taken shortly to cut off the front (and
worst affected) portion of the roof, which would 3 I50 have the effect of
increasing the headroom.
Whilst certain remedial work had already been undertaken by the contractor to
stabalise the banking at the rear of the Spicn Kop following digging out
to provide new refreshment and toilet facilities, the Officer Working Party
were of the firm opinion that further work was essential. Measurements had
shown that in places there had been as much as four to five inches of
movement. Simple visual inspection showed that there was a lack of the
 ;ormer retained earth material underneath the access ramp in places, and
consequently there had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
of the existing barrier rails.   The Club would have to look to the contractor
(or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial work to the existing access
ramp and barrier rails.
As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures would
require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
new facilities (as they were not load bearing).  Barriers would have to be
provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
crowd pressures where these were capable of being generated (as also pointed
out in the letter of 29th June).
IT WAS AGREED
(i)     That the Club's proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be supported in
principle.




                                    ED
 (ii)    That as soon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
match, on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
rails must be stabilised (possibly by- drilling holes at intervals and
inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success or otherwise
of the measures tested by test loading the barrier rails (or a representative
sample) to the Green Guide requirements.

(iii)   Also prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must
be taken (a) to prevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
facilities and (b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures
where these are capable of being generated.

(;iy). . That the new buttresses to the existing boundary wall in connection
with the new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so ds not to reduce the
support to the wall, and that the need for pointing of the wall externally
in places must also not be overlooked.

?.     "Stands" Club

It was noted that there was spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel
beams underneath the "Stands" club.  It was understood that the premises
were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries Ltd.

It was also noted that there was a certain amount of deflection in the brick
built screening wall in front of the Male toilets underneath the Club if
pressure was applied to the top of the wall.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)     That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to give
attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel beams
under the "Stands" Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

(ii)    That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets
should be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.

G.     South Stand

It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the
dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed,’
and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
steel supports to the sides of the  concertina-type exit gate from the
Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)     That the Club would remove  the remaining coping stones and arrange -
for the remainder of the pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
undertaken as a matter of maintenance.

(ii)    That the Club would shortly consider a scheme to be prepared by
Messrs. Eastwood & Partners forreplacement of'both steelsupports    to
the exit gate from the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).




                                 m
H.      Ground Fitness Certificate

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that many of the matters discussed at the meeting
were contained in his Annual Ground Fitness Certificate. However, he had
delayed submitting this to the County Council, as required by the General
Safety Certificate, in view of the situation on the Penistone Road end of
the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED that Dr. Eastwood would submit his Ground Fitness Certificate
to the County Council, excluding the Penistone Road end of the Stadium at
the present time.

  it.     Further investisation revealed that, in a number of areas, listed below,
          the puoiic accress systein w£.s not audible.

          (a)       Area between the ,cop and Penistone itoad exits.

           There are speakers at tne rear of the west stand but these were not workin£

     the alterations currently being carried out at that end of the ground.

5.   3ecause of the problem with the audibility of the public address system
     it was not possible for my Officers to assess the effectiveness of the
     emergency procedures. They did, however, report that the stewards they
     questioned would have known what to do if tne message had been heard
     by them.

6.   A number of stewards vere not wearing identifiable dress, i.e. fluorescent
     tabards, as required Dy condition ?{c) of your General Safety‘Certificate.

7.   My Officers also reported that staff manning refresanient bars in the
     north and soutn stands cid not know the position of fire alarm call
     points or the position of and how to use fire extinguishers.

I have informed Hr. D. Vaughan (Secretary Officer Working Party) cf the
problems listed above and he will oe arranging a site neeting as soon as
possible to resolve the matter of the public address system. Iters 6 is
a matter which I think you can deal with yourself.

On the subject of staff training, which is a condition placed on the Club
by the General Safety Certificate, I am prepared to make my Officers
available to instruct your stewards and staff members in the emergency
procedure and use of fire extinguishers.

Please contact Divisional Officer         it the above address if you wish
to take advantage of this offer or if you require any clarification on the

Dear Mr. Wright,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Further to your letter of the 7th October re your visit and
appraisal of ’:he emergency procedure at this ground on
Tuesday, 4th October, when your Divisional Officer Johnson
came to see me after the match and explained thatiin his
opinion there were'dead1areas in our ground, as it appeared
that stewards had not heard the emergency announcement, to
say the least this surprised me, as only this last close,
season have we had the P.A. System further improved.

I have taken the opportunity this morning to try out the
svsten in all the areas that were supposedly 'deadj and
I must report that everything that was said, was heard
clearly and distinctly.

I have informed Hamraerton Road police of this, and it
has been suggested to me that perhaps it would be a
sensible idea for one or two of your officers to come
to the ground at say t.00 o’clock on Saturday, 29th
October when we play Huddersfield Town and go around the
ground with the police and hear the broadcasts for them­
selves.

Yours sincerely,




Secretary.

REPORT OF THE HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE GENERAL
PURPOSES PANEL


                              Safety of Sports Groundg


With effect from 1st April 1986, the City Council will be responsible as
Licensing Authority for the administration of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1985 in place of the South Yorkshire County Council. This preliminary report is
intended to inform Members as to the basic framework of the Act and the
delegations required to carry out the Council's functions.

A detailed report will be presented to the next meeting of the Panel by which
time investigations into the current licensing system will be complete.

The Home Office have provided a useful summary of the duties of Licensing
Authorities and a summary of the Act itself; both these documents are attached
to this Report for members to consider.

Following the Bradford disaster, the importance of the provision of a sufficient
level of safety at sports grounds has been highlighted; the responsibility of
the Council in this regard should not be underestimated.

Members will probably be aware that the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into
Crowd Safety and Control at Sports Ground (the Popplewell Report) was recently
published and a copy of its recommendations are attached to this Report for
information.

Summary and recommendations

A more detailed report will be submitted to the Panel as soon as possible but
in the meantime it is recommended that the following delegations be approved

(a)   All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports Ground
      Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel;

(b)   The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 Act be
      delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in
      consultation with Chairman or Deputy Chairman of this Panel or of the
      Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as
      appropriate.

(c)   The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be delegated     to
      the Head of Administration and Legal Department.

REPORT OF THE HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE GENERAL
PURPOSES PANEL

                          Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

Introduction

The Panel will recall that a report was submitted to the March 1986 Meeting

covering the general safety of sports grounds legislation as it affects the City

Council.   This follow-up report aims to deal   in detail,with the current           "

situation in Sheffield as inherited from the    South Yorkshire County Council.

There are 2 sports grounds currently subject    to the legislation - Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club and Sheffield United    Football Club; the     Owlerton Sports

Stadium is likely to be made subject to the legislation shortly.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club - Hillsborough

The Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited was designated as requiring a

Safety Certificate in August 1978 and such a Certificate was issued by the"

County Council on 21st December, 1979.    The Stadium is currently undergoing

major works which, when complete, will form a roof over the Spion Kop and thus

substantially improve the accommodation for spectators.

Sheffield United Football Club, Bramall Lane

The Club was designated as requiring a certificate in August 1984 but to date

a certificate has not been issued as there are outstanding works to be

completed. The County Council took the view that the certificate should only be

issued as and when the Ground was up to the appropriate safety standard and not

before.    This procedure effectively insured that the terms of the Safety

Certificate were not breached as soon as it was issued.       It is hoped that the

Council will be in a position to issue a certificate before the start of the

1986/87 season.

Owlerton Sports Stadium

It is understood that the Home Secretary will shortly be designating the Stadium

as requiring a Safety Certificate in accordance with the Popplewell Report '

recommendations.    It will, therefore, be necessary to arrange for a full

inspection of the Stadium in the next few weeks to find out what works are
- 2.

 going to be required to raise the standard of the Stadium to appropriate levels.

 The Panel is probably aware that the Stadium is Council owned but is currently

 leased to the Owlerton Sports Stadium Limited.    This Lease will expire on 1st

 November, 1987.

 Safety Certificate Standard Conditions

 At the moment the Safety Conditions attached to Safety Certificates are

 standardised throughout South Yorkshire and both the Police and the Fire Service

 have indicated that they would wish this situation to continue for reasons of

 administrative simplicity.   The Conditions do, however, give some cause for

 concern, as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.    The

 drafting of these Conditions is of particular importance as it is a serious

 criminal offence to contravene any of them punishable by the Statutory Maximum

 Fine (Currently £2,000) or 2 years imprisonment or both.


  It is proposed to re-draft the Certificate conditions, where appropriate, and to

  submit them to the Panel for approval.   The Sheffield Wednesday Certificate

 would then be replaced in accordance with Section 4 (1) (b) of the Act.    The

  Sheffield United Certificate could then be issued with the new conditions before

  the start of the 1986/87 season.    The re-drafted conditions would, of course, be

  submitted to the Fire Service, the Police and Building Surveyor for comment;

  other authoritiesin South Yorkshire could also be involved in this process.

  Existing Administrative Arrangements

  The County Council system for administering the Act is based on 2 main

  components - (a) bi-annual inspections of the Stadium; and (b) meetings of an

  officer working party.   The bi-annual inspections consist of representatives

  from all the interested authorities and involve thorough inspections of the

  Stadia and the identifying of any defects.    These defects are at the time of the

  visit brought to the attention of the certificate holder and its technical

  representative if one is present.    Depending on the nature of the faults found

  (if any) steps are then agreed between the Authority and the Certificate Holder




                                     E 9
3.

to rectify them or so arrange matters that no risk to the public occurs.       The

Working Party consists of representatives from the Police, Fire Service,

Building Surveyors and the County Council - it considers in detail various

matters (such as the Spion Kop development at Sheffield Wednesday Football

Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.       The

Working Party is effectively a co-ordinating body which attempts to ensure that

a'balanced and consistent approach is maintained to current issues at the Sports

Grounds.    Any recommendations it makes are subject to approval by this Panel.

The Health and Safety Executive                                    :~

Recommendation 9 of The Popplewell Committee's Interim Report read as follows

"There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety Executive and

the Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how best to co-ordinate and

communicate their inspections and reports”.    Bearing this in mind^the local        i

office of the Health and Safety Executive was invited to participate in the          j

administrative system for safety at sports grounds.    This invitation was

declined.    The Executive will apparently take no direct part in the




In view of this problem the Home Office was contacted and the position

explained; it appears that negotiations are under way between the Home Office

and the HSE about Popplewell's recommendation but as yet there has been no

useful outcome.

In these circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety Executive

informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite their comments on them.

It would then be the responsibility of the Executive to decide whether or not to

respond.

Fees

The basis on which fees may be charged is set out in Regulation 14 of the Safety

of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 which states "14.    A local authority may

determine the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or
amendment of safety certificates but such fees shall not in a particular case

exceed an amount commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done.”      The

South Yorkshire County Council did not fix any fees under the Regulation

apparently as a matter of policy and the Panel is therefore asked to decide

which of the following options to adopt;- (a) state as a matter of policy that

no fees will be charged in respect of Safety of Sports Grounds legislation or

(b) decide in principle to fix fees and to ask for a report back on the costs

to the Council.

Conclusion                                                       _

The Panel is asked to;-

(a)   Note the broad   outlines of the administrative system organised by the

      County Council and authorise its continuation for the time being;

(b)   Note the position of the Health and Safety Executive and request the Head

      of Administration and Legal Department to keep the Executive informed of

      all matters relating to sports ground safety;

(c)   Request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to draft new

      safety certificate conditions in consultation with the appropriate

      authorities approval by the Council;

(d)   Either resolve   that no fees will be charged under the legislation or

      request the Head of Administration and Legal Department to report on the

      Council's costs in this respect.

REPORT OF THE HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT TO THE GENZjtAL
PURPOSES PANEL

SAFETY OF  SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - THE_CURRENT SITUATION AND PROPOSALS FOR   THE
FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNCIL'SCERTIFICATION FUNCTION

Introduction

The Panel will recall that on 1st April 1986 the City Council inherited from the
South Yorkshire County Council the role of certificating Authority under the
1975 Act.   The Act itself is basically aimed at ensuring adequate standards of
safety at  designated stadia; there are three of these in Sheffield at the moment
- Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield United Football. Club, and the
Owlerton Sports Stadium. A detailed report on the Act and its application in
Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6th May 1986.

The Current Situation

The Panel at its meeting in May 1986 identified several main areas for further
investigation.

Firstly it was accepted at the time that the broad outlines of the
administrative system organised by the County Council should be continued for
the time being. This system has now been reviewed and the proposed
reorganisation is detailed later in this report.

The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive be kept informed of
all matters relating to sports ground safety and that the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about the HSE's involvement. As far as
keeping the HSE informed of safety developments at the stadia the Executive made
it fairly plain that they would not make any comments. The practice was
therefore discontinued. The involvement of the AMA in the HSE issue has been
somewhat forestalled by action at central Government level to review the HSE's
relationship with local authorities; this review was announced in the
Government's reply to the Popplewell Report but no results of that review have
yet been received.  Fortunately, however, the Council's Director of Health and
Consuaer Services has permitted his Officer's to provide ahealth and safety '
input into the decision making process in relation to safety of sports grounds. ,
This substitution, therefore, temporarily covers the absence of an inpuC from
the HSE.       -

The Panel also made reference to consultation on the safety of sports grounds
policy with the other District Councils in South Yorkshire. Unfortunately,
attempts at arranging consultation meetings have been unsuccessful to date. It       '
is proposed to try again to organise some consultations in the fairly near
future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled down in each area.

The drafting of new safety certificate conditions in consultation with the
Council's advisers has been progressing steadily and new draft conditions are
currently under consideration by those advisers. It is hoped that the new
conditions will be submitted to the Panel at its meeting in October for final
approval;^- ■>??£££•..■■ ,

As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 legislation, it should be
be made deai^ that such fees are only payable on the grant of a Certificate.
It is anticipated^, that if the Panel approves the new Certificate conditions a
Certificate will .then be issued co Sheffield United and at that time it is
proposed to deal with the question of fees.
                                        -    2   -




Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a thorough review of the legislation it has become d e a r that a
detailed administrative system needs to be established in connection'with the
Council's Certificating function. Discussions on this matter have been underway
for some time with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council's Building
Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services on the establishment
of such a system.

Accepting that the Council as the Certificating Authority will act on the-basis
of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service) the question arises as to how
that advice may be best formulated. In the past, the County Council organised
an Officer Working Party which was apparently used as a forum for discussion
between Officers prior to the final formulation of advice to the Council. That
particular working party also appeared to have had some decision making powers.

As it is essential that meetings take place due to the potential overlap of
requirements in many areas, all the Authorities and Officers have now agreed
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised form of the working party to ^
perform a similar function for the City Council. It is recommended that the
“Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist of
representatives from the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's
Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services), would function as
a forum for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
the discussion of items of advice to the Council before they are finally
formulated by the appropriate Authority. Meetings of the Group would be held at
the request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head of
Administration and Legal Department would-arrange a meeting and despatch a list
o£, items to be discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting a further list of
iteas would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken by each
Authority would be noted. It is then anticipated that detailed written advice
would be provided by each discipline and be acted upon as appropriate.

In addition, the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep copies of
all relevant correspondence which will be available to all participants in the
Group.                                                       *

Under the old County Council administrative structure the different Authorities
represented in their working party had fairly clearly defined roles within which
to operate. Although it can be seen that there is some merit in this idea the
areas of potential overlap of responsibility are quite extensive in dealing with
sports grounds. However it appears that the various Authorities and Officers
wish for some definition of roles and the following have been agreed:—

Authority                                             Area of Responsibility

The Building Surveyor                       All matters relating to the structure of
                                            stadia including crush barriers, walls,
       T       '                            etc.

South Yorkshire County   Fire Service       Fire precautions, fire alarms, means of
                                            escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                            capacity.

South iorkshire Police                      Stadium policingi evacuation procedures.
                                            ac^*2 3 S cf; emerrer.cy v e h i i i s s ar:d




                         CD
It is anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department would have an
input to the Advisory Group on (a) aspects of general safety; (b) the general
safety management of stadia; (c) various special items such as first aid
requirements. It will be appreciated that these areas of responsibility are not
e^austive but it is anticipated that any areas of doubt will be dealt with by
discussions at advisory group meetings.

Inspections

Moving on to a matter of more general policy it has been suggested that one
large-scale inspection per stadium should be carried out by the Group backed up
by a-series of inspections which will take place actually during events. ;
this proposal is in line with both the Popplewell Report and with licensing
practice in other areas.

Delegations

There is also a further question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
to the day to day decision making required for the running of the Certification-
System. At the moment decision making powers rest with the Panel but this.is a
highly impractical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently.  It seems •
that as an interim measure all routine matters could be delegated to Head of
Administration and Legal Department with other matters remaining at the
discretion of the Panel. It is proposed that when the revisedCertificate
Conditions are in force then the delegation will be much more closely defined.
Unfortunately this is not possible at the moment with the current Certificate of
Conditions.

Recommendations

The panel is recommended to:-

(a)                  Note the current situation;

(b)                  Approve the revised administrative system detailed in this report including
                     the establishment of the "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group".

(c)                  Delegate to the Head of Arinrinistraton and Legal Department authority to
                     deal with all routine matters in connection with the Administrative System.

                       The contents of the memorandum were noted and it was
                       agreed that the situation should be kept under review.


                       Owlerton Sports Stadium - Safety Management Plan
         3..
                       Mr.        presented the Safety Management Plan which is
                       designed to be capable of amendment in appropriate
                       circumstances. The idea is to place a large scale plan
                       in the stadium control room. The plan itself would then
                       provide complete information as to lines of communication,
                       stewarding, fire extinguishers, etc., at a glance. It was
                       agreed thatifche plan was a most useful inovation.


                       Owlerton Sports Stadium - Access Around the Whole Stadium

                       After some discussion it was agreed that access should be
                       maintained around the whole stadium even on the top of the
                       old south terrace.: This particular footpath should be
                       restored to a suitable condition*

             wV*t.V-   give advice on exit widths until some idea had been                   enquire

                       obtained froa tiite Company as to its future plans for -              further
                       the stadium.^ The point was made that although exit :                 into the .
                       widths could be recommended for a 4,000 capacity those                capacity
                       widths would need to increase if the capacity was to be               question.
                       raised at a subsequent time.         It is therefore desirable
                       to set a exit width, etc., at appropriate levels to
                       prevent the need for expensive works later on.

1.0   Spion Kop

1.1   The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main
      means of escape exit route from the KOP should be removed, since
      it is causing both a high risk and a narrowing of the escape
      width.                                                     B.S.

1.2   A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier
      adjacent to the tunnel exit at the north end of the KOP to be
      removed, and the crush barrier be modified to join onto the e n d —
      of the riew steel supported barrier directly 7adjacent to it.         B.S. :

1.3   A t imbe r hut at ground level, under the KOP structure should be
      removed.                                                      B.S.

1.4   An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed
_     adjacent to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended            ____
      terracing. This was agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.                   B.S.

1.5   An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding to the
      side of the Kop is corroded and torn.                                 HCS

1.6   It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving radial
      gangways had become defective.                                        HCS       ^

1.7   At some positions within the new development there is a
      difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway
      of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by a
      suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.                            HCS

1.8   Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
      minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would be
      adequately controlled by means of "ongoing" maintenance.              HCS

1.9   The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires to
      be repaired.                                                          HCS

2.0   North Stand

2.1   A broken glass panel in the west gable end   should be replaced.      B.S.

2.2   The step between seats 12 and 13 on row 43is loose and should be
       correctly bedded down.                                               B.S.

2.3   It is important to ensure that the groundman's store beneath this
      stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
      fertilisers or weedkillers.                                           HCS

3.0   West Stand

3.1   Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be
      permanently secured at the following positions

      a) between seats 1 and 14                                             B.S.
      b) between seats 20 and 28
      c) between seats 136 and 150.
       Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
       purpose.

       Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
       be correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

3.2    Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
       have a gauze inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
       onto the crowd below.                                                B.S.

3.3    It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the
       suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
       emergency exit stairway on the south end of this stand. The
       fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
       cannot easily beunfastened in the direction of travel,and is
       impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                     B.S.

4.0 - Miscellaneous Points

4.1    At a number of points within the stadium various pieces of
       abandoned builders' waste were readily available for use as
       projectiles by the crowd.  Such material should be collected and
       suitably disposed of.                                                HCS

4.2    The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
       first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
       become ill or injured within the sports ground.                      HCS

4.3    The provision of  qualified first aiders is beingreviewedat the
       moment; it is felt that the existing arrangements require                 |
       formalisation. The Club's views on this point are sought.            HCS /

Of the five FooCDall League Grounds in South Yorkshire, three (Barnsley,
Rotherham United and Sheffield Wednesday) have already been granted General.
 \ e t y Certificates by the County Council under the Safety of Sports Grounds
  *• 1975, following their designation by the Secretary of State O n the
ci.   ying out of improvements.

The Bran.aH Lane Ground of the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. was designated
by the Secretary of State in July, 1984 on the Club’s promotion to the Second
Division. The Club has already carried out a number of improvements to the
Ground, the remainder to be completed during the 1985 close season.)

Only the Belle Vue Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club Ltd. remains
undesignated (the Club remaining in th e T h i r d Division), but the County Council
is continuing to work on a goodwill basis with the Club.

The County Council has also since 1979 had a policy of "winter" and "summer"
inspections of all five Football League Grounds by Officer Working Parties
(comprising representatives of the Police, the Fire Service, the County Cou^
and the District Council’s Building Surveyor).  Such inspections have been welcomed
by the Football Clubs, who have always displayed a responsible attitude on salety
matters.

  ^   rally, the forthcoming "summer" inspections will take into account the lessons
01 che recent tragic events at Bradford and any revised advice and requirements
which may be issued by the Home Office.

I attach a copy of a Press Release issued by the County Council today,
in response to requests for information by the media on the situation
in South Yorkshire following Saturday's traffic events at Bradford.

It is reasonable to assume that revised advice and/or requirements
will be issued by the Home Office in the near future, and naturally
this will be taken into account at the forthcoming ”sunaaer" inspections
by the Officer Working Parties.                    *

In the meantime and racpgr.ising that the season has ended, I would
particularly stress the vital necessity for safety stewards to be fully
aware of and trained in their duties on the manning and opening of doors
and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire fighting equipment.

                                                Yours faithfully,

        Many thanks for your communication dated 9th August 1985*

        I can confirm that arrangements have been finalised with South Yorkshire
        Police Authorities, Hanmerton Road, for the staff concerned to Be briefed
        on matters relating to safety/emergency procedures prior to our: first heme

        The written instructions are already in existence with the amended rtwaming^
        message" of an emergency situation confirmed during season 1984/5.

  4 ; tfy Head Steward and various sectional senior stewards, are kept fully
         informed of the various matters and are responsible for advising, the
      ; "match day" staff accordingly.

  : : In addition the staff are supplied with distinguishing attire*. airf are

               Purpose of Meeting

    Bearing.in mind the F.A. Cup Semi-Final which was to take place on Saturday,
    11th April, 1981, it was felt it would be desirable for the Working Party to"
    visit the ground, especially as"a small number of matters had arisen since the
    last visit on 10th February, 1981.

    2.         Inspection of Ground

    (a)        South Stand

    The previous comments relating to the roof structure and the exterior windows in
    the Ladies’ Toilets below the stand were still applicable.

y   The L.P.G. cylinders had been removed from beneath the Stand, and the batteries
    supplying the emergency power supply for the police address had been enclosed in
    a satisfactory fire resisting metal case. Whilst the provision of an automatic
    battery charger would be a longer term solution, in the short term arrangements
    had been made for the batteries to be charged before each game and for the public
    address system to be checked relying only on the emergency battery supply. The
    indicator for the batteries condition was presently in the Public Address Box.
    It was suggested that it would be less likely to be overlooked if the indicator
    was sited adjacent to the new metal case for the batteries.

    (b)        West Stand

    As previously agreed, the Club would round off the steel supports to the new
    emergency exit (nearest to the South Stand) as soon as a grinder was next present
    at the ground.

    The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand which required pointing, the ' -
    apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the. rear of the .'
    stand, the cracks in the concrete at the top bo both sets of stairs, as well as
    the currently slight corrosion-in the base plate of the outer steel column
    (nearest to the South Stand) had all been included in the maintenance programme
    and would be undertaken shortly.-



                                       CTO      i.
                           '   r r - ', * '- ’ -   r —" V - r •   .. •; ...............• .   ..   -i w ......
(c)   ' 'N o r t h ‘West                                                                          • •• .-

The cracking of the'concreting had been attended to by injecting material from                    _
the top;— The results had'been satisfactory, except in two small areas, where                      ,—
water seepage had obviously taken place and which would receive further
attention.              '   .
                        t*-
(d)     North Stand

The expansion cracks which had appeared in the wall of the North Stand (nearest
to the Spion Kop) had been included in the maintenance schedule and would be
attended to shortly.

(e)    Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original
exit at the top of the Kop would be given attention in the close season........                    ;_

Whilst the brick built chip shop at the bottom of the new exit from the Kop had
been erected, it was not yet in use. It was noted that the siting of the
chip shop had resulted in a possible danger to spectators in that a gap into
which spectators could be pushed, or possibly stumble because of the camber, had
been created. As regards the F.A. Cup Semi-Final,

IT WAS AGREED -                            .............             ....

that a temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes should be erected between the end
of the new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps.  In the longer term, the existing barriers would need
extending to fill the gap and ideally, the area between the bottom of the new Kop
exit staircase and the original Kop exit steps should be levelled off.

3.      Ground Evacuation Procedure

Whilst the Club had been supplied with a Schedule on "Fire Instruction and Drills"
on 9th April, 1980, consultations between the County Fire Service and the South
Yorkshire Police had resulted in the production of an "Emergency Evacuation
Procedure". The Club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to all
Stewards who would be on duty for the F.A. Cup Semi-Final.

                    Dear Sir,                ^

                     SEMI-FINAL - 11TH APRIL 1981 :                   -              .....

                    On the occasion of the above match, there was an incident
                    at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in the standing
                    enclosure, which resulted in injuries to spectators
                    because of crushing.        ..........

                    From our enquiries it appears the.crushing was caused
                    through Tottenham supporters arriving late, due to
                    problems on the Motorway, and rushing to their places
                    after the game had commenced, thereby causing problems
                    to spectators at the front of the terracing who had
                    been in the ground a considerable length of time.

                    According to our turnstile readings there were 335 in
                    excess of the stipulated capacity for that particular
                    area; this was the result of Tottenham fans having
                    purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival
                    at Turnstile *N*, Penistone Road, which was the
                    Wolverhampton standing area, were directed by the
                    police to the other end of the ground where the
                    Tottenham fans were standing.

                    I give below details of injuries reported to me:-
                          30 spectators treated by St. John*s Ambulance
                                       Brigade for minor ailments, etc.

Dear Sir

FA CUP SEMI-FINAL              -   11 APRIL 1981

I would refer to the FA, Cup Semi-Final match between Wolverhampton
Wanderers Football Club'and Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, held at
Hillsborough Stadium, the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
Saturday 11 April 1981.

As you will no doubt be aware many similar Semi-Final matches have been
held at this ground without previous problems. The stadium is issued with
a certificate under the provisions of the Safety in Sports Grounds Act 1975.
This limits the total capacity of the ground to 50,174. The area of the
Leppings Lane enclosure has a capacity of 10,100.

Prior to the match itself, difficulties were envisaged because both sets
of supporters were obliged to use the Ml Motorway. This problem was added
to when a major road accident occurred on the Ml near to its junction with
the A38. The problem was exacerbated by a coach breaking down further along
the motorway, and by extensive road works. This set of circumstances
caused a large number of spectators, predominantly Tottenham Hotspur fans,
to be held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes. As you will appreciate
traffic jams built up and resulted in a sudden influx of large numbers of
football supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the
start of the match when a fairly steady build up of support throughout the
afternoon could have been anticipated.

I now wish to outline an aspect of the problem which could have been avoided
and which should be anticipated for future similar occasions.

On the day before the Wolverhampton ticket allocation was put on sale to
the public, Tottenham Hotspur played Coventry City Football Club at Coventry
in a league match. Many Tottenham Hotspur supporters stayed overnight in
Coventry and travelled the short .distance to Wolverhampton to obtain tickets
which were at a premium in London.   Others also made the journey from London
to Wolverhampton on the Sunday. This completely defeated the spectator
policy which is put into effect at these matches and which places the largest
groups of standing supporters at opposite ends of the ground. Neither of
    -the two participating Semi-Final' clubs saw fit to inform the South .
    Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Glub or the Football
    Association about this situation and in that event the mixing of supporters
    was not^roperly”catered for. " The result of this was that some 400
    Tottenham fans had to be- removed from the Spion Kop, in the interests
    of general safety and public order, and were accommodated in the Leppings
    Lane end of the ground,-. which had been designated for use by Spurs
    supporters.    .       .j

    The capacity at the Leppings Lane end is 10,100 and this obviously contains
    a safety factor. At a previous match some 400 holders of forged tickets
    gained entry into this part of the ground and were absorbed without any
    apparent difficulty. However, on this date turnstile readings showed
    that 10,435 people were admitted to this part of the ground.

    A policy of packing spectators occurs at most football grounds where
    large crowds are in attendance so that all the available space is utilised.
    On this occasion the Tottenham Hotspur fans, who had arrived early in the
    day and taken up advantageous viewing points, refused to move into the
    centre of this enclosure," thereby creating a jamming effect at the
    extremeties of it. The late arrivals caused an immediate problem upon
    gaining access to the Leppings Lane area because of rushing forward
    immediately upon entering after Tottenham Hotspur had scored a goal soon
    after kick off. This resulted in a number of crushing injuries on this
    terrace including broken arms, legs and crushed ribs. In all, some 38
    fans received treatment either at hospital or from the St John. Ambulance
    representatives present at the game.

    As a result of this the safety gates at the front of the Leppings Lane
    enclosure were opened and spectators at the front were allowed to go
    onto the playing area perimeter track to relieve the pressure within the
    terrace. Due to the problems being created by crushing, my officers also
    refused access to the Leppings Lane enclosure to -spectators waiting to
    get in. In ray view no other course of action could have been adopted in
    the interest of public safety.

    During the half time interval my officers attempted to move the spectators
    who were standing or seated within the tracks around onto the normal
    spectator areas. During this manoeuvre some rather foolish youngsters
    did run onto the pitch but the situation was quickly brought under control
    by officers within the ground.

    In conclusion I would add that there were no other incidents either
    inside or outside the ground other than those caused by the circumstances
    I have described. The circumstances I have outlined have been discussed
    at length and will be borne in mind in the planning of future similar
    events. Discussions are to take place with my officers and officials
    of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club regarding suggestions for obviating
    the problems caused within the Leppings Lane terrace on this occasion.

    Yours faithfully

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan.


 Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                                    Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End

                We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
 installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
 Leppings lane end of the ground.

                It is intended that these fences are so positioned
 that they divide this section of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
.entrance.

                By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
 should result.                           A visiting team with only a few followers
will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
retained by the home supporters.

                Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
 accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
 dictate.

                A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
 each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
 during a game. The gate could be left open, but fastened
 back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones

                                                                                          land - No. 1134531
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




   are accupied by supporters of the same team.     When establishing
                           f I
   the height we have considered that the views to the corner
   flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
   present by the perimeter fence.     We therefore propose that the
   top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
   terrace.
        This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
   but. should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
   Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James's
   Park, the home of Newcastle United.

        We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
   within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

    —       Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
   various locations around the north stand.     Now the gymnasium is
   open to the general public security to ether parts of the ground
   must be maintained.    It is proposed that gates are provided at
   the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
   gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
   stand.     A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
   prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
   Leppings Lane.

For the attention of Mr. DV Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
                                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
          Thank you             for your letter of 8 September.                                                         I am grateful
to you for accepting our letter of 2 September                                                                         as giving
the formal                        21days notice tinder paragraph 5(2)of the
General Safety Certificate.
          Tenders have to be returned by 23 September and we shall
be reporting to the club shortly thereafter.                                                                           Normally the
contractor would commence on site in not more than about two
weeks from receipt of order.                                                    Thus work is likely to begin
in early October subject to there being no objection from the
County Council.
          We may be wishing to place the formal order for the work
on about 24 or 25 September so that if there is the likelihood
of suggestions for major changes to our proposed scheme, I should
be grateful if I could have notice by that time.


                                                                                    Yours sincerely,

1_.____Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners on behalf of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
gymnasium was open to the general public,.                 . _

2.   Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered that they could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.

It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head­
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs — Eastwood and Partners
thatthe Officer Working Party  sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 1680mm high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

      (i)-       the further calculations required by the Building
                 Authority being satisfactory;

      (ii)       confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                  available at the rear of the Terrace, and

       (iii)       the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
                  under police control.




                               cm
3.    Security Gates around North Stand

Now^that the gymnasium was open to .the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates at the top of-the ramps at both ends of the North
Stand, with additional gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road
end of the Stand. A separate gate would also be placed behind the West
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Lepping? Lane.

These gates would .be fastened when the gymnasium only was ir. use so as to
provide security for the rest of the ground. However, on match days they
would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.'

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the North Stand, subject to* the gates and/or their supports, ‘
hinges, etc not impinging "on the existing critical ramp  widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4 .____ Police and First Aid Facilities

It Was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim basis'.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities during the 1980 close
season. Whilst some progress had been made in discussing details of the
facilities, no firm indication had yet been given as to when they would
actually be provided.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr..D, Vaughan should press the Club and/or its
Consultants   for a firm indication as to when the new police and first
aid facilities are to-be provided.

5.    Lottery Ticket Boxes

Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps were, to
be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should draw the Club’s attention to the.
desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act. 1975                                  ^
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

Referring t«r your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working P a r t y -
(Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans.

1.     Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should
result, concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
exit- gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
problem was of such a small scale that it could be easily coped with by
the police.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
to the proposals to instal two 1680 nan high radial barriers, with 1.15
metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:- .

(a)    the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
        satisfactory (Mr. Sheriff to contact you direct);

(h>    confirmation that adequate headroom will be available at the     rear
                                           ' ’ ' criers and gates,      ana

(c)    the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
       control.

2.     Security Gates around North Stand

The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club’s need to provide^
security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is in
use.

Provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc. do not
impinge on the existing critical ramp widths and the gates are secured
in the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the North Stand

Two other matters were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating " ' -
to the Police and First Aid Facilities and th6 siting of certain of the
Lottery Ticket Boxes.

(a)   Police and First Aid Facilities

      It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
      aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim
      basis on the understadding that the Club would provide purpose built
      replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

       It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are
       still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to give
       a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are to,
       be provided-
 (b)'" Lottery Ticket Boxes" —                                       7~

      Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
      the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramp*
      were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

      The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
      re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

 For the'attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

 Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                      Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End
                                      and Security Gates

              The work on the radial fences and security gates
  indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 which we sent to you on
  2 September 1981, is now substantially complete.
              Three first team home games have been played since the
  fences were erected. We have not heard any formal comments
  from the Working Party about the operation of the fences and
  their access gates but we understand that representatives of the
  South Yorkshire Police have inspected the work and they are
 satisfied with the new arrangements.
              To increase security it is proposed that pairs of gates
  are installed at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of
  the West Stand.                        Two copies of our drawing 3563/4 are enclosed                                                      ~

    I refer to your letter of 23 December 1981 and to the letter from Messrs.
    Eastwood & Partners - the Club's consulting engineers - relating to their
    proposals to erect a pair of security gates at the base of the two staircases
    at the rear of the West Stand at the ground. From a policing point of view I
    see no problems whatever concerning the erection of these gates, subject of
    course to them being secured in a fully open position during the time the
    public parts of the ground are occupied when matches are being played.

    Dealing now with the radial fences which have recently been installed on the
    Leppings Lane terracing, I can confirm that the fences are working particularly
    well and proving to be most satisfactory in effecting the segregation of
    opposing groups of fans. Since the fences were put up there has been no
    fixture at the ground of sufficient interest to result in that entire section
    of terracing being given to one group of fans and so I am unable to comment in
    that respect, but I see no problems whatever.

    However, there are one or two points concerning the actual construction of the
    fencing which give cause for concern from a police point of view. In some
    places the existing barrier rails have been extended up to and completely
    through the new radial fences at a height of 4*6" or so from the ground,
    making it very easy for fans to climb from one pen to another. In other
    places the existing barrier rails have been cut off short of the radial
    fences, leaving what the police consider to be dangerous pieces protruding
    into some of the gangways. This matter has been drawn to the attention of the
    Club Secretary, who has been advised of my intention to-bring it to your
    notice. I would point out that Mr. England totally agrees with police
    observations regarding the construction of the radial fences but I understand
    from him that it is being suggested that any* alterations could conceivably
    result in a reduction in the capacity of the Leppings Lane terracing. I am
    not aware of the thinking behind that but for my part see no reason why that
    should be.

    I apologise for the delay in replying to you but I am sure you will appreciate
    that the recent bad weather has necessitated the cancellation of a number of
    matches at the ground which would perhaps have provided greater experience in
    the handling of spectators within the new pens - particularly the match on
    Boxing Day.  -      .......        •—

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, I understand that
the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification
on a small number of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
of gates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of the West
Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, of
course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position during the
time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals

As regards the radial fences installed on the West Terrace and the
security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party wishes
to make the following comments

(a)   Radial Barriers on West Terrace

The matches played at the stadium since the installation of the barriers
confirm that they appear to be working well and satisfactorily effect the
segregation of opposing groups of fans. However, the entire section of
the Terrace has yet to be given to one group of fans.

The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radial barriers,
the existing crush barriers have been extended in some places up to and
completely through the new radial barriers at a height of 4*6" or so
from the ground. The effect is to make it very easy for fans to climb
from one pen to another. In other places the existing crueh barrier
rails nave been cut off short of the radial barriers in a manner which
leaves dangerous pieces protruding into some of the gangways.

(b)   Security Gates around the North Stand

You will recall that my   letter of 14th September, 1981 stated that,
provided that the gates   and/or their supports, hinges, etc., do not
impinge on the existing   critical ramp widths, the Officer Working Party
saw no objection to the   erection of the security gates.

I am informed that the manner in which the gates have been installed
has resulted in each gate's hinge impinging at least 7j" into the width
of the ramp. This means that there is a 15” reduction in width of the

As the Annual winter inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium is due

       For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


       Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                               Safety of Sports Ground Act
                         Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
                         I believe the small number of points needing
       clarification have already been discussed between
       John Strange and Mr.                                                        |   One of these refer to the
       need for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
        in fact already provided by the sheeting frame.                                                                 There is
        also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
       of reinforcement in the 100mm thick retaining wall.                                                                     There
        is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
        maintenance repair will be carried out.
                Turning now to the radial barriers -on the West
        terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
        crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
        it will make it easier for anyone who so wishes to climb
        over.            Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable•to
        leave the crush barriers as they are.                                                           If all barriers
        were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
        would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.
                                                                                                                                                  to- C

 There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
 capacity which is undesirable from the Club's point of
 view.     However from the point of view of safety a strip
 of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
 major hazard.
 ------    It should be kept in mind that the introduction
 of these radial barriers has effected a very great
 improvement from the point of view of segregation of
 spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
 view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.
 I believe that what we have done is a reasonable compromise
 between the various interests.

 refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
 crush barriers.     I have not had an opportunity to check
 this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
 the word 'dangerous' is'a little exaggerated and they
 do not of course protrude into a gangway as there is no
 gangway at this position.
           With regard to the security gates around the North
 stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
 the gate width is at all critical.     The remaining clear
 width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
 Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
 eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
 per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
 routes.     The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
 practice more than half the number tend to use the lower
 exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
 to the upper set of exit stairways.     The picture is that
 fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
 exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes.

                  There were very good structural reasons                          for pl acing
     the gates       in t h i s w a y .      The theoretical exit capacity has

    1.    Purpose of Meeting

    The purpose of the meeting was to discuss<*£he apparent difference of opinion
    on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
    and the security gates at the top of the North stand ramps, as well as to
    carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

    2     Ground Inspection

          West Terrace

    Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
    erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
    satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

    However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
    had been extended up to and, in some cases, completely through the new
    radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
    who wished co do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, in the.pen
    nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
    left unsupported.

    IT WAS AGREED -

    (i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
    prevent crowd surge -by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
    through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
    able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
    current season.

    (ii) That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
    be cut off.

                                              1'

3.     West S    t    a   n   d   :— .1 ................ \ L.   V .‘

One of the -security., gates which tha Club wished to instal at. the bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.            .....

IT WAS AGREED        that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

C ..   North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the-manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

The Club's Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.

IT WAS AGREED~ that, as the point might well have been covered -in t h e ........
initial consideration of the Club's application for a General Safety
Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

       NOTE - A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as
              suspected, the'point'had been considered at a
              meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
              the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading:-

                     "the construction and width of the ramps being
                      such that they could -quite- properly be
                      regarded as elevated roadways".

D.      Spion Kop

It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
the left of the original exit at the top of the Kop had taken place; that
the boundary fence at the top of the Kop had been reinforced, and that the
existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)              •   _)
levelled off as agreed.

E„      South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

F.     Items    of General Maintenance

IT WAS AGREED        that the following items of general maintenance required
attention:-

(i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
the exit at the southerly end of the WestStand (to be done that day), as
well   as the rounding off of thebrackets to the North Stand securitygates.

(ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
Gate "0".




                                      OUT
'(iii)    The' cracks‘in the*'concrete 'terracing of 'the- Spion Kop to be filled.'   -   ;

(iv)   The’wooden support tjo:the electrical line between the brick built
refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

(v)   The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
to the South Stand) to be pointed.

(vi)   The concrete supporting strut to the wall between the Spion Kop and
the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected(cracks and..    .. .... .
exposed bar).

G.       Temporary Structures

Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
television transmissions.,

Paragraph 20 of the Club’s General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreed
between the Police and the Club.. . The Club also were generally required to
ensure that the Stadium complied with good engineering and building practices
and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
under review, and that the Club's Consultants should give advice to the
Club.                                  *

         Future Developments

 A.      Police and First Aid Facilities

 It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
 Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
 that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
 forthcoming close season.

         Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

 The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of. their
 intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of
 some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in
 order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
 Stadium.

 C.      Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

 Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
 rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
 When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
 walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

 For the attention of Mr D Vaughan

Dear Mr Vaughan,
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
        Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End

             The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team's supporters
 as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
 their exit at the end of a gams.
             We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
 drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
 turnstiles (Nos 17 - 21 and                                                22 ~ 29),          and various runs of fencing
 and new gates.
     It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
 proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
 the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                                Yours sincerely,

                  Note of a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield
                  District) held at the Police Sports & Social Club, Niagara
                                Sheffield, on 18th April 1985

1.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

2.    Consideration of Proposals

The Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
prompted in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
time, both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
for the use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
home supporters as well.

The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
Police representatives, subject tos-

(a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
      and the wall of the inner access road;

(b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
      visiting supporters* terrace) being divided in half by a new
      central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
      pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
      to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
      secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
      on the plan to be abandoned);

(c)   the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters*
      terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
      running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
      fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral area and
      home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

(d)   the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
      installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
      area




                                    SZH)
The County Fire Service saw no objection^in principle to the proposals,
subject to more detailed investigation of 'the means of escape aspects,
and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

3.   Action

IT WAS AGREED

(a) That              Should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
o£ escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the
outcome.

(b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the South
Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
necessary detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

              Dear Sir

              SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
              SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FC

             Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1985, to discuss the proposals for
             new crowd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
             been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
             certain gates have the minimum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
             plan. It is understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
             or club officials.

              Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
              this Department.

             Yours faithfully '

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                          Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                  Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April.
                  In the interim period several of the points which you
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                                        However I
would ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                                       If these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                                             a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense .of which
would hardly be justified.                                                It is our view that in the event of
emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                                                  Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

In reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph"
(c) of my earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request
©f the South Yorkshire Police.

Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
are incoprorated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
•the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radical fence
in the right teand area of the beppings Lane End Terrace (indicated as”"heme
supporters' terrace on the plan).


                                        Yours faithfully,

the Police. Sports and Social Club, Niagara, Sheffield, on 29th July, 1985

PRESENT:                 (South Yorkshire County Fire Service).
                          (City of" Sheffield Metropolitan District Council).

                            (South Yorkshire County Council).

_1_.     Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to consider the detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.    It was
recalled that consideration of outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985. , Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
commenced, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by 'phone that
submission of the detailed proposal's for. Safety of Sports Grounds Act
approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
holidays. Hie plans also included details .of repairs to certain crush
barriers on the Spion Kop.

2.         Consideration of Proposals

The 14     detailed plans submitted "were' each considered and discussed individually.

IT WAS AGREED -8 that, subject to the following points and to the submission of      .
the necessary detailed calculations.to the Building Authority, the proposals
for segregating visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium were generally., acceptable;”

(a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes,
a pitch perimeter fence gate to* b e provided;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by. Turnstile 23 to be either
shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
(river) wall and Turnstile 2 3 y and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
the new handrail not to be less than, the width of the roller shutter gate
between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

(c)    Plan No. 6705/9A - the singlie block thickness of the interal walls
(e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to he substantial enough, and a • '
substantial stud partition (timber or steel — suitably faced) is felt to
be required;

 (d)     Plan No. 6705/10A    - same conments as for plan 9A;

 (e)    Plan No. 6705/11A     - no objection in principle* but details of exact
 location required;

 (f)   Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
 indicated;
                                                    <
 (g)    Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
 slopes as indicated or. the plan and not byr:.        arrangements to give

    over will have to be borne in mind;

    (h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
    corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
    either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
    possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

    (i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
    purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

    (j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May, 1985,
    it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by Stewards%
    who must be fit, able and properly trained.

    For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan                                   '


    Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                            -         Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                  Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
    outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.                                            We note
    the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
    by the Building Surveyors Department.                                     We believe that all the
    calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
    checking and comment.
           With regard to your detailed observations our response
    is as follows; r-iV’
    laj           We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
    the proposed *ex£ra security gate.:                                 There is already a gate "in
    the 2m wide ga|_formed by the new radial fence for use by the
    police.            This same gate will still be available for the spectators
    in emergency as" there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
    which will be under the control of the police.                                           This point may
    perhaps be clarified during the Working P a r t y rs visit on 7 August.

    (b )     ■    The foundations ‘for this fence are in fact already aligned in
                                  An Unlimited C o tfP ^ P fcistered in England — No. 1833144              -* ■

  the way you suggest.

   (c) and       (d)
                We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
  single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
  walls.         The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
  vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door                        frame.
  Stadding is not at all suitable                      in terms of strength   or
  durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

   (e^         The refreshment area is under the most westerly
  staircase up to the north west corner terrace.                         There will
  Be- an opportunity to inspect on                     7 August.

   (£>         v. The handrail is to be at             a height of 1250mm (4‘1")
  above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
  step-.

   CgJ         The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
  chamfers which will not form good footholds.

   (h)t        Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
  object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
  the'precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

                As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
  ancfc the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

   &3X         Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
  taken care of by Mr. Chester.


                It will be much easier for your Working Party to
  appreciate w&at is intended when they see the works under
  c o n s t r u e T h e r e will also be. an opportunity to see ,
  the metal decking of the South stand.                            . .

A.    Leppings Lane End

The progress o f the works to segregate visiting, supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party's meeting, held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs, Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive's letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August..

Messrs. Ekstwood^i Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building, Authority for
checking and ccnment.      '

On the inspection^ the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor' standard.of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by .
45 chamfers so’ as not .to form footholds were acceptable.

The foundations^of the n e w handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been-*"
aligned so as    maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall--,~
and the Turnstil^.(unlike the indication on the plan submitted). ^     ,a

As regards the "single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out tliat the walls were braced
by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted,
the assurances given by.Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the




                               m
dividing walls in the new toilet facilities evidently did not have any
foundations, apparently having been built straight onto the existing
concrete-slabs.  It was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick walls
in the Male1Toilets, it being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more likely to occur there than in the Femaie Toilets.

The Club pointed out that the new toilet facilities would not be completely
finished by the first match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary facilities would be available and that no building material would
be left on site.

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an existing gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the Police.
This gate would still be available for the use of spectators in an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
Police would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
However, it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be required.   It
was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by letter dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access level.

IT WAS AGREED                                                          :

(a)   that the condition of the internal walls in              the new male andfemale
toilet facilities at the rear of the Stand should be           monitored;

(b)   that the existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be
extended or have steps to provide easier access from the-new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial' fence; '                     .     : :;r,

(c)   that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence should be provided from
the new South Central Terrace Pen; ^                    -

(d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated stand
area should be securely fixed to the concrete wall;-      - : :^

(e)   that the spalling of the concrete of the wall at the front of the
upper seated stand area should receive attention as a matter of maintenance;

Messrs'.- Eastwoods..Partners' reported that" the’condition* of the^ upper
concrete o u t er ' p ot i on of the exterior wall of the Stand had been ' '"                     -
investigated and was considered to be satisfactory.

It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying pf the non-slip
surface was to conmence very shortly (and certainly be completed by the
start of the season).
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the flammability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.                                 •

C.   >. Spion Kop                    1,;                          '

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details ofri’the Club's
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part' of/that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed.: Its present'condition
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.         •-•

In view of experiences last season, the Club were.requested to. provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present. : - t - .                  ^

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.

inspected,           .--v.;-            :                •

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paixitf) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

E.     Closed Circuit Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and ^outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed "CloseSd''Circuit
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party*

IT WAS AGREED

(a)   that a 2| kg. CC>2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in hoth the
Police Control Box an d ‘the Disc Jockey Box;

(b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should h e made
secure.

     1.    Purpose of Meeting

     The purpose of the meeting wa3 to- consider the response to be given to the
     proposals outlined in the letter dated 25th October, 1985 and plans received
     from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to facilities for the disabled, an
     increased capacity for the Spion Kop and consequent additional exit routes.
     Outline details of the roof to be.erected over the Spion Kop had also been
(    provided.                              '•

     2 .____ Disabled Facilities

     The Officer Working Party expressed’reservations on both of the suggestions
     proposed by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for the disabled.       If the disabled
     continued to be accommodated in' front of the North Stand, they would still
     be in the "firing line” of rais*'"aimed~’shots and any, clear sheeting over the
     top of the area they occupied'could” constitute an unacceptable hazard to
     persons who might vacate the Worth Stand in an emergency situation by
     climbing over the front wait of the stand onto the pitch perimeter.       It was
     accepted that the means o f escape.tEDf not provide for this to be done, but
     it had to be recognised that in?practice this was a real possibility. The
     structural streng£h of such a structure would also be something of a problem.
     The other suggestion of accommodating,, the disabled in front of the perimeter
     fence along the front of the Sgion Ko& (nearest to the North Stand) was also
     unacceptable for the reasons stated        Messrs. Eastwood & Partners.

^    The suggestion of the Police representatives was that the front area of the
    I lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the terracing levelled
     to provide, say, a two— tier level landing, on which to accommodate the disabled,
     with a substantial fence at the rear. The; existing^pitch perimeter fence in
      front of this area could be removed^, and the disabled would continue to gain
     access from the ramp between the Spion Kop and-the North Stand as at present.
     This would also enable free access by the disabled to the proposed disabled
     toilets under the rebuilt terracing o f the Spion Kop.

     The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.

     IT WAS AGREED that ,the proposals fcrr the disabled*, as now
    -outlined by the Police representativesv should be supported and
     ’transmitted to Messrs .<Eastwood & Partners as the views of
     the Officer Working Party, subject to there being no obstruction of exit
     routes and flows. ---

     3 .____ Enlarged Spion Kop             ~                 !

     The Fire Service and the Building Authority, agreed" that calculations showed



                                    cm           -
that the enlarged Sri or Kr'p would provide for an increase of some 5,000
spectators on the present capacity of 16,850, and that the number of exit
widths required to achieve evacuation was 46.    The. proposals to increase the
tunnel exit bn the north side of the Kop to 8 clear units and to provide a
complete new six unit staircase on the south side were regarded as acceptable.
As when the original calculations had been made, the units of exit width
included the emergency gates in the pitch perimeter fence, but it was cons­
idered that landings in front of these gates should be constructed (as has
been done at Bramall Lane).

IT WAS AGREED that, subject to the following points, the proposals from the
enlarged Spion Kop submitted by Messrs. Eastwood & Partners were generally
acceptable:-

     (a)    adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the
            upper rear and the new south side exit routes:
     (b)    to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents’
            toilets and the new ladies' toilets in the new six unit staircase
            on the south side;
     (c)    to landings being constructed in front, of the existing emergency
            gates in the pitch perimeter fence;
     (d)    to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
            the south side and on the PenisLone Road side;
     (e)   until acceptablealternatives are     available, the new exit gates to
            be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of
            stewards.

4 .___ Roofing of Spion Kop

Whilst it was accepted that only an outlineof the roofing proposals had been
supplied to date, the Building Authority pointed out that the plans showed
that the gables were not lined.

IT WAS AGREED that this should be pointed out to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,,
as well as the fact that should any of the proposed works on enlarging or
roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the close season, it will be
a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to prevent
unauthorised access.

5 .____Crowd Flow at the Leppings   Lane End of the Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems caused by the merging of
spectators from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Lane end.

It was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the physical restraints
to achieve this could conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present
position to continue.

6 .___ Duties of Stewards Booklet

IT WAS AGREED that the draft of a Booklet prepared by the South Yorkshire Police
outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and should be distributed
to designated grounds for the information and guidance of stewards employed at
such grounds.  Factors peculiar to particular grounds could, of course, be
added if considered appropriate.

7 .___ Spot Checks at Designated Grounds

The Fire Service reported on the success of the recent spot check carried out




                                    m
at the Oakvell G r o u n d c f t h e F . a r n s l e y F o o t b a l l C l u b i n r o n j u n r t i o n wi cb t h e
Police and the Building Authority, and reported that thr Divisions of the
Brigade were being asked to carry out similar spot checks at designated
grounds in their areas.

IT WAS AGREED that such spot checks were essential to ensure that the required
standards were being maintained by the Clubs.

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Crounds Act, 1975                          -V'V'
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) net yesterday afternoon to
consider the proposals contained in your letter dated 25th October, .1935
and accompanying plans.                                ‘

1.    Disabled Facilities

The Officer Working Party expressed reservations on both of your suggestions
for the disabled. If the disabled continue to be accommodated in front of
the North Stand, they will still he in the "firing line” of mis-aiaed shots
and any clear sheeting over the top of the area they occupy could constitute
an unacceptable hazard to   persons who sight vacate the North Stand inan
emergency situation by climbing over the front wall of the stand onto the
pitch perimeter. It is accepted that the means o£ escape does not provide
for this to be done, but it has to he recognised that in practice this is a
real possibility. The structural strength of such a structure could also be
something of a problem. The other suggestion of accomsodfctingftBe disabled
in front of the perimeter   fence along the front of the Spion Kop (nearest to
the North Stand) is also    unacceptable for the reasons stated by you.

The suggestion of the Police representatives was' that the front area of the
lower Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) should have the teraatcing
levelled to provide, say, a twoitier level landing on which to.acccrcsEodate
the disabled, with a substantial fence at the rear. The existing pitch
perimeter fence in front of tfess area could be removed, and the disabled
could continue to gain access from the ramp between the Sp£on Kbp and the
North Stand as at present. This would also enable free access By the
disabled to the proposed disabled toilets under the rebuilt terracing of
the Spion Kop.

The current legislation relating to the disabled was also discussed.
In the circumstances, the Officer Working Party consider that the
proposals for the disabled suggested by the Police should be supported
subject, of course, to there being no obstruction of exit routes and
flows.

2.    Enlarged Spion Kop

The Officer Working Party agreed with yonr calculations and proposals to
increase the tunnel exit on the north side of the Spion Kop to 8 clear
units and to provide a complete new 6 unit staircase on the South side.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party agree that, subject to the following
points, the proposals for hhe enlarged Spion Kop are generally acceptable:-*      '

(a)   adequate headroom being provided between the new roof and the upper
      rear and the new south side exit routes;
(b)   to barriers being provided adjacent to the refurbished gents’
       toilets and the new ladies’ toilets in the new six unit staircase
       on the south side;
(c)   to landings being constructed in front of the existing emergency
       gates in the pitch perimeter fence (as at Bramall Lane);
(d)   to confirmation of the number of new turnstiles to be provided on
      the south side and on the Penistone Road side;
(e)   until acceptable alternatives are available, the new exift gates to
      be fitted with a turn-bar arrangement under the control of stewards.

3.    Roofing of Spion Kop

It was accepted that only an outline of the roofing proposals has been supplied
to date, but the Building Authority point out that it appears that the gables
are not to be lined and thus it would be comparatively easy for them to be
climbed.

Also the Police asked me to stress that should any of the proposed works on
enlarging or roofing the Spion Kop take place other than in the cilse season,
it will be a requirement that the areas concerned will have to be secured to
prevent unauthorised access.

4.    Crowd Flow at the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium

The Police reported on the continuing problems, caused by the merging of spectators
from all parts of the Stadium at the Leppings Sane end.

It was agreed that it was difficult to see how this could be overcome, as the
physical restraints to acieeve this could conceivably be more of a danger than
allowing the present position to continue, but I was requested to register the
noinf.

    -1.    Welcome and Introduction

    Mr. V augh an pointed- out that the Local Government Act,' 1985/ would abolish
    the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan County Councils)
    on 31st.March, 1986. From 1st April, 1986,, the Certificating Authority under
    the Safety of Sports Grounds. Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
    Council. In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
    the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it had been suggested to the
    City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
    Surveyors* Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
    Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. J. Derricott were welcomed and introduced to the
    remainder of the representatives present'.

    Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to
    the representatives for. the help and assistance which they had given to him
    in his role as Co-ordinator of the Officer Working Parties since 1978. There
    had obviously been occasions when differences of opinion and interpretation
    had occurred but', in the main, these had been resolved both amicably and
    constructively . - O O           < 0 ”'

    For the Club, Dr. Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his s e r ^ c e ^ a nd"wished

    The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
    details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded’with the letter
    dated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
    to carry out the "winter" inspection of the Stadium.

    A.      Development Proposals for the Spion Kop

    dated 29,th November^ 1985,;on;the observations made following the Officer
    Working Party meeting held on           ember.;
                (i)    Sheeting of Outer Face

               Dr. Eastwood reported that the slieeting of 'the enlarged Spion Kop at
               the rear and sides would result in the structure being virtually
               sealed.  In reply to queries from the County Tire ‘'S e r v i c e , he confirmed
               that no storage would be allowed under the structure and that checks
               for any accumulations .of rubbish would be imdert^fcen-on a regular basis.

     To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to; provide facilities for the
     disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop'(nearest t o t h e H o r th Stand) were not
     unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender'figures.
   ; (opened on Monday) for the enlarged* roofed Spion T£op. H e still considered
     that any such proposals would involve the loss of.up .to*X,000pf ihe extra
     5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
   " Other areas of •the Stadium had also been considered and investigated, but '
     none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible area as that in front of
     the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long without any major
     problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants., used the area. The only
     major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
   . could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever xoof <of the North
     Stand extending virtually to the pitch. Tor this reason, theClub were willing
     to roof an area from approximately the letter "0"on the results “board to the
  .."..end of the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) with a substantial roo$, including
    rarmoured glass .where there might be a visibility problem, ^provided that this
   .was supported by the Officer Working Party.
         *■y        ju<£■ ...— AL.-te.">-   . •
’'^.Whils't^accepting much of what Dr. Eastwood said, the Officer Working Party
     :(and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed sans, concern as
     to whether making semi-permanent facilities for the disabled in ^ront of the
     North Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.

        The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
        considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building
        Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictly apply to the roofing of the
        enlarged Spion Kop.
IT WAS        that, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
plans ox the suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

C.    Ground Inspection
      (D    West Terrace and Stand

The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
to the xeax of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

Dr. ILastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the ^ipper seated area”*

The.area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

As previously:mentioned by Dr. Eastwood', the possibility of providing an
increased width access to the pitch area (between the. North Stand and the
Spion Kqp) for j>ossih1e use by emergency vehicles, as well as for maintenance
by the Clid> was discussed. The facility could be incorporated into'the
enlarged Spion"Koppxoposals relatively easily.

lit WAS AGREED that,-whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
|was not essential ±or their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
 vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

       (iv)   Spion Kop

Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,
roofed, Spion "Kop, and confirmed that steps would be taken to prevent
unauthorised access to areas where work might be in progress during the
cpurse.of the season.
                       ' -V^vrs-'.r                                   "
It was noted that the additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the
front c o m e r nearest to the South Stand, with a stepped arrangement to
assist access and egress, had been provided.

        (v)   South Stand

 It was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden floor of the upper
 portion of the Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
 acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
 solution to the flammability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.

          Road turnstiles)                        are showing signs of spalling due to
          corrosion of the reinforcement.                                          The cracks should be repaired
          with either liquid epoxy or by epoxy mortar.

      Note of a visit->to the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield

1.      Purpose of Meeting............     .         .... .

Mr. H. E. McGee, the Club's Chairman, welcomed the Working party.       *

As had been explained in theChief Executive's letter dated 10th January to
the Club, the County Council felt it was desirable to introduce a twice-
yearly programme of visits by the Officer Working Parties to all five of
the League Football Grounds in South Yorkshire (namely, early in the year and
also in the middle of the Year) in an effort to maintain public confidence
in their safety at football grounds. Additionally, at the other grounds,
it was hoped that this procedure would obviate the rea'l possibility of the
Clubs carrying out works which might prove- abortive or require additional
work on designation. This was the first of such a programme of visits.

2 .______ Inspection of Ground

Mr. McGee left to attend to other business, and the remainder of the
representatives made a tour of inspection of the ground. It was agreed
that the majority of matters revealed (detailed below) could be regarded
as routine maintenance.

(a)     South Stand

The detailed inspection of a mutually agreed part of the roof structure
had taken place on 13th/14th January after the erection of scaffolding and
platforms. Bearing in mind the age of the stand, relatively little
deterioration had taken place. It had been agreed that the apparent
deflection in the steel trusses should be monitored over a period of time.
Whilst there were signs of water staining on the roof timbers, it was by
no-means certain if water penetration was still taking place. It was
agreed that the area around the roof hatch should be particularly investigated
which would also give the opportunity of inspecting the roof tiles generally':

It was also agreed that should any of the exterior windows in the Ladies'
Toilets below the stand be broken, they would be replaced by wired or some
such safety glass.




                                 523
     Except for the continuing maintenance of the concrete terracing and crush
     barriers,..the only.matter,, requiring, attention was., the infilling of a step
     adjacent to the handrail on the left of the original exit at the top of
     the Kop.
                              i
     The Club had received Planning Permission and Building Regulation approval
     to the erection of a brick built chip shop at the bottom right of the new
     exit from the Kop (viewed when descending).       The siting of the chipshop
     would not interfere with the egress from the new            Kop exit.

      (c)“ ‘   North Stand
                               ••   .
     Expansion cracks had appeared in the wall of    the North Stand(nearest    to
     the Spion Kop) which required attention.

     The Club were in the process of building showers and changing accommodation
     attached to the existing gymnasium at the rear of the Stand. The public
     did not have access to the facilities. Additionally, the Club were
     investigating the possibility of acquiring property in Vere Road so as to
     provide an alternative exclusive access to the gymnasium without using
     the existing access through the ground.

     Revised proposals for the facilities to be provided in the new Police Post       ^
     and Firsc Aid facilities had been agreed, and it was intended to build   •'*
     permanent accommodation in virtually the same position as the existing       ,T-.T<
     temporary structures.                                                   ' ‘

      (d)      North West C o m e r Terrace

     The Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the concrete
     on the terracing, which the Board were to consider shortly.

      (e)      West Stand

~)   Some cracked brickwork at  the rear of the stand required    pointing and then
^    checking to see if the cracks re-opened.

     ^Apparent distress on the concrete pillar supporting the steps at the rear
      of the Stand required urgent attention, and attention ought also to be
      given to cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs.

     The weathering and corrosion in the base plate of the sheeting column in
     the south-west c o m e r of the stand required attention, possibly by concrete
     sheeting.

     Finally, the steel supports to the new emergency exit (nearest to the
     South Stand) still required to be rounded off.

      (f)      Police Control Facilities

     The Club pointed out that the police now had exclusive use of the box
     (overlooking the whole of the ground) previously used by the disc jockey.
     The disco unit had been re-sited underneath the original box.




                                        da
The Club outlined the consideration being given to the siting of caravans
outside the Penistone Road and Leppings Lane ends of the ground to sell --------
tickets.  It was hoped, that if this took place, increased entry flow of
spectators to the ground would result by reducing delays at the turnstiles.

4 .______Bar Facilities" .:
                              *

The Club also outlined' “he consideration being given, at the request of
the Police, to revised bar facilities at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground.              ......     ....... _ .

5 .______Future Developments

Whilst the proposals were in a very preliminary stage, consideration was
being given by- the Club-to the provision of an Executive Club... at the -----     _
Leppings Lane end of the car park under the South Stand and the adjoining
store area. There was. also a possibility of the existing office accomm­
odation being extended outwards. Additionally, the reception lounge
might be extended, the kitchen area moved and a new Directors' Room built.
It was stressed that these were long term plans and no firm proposals existed
at the moment.

1 ._____ Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on. 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2 ._____ Inspection of     Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)       South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be given.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)       West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the-Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.                                        ^




                                     ED
The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

It was also noted'that' the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been -protectively wrapped—    ---- ---- —   — .. :—

(d)   North Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)   Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the -top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
be attended to shortly.

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps- (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

(f)   General   .............

It was noted

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion
Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

    1      Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the usual summer inspection carried out of all.Football
League Clubs in South Yorkshire (originally referred to in the Chief
Executive’s letter to the Club dated 10 January 1981).

    2______ Ground Inspection

A          West Stand

•It was noted that there was light surface corrosion at the foot of the
 steel supporting pillar nearest to the North-West Terrace. As there was
no enclosing wing to the stand, the pillar was open to the elements.

The possibility of spectators climbing onto the roof of the store shed to
the rear of the stand and adjacent to the boundary wall was discussed.

IT WAS     AGREED -

(i)     That the Club would arrange for thefoot of the steel supporting
pillar to be cleaned and paintedandpossibly for thegusset    plate to be
covered by a concrete haunch.

(ii)   That the Club would consider whether any useful purpose would be
served by retaining the store shed adjacent to the boundary wall.

(iii) That the Club would investigate and make good the crack in the.
concrete adjacent to stand entrances "W" and "X".

B         North West Terrace

It was noted that the cracks in the concrete underneath the Terrace had
been repaired and appeared satisfactory. However, there was seepage of
water between the North. West Terrace, atid the.West Stand.in heavy rain. .'V ;

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club'would make good the bitumastic sealing
between the.Terrace and the West Stand.    ,

C         North Stand~r~,~Ty~       — -       •   ...   -....:.....

A crack in the concrete at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance
"R" was noted.

IT WAS A G R E E D T h a t the Club would investigate and make good the crack.---

D         Spion Kop

The Building Authority suggested that at some future date the Club should
consider giving attention to the original steps at. the rear of the Kop
(at the bottom of the new staircase) so as to remove the slight downward
tilt and ensure a common height of risers.

IT WAS AGREED - That, whilst there had been no reported incidents, the Club
would bear the suggestion in mind for attention at a'future date.

E         South Stand

The Club reported that-the gantry access to the Commentary Box on the top
of   the Stand was not now used, except by ground maintenancestaff.

IT  WAS AGREED - That the Club would replace the missingrings         in the chain
used as a handrail on the gantry.

F         Crush Barriers

The Club reported that the remaining third of the crush barriers on the
Spion Kop had now been tested. The only problem had been rusting of some
of the clips over the top tubes. These had been replaced or would be
replaced by the start of the Season on 28 August.

A visual inspection had also been carried out of the clips on the crush
barriers on the West and North-West Terraces, and similar action taken.

G Police and First Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand were well
on the way towards completion, and would be utilised at the opening match
on 28 August.                                <=-- -—
      .


.H        Penistone Road Side

It was noted.that the steel girders adjoining the wall at the rear of the
Butcher’s Shop had been satisfactorily attended to, and that the Folding
Exit Gates had had new tops and runners installed and the concrete made
good.

So far as the proposal to re-site an existing toilet block to the rear of
the Spion Kep to enable additional turnstiles and an exit gate to be
installed was concerned, the Club had reported to the Chief Executive
by letter that this had had to be deferred until the end of next season
due to the size of the problem and the possibility of creating hazards for
spectators.

                         Television Camera Facilities

                 It was.noted that the scaffolding"Tower erected'on the Spion Kop for.
                 Television camera.purposes had now.been removed.

                 There-did-not-appear”to.have been- any progress with the Television..

                 J   .   Fire-Fighting Equipment                     .

                 Whilst the Club were*confident that all of the fire extinguishers, etc,
                 were still sited as originally required by the General Safety Certificates
                 the County Fire Service felt that a routine inspection of the equipment
                 would now be appropriate.

                 K       Maintenance

                 Certain areas of spalled concrete in. the Stadium required attention, and
J                the Club had the work in hand as items of routine maintenance.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


 Dear Mr. Vaughan,

                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd .
                          Minutes of Meeting held on 24 August

              Thank you for sending us a copy of your note of the
 proceedings of the meeting.                                          My one comment                 on these minutes
 is that although the leakage of water between the north
 west terrace and west stand was discussed, there was
 no commitment to effect a repair.                                                   This is not a matter
 which in any way affects the ground safety at this moment.
 As I explained, creating the perfect seal at a junction
 of this kind which is subject to opening and closing with
  change in temperature is extremely difficult and quite
 expensive.           The polysulphide sealant which would need to
 be used would itself cost not less than £200 to install
 but we fear that unless a carefully shaped chase is cut
  into both the concrete and the brickwork the sealant
 will not work.                 Thus an expenditure of quite a few hundred
  pounds would be necessary and the Club is unlikely to
 wish to spend this money on a matter which does not
  present a hazard to spectators.                                                 Nevertheless, we will                              Ce-py       1®
  suggest that this be put on the list of items which might                                                                          Wo               T

                             (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1 ._____ Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the usual winter inspection carried out of the Football
League grounds in South Yorkshire (originally referred to in the Chief
Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981), as well as to
discuss and comment on the Club's proposal to erect a new score and
message board (referred to in the letter and plans from Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners dated 7th February, 1983).

2.     New Score and Message Board

The new board was to be erected in the south west corner of the ground
between the South and the West Stands at a-height of some 7 metres above
the terrace level. The siting and construction of the supporting pillars
were such that there would be no appreciable effect on the number of
spectators who could be accommodated on the terrace.

The Building Authority regarded the detailed drawings and calculations as
satisfactory, and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners outlined the steps taken to
take effect of wind and ice-loadings on the structure. The South Yorkshire
Police were satisfied with the assurances given that the structure would,
for all practical purposes, be climb proof. The South Yorkshire County
Fire Service saw no objection to the proposal.

IT WAS AGREED That the Officer Working Party saw no objection to the
proposal, and that Mr. D. Vaughan would reply to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners
to this effect.

3._____Ground Inspection

A.    West Stand

It was noted that, whilst the foot of the steel supporting pillar had been
cleared of light surface corrosion and its gusset plate had been covered
by a concrete haunch (as agreed at the summer inspection on 24th August,
1932), it still required to be painted.




                                 S3
It was also noted that the crack in the concrete adjacent to stand entrances
"W" and "X" had been made good.

The Club had also been requested at the summer inspection on 24th August,
1982, to consider whether anyuseful purpose would be served by retaining
the store shed at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall.
This point was repeated, and the South Yorkshire Police added that at
some time in the future they hoped the Club would be able to provide some
form of segregation, as well as separate bar and toilet facilities, to
separate home   and visiting supporters at the rear of the Stand.

IT WAS AGREED   that the new expansion crack in the brickwork at the rear
corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should be
monitored to ensure its condition did not worsen.

B.     North West    Terrace

It was noted that the seepage of water between the North West Terrace and
the West Stand in heavy rain (also raised at the summer inspection) apparentl
continued to occur.

IT WAS AGREED that, whilst not being a matter of safety, the Club should
be recommended to replace the bituman impregnated fibre board as a matter
of maintenance to overcome the seepage problem.

C.    -North Stand

The crack at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance          "R" (which the
Club had been   requested to investigate and make good at the summer
inspection) had received some attention but could not be regarded as
satisfactory.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would give further•attention to the crack.

D.     Spion Kop

All of the crush barriers had been tested since certification, the main
problem having been rusting of some of the clips over the top tubes on
certain barriers.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would investigate and make good the spalled
concrete and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop
(at the North Stand end).

E.     South Stand

In view of recent adverse weather conditions, the agreement to visually
inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection after exceptional gale
or snow loading was recalled.  It was noted that the sixth roof truss from
the East Gable (including the Gable) particularly appeared to have deflected
since the summer visit.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That some form of measuring the evident deflection in the roof
trusses was desirable, and the Club were requested to consider whether sone
form of quick and/or economic method of doing so could be devised.

(ii)   That the Chief Fire Officer be requested to consider tho suitnbilitv
from a fire resistance'point of view of the elnddim; in the first floor
enclosed link bridge from the Stand to the Restaurant.

F.     Police and First Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand had been
w elcomed by the users" ajKcT'UetfS proving to be most useful”!

G.     Maintenance

It was noted that certain items of maintenance throughout the ground
required attention.

IT WAS AGREED that under this general heading the Club would look particularly
into the loose wiring at both ends of the South Stand, at the pointing and
spalled concrete in the Male Toilets at the Spion Kop end of the South
Stand, and at the pointing required to the wall (including coping stones)
and the loose metal sheeting between the South Stand and the Spion Kop.

H.    Floodlighting Pylons

Whilst the electrical contractor’s staff obviously had to climb the flood­
lighting pylons from tine to time, it appeared that no regular inspection
of the pylons took place from a structural safety point of view.

IT WAS AGREED that a regular inspection of the floodlighting pylons from
a structural safety point of view was desirable, say, every, two or three
years, and that to establish the present position, an inspection  of one of
the pylons should be carried to see what was revealed.

I.    Painting of Structural   Steelwork, Roof Trusses, etc.

Whilst not being a matter of immediate concern, the Officer Working Party
felt it would be in the Club's own interests to institute a programme for
the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, et.c.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club should be requested to consider instituting a
programme for the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, etc. on
a regular basis.

J.    Penistone Road Side

The Club were not yet in a position to say when the proposed improvements
at the Penistone Road side of the Ground were likely to be implemented.

ANNUAL INSPECTION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM AS REQUIRED BY THE
                             CERTIFICATE OF GROUND SAFETY


                  On 16 August 1982, I made an inspection of the ground,
after having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
on Spion Kop tested by members of my staff under my control.
                  At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 43, 44, 45,
46, 51, 52, 53, 54,                           62, 63, 63A, 65, 66, 72,                         73, 74, 75, 76,     78,
79, 80, 86, 87, 88,                           89, 91, 92, 94, 95, 97,                         98, 99, 100, 101, 103,
104, 105, 107, 108,                          109and 110 were tested                           in accordance with the
procedures laid down in the Guide to Safety                                                   at Football Grounds.
All the barriers sustained the test load although in some instances
the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed.                                                     These clips have
been replaced.                 At the same time, other clips and horizontal rails
showing signs of advanced corrosion were replaced.
          I am now able to certify that all 41 barriers have a
satisfactory strength.
                  Two radial fences have been installed on the Leppings
Lane terrace to segregate spectators.
          Gates have been installed at various locations around
the ground to prevent intruders entering the stands.
                  Repairs have been carried out to six stanchions
supporting sheeting along the boundary wall near gate 'O' on
Penistone Road.

            D. Sheriff (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council)
            D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

 1.______ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was primarily to carry out the "summer"
inspection of the Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly
visits to Football League grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate
Officer Working Party.

In particular, the Officer Working Party wished to see the position with
regard to the effect of the carrying out of the improvements at the
Penistone Road end of the Ground (considered by the Officer Working Party
on 28th June, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
a letter to the Club dated 29th June). F.eports being received from the
Building Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
material, apparently of sufficient magnitude to impair the stability of the
adjacent access ramp and associated perimeter walls and barrier rails.

2_.______Ground Inspection

-A.      Electronic Score and Message Board

It was noted that, since the agreement indicated at the "winter” inspection
of the Stadium on 21st February, 1983, the electronic score and message
board had been erected between the South and West Stands. Evidently, it
was proving to be a most welcome feature.

B.      West Stand and Terrace

The Club's intentions with regard to the brick built former A.R.P. building
at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (now used as a
store) were again discussed in view of its condition.

The condition of the crack in the brickwork at the rear corner of the Stand .
(nearest to the North West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

Dr. Eastwood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium.  One had
failed and been replaced.
IT WAS AGREED -
(i)     That, if the Club intend-  to continue to use the former A.R.P. builcir-g
adjacent to the boundary wall, the lintel over the door would require attention
in particular, as would the general maintenance of the building.
(ii)    That the condition of the crack in the non load bearing brickwork at
the rear corner of the Stand (nea_'2 st to the North West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.
(iii)   That the Club would give attention during normal maintenance to the
loose concrete rendering apparent in places.
C.      North West Terrace
As the Terrace and the West Stand were separate structures, the Club were of
the opinion that there would continue to be movement between the structures
caused by changes in weather conditions, thus making it difficult if not
impossible to achieve a seal sufficient to permanently prevent the seepage of
water between the two.
IT WAS AGREED that this was not a matter of safety and that the Club would
continue to monitor the position.
D„      North Stand
The Club reported that the further attention to the crack at the expansion
joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" requested at the last meeting was in hand
as a matter of maintenance.
£.      Spion Kop
As requested at the last meeting, the Club had investigated the spalled concrete
and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (cowards the
North Stand end). Action would be taken shortly to cut off the front (and
worst affected) portion of the roof, which would also have the effect of
increasing the headroom.
Whilst certain remedial work had already been undertaken by the contractor to
stabalise the banking at the rear of the Spion Kop following digging out
to provide new refreshment and toilet facilities, the Officer Working Party
were of the firm opinion that further work was essential.  Measurements had
shown that in places there had been as much as four to five inches of
movement. Simple visual inspection showed that there was a lack of the
lormer retained earth material underneath the access ramp in places, and
consequently there had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
of Che existing barrier rails. The Club would have to look to the contractor
(or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial work to the existing access
ramp and barrier rails.
As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures would
require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
new facilities (as they were not load bearing). Barriers would have to be
provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
crowd pressures where these were capable of being generated (as also pointed
out in the letter of 29th June).
IT WAS AGREED
(i)      That the Club's proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be supported in
principle.
(ii)     That as s'oon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
match, on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
rails must be stabilised (possibly by drilling holes at intervals and
inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success or otherwise
of the measures tested by test loading the barrier rails (or a representative
sample) to the Green Guide requirements.

(iii)   Also prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must
be taken (a) to prevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
facilities and (b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures
where these are capable of being generated.

(iv)    That the new buttresses to the existing boundary wall in connection
with the new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so as not to reduce the
support to the wall, and that the need for pointing of the wall externally
in places must also not be overlooked.

F.     "Stands"   Club

It was noted that there was spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel
beams underneath the "Stands" club.  It was understood that the premises
were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries Ltd.

It was also noted that there was a certain amount of deflection in the brick
built screening wall in front of the Male toilets underneath the Club if
pressure was applied to the top of the wall.

IT WAS AGREED:-   .

(i)     That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to give
attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel beams
under the "Stands" Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

(ii)    That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets
should be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.

G.     South Stand

It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the
dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed, '
and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
steel  supports to the  sides of theconcertina-type exit gate from the
Stand   (nearest to the Spion Kop).

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)   That the Club  would remove   the remaining coping stones and arrange
for the remainder of the pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
undertaken as a matter of maintenance.                                         «

 (ii)  That the Club would shortlyconsider a scheme tobeprepared by
Messrs. Eastwood & Partners forreplacement of both steelsupports to
the exit gate from the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).




                                 E   0
H.      Ground Fitness Certificate

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that many of the matters discussed at the meeting
were contained in his Annual Ground Fitness Certificate.  However, he had
delayed submitting this to the County Council, as required by the General
Safety Certificate, in view of the situation on the Penistone Road end of
the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED that Dr. Eastwood would submit his Ground Fitness Certificate
to the County Council, excluding the Penistone Road end of the Stadium at
Che present time.

       Annual Inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium as required
                            by the Certificate of Ground Safety


              On 25 July, 1983 I made an inspection of the ground after
having had approximately one fifth of the crush barriers
 tasted by members of my staff under my control.

              At the end of June, crush barriers numbers 121, 122, 123,
 1 2 4A, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130,                                           131, 132, 133, 134, 135,
 13 6 (part), 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144                                                          (part), 145
 (part), 146            (part), 147, 148, 149                                  (part), 150, 151, 152, 153
 and 154            (part), all at the Leppings Lane end of the ground
were tested in accordance with the procedures laid down in the
Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.

              In all bu't one case the barriers sustained the test load
although in two cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
deformed.             These clips were on barrier 136 between spans 6-7
and 8-9.             New clips have been f i tt ed.

              The only failure was the centre support of barrier 141
where the angle leg parted where it was badly corroded.                                                                  The
 angle has been plated and new bolts inserted.

              I am now able to certify that all the barriers tested
have a satisfactory strength.

              Various minor items of remedial work to concrete walls
 at the back of the North stand, steps and terracing on Spion

Kop and protection of the North side gable stanchion in the
West stand have been completed as part of the maintenance
programme.

      Certain other items of maintenance work which it is
suggested should be carried out in the near future have been
recommended to the Club.       A list is attached.

     New toilets and turnstiles have recently been constructed
behind Spion Kop.       During these operations the ramp down the
back of Spion Kop was disturbed by movement of the embankment.
In particular the hand rail and concrete wall guarding the
edge of the gangway moved sideways.       The hand rail and wall
have now been tested in accordance with the requirements of
the Code of Practice and in all but one case, where there was
excessive deflection of a hand rail post, successfully
‘resisted the test load.

     Following these inspections and tests,, I certify that in
my opinion the various structures on the ground are in a
-satisfactory condition and are appropriate for the stadium to
be used to the full capacity laid down in the Certificate of
Ground Safety.

Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football League
grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate Officer Working Party.

The Club reported that the majority of the items listed as normal maintenance
items following the "summer" inspection had yet to be carried out. This was
due to a combination of the change in Club Secretary and certain development
proposals (outlined on a confidential basis) which the Club had in mind.
However, those which the Club's staff could undertake would be commenced shortly
and tenders had been invited and received for the urgent remaining larger
items (to be carried out commencing in Ma y ) . The exception was the roof of the
tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the North Stand end) in view of its
possible inclusion in the development proposals outlined.

2 ._____Ground Inspection

A.     West Stand and Terrace

It was noted that the former ARP building adjacent to the boundary wall was
in the process of demolition and the site cleared  and levelled. This would
have the additional benefit of improving the access/egress.

3.     North West Terrace

It was noted that whilst generally the sealing of  the cracks beneath the Terrace
to prevent seepage of water had been successful, there was still a slight
seepage from one of the repairs.

The possible need for protection of the wire mesh on the inside of the upper
access deck was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That the Club would continue to monitor the slight seepage of water
from the repaired cracks under the Terrace.

(ii)   That the possible need for lateral bracing co Che frame of the•wire
mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access deck be investigated by a
test loading during the forthcoming close season.
c.     Spion Kop

As previously indicated, the Club confirmed that the remedial work to the
existing access ramp and barrier rails required as the result of the
construction of the new refreshment and toilet^ together with the erection
of barriers to prevent access to the roofs of the new facilities, had been
carried out.

The present condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the roof of
the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop was inspected.

The stability of the perimeter wall at the Penistone Road end of the ground
was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That theBuilding Authority and Mr. J. Strange of    Messrs. Eastwood &
Partners should discuss and inspect that part of the perimeter fencing
erected at the northern end cf the ramp to prevent access to the roofs of the
new facilities.

(ii)  That the Club would undertake continuous maintenance work on theroof
of the tunnel exit, pending a decision on any development proposals.

(iii) That the Building Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood should discuss and inspect
the stability of the perimeter wall at the Penistone Road end during the
forthcoming close season.

D„    Lighting     Pylons

The Club undertook to carry out a visual inspection of the lighting pylons during
the forthcoming close season and to make more detailed inspections should this
prove to be necessary after the visual inspection.

E.    Emergency Lighting, Fire Alarm and Public Address   Systems Test

IT WAS AGREED - That the County Fire Service in conjunction with the South
Yorkshire Pol_ce and the Club’s staff, would carry out a test of these systems
at the evening match against Fulham to be held on 7th March.

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                     ‘                          Testing of Crush Barriers
                 The barriers at the North West corner of the ground
are due to be tested this year, which will complete the fi— st
five year cycle.                     As -the ground is being used by a congress of
Jehovah's Witnesses during early July, we shall be carrying
out the tests during June.
                 Mr. Sheriff will be informed of the arrangements so
that he can carry out his usual inspections.


                                                                                                  Yours sincerely,

                  On 18 and IS June, crush barriers 155, 156, 157, 158, 159,
 160, 164, 165, 165, 167, 167A, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173,

  (spans 1 and              2.}f 184                  and 185, on the north west corner terrace,
 were tested in accordance with the procedure laid down in the
 Guide to Safety at Football Grounds»                                                 The barriers are shown
 on the attached print of our drawing 1610/64C.
                  Barriers 161, 162, 163, 180 (spans .1 and 2), 181, 183
  (spans 3 and 4) and 186 could not be tested because being                                                                      very
 close to the back a£ the terrace the testing rig would not fit
 into the space available.                                               Because the distance behind these
barriers is so resitricted it is extremely unlikely that the few
 people behind them will exert the full load suggested in the
 1green 1 guide„

                  In all cases tested the barriers sustained the test load.
                  On 20 June the fencing along the internal edge of the
 access walkway at the rear if the north west corner terrace was
 tested.               Thirteen spans were tested and although the wire mesh
deformed by as much as 36mm during the load application,

 recovery at the end of the final test was 1 0 0 %.
      On 22 June the concrete parapet wall along the front cx
 the suspended section of terracing, in the north west corner
was tested.    During the load application, movement of the
wall was so small that readings using the measuring e q ui p m e n t
 could not be taken.
      Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing
 the results of all the tests on the barriers and fencing.
We are pleased to report that none of the barriers needs
 strengthening work.
      This set of tests now complete the five year test cycZs
 at the ground.

    fence at the front of the Terrace should be repaired, or replaced.

    C„         North West Terrace

    The wire mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access desk had be==

Mr. Vaughan have detailed comments.

(ii)      That the removal of loose coping stones and the pointing of the wall
between the Spion Kop and the South Stand (mentioned at'the 11th August, 1983

(iii)     That, as it apparently now serves no useful purpose, the damaged
corrugated metal sheeting between the Spion Kop and the South Stand should be
removed.

(iv)      That pointing work should be carried out as a matter of urgent
maintenance to the outer perimeter wall pending agreement between the Building
Authority and Dr. Eastwood as to its stability (during the present close -season.,
as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection).

(v)        That the redundant wooden postand loose wire adjoining thewalkaway

L.     Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2.____Ground Inspection

As..   South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
h.ad been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

(iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

B.     West Stand and Terrace

The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
temporary barriers. This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.
IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
usual way.

(ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

C.   North West Terrace

No comments.

D-   North Stand

IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
the area would be regarded as acceptable.

£•   Spion Kop

It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
Club’s development proposals proceeding'; that the loose coping stores
had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and, that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

ir WAS AGREED -

(i)  That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(ii) That the Club vould carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

F.   Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

3.   Public Address System

The Club pointed out that an improved public address system had been installed,
and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
better than the previous system.
4.    Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club’s
Architect and had been formally approved. ■

The Club reported that the scheme for the general up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for improved toilet
and catering facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board's decision whether to proceed with the scheme.

I refer to ths meeting of" the General Purposes Panel of the City Council which
took place on Thursday 21st, Aisnisx 1956 which you and other representatives of
the Club attended*

I am writing to confirm that the Panel agreed to increase the capacity of the

     (a)     that the Infillinjf t r f crush barriers takes place prior to the catch
             on 25th August."

     (b)     the other worfc refereed" to. before th» Panel be completed within 2
             weeks (i.e. by 4th September 19S6)?

     Cc)     extra stewarding be rrovideddurlng the next 2 matches to the .
             satisfaction of the Fire Service- and the Police.

Obviously, all vorfc is to Be carried out to the satisfaction o f the
Certificating Authority end cite- Panel authorised ne to take any necessary action
to secure compliancewfth the abov^ conditions*

                                                                                            ; ■ - ■ y . *.v

    During Mr. BownesV visit to the natch on 25th Aupust it was noted that very
    little of the fencing which should have been installed to protect the sheeting
    at thp rear and sid*»<* of tb<? Kop was In fact in place and •ft is also understood
    that the P.A. System on the Kop was not in operation during that natch. It was
    also noted that several pieces of fencing were in fact wired to the structure of
    the Kop presumably as a temporary measure.     1 consider these items important and
    that it is in everyone's interest that they are dealt with immediately and in
    any event before the match on 30th August.

    I have sent a copy of this letter to Dr. Eastwood as usual.

    Yours faithfully.

For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes,


Dear Mr. Bownes,

                                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                                          Safety of Sports Grounds Act 19 75

               As requested in your letter to the Club date d 8
January, we reply to your letter dated 4 December.                                                                We will
reply to your earlier letter, dated 22 April, in the next
couple of days.

               Going through the list of items accompanying your
letter of 4 December the following are being done or have
already been done by the ground staff - 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6,
1.8, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2 and 4.1.

               The concrete post mentioned in item 1.2 has been
taken down and a new barrier rail fitted to an existing
steel post.

                I have not had the opportunity of speaking to Dr.
Eastwood about the rail in item 1.4.                                              ‘He left for
Australia the day after I returned from six weeks leave.
However, enclosed is an extract from the terrace layout.
Is it the rail which is shown in red that was agreed to?

                Item 1.7 is not understood.                                 You will recall that
just before opening the Spion Kop, handrails were erected

alongside the radial barriers where the members of the
Officer Working Party considered that the step between the
gangway and terrace was excessive.     I cannot find anywhere
on the new terracing where an unprotected drop of over
600mm exists.     Perhaps the location can be pointed out to
me please.

     We do not consider that the rendering on the gable
wall adjacent to gate 'O' warrants immediate repair.     How­
ever any loose rendering will be knocked down to prevent
it falling on passing spectators.     That job can be done by
the ground staff.

     As I recall, when the store mentioned in item 2.3 was
inspected on 6 August, there was nothing in there that
constituted a hazard.

     A prototype of a gate fastening is to be trialed
shortly.     I will let you know when it has been fixed so
that it can be inspected.     Perhaps that type of fastening
will also be acceptable on the gate mentioned in item 3.3.

     The comment in item 4.1 is noted -but we consider that
a greater hazard exists outside the ground, caused by the
road works on Penistone Road.     I have personnaly seen two
members of the public injured when leaving the ground.
One fell into an unprotected deep excavation, another
tripped over a partly excavated pavement and required
medical attention after receiving cuts and grazes.     I am
not aware of any similar injuries occurring within the
ground over the past few years and feel that more benefit
to safety would be gained by tidying up the pavements on
Penistone Road.

     The comments in item 4.2 are noted.

     I understand that the Club regularly liaise with the
St. John's people about manning levels and a sufficient
number of first aiders is provided for each game, in line
with the recommendations given by the Football League.

        The    rail on barrier           133    is b a d l y c o r r o d e d a n d   s h o u l d be
r e p l a c e d n ow.     There was      also    a lot of m o v e m e n t      of the rail o n
barrier       144,      when   tested,and we also recommend that that rail
is a l s o    replaced.
        As    agreed we have arranged               for t h e     clip on barrier            124       to
be   r e p l a c e d t o g e t h e r w i t h r ails on b a r r i e r s   133 a n d    144,    before
the start       of the coming season.

Dear Mr. Sheriff,

               Following your telephone call I am very pleased to enclose
a copy of my report to the Club concerning the barrier testing
at the West end of the ground in July, 1988.                                                                         You will see from
the carbon on page 2 that a copy of the letter part of our report
was certainly sent to Mr. Butler in your department and to
M x . Bownes in the Legal department.                                                           I know it is our normal
practice to send you all the record sheets but if we did not do
so, a full set is now enclosed.
               I also enclose a copy of the test certificate from Sheffield
Testing Works who checked the calibration of the testing equipment
the previous week.


                                                                                     Yours sincerely,

T ot the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                  Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                        Barrier Testing 1988
     Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
the lower area of terrace at the. Leppings Lane end of the ground.
?he location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
161G/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
     The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds'.
     In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
withstood the applied load. A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the full test load.
     Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those t 'sted on the
leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.


                             ED
                                                                 2




           The rail on barrier 133 Is badly corroded and should be
    » replaced now. There w a s also a lot of movement of the rail on
      barrier 144, when tested, and we also recommend that that rail
      is also replaced.
           As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
      be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
      the start of the coming season.
           Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
      results of the barrier tests.



                                    Yours sincerely,
J                 i                   ,

         DESCRIPTION:                          One hydraulic pump complete with two hydraulic cylinders.
                                               The force on the cylinders, under an applied force is
                                               measured by a pressure gauge mounted on the pump.


         IDENTIFICATION:                       Pump: D948005
                                               Gauge: BGF 168 SR
                                               Cylinder 1s 04773                   Model RC 53AF9N
                                               Clyinder 2: 04772                   Model RC 530J8N


         METHOD

         The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0.5 lever arm testing machine                                                     in
         terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty                                                   of
         the forces applied during the calibration is +0.5/6»

         Three tests were made on each cylinder*

         Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

  Dear Sir,

  SAFETY OP SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
  SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

  I refer to your letter dated the 14th March 1980, concerning the above
  subject and would inform you that so far as our primary responsibilities
  are concerned, we do not have any current problems in respect of access
  for emergency vehicles, terrace to touch line area or communications.

  The only matter outstanding so far as the Police are concerned is the
  provision of a suitable Police room and I understand that an undertaking
  has already been received from the Club that this will be constructed
  in the closed season of 1980. In dealing with this particular aspect,
  it would also be advantageous for a site to be made available, whereby
  ground control could be maintained from a position overlooking the play
          ’ this is a matter which may be properly discussed at future


   'ours faithfully




                                                                      m

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                            Safety of Sports Grounds Act,' 1975
                                            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
              Thank you for your letter of 14 November setting                                                                      out the
comments of the officer working party on the proposals for the
new roof over the Kop.                                                 Our response is as follows s~


1.           Disabled Facilities
       ' First it should be emphasised that the disabled will have
to be accommodated at ground level.                                                               No other arrangement is
possible at reasonable expense.                                                           The choice is between putting
them in front of the North stand or in front of the Kop.
             Considering first the Kop, you will know that the terracing
drops down below the level of the perimeter track.                                                                                It would
therefore be necessary to place the disabled slabbing^ and-seating
behind the line of the present perimeter fence.                                                                               Each disabled
chair including manoeuvring space and also a runway in front
of the chairs occupies the same space as about 20 standing
spectators.                           it would therefore be necessary to sacrifice the

                                              An    U n iim itS Q      C              istered in England - No. 1833144
equivalent of about 1000 standing spectator places to accommodate
50 disabled people and their attendants.      This would be
extremely costly.     The Club has decided to increase the
capacity of the Kop by 5000 people and the additional cost
compared with merely roofing over the present Kop is in
excess of £500,000.      Thus, if 1000 standing places were
sacrificed the cost to the Club would be £100,000 at least.
Ancillary expenses would include moving the boundary fence
and reconstructing it to safety barrier standards plus the
cost of the concrete hardstanding.      We also have to keep in
mind that not only would the spectators be in the firing
line if anywhere near the goal but that in addition the new
Kop roof only extends to the front of the terracing so that
the disabled would be virtually unprotected from rain.
        The alternative proposal of leaving the disabled in front
of the North stand has the advantage that the cantilevered
roof extends some way in front of the seating so that there
is some protection from rain except when the wind is blowing
from the South.        The Club would like to give complete
protection from rain and is prepared to consider the cost of
the glazed roofing which we have suggested as a possible way
of "increasing the comfort of the disabled.     The glazing
would of    course be of toughened glass.
        If the working party has strong reservations about the
glazing then obviously it will     not be carried out.     However
I should stress that there is no possibility of the disabled
being placed in front of the Kop because of the exorbitant
cost.      The Club will continue to use the present location and
the only question to be decided is whether it should be under
cover or not.
        I should add that new toilet facilities for the disabled
are an integral part of the scheme for the Kop and will be
conveniently placed under the North      end of the Kop.

2.       Enlarged Spion Kop
          (a)-   All exit routes will have 2.4m clear head room
          (approximately 8ft.).


          (b).   We will need to discuss the proposed barrier
          adjacent to the new ladies toilet.        The exit route
         widens* out very considerably from 4.lm wide at the
          location where the six unit width has been calculated
          and is approximately 6m wide alongside the toilet block.
          We therefore believe that there is no bottleneck effect
          and that a barrier might merely provide an unseen
          obstruction which could create difficulty.       We will
          forward a larger scale drawing of the area so that
         our comments can be considered in more detail.


     -    (c|- We will of course provide the landings in front
          of the -existing emergency gates in the pitch perimeter
.. ■      fence but you will know that there have been changes of
          view on this particular matter in the past and we would
          not wish the Club tp be put to the expense of taking
          them out again when members of the present officer working
         ’ party are- replaced with the passage of time.


          (d)    Therewill be four new turnstiles on Penistone
          Road and six new turnstiles at the South end of the Kop.


          (e)    Gates with-a t u m - b a r arrangement will be provided
          at the exits and the Club will of course provide stewards
          to control them.


3.        Roofing of Spion Kop
          The gables will be sheeted on the outside face only and
will       not be lined.     This is normal in Kop buildings and we
think it extremely -unlikely that there will be any difficulty
with hooligans climbing.           The horizontal rails are at such
wide spacings that it would be difficult for even the most
-agile     to climb up. . ’ ....
       We are very mindful of the need to complete the areas
open to spectators before the start of the new season.           It
is conceivable that the contractors will have difficulty
in completing the new terrace steps at the rear of the Kop
before the first game.    In that event secure fencing will
have to be provided as a temporary measure. However we
are reasonably confident that the whole of the terrace
area of the Kop will be complete by the due date.         We
also intend to have all the new exit arrangements completed
but it is possible that work will still be going, on. in toilet
areas, particularly the new toilet for the disabled.


4.     Crowd Flow at the. Leppings Lane End of the Stadium
       The Club is aware of the difficulties which the Police
have to contend with at the Leppings Lane end arid. has of
course been very pleased to help the problem by. the major,
works which were undertaken during the last close season.
We find it very difficulty to envisage anything, more which
could be done at reasonable expense.


5 „     Fire Brigate Access to the Front of all Stands      ..
       As part of the works on the Kop, we are completely
remodelling the area around the      existing, tunriel.   The
head    room is being increased to 2.4m and the width of. the
tunnel is being increased also.      A considerable amount of
earth shifting will have to take place arid this
presents an opportunity to widen the gangway so as to                 1
enable say a fire engine to pass between the North s t a n d ” '
and the retaining wall of the Kop.        If the Fire Service         j
think this is of va l u e , I should be pleased to know the
width they would like so that we can see whether it can
be provided at reasonable cost and without sacrificing, too :
many standing spaces.

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

    Following approval by the County Cornell and clarification of ccrtr.in
    structural aspects of the South Stand construction, I am now able to formally
    issue the attached General Safety Certificate in respect of the Hillsborough
    Stadium.

    As previously mentioned to you, the fee payable has yst to he dstexsrinsd by
    the County Council and I will, of course, contact you further cn this point
    as soon as possible.

    I would particularly draw your attention to the following paragraphs of
    Schedule 2 of the Certificates-

    8(1)   - the existing First Aid facilities are accepted cn an interim basis
              only pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980
              close season;

    12(1) - the arrangements for Emergency Lighting in the South Stand (as set
            out in the letter frcm Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the South
            Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 12th Decanter, 1979) are
            regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the existing
            battery life?

    14     - the existing Police facilities are accepted cn an interim basis only
             pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980 close
              season;

    30     - use of the Stadium in excessively high wind conditions
                                          and
           ~    use of the Stadiun in excessively high snowfall conditions.

    Perhaps you would also treat this letter as the formal notice of issue required
    by Paragraph 7 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976.

Should you have any queries an the Certificate, Mr. D. Vaughan of irty staff
will be happy to discuss them with you.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity of recording the County Council's
appreciation of the co-operati.cn and goodwill whidi the Club and its Consultants
has extended to the Officer Working Party over the months of the necessarily
involved detailed investigations.

   Dear Sir,

   Safsty o£ Sports Grounds Act, 1975

   I refer to your letter dated 5th April and to the recent ’phone conversation
   which you had with Hr. D. Vaughan of my staff.

   I confirm that the Officer Working Party has now considered the Club's outline
   drawing of the new police and first aid facilities and, subject to the following
   points and consideration of detailed drawings, regards the proposals as.
   acceptable in principle:-

   (i)       the walls of che first aid room to be lined with suitable non-
              combustible material to enable the room to be easily cleaned and
              also avoid the need for re-decoration;

   (ii)     " lockable storage facilities for blankets, strctchers,etc. to be
              provided in the first aid rooa;

   (iii)     in view of the location of the ".P.O. iacV point in the police room,
              the telephone facility to be extended into the first aid room also;

   (iv)      the f(boors of both the first aid and police rooms to be of easily
                 -.nable material (such as quarry tiles, etc.);

   (v)       Uu    uoor of the. detention roca in the police rocn to be at least
             2" thick and fitted with a 5 lever mortise lock, and to open outwards
              in the direction cf the top of the plan        zstij

   (vi)      the roof ever the two roens to ":>e of   suitable non-corabustible
             material;

   (vii)     the need for the building to be robustly constructed, (especially
              the detention roon) without reducing the internal dimensions to be
              borne in mind;

   (viii)    the building generally (and the toilet accomodation particularly)
             to be adequately ventilated, and suitable drainage facilities to be
             provided.

        Provided in both.the first aid and police rooms;
                        r '
(xi)     the Club to be reminded of the necessity of seeking formal Building
         Regulation approval from the Building Authority.

Additionally, two other matters were raised at the Working Party    meeting. The
first relates to the subject of temporary structures. This was,     of course,
referred to in m y letter dated 31st March, and no doubt you will   let me know,
in due course, what progress is being made on the preparation of    the proposals
for semi-permanent or permanent facilities.

The second matter relates to the concern felt from a public order and safety
point- of view- b y -spectators-(particularly during evening fixtures) spilling out
on to Penistone Road whilst trying to gain admission to the Ground. As you are
aware, the Penistone Road-at that point is both the main A61 Sheffield/Barnsley
road and a feeder toute from the city centre to the ML Motorway at Tankersley
and, as such, carries considerable volumes of traffic at all times. There is
a very, real fear th<cfc «, s«rious accident will result unless something can be
done to enable spectators nueuingto gain access to the Ground        "that point to
enter more rapidly than is possible presently.

This was, of course, a natter discussed at the Ground Inspection on 4th February,
1 9 S 2 I t was understood at that time that the Club intended to carry cut vcrk
in the close season to rectify the problem. In this connection, it is suggested
that the most viable method of improving the situation is to re-site an existing
toilet block to the rear of the Spion Kop to enable an additional minimum of
six (but preferably twelve) turnstiles to be installed, together with an
additional exit gate. The exit vi-Sths on the Penistone P„oi’d side of the Ground
are, of course, just acceptable and an extra e::it would relieve the situation.

The County Council feels justified in requesting mos>c firmly that the Club
sho-i-'■' La’-je action in the forthcoming close season to relieve the admission
(and to a lesser extent, the egress) problems at the Penistone Road side of the
Ground, should a decision to do so not have already been taken by the filu1-..

                                       Yours faithfylly,




                                       Chief Executive.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
Annual Inspection of the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium -
6th August, 1987

T enclose for your attention a list of comments made by Officers arising from
the above inspection.

I anticipate that during the course of your Clubs* normal tsaintenance
arrangements cany of the items listed will have already been attended to.    Would
you please let ire have your cowwents on the points raised in due course.

If you require any clarification of the individual comments made you will see
that on the ri^ht-hand side of the sheet an abreviation of the title of the
Departwent/Authority concerned. At the end of the list is a Schedule shoving
the appropriate Officers to contact if necessary.

The Fire Service has recently reminded me that no reply has yet been received to

recall that you were asV.ed in that letter to convent on the points raised by the

    For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bownes


    Dear Sir,

    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

    Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November,                   1986, in respect of the above
    Club.

    Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

    An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1 9 8 6 .    The
    comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
    individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
    it is assumed that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
    various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

    MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

    North Stand

    Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

    The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7 .8.85
    in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

    There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
    with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
    ment of these buildings.

    Spion Kop

    A.     Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exit route has -not
           received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
           installation, this should be removed immediately.

    B.     It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter fencing form
           part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten


                            All communications O     S   sed to the Chief Fire Officer.

        To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch it is recommended
        that openings be provided in the wall at the foot of radial gangways.

D.      Covered Seating Area (Rear Stand):-

       The means of escape from this area is not considered to be satisfactory
       in that escape is possible in one direction only, this being down through
       areas described in A and B above.

       Subject to all the recommendations outlined in A and B above and made
       later in respect of automatic fire detection being implemented, the
       means of escape from the covered seating area would be acceptable.

AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION

 In 1979 th e w orking p a r t y d i s c u s s e d t h e p r o v i s i o n o f a u to m a tic f i r e d e t e c t i o n
'in t h e South S t a n d .

It is recommended that such provision should be made in all areas beneath
the seated area of the stand as soon as possible.    The system should also
cover the Tavern Club which has a direct link on to the first floor corridor
of the South Stand.

The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
system.

In order that persons using the Spion Kop can receive early warning of any
fire occurring in the "Stands" Club, it is also recommended that automatic
fire detection be provided in that Club.

EMERGENCY LIGHTING

Spion Kop

The emergency lighting has yet to be tested - no test certificate received.

South, North and West Stands

In letter dated 12th November, 198-0, from Eastwood and Partners, it was
suggested that following test certificates dated 11th August, 1980, a period
of 5 years should elapse before re-testing for South Stand and 2 years for
North and West Stands.  As of today no record appears to exist as to whether
these areas have been re-tested or that the test certificates together with
maintenance records have ever been re-presented.      The emergency lighting
system should therefore be re-tested for the whole of the ground and test
certificates produced.   In addition the whole of the system should conform
to B.S. 5266.

FIRE ALARM

West Stand

Existing call points to be relocated to accessible positions outside of -
franchise areas and be increased to cover the upper areas of the stand.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club FLC,

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Ground* Act 1973 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

Is Wove*her 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to eoaaent on the
condition of your stadias having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. 1
have also asked the Building Surveyor to sake similar co ueats but I have not
received the* as yet*

The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1967 they are quite satisfied
with the stadiua and have indicated that tbe degree of co-operation which they
receive is very satisfactory.

Tbe Fire Service have, however, aade a nusber of coosests and I attach for your
information a copy of their letter to ne of 18th February. Seae points in the
letter have now been further clarified as followss-

(a) The tisber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
from the walkways.

(b) As far as the locked doors is the south stand are concerned they will be
dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

(c) Gates aust be unlocked and stewarded at all tines, during aatches: if this
cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be Insisted upon.

I think the rest of the letter is largely self—explanatory but I would
particularly like to refer to the consents which are sade in respect of final
exit gates. As you can see froa the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach tbe end of
their useful life they mist be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which X enclose) to show a
better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry froa the
outside during the course of the gave. The Fire Service feel that this hook
type arrangeaent will be aore easily used in the event of an eaergency than the
current locks, about which they are very concerned.

Encs.

Wouldt you please let ne have your consents on the Fire Service letter as eooe as
possible.

fours faithfully,

                  Means of Escape in Case of Fire

                  North Stand

                             With the exception of a small hut and the steel
                  clad groundsman's accommodation, which are both
                  located under the ramp and not the stand, the timber
                  clad buildings have been removed.
                             We believe that the reference in the minutes
                  dated 7 August, 19 85 was to storage facilities and
                  not to buildings.

     removed so that the width of the exit route is not
     reduced.
     b)     This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.
     c)     Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
     repaired but, as has always been accepted, the
     repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
     job.
     d)     The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
     people from climbing onto the steelwork but to act
     as a guard preventing spectators damaging and
     possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
            We disagree that spectators climb onto the
     steelwork in large numbers although we do not deny
     that-the police have, at some matches, had to tell
     a few spectators not to sit on the steelwork.
            The cost of erecting a full height fence
     would be several thousands of pounds.    The Club is
     not at present contemplating that magnitude of
     expenditure just to protect a few spectators from
     their own foolish behaviour.
     e)     There are four or five lengths of barrier
     where the drop in front is just over one metre,
     but as far as we are aware this has not created
     any hazard.    In fact to the contrary, because
     people can leave the ground by going under the
     barriers onto the lateral gangway.    This is a
     common feature of most league grounds.
            The welding is performing well and it seems
     that any additional vertical support is
     unnecessary.    However, the welding can be inspected
     at regular intervals to make sure that it con­
     tinues to hold the mesh securely.

     f)    Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
     the ground.     The keys then remain in the possession
     of the steward(s), given the responsibility of
     unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
     match and all spectators have left the ground.

     West Stand

     a)   Do we understand correctly that the
     reference to 'timber framed and clad units' is to
     the bar fittings at first floor level?        If so, then
     those fittings were part of the. original construction
     for which Building Regulations Approval has been
     granted.     There has not been any previous comment
     about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
     or other stands.     We do not consider that they
     present a hazard.
     b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.

     South Stand

     a)    (i)   We note the comment about the doors and
     this point has been dealt with under the regular
     procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
     the Fire Precautions Act of 1971 for the offices.
     Fire Officer Roger Woodhouse has been dealing with
     the matter.
          (ii)         We see the principle behind the creation
     of fire compartments.     That is sensible.     Sealing
     off the windows is not difficult but the provision
     of ducting to the south wall is, and furthermore
     very expensive.     A major exercise such as providing
     ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
     redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.

EASTWOOD ft PARTNER8                                        SHEET




          (iii)    We agree that stored materials should be
     removed from stairways and exit routes.      There is a
     particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
     ground floor level, but the caterers have been asked
     to clear that particular area well before the public
     are admitted on match days.
     b)      (i)   It was agreed in 1979 that the fans
     ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
     be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
     controlled shutters.      Those grilles and shutters
     were fitted although we see that two recently
     installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
     and shutters.      As the form of fire protection from
     those lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
     Service, the Club are not prepared to have ducting
     installed, although the new fans should perhaps be
     fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
     shutters.
           (ii)    A close inspection of the gas supply pipe­
     work in the five bars revealed that four bars have
     valves fitted to the feed pipe or to the appliance
     when there is only one appliance in the bar.         The
     pipework in the bar nearest to the Spion Kop has
     been replaced recently but without a valve.
                   However, there is a master valve, at
     ground floor level, which isolates the gas supply
     to the whole of the first floor.      That valve was
     installed at the request of the Fire Service in
     1980.
          (iii)       We confirm that all the timber facing onto
     the public circulation areas was treated with an
     intumescent paint during the work carried out in
     1980.    Since then the walls have been re-decorated




                             3D
EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS                                         SHEET




     but this does not reduce the effect of the
     intumescent paint underneath.
            (iv)       We cannot understand this comment because
     the paint store was constructed in its present
     position on the advice of the Fire Officer.         A
     special 'non-sparking'     light fitting was even
     installed on his recommendation.      It is not contem­
     plated to move the store again after spending money
     to build the store in its present position.
             (v)   We do not consider that the two laminate
     covered toilet kiosks present a hazard.      As for the
     wooden cupboards, they have been on the first floor
     for many years and no previous adverse comments
     have been made by the Fire Service about their
     presence.
            (vi)   We agree that the holes round the cables
     should be plugged with an appropriate fire resisting
     material.
           (vii)   As far as we are aware all doors leading
     onto the first floor and ground floor circulation
     areas were provided with 25mm rebates and the doors
     made up to a nominal one hour standard.      That work
     was done in 1979-80.
          (viii)   We agree that the spaces above toilet
     accommodates should not be used for storage but
     believe that the Club have now removed the stored
     materials.

     c)      We believe that clinbing over the existing low
     wall does not present any difficulty in the event
     of an emergency.      Spectators will go over the wall
     whether there are gates or not.      We do not consider
     that the installation of gates is necessary.

     d)   Escape through the rear of the stand has always
     been accepted by the Officer Working Party.     Further­
     more, it has been readily accepted with the
     protection which has been provided so far to the
     escape routes.


     Automatic Fire Protection

          We will suggest to the Club that proposals
     should be put forward for the provision of a fire
     detection system but the system is not likely to be
     installed until the major re-development of the South
     stand which is planned for 1991

     Emergency Lighting

          Testing of the emergency lighting system is
     being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
     Service in the next day or so to agree a date and
     time for carrying out the test.
          The testing of the general electrical circuits
     will also be organised over the next few weeks and
     a current IEE Certificate produced.

     Fire Alarms

          The Club was told by the Fire Service to put
     the call points in the bars in the stands.    Moving
     the call points again is out of the question.

     Inidcator/Control Panel

          The Officer Working Party was asked, at the
     time of installation, where the indicator/central
     panel should be placed.     The Club was told that it
     should be located in the Police control centre,
     where it is now.     No duplicate panel was asked for
     and it is not considered that one is necessary«

Tor the attention of Mr. D. Bownes




Dear Sirs,-

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB -
SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUND ACT

Following the inspection at the above sports ground on 19th May 1988, the following
items are forwarded for your attention.

S p i o n K op

Rubbish is accumulating under the new structure and requires removing.

South Stand

a)    The extractor fan from the laundry has an accumulation of fluff and requires
      cleaning.

b)    The new Sponsors Lounge on the first floor has been fitted with an extractor
      fan that breeches the fire resisting wall. At the time of the inspection it
      could not be determined whether it is fitted with an automatic heater detector
      operated shutter or not. If not, some such device will be required.

West Stand

There were only two small EXIT signs situated above the exits•from the covered
walkway which could not be seen from the extremities of the walkway. As this
stand is used by visiting fans it is recommended that larger signs be fixed,
in a more prominent position.

                              All communications to be addressed to the Chief Fire Officer.

Fire Safety

It is recommended where gas cookers are used in the snack bars that a fire blanket
be provided.

Should you require any further information concerning these matters, please do not
hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully,

          THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

          ANNUAL INSPECTION OF SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
          ON THE 19th MAY, 1988

          I write with reference to the above and following our recent site meeting
          and safety inspection of the named premises.

          I would confirm that while the general standards of health and safety
          being maintained were found to be satisfactory a number of points did
          require attention.  I have itemised these below for your convenience.

          Spion Kop Development

          1.   The pylon situated to the left-hand side of the kop was not suitably
               protected from unauthorised access and climbing.

          2.   To-several locations around the kop, accumulations of associated
               builders wastes and stonework that could easily be obtained for use as
               projectiles were noted.

          3.   At some positions within the new development, there is a difference in
               height between a terraced area and radial gangway of over 600mm.  I
               would advise that these areas be protected by a suitably constructed
               pedestrian guardrail.

          4.   An area of stair nosing was found to have become defective upon the
               "new" part of the spion kop and a similar defect was located upon the
               older radial gangway.

          5.   Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of minor
               repairs.

          6.   A loose rainwater pipe and length of guttering were located to one of
               the Penistone Road turnstiles.

          7.   An area of glazing serving one of the Penistone Road turnstile huts
               has been broken.

          8.   The club might consider the now combustible nature of much of the
               vegetation situated immediately behind the spion kop and take the
               appropriate remedial action.

          9.   The rendering to the entrance gate side wall was still found to be in
               a loose and defective condition.

          West Stand

          1.   In a number of cases terrace nosings require to be repaired.


                                                          /Contd....
2.   A number of seats were defective and require to be renewed or
     repaired.

3.   To the left-hand side of the stand, some pieces of old barbed wire
     were found to project over a walkway at head height.

 Eastwood and Partners since 12th N o v e m b e r on the South Stand Emerg ency Lighting
 had produced agreement on an interim arrangemert which would be regarded as
acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life. Further modifications at
that time would remedy the shortcomings of the existing Installation. Details were
contained In the letter dated 12th D ec e m b e r which Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
had addressed tx> the Fire Service.

B.     South Stand Construction

The Building Authority expressed concern as to what they saw as a lack of structural
Integrity In the South Stand. In their opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
progressive deterioration of the Stand which, It was felt, could only be properly
determined by a full structural survey. The report forwarded by Messrs. Eastwood
and Partners In the last week was not considered to be sufficiently comprehensive
to provide tbs required information, and the basis of calculation used could not be
agreed as appropriate. Whilst It was agreed that there had not been a specific
written request for such a M l structural survey of the South Stand, the Building
Authority felt that It had been Inherent in the detailed discussions which had taken
place that such a report would be forthcoming. The Building Authority were
concerned at the possibility that the requirements of the Building Regulations and
the Code of Practice Safety Factors could not be met; In particular the Structural
stability of the South Stand in conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
was mentioned.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
s ame specification or the sans construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
that, for instan ce, none of the buildings In Sheffield built before 1970 could meet
the latest wind pressure requirements. Even the Building Research Station was n
evidently thinking In terms that these requirements were unrealIstically high. In
his professional opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able In practice to meet
the loadings demanded. In any case, the conditions which had been described as
being possibly dangerous would m e a n In practice that a match could not be played
and consequently no spectators would be present.                                          (\

Experience of the corrosion of indoors steel in the Sheffield area showed this to be
minimal, and the Stand was regularly test loaded by spectators. Structures such
as this would show obvious external signs, such as cracks, well before there was
any possibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
visual inspection. Even though he did not consider it essential, pla ting of the
front steel columns had been carried out as a compromise to try and meet the
Building Authority's concern. H e agreed there might well be a continuing
maintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different matter to saying there
was a structural problem. Reference was m a d e to the Guide's advice that when
assessing whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of spectators,
the criterion to be used Is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In Dr. Eastwood's
view, It would be unreasonable and unnecessary to Insist on a full structural survey
of the South Stand or to delay the issue of the Certificate. It was his professional
opinion (which he was most jealous of and would not put in jeopardy) that the South
Stand was structurally safe and that the basis of the calculations provided was '
appropriate. H e was prepared to advise the Club to use the appeal procedure open
to them should this be necessary.
IT W A S A G R E E D that:

(a)     as there was no obvious deterioration in the South Stand structure of such
        a nature as to be of immediate concern, no objection would be raised to the
        continuance of the derby g a m e with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
        provided that no extreme weather conditions occurred in the intervening
        period, and

(b)      a further meeting should be held as a matter of urgency between the Building
         Authority and Dr. W . Eastwood to discuss the structural Integrity of the
        South Stand and the appropriateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
        to be present at Dr. Eastwood’s request).

NOTE     A s the discussions on the South Stand Construction hinged on structural
         theories and practices, the Fire Service and Police representatives felt
         there was little they could contribute and left the meeting prior to its
         termination.

1.      Purpose of Meeting

la view of the F„A. Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on 12th April and following recent
•visits by the disciplines represented on the Working Party, the Chief Executive of the
South Yorkshire County Council had raised with the Club by letter dated 31st March various
matters which apparently were still outstanding.

A letter of reply dated 3rd April had been received from the Club, as well as letters dated
4th and 8th April from the Club's Consultants, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners, giving
details of the present position.

 2.     Inspection of Ground

 The Working Party inspected the ground in company with the Club's representatives.

 (i)     Training of Safety Stewards

          The Club had felt there was little point in pursuing the training of the Safety
          Stewards until the fire warning system had been completely installed, but with
          agreement the County Fire Service had instructed some stewards yesterday.
          A schedule^jpec4fytog-^he-daH:es-aiidTgspgnsiMiittgS"was4iarnde4-"to the Club's
          representatives.

 (ii)    Exit Signs

          The Club's representatives felt that the exit signs generally had been sited where
          required and were of adequate size and/or illuminated.

           It was agreed that there were a number which could be m o r e advantageously sited
          and/or illuminated, and s om e which might be m o r e effective with larger lettering
         and/or direction arrows. The County Fire Service undertook to liaise with
         Messrs. Eastwood and Partners.

(iii)    Emergency Lighting in the South Stand

         As was evident, complete re-wiring of the South Stand with separate circuits had
         already commenced, and the County Fire Service undertook to let Messrs. Eastwood
         and Partners know their detailed requirements.

(iv)     Fire Warning System

         The Fire Warning System had been installed, except for the trickle charger and
         battery equipment. These items had been subject to delivery problems, but the
         system should be complete by the end of the month.

         It was agreed that as regards the F.A. Cup Semi-Final, the Police Communications
         base which would be at the ground would also be used for Fire Service purposes if
1        necessary.

(v)      Sealing of Fire Resisting F r a m e s

         The sealing of the fire resisting door frames against the supporting walls had generally,
         been carried out, but there were a small number which were now showing signs of
         small gaps.

(vi)     Fire Betardent Paint

         The Club pointed out that ’’Nullifire" fire retardent paint had been specified on the
         partitions within the South Stand but, as the Contractors were on holiday until
         14th April, it was .not possible to say with certainty at this time whether it had actually
         been used.

(vii)    Wired Glass

         The Club pointed out that to the best of their knowledge wired glass had been used
         wherever required by the County-Fire Service.

         The County Fire Service and the Police were generally satisfied that the small panes
         of glass in the upper half of the wooden partitionswithin the SouthStandwould not in
         normal circumstances be regarded as a fireand/orsafety hazard.         The Clubagreed in
         the longer term to consider the fitting of wired glass and, in the short term, to
         consider fitting wooden battons as an interim measure.

(viii)   Sharp Edges to Steelwork on South-West Stand

         Whilst there were a number of sharp corners on the supports, these were at a height
         of at least seven feet. However, the Club undertook to round them off.

(ix)     Perimeter Fencing on the Spion Kop

         The Club pointed out that this had been tested where feasible and the results forwarded
         to the Chief Executive in January. A copy had been passed to the Building Authority on
         30th January.
(X)    P o s s i b l e S te p O b s t r u c t i o n o n U p p e r E x i t A r e a o n S p io n Kop

       Whilst it was agreed that'the erection of the barriers at the Upper Exit A r e a had left
       a small adjacent area of approximately one foot wide by four foot long at a lower level
       than the remainder of the exit, it was felt that its position coupled with the crowd
       flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However, the Club
       undertook to give attention to it in the longer term.

(xi)   M e s h Fencing under North Stand

       In view of the normal crowd flow rates on the public side of the m e s h fencing and the
       fact that there was no public access to its rear, it was felt that the timber framed
       m e s h fencing under the North Stand providing security to storage areas was acceptable.

           Dear Graham,

           SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM

           You will be aware of the shortcomings in the public address system installed
           at Hillsborough, which were highlighted at the trial of emergency evacuation
           procedures which took place during operational conditions on 14 November 1987.
           The emergency evacuation instructions proved to be inaudible in the concourses
           at the rear of the Stand, at the rear of the Spion Kop, and in the club reception
           and office areas. Plainly, this situation-detracts from the overall safety of
           the ground and there is a pressing need for the deficiencies to be remedied as
           soon as possible.

            You will know at the meeting which took place                                               on Thursday 26 November 1987,
            which was attended by your- contractors Messrs                                              D P Sounds Ltd, that it will be
            necessary to substantially upgrade the public                                               address system. I would be
            grateful therefore, if you could proceed with                                               this work and notify ms when
            this has been cocrpleted.

            I am copying this letter to Mr David Bownes of the Sheffield District Council
            Admin and Legal Department.

                     On 18 July 1988,                                         I m a d e an inspection of the ground

gates and entry and exit routes and to boundary w a l l s and
fences.                              N o significant defects were noted.
                     The roo f of the South stand was inspected f rom the ground.

                                 MR. COLLINS:    Sir, the whole purpose of my going through
                            the documentation was to avoid having to repeat it througn\
                            witnesses.   1 am mindful of thaty^Ma^\I say for the benefit,
                            of the press what I propose to     is t o ^ r e a t Mr. Bownes’
                                       as his evidence without requirink him to go tmrough


                                 LORD                        all I make it clear to ths press
                     B      ^hat that means                 the statement they\ave. of which
                            they have a copy,              ctence-in-chief, so thie^ car? quote
                            any of it they want

                                 MR. COLLINS:   The same of course applied to the tire
                            witness and to Dr. Eastwood as well.

                                                  DAVID BOWNES Called

                                              Examined by MR. COLLINS:

                          G. Mr. Bownes, you have heard that, and I take it you will
                             confirm the accuracy of the statement which you made? - A.
                             Yes, sir.

                          Q. You are the Chief Licensing Officer of the Sheffield City
                     D       Council? - A. Yes, sir.

                          O. In the Administration and Legal Department? - A. Yes, sir.

                          Q. Mr. Bownes, football grounds are not the only licensing
                             concern of the City Council.  Is that right? - A. That
                             is right, sir. yes.

                          Q. You say in your statement that you have 33 different systems
                             of licensing to administer? - A. That is correct, sir.

                          G. Which range from taxis through sex shops, through.... - A.
                             Cinemas, theatres, places of public entertainment and so on.

                          Q. How many   people do you have to assist you in this licensing
                             concern? - A. Five in addition to myself.

                          Q. So there are six of you altogether? - A. Yes.

                          Q. And if there have to be prosecutions for breaches of any of
                            • the licensing requirements is that something your Department
                              also handles? - A. Yes.

                          G. So the six of you have to handle not only control, you also
                             have to handle prosecutions? - A. Yes.

                          G. Have you found it possible generally to cope? - A. Yes, in
                             general terms.

                          u. Does it mean you have to adopt a system of priorities? - A.
                             Yes. sir.
                      H   G. I am going to come to this later.     As y o u .appreciate there has

                                been on the face of it some degree of delay in attending to
                                the Sheffield Wednesday football ground safety certificate? -
                                A . Yes.

                           G. You, of course, come into the picture as a result of local
                              government reorganisation which came into force in April 1986?
                              - A. Yes.
                     B     0. And that meant you became the licensing authority in the place
                              of the South Yorkshire County Council? - A. The City Council
                              did, yes.

                           G. I say "you".  I mean the City Council.  When you realised you
                              were going to have to take this over no doubt....

                                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Just give me that date again?

                                     MR. COLLINS:   1st April 1986 is the change over day.
                                The old Councils expired on 3lst March and the new ones took
                                over on 1st April:

                           Q. Mr. Bownes, were there other licensing functions you took over
                              from the old South Yorkshire apart from football grounds? - A.
                      D       Not that the licensing section took over.  There were some
                              others in relation to poisons and what have you that went to
                              other Departments.

                           Q. But your Department, this was the only extra matter that you
                              took over as a result of local government reorganisation? - A.
                              Yes.

                           Q. You no doubt got from South Yorkshire the relevant files? - A.
                              yes.

                           G.   And you familiarised   yourself with those? - A. Yes.

                           G.   Did you goto Sheffield Wednesday ground? - A. Not in April
                                1986, no.

                           G. When did you first go to the ground? - A. I believe tnai was
                               later on that year.  The inspection was in August 1986.  I
                               think there may have been a visit before that to deal with the
                               Kop.

                           G. The other ground the City Council became concerned with was
                              Sheffield United? - A. Yes.

                           G. Were "there any other grounds within the jurisdiction of the
                              city? - A.  Yes, sir, Owlerton turned up in August 1986
                              designated as a new stadium.

                           Q. That had not then been designated when you took over,       dut:   it
                              was thought it was about to be? - A. Yes.

                         I Q. But the two most important ones at the time you took over were
                       HI    Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United? - A. Yes.

                        G. We know Sheffield Wednesday had a safety certificate which had
                           been issued in 1979 and which had never been changed? - A.
                           Yes.

                        Q. So far as Sheffield United was concerned did that have a
                           safety certificate? - A. It did not.

                    g   0. Is there a safety certificate in being for Sheffield United
                           now? - A. No, there is not.

                        0. When was it designated?

                        G.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Has it been? - A.^It has been
                             designated, sir, yes. I d o n ’t know, sir.

                        G. Is that a separate instrument? There was one especially for
                           Hillsborough, I gather? - A. Yes, it was a separate one, a
                           much later one, I think, owing to this question of moving up
                           and down the Divisions.   I am not too sure when it was. I can
                           find it out, though, sir.

                        0.        MR. COLLINS:   The result is Sheffield United has been
                             operating without a safety certificate when it should have had
                    D        one? - A. That is not quite right, sir.   Any designated ground
                             can continue to operate as a sports ground provided an
                             application has been submitted.   It is my understanding an
                             application has been submitted for Sheffield United.

                        G.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Can you let us know when that was
                             done? - A. That can certainly be found out.

                        0.        MR. COLLINS:  Anyway, had you ever been to Sheffield
                             Wednesday, even as a paying customer or not? - A. No, sir.

                        G. So the significance of whatever might have appeared in the
                           safety certificate of itself would have meant nothing to you?
                           Obviously when you read the files you could follow some of the
                           history, but the details themselves meant very little? - A.
                           The details of the safety   certificate are reasonably clear,
                           sir.   It does not require knowledge of the ground as such.

                        G. I am sorry, I    am talking   about things like capacity and the
                           layout of the    ground and   so on? - A. Obviously the layout of
                           the ground is    a bit of a   closed book without the advantage of
                           seeing it and    looking at   the plan.

                        0. Did you, for example, appreciate on reading through the files
                           that "there had been the creation of these pens on the West
                           terraces? - A. No, sir, it was not immediately apparent to me.
                           That is a very detailed matter which would require a great
                           deal of research at the time.

                        G. So you were not aware of the significance when you took over
                           of those pens and their effect or potential effect on the
                           capacities? - A. No, sir, not at all. that would be true.
                    H
                        G. We know that the system under South Yorkshire had been via a

                           history.

                        0. And had reported back to the relevant subcommittee of the
                           County Council?   It is not entirely clear precisely what its
                           status was? - A. That is entirely right, sir.  I am not sure
                   B       what its status was, actually.

                        0. And did you consider in any event that was something that was*
                           rather unsatisfactory? - A. I regarded it as a matter that
                           perhaps needed clarifying somewhat, yes.

                        0. When you came into the picture you came in effectively with
                           the memorandum at page 313 of the core bundle attached to a
                           letter dated 5th June, with the report annexed to it. an
                           earlier report.  Have you got page 133? - A. Yes, I have.

                        0. If we look at the first sentence we see that there is a
                           reference to a report submitted to the March 1986 meeting,
                           which of course was the meeting which was held prior to take
                           ov e r .

                    D                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   As I have it in front of me I
                                gather that Sheffield United was designated on 3rd July. 1984.


                        q   .          MR. COLLINS:   Which means, speaking from memory, it had
                                 then to put in an application for a certificate once it had
                                .been designated? - A. No, sir, I believe would have to put in
                                 an application immediately before it was designated.

                        Q. That is right.  It was then up to the relevant licensing
                           authority to decide on what were the particular terms required
                           in any safety certificate? - A. Strictly, sir, to determine
                           whether or not the applicant was a qualified person.

                        Q. It has taken effectively therefore 5 years? - A. Yes, sir.

                        G. And there is still no safety certificate? - A. That is right,
                           sir.  I should explain that the County Council on its
                           dissolution was about to issue a safety certificate Zor it
                           pending the completion of certain works that the Fire Service
                           required.  I understand those works were not completed by the
                           time of the dissolution of the County Council.

                        G. We are not strictly concerned with Sheffield United.   Let us
                           come back to Sheffield Wednesday.   Can I just ask you as a
                           matter of introduction, and I am sorry this is not in our core
                           bundle, but it is page 122 of your bundle, Mr. Bownes, because
                           this is the March 1986 report, just in order to put the whole
                           matter in context.   I say "your report", it is under Mr.
                           Pensam’s name but drafted by you? - A. Yes, sir, that is the
                           normal practice.
                    H   G. I am not suggesting otherwise.        It is so we know it was you

                          speaking, although Mr. Pensam adopted what you had said. - A.
                          Yes, but I would not seek to transfer responsibility by that,
                          sir.

                        0. No. I fully understand that, as I am sure anyone who has any
                           knowledge of local government also understands.  Really, what
                           you are doing there is recording that the City Council will
                           have to take over as a result of the legislation, and you
                    B      refer to the Bradford disaster and the Popplewell Report, and
                           indicate that a more detailed report will be submitted as soon
                           as possible? - A. Yes, sir.

                        0. And really you recommend the delegations, that the General
                           Purposes Panel should have the powers under the 1975 Act? - A.
                           Yes.

                        0. And a further delegation of the Emergency Procedures and

So can we come on, please, to the report at our page 313
or your page 124, whichever you prefer? Now, you refer
to the current situation which was inherited.    You say two
sports grounds currently subject.   First, Sheffield
Wednesday.   Yes, if I bother to look I ....   Sheffield
Wednesday designated in August, 1978, certificate issued
December, 1979, undergoing major works to The Kop. And
then you refer to Sheffield United and indicate that it
was hoped that the Council would be in a position to
issue a certificate before the start of the 86/87 season.
Then you refer to Owlerton which is expected to be des­
ignated.   Can I ask you to look over the page, please,
at the paragraph safety certificate, standard conditions?
You indicate the desirability of standardisation for
obvious reasons.   Then you say this, "The conditions do,
however, give some cause for concern as they appear to be
inadequate or inappropriate in some areas." Now, the only
conditions or the only safety certificate that existed
was of course Sheffield Wednesday's.    Is that right? - A.
That is correct, sir, yes.

And therefore the inadequacy and inappropriateness of the
conditions in some areas must have referred, must it not,
to Sheffield Wednesday, on the face of it? - A. It did,
sir, yes.

Can you help us, please, as to what conditions you consider
to be either inadequate or inappropriate?- A. Yes.  I
should explain, sir, first of all, that that phrase is
what, if I may use one of Dr. Eastwood's comments, is a
daft phrase, to be honest.  It was not carefully thought
out by the look of it. In fact it is my view that there
were no fatal errors in the conditions themselves.
There were certain areas that needed tightening up.
For example, it refers to the County Council throughout
whereas it should of course now refer to the City Council.

Well, yes, that is a fairly obvious one but that does not
make much difference, does it?  I think in the legislation
there was a provision, was not there, an interim provision,
which effectively provided that in any document where
County Council appeared read relevant .... - A. Yes, sir.
The point I was making was that is the sort of order of
defect that there was in the certificate.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Really one would not get that
impression from this, not talking about .... - A. Yes, I
agree with you entirely, sir.   On looking at it again in
the light of this Inquiry I would entirely agree the words
are wrong ....

So there was nothing that gave cause for concern? - A.
The conditions gave some cause for concern in that there
were were drafting corrections that needed to be made.
                                                    D.   BOWNES


q.          MR. COLLINS:    Was there anything of substance that
     you had identified that needed to be addressed? - A. There
     \-7 as nothing, if you like, fatal in the conditions that I
      could see that needed to be addressed immediately.

Q. If I had been asking you in May of 1985, Mr. Bownes, which
   conditions do you regard as inadequate and which do you
   regard as inappropriate what would you have told me? - A.
   Exactly what I have told you already, sir. As I have
   explained, the wording is inappropriate.  There is no
   question about that.

Q.Did anyone on the committee ask, as far as you are aware,
   which were the inadequacies and which were the .... - A.
   I cannot honestly recall, sir.  It is an awful long time.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    If it is just a question of
     changing South Yorkshire to Sheffield City it would hardly
     merit, if you look further down, a redraft of conditions
     would of course be submitted to the Fire Service, the
     Police and building surveyor for .... - A. I think in
     anticipating the redrafting, sir, I anticipated there may
     be changes that would be needed as well,simply to update
     things.  Changes may have occurred at the ground that
     needed reflecting.

Q.       M R . COLLINS:  Why? Were you aware on looking through
     the file that there were changes that had occurred which
     would need reconsideration of the certificate or was this
     iust an assumption? - A. It was an assumption, sir.  I
     believe conditions that had been in operation for that long
     could well require review and people might well have
     changed their views as to the sort of things that needed
     addressing.

0. But if South Yorkshire had been doing its job properly
   surely you would have expected it to pass on a note, or
   your opposite number in South Yorkshire to pass on a
   note, saying look, this needs to be dealt with or that
   needs to be dealt with?- A. Yes, sir.  I find with
   certificate conditions and what have you that people
   tend to take them as read for years without constructively
   looking at them to decide whether or not they ought to be
   changed.  That is my experience with other conditions the
   Council has been involved in in licensing areas.

 Q. So what you are saying is your experience told you that
    it would be sensible to have a fresh look at these? - A.
    Yes, sir.

 0. And you intended to mean no more than that when you used
    these words inadequate or inappropriate? - A. Yes, sir.

 Q. Well, if that is right, Mr. Bownes,I think one is inclined
                                                        D.   BOWNES


to agree it was a daft expres sio n      to use. - A.    It w a s , sir.
I would fully support that.   That       is right.

On the face of it, it goes a lot further than that, does not
it? - A. Yes, sir, wit ho ut question.

Yes, I see.  Did you have availa ble a draft certificate
for Sheffield United? - A. Yes, sir, I believe there was
one copy on the Sheffield Un ite d file.

Because you also refer to the redraft where appropriate
and to submit to the panel for approval and then go on,
"The Sheffield United ce rtificate could then be issued
with the new conditions before the start of the 8SA87
season."  That rather suggests that you had spotted
something other than mere draf tin g matters in the
Sheffield United ce rtificate wh ich you thought ought
to be brought up-to-date or changed?- A. No, I would
not accept that necessarily, sir.    I must admit I have
not read the Sheffield United certificate recently
so I cannot really say what that comment referred to.

I see.  Now, over the page you refer to an attempt to
get the Health and Safety Executive in the picture. - A.
Yes.

Was that in the hope that it wo uld take the burden off
the City Council and your shoulde rs? - A. Not at all, sir.
It came from a rec om men dat ion in the Poppleweil Report.

I know it did but was your hope that if the Health and
Safety could be persua ded to involve themselves this would
m ean that your department w o u l d not have to shoulder the
responsibility? - A. I cannot see how that could happen, sir
The Council is the cer tif ica tin g authority ....

Well,   I know.   - A     and   therefore carrys    the can any way

I see.   So there was no hope of getting someone else to
carry out some w ork that otherwise you might have to do?
- A . I do not agree with the wa y you phrase that, sir, to
be honest.   I would have h o p e d the Health and Safety
Executive could have put a useful input into the Council's
ad visory system, if you like, for certificating.

I follow.   Now, one of the mat te rs that I think you spotted
w hen you received the safety certificate from the County
Council was that the plans had not been signed, is that
right, the plans .... - A. No, sir.

When you say "No, sir" you mea n they had not been signed?
- A. No, sir.  I had not spot ted anything about the plans,
to be quite honest.

Can I ask you to "c.ok at par ag ra ph    130 of your proof?          Do
                                                     D.   BOWIES


you see you refer in that parag rap h first of all to
sections of the Act and then you say under Schedule
1 of the certificate the de fin iti on of plans is - we
can see this at our page 107, I think - document or
documents atta ch ed to and forming part of the general
safety certificate and signed by the person signing
the certificate.      Wh en the files were handed over to
the Sheffield City Council in April, 1986, a copy of
the general safety certificate was in an envelope
together with a nu mbe r of plans none of which were
signed by Hr. M a l l e tt ,th e original signatory of the
certificate.   This, do I u nd er st an d from your answer
you gave a moment ago, this is something you have
spotted since? - A. Yes, sir, that is entirely correct.

But you did not spot   that at   the time? - A.    I did not,
sir, no.

One thing that h 2 s not come out and I am looking at your
paragraph 134 in the h i s t o ry so far is that it would
appear that there w er e one or two amendments to the
safety certificate wh ich had not been incorporated in
the certificate itself? - A. Yes, sir, those are a
my st e r y to me.

A<>ain, is that a. mat ter wh ich you have discovered since
this tragedy and you have been investigating for the        . .. .
purpose of giving evidence? - A. Yes, sir.      As you will
appreciate, for the benefit of the Inquiry, considerable
wo r k has gone into the files to extract all relevant
information as far as possible.

Maybe slightly surprising, Mr. Bownes, that that had not
been done in the last three or four years, three years,
rather, since the City Council was considering what ought
to be in the safety cer tif ica te? - A. Yes.       The impression
I had on taking over the a d m i ni st ra ti ve system was that
everything was O . K . , eve ry bo dy was happy with what was
going off essentially.

Well, one thing that mu st have become perfectly - well, no,
I will come to that later.      A n y w a y , there were apparently
amendments to the conditions, details of wh ich we have not
seen, but they are somewhere on the file, are they, indic­
ating wo rding am endments to conditions 10 and 26, wording
amendments to 10 and a time limit va ri ati on on 26? - A.
Yes,sir.    They are not a c t u a l l y on this file, though
they can be pr oduced if required.

You m ea n they were not even on the right file, they were
on a different file? - A. No, sir.    They are not in this
file here.

 I follow.   I am not asking you    to produce    them. - A. No.

You refer to them there, and I imagine they are not
enormously material or are they? - A. No, I do not
think they are, sir, no.

Just indicates a slight, if one ma y be forgiven to use
the word, sloppiness in appr oac h to what goes into the
safety certificate? - A. That is a matter of speculation
as to what the County Council actually did ....

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Sorry.  Would you speak up?
- A. Sorry.   It is a qu es tio n of speculation there as to
wha t the County Council ac tu all y did and what they
intended by these alterations.      It is not possible to
pick that up from the file.

        MR. COLLINS:    Any way we kn ow that there was a
m e et in g at the ground in Aug ust of 1986.  Is that right?
- A. The inspection, sir?

Inspection,    yes.   - A. Yes,    sir.

And you at tended that,        did you? - A.   I did,   sir, yes.

And I think you told us you had been to the ground before
that? - A. Yes, sir.

Was that correct?   The purpose of that inspection was
what, as you un derstood it?- A. It was one of the inspections
of the ground, the usual ones the County Council used to
organise, sir.

Yes.  And also was it, as you understood it, to view the new
works that had been co mp let ed at the Kop? - A. No,sir.

That was wh ol ly separate, was it? - A. That was an entirely
separate issue.    If I could just mention, I had previously
been to Sheffield W e d n e s d ay on the 10th of July, 1986, to
discuss questions of the Kop.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            20th of July? - A. No,     sir.
The 10th of July.

Was that the first lvisit yo u ever made? - A. To the best
of m y recollection, sir, yes.

10th   of July,   1986. - A. Yes.

And the inspection you are n o w referring          to was when?

       MR.   COLLINS:    7th    of August.

       THE WITNESS:      Yes, sir,    I believe    it was.

                                  the co mposition of the -  what do you call it - safety
                             q    committee? - A.   At that stage, sir, it was the working
                                  party still.

                             0. Still   the working party? - A. Yes,   sir.

                             Q. And what was your intention about its compo.sition and how
                                it should work and its responsibilities? -A. I had formed
                         B      no intention at that stage, sir.  Formed a number of views,
                                but the intention was at that stage it should operate as
                                the old wo rking party did.

                             Q. Now, it would appear that the old working party had no
                                chairman? - A. To be quite honest, sir, I have not really
                                been able to establish how the old working party worked
                                as such.

                             Q. It does not matter how the old one worked.       How did yours
                                wo rk when it started its operations ? - A. Well, sir, it
                                started its opera ti on strictly, if I may go back in history
                                a while to a me et i n g that took place on Friday, the 4th of
                                July, 1986.      That was a meet ing to discuss a letter from
                                Dr."Eastwood, the 26th of June, relating to The Kop.       I
                                recall that that letter included a number of plans, I
                         D      believe, sir, and there were discussions about what was
                                going to ha pp en in relat ion to them.    Immediately prior
                                to that meeting, sir, I formed the view I was going to
                                follow exactly as far as I could what the old County
                                Council had done, as far as I could understand it, in
                                relation to pr eparing notes of meetings and so on and
                                so forth.      However, sir, I was struck at that time,
                                wi t h i n a few minutes of getting into the meeting, that
                                there were potent ia ll y serious problems with the Kop,
                                particularly from the point of vie w of the-Fire Service.

                             Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    It is very difficult to hear
                                  you.  I am sorry.  Wo ul d you bring the microphone closer
                                  and try and speak a little louder? - A. Yes.

Q. Unless you have some written record or write some letter
   to the Club,  how on earth can you know or be sure that they
   are going to   do what they are supposed to do in relation
   to repairs?     A.   Sir, I think I have already explained
   that I did make a note at the time.     I fully intended to
   deal with it but unfortunately it disappeared from the file.

Q.   One would have thought that you would write the sort of
     letter that we see later on, namely referring to the meeting
     and saying, "This, that and the other in the way of repairs
     must be done".   A.   Yes, sir, that should have been done.
     There is no argument about that as far as I am concerned.

Q.   Of course, that could stand effectively as the minutes,
     could it not, in the sense that if you write a letter
     immediately following to indicate what was agreed, that
     will take the place to some extent of the minutes.
     A.   Yes , s i r .

Q. But you have got to have one or the other.                  A.    Yes,   sir.
   I quite agree with you.

Q. And sadly here     you have got neither.           A.    Yes,    very sadly,
   sir. Yes.

Q.   Then we come on to the Kop because, of course, at this time
     too, as'you h a v e i n d i c a t e d , the Kop had been roofed and
     extended to some extent.              A.   Yes,  sir.

Q.    Csn I ask you to look atpage 370 of  our bundle, please,
     mr. Bownes.    You here confirm the Panel agreed to increase
     the capacity of the Kop to 21,000, subject to three
     conditions;   right?    A.  Yes, sir.

Q. For some reason the Ssfety Certificate was never amended
   and never has been amended.    A.  No, sir, there was a
   defect in the procedure in relation to that in that no
   public advertisement was made.

Q. Exactly.      A.    I think      I refer    to that in full in the
   statement.

Q.   You do and you seek to       excuse it by saying it got alot of
     publicity anyway, have       a look at the preceding page of our
     bundle, page 369.    A.      Sir,   I think the statement is
     entirely clear;   there      is no attempt at excuse her.

Q.   I follow that.     A.   Sir,     you     just said    itwas being      used
     as an excuse.

Q. Well, it is being used as an excuse, with respect, Hr. Bownes,
   is it not?   You are saying that although the regulations
   were not followed, in fact everyone knew because it was w e l l -
   publicised.   A.   Sir, I have not used,the word "excuse",
   it was not put as an excuse.  There is £ clear admission
   that there was a mistake made, an oversight in not putting
   a press notice in.   The point of referring, I think, to
   the various bits of publicity which accompanied the
                                65


                                               D.   BOWNES



     development of the Kop was to demonstrate really that had
     any interested persons wished to object or to make any
     comments at all, they would have been clearly put on
     notice by all this publicity.

Q. The Safety Certificate itself is a public document, is
   it?   A.   I am not sure what a public document is, as
   such.

Q. What I mean is, if anyone had come to the City Council
   and said, "Can I have a look at the Sheffield Wednesday
   Safety Certificate?" you would have shown it to him?
   A.   Yes, sir, there is no difficulty with that.

Q. And anyone looking at it, if interested, would have seen
   that the capacity of the Kop was whatever it was - 18,000-odd?
   A.   Yes, sir, that is correct.

Q. And he would not necessarily have appreciated that it had
   been increased.   A.   Sir, I think an amendment to the
   Certificate can be dealt with by means of a letter or other
   document attached to it, as indeed Liverpool have done
   in the latest certificate.

Q.   If it forms part of the Certificate, because any offence,
     of course,, if you have to prosecute, is for breach, of s..
     condition of the Certificate, is it not?    A.    Yes, sir.-    -

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You said just now you did not
      know whether it was a public document but in your proof you
     •say this, do you not, at page 42:   "The General Safety
      Certificate is regarded as a public document and therefore
      the spirit of the legislation has been met."    A.   Yes,
      sir, I failed to recall that.    As far as I am concerned,
      it is a public document and anyone may have access to
      it if they wish to see it.    Sir, as far as I am aware,
      an amendment need not actually be written on the Certificate
      as such, as long as it is properly recorded then I would
      have thought proceedings for an offence could take place,
      obviously you are better qualified to judge that than I
      am, sir.

Q.         MR. COLLINS:     Did you consider   this at   the time?
      A.   Consider what,   sir, exactly?

Q.    That there was no need to amend the Safety Certificate
      because what you had done was satisfactory - was this a
      m a t teT that you considered at the time or is this hindsight
      justification?      A.   I believe I took the view that it
      was unnecessary to recover the original Certificate document
      and physically amend it in order to record the amendment
      in that way.

Q.       - LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:   Was there an amendment in
      effect annexed to     it and a letter saying, "Do the same
      for yours"?   A.       Yes, effectively, sir, this letter
      that we have just     referred to to Mr. Chester at page 370
      of the bundle was     that amendment.

                    Q.        MR. COLLINS:     Although that was simply a private

                         yes, indeed.

                    Q. Certainly, and did not form part of the Certificate itself.
                       A.   The letter did not form part of the Certificate
                       itself, sir.   I take the view, and obviously there are
               g       others better qualified than me to comment on it, that
                       the existence of that would effectively amend the Certificate,

                    Q. Now, after the meeting in August, 1986. and the approval of
                       the extension of the Kop, what was the next matter that the
                       City Council did in relation to the safety certificate, the
                       review of the safety certificate? Can you help us about that.
                       Mr. Bownes? - A. I am not sure to what you are referring.

                    Q. You had indicate in that minute we looked at in May 1966 you
                       were intending to redraft the safety certificate, and you were
                       going to seek comments from the interested parties, that is
               ®       the Fire Service, the Police and the Building Surveyor? - A.
                       Yes, sir.

                    0. And you started that process, did you? - A. If I can refer to
                       some notes I have made, sir?

                    0. Yes, of course.  I just wanted to find out when that process
                       started.  It would seem to have been in the late autumn of
                       1986, but I will be corrected if I am wrong. - A. Perhaps it
                       might be useful for me to go through a chronology of this?

                    0. If you have got a chronology that would be very helpful.

                    0.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We have not got it in this bundle,
                         have we? - A. I think it can be made available, sir.
               D    Q. We have not got it in the bundle? - A. It is not in this
                       bundle at the moment.

                    Q. Is there a copy?

                            MR. MAXWELL:     There is, sir.     There is a copy I have
                      • made available to Mr. Collins.

                              MR. COLLINS:    This is the chronology we are talking
                         about?

                              MR. MAXWELL:   Yes, sir, and I think it is the schedule
                         of safety conditions at the end, its chronology set ou t w i t h
                         letters.  I have not got 20 copies but I can get them.

                              THE WITNESS:   I believe it is the last two pages of the
                         document you have, sir.

                              MR. COLLINS:   Yes.  You had asked other Councils for
                         copies of their safety certificates and their conditions, and
                         you had done that in April and May 1986? - A. That is correct.

                         And in June 1986 you sent a memorandum....

                              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If this is tabulated in some form
                         I would very much like to have it rather than have to write it
                         all down again.

                               MR. MAXWELL:   Yes, I am sending someone off now to do
                         it.

                          afterwards.

                               MR. COLLINS:     I was handed this by Mr. Maxwell this
                          morning:

                     Q. Let me take it fairly quickly because copies will be maae
                        available, and we can see them later.  18th April, 1986, you
                        refer to a response from Liverpool enclosing copies of their
               g |      safety certificate conditions.

                               MR. MAXWELL:   I hesitate to interrupt, but in the mean
                          time could I offer you mine, marked somewhat as it is. but it
                          may assist you.

                               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I will be patient.

                     Q.        MR. COLLINS:   6th May 1986, meeting of General Purposes
                          Panel, the resolution we have seen.  That is in our bundle,
                          313.  29th May your Chief Executive writes to his opposite
                          numbers in Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds asking for their
                          safety certificates? - A. Yes, sir.

                   O. 5th June memo to building surveyor, and letters containing the
                      same comments to the Chief Constable and Chief Fire Officer,
               D |    informing them that the certificate conditions were shortly to
                      be redrafted when they would be asked for comments.  That was
                      putting them on notice they were going to be asked for
                      comments but not actually asking them? - A. That is right.

                     0. You get a reply from Birmingham on 10th June.   You       write to
                         your opposite numbers in Barnsley and Doncaster on       4tn July
                       . inviting consultation, because they had taken over       some of the
                         old South Yorkshire grounds in their jurisdiction?       - A. Yes,
                         and Rotherham Council as well.

                     Q. And Rotherham.  29th August you get some response from the
                        Home Office? - A. Yes, sir.  I d o n ’t think that should be in
                        there.  It is not really relevant.

                     Q. We will forget about that.       - A. The next entry is 24th
                        September.

                     Q. You get a copy from Manchester.  I can see you were doing
                        that, but you did not start the process of asking for the
                        specific comments of the Fire Service, the Building Department
                        and the Police, it would seem until November 1986 or
                        thereabouts, because if you look at our page 374.... - A. I
                        think I can speed this up a bit.  The drafting of the safety
                        certificate conditions actually took place during the 6 months
                        January-June 1987.

                     Q. Yes, I follow that.  All I am asking you about at the moment
                        is when you requested the input to help you with the drafting
                        from the Fire, Police and Building Department? - A. That was
                        on 7th July, 1987.
                H    0. 7th July?       No, you told them you were going to ask them on 7th

                                July? - A. I think you have mistaken 1986 and 1987.

                      0. You say you did not ask them until July 1987? - A. Yes.

                      Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     About a year later? - A. Yes.

                      q   .          MR. COLLINS:   I think you are doing yourself an
                                injustice there, Mr. Bownes, because unless I have misread the
              g                 purpose of the letter at page 374 you had asked in November
                                1986.

                                     MR. MAXWELL:   I hesitate to say the purpose has been
                                misunderstood, but I think it has, because it is a response to
                                another letter asking whether the Fire Service has any
                                comments about the ground rather than in the context of safety
                                certificate conditions.

                                     MR. COLLINS:   I follow.  I got myself into the same mess
                                before as I remember, in relation to the Fire documents:

                      Q. It was not until July 1987 that you asked for the input that
                         had been referred to in the meeting of May 1986.  Is that
                         right? - A. Yes, sir.

               D      Q. It seems to have taken, with respect, an awful long time to
                         get round to asking for their comments? - A. Yes, sir.   The
                         problem essentially was that the exercise which I originally '
                         anticipated would be relatively straightforward was not.   By
                         looking at the other Council certificates I noticed very much
                         in the way that Mr. Justice Popplewell noticed that matters
                         differed considerably between authorities.  It took me a great
                         deal of time to wrestle with that and to try and get it down
                         and take the best bits of each certificate and put them
                         together.

                      Q. That was the problem, was it? - A. It was a very great
                         problem, yes, sir.

                      0. Having requested that y o u , I think, had a draft report for a
                         meeting in September 1987 which appears on our page 417? Is
                         that correct, or your page 128, whichever you prefer. - A.
                         Yes, a report to the General Purposes Panel in September 1987.

                          Q. What you say there, I think so far as relevant is that you
                             refer back under the heading, "Current situation" to the
                             panel’s meeting in May 1986, and identified several main areas
                             for further investigation? - A. Yes, sir.

                          Q. Then you deal with the review of the administrative system and
                             say it is going to be changed.  In the meantime presumably
                             there had been an inspection meeting in August 1987, or the
                             summer of 1987, or not? - A. yes, there had been one in 198/.

                          Q .
                                 That was under the old system again, was it? - A. No, sir,
                                 that was under the new system slightly anticipating this
                                 report, where individual officers were asked to submit
                  H              comments in writing, which indeed happened.

                                                                          D.   B0 W N E 5




                         Q. That we can see, for example, at - no we can't. - A. It is in
                            my bundle.

                         0. I am not particularly concerned with that because no doubt it
                            was sensible to anticipate what was clearly a sensible
                            reorganisation.  I don't doubt that at all. Can I get
                            absolutely clear what was the new system as you understood it
                     B      that was going to operate? - A. The inspection system or the
                            administrative system, sir?

                         Q. First of all the inspection system? - A. Yes, sir. My
                            impression was that the best way of operating an inspection
                            system like this was to persuade officers to submit the     -
                            comment subsequently in writing and then those comments would
                            be submitted to the club, which would make it reasonably clear
                            what exactly was being raised and who was raising it in order
                            that the matter could be dealt with more efficiently than I
                            thought had been done in the past.  So it occurred to me that
                            some of the working party minutes did not make it clear who
                            was saying what in relation to matters.

                         G. I follow that, but you would have an annual inspection? - A.
                            Yes.
                     D
                         0. That would take how long, was it anticipated? One day, two
                           •days? - A. In terms of officer time or in terms of time on the.
                            ground?

                         Q. In terms of time actually on the ground? - A. That would take
                            perhaps a full day, I would have thought.

                         0. Who would decide which parts were to be inspected? - A. That
                            would be for the individual officers to form their own views.
                            They would go to the areas they were most concerned with.

                         Q.    Was there a chairman of that group? - A. No, sir, it can't
                              work like that effectively.   This is a very similar system to
                              that used for public entertainment inspections in those sort
                              of premises, where officers simply go to the areas they are
                              particularly interested in in order to obtain their comments
                              or make comments.

                         Q. Did you attend? - A. Yes. I did.

                         G.   What parts did you look at? - A. I can't recall offhand, sir.

                         G.    What did you consider to be the area with which you were
                              concerned when you went on these inspections? - A. Any area
                              which somebody pointed out to me was a matter ior concern, for
                              example, sir.

                         0. Such as? - A. I c a n ’t actually recall what happened on the
                            inspection, sir.

                         Q. Did you have any knowledge of what you were going to look for?
                     H      - A. No, sir.  As far as I am concerned I am not an expert.

                                                                       D.   B OW N E S




                    Q. I follow that.  - A. I rely on the advice of experts, and they
                       have frequently given advice on various matters relating to
                       safety.  My job as I saw it was to ensure that the inspectors
                       could go where they wanted to, were not obstructed in any way
                       - there was no suggestion they were ever obstructed - and to
                       ensure they had all the information they needed to carry out
                       their job.
                B
                    Q. Did you have an advance meeting before you went on this
                       inspection to discuss among yourselves what you should look
                       for an so on? - A. Not as I recall in those terms. All the
                       services involved are very familiar with doing inspections in
                       this wary.

                    0. Did you have a meeting afterwards to decide what each of you
                       required to be done or was it simply left to the individual to
                       write a letter to you? - A. Individuals wrote a letter, sir.

                    Q. To you? - A. To me.

                    Q. And you would send on to the club? You would write to the
                       club incorporating such of the points as you thought the club
                       ought to know about? - A. No, sir.  What happened on this
                D      occasion is that the newly set up advisory group, which is
                       referred to in this report in September 1987, considered the
                       various comments made by the Building Surveyor and the
                       Environmental Health Department, and from their input I -was
                       able to extract a list of comments to send to the club.

                    Q. The advisory group was going to consist of who? - A. The Fire
                       Service, the Police, the Building Surveyor, the Health &
                         Consumer Services and ourselves, sir.

                    Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You have got a working party which
                         consists of these.  They conduct an inspection? - A. Yes.

                    Q.    With you there. They then write to you with their comments on
                         the inspection for consideration by an advisory group? - A.
                         Yes.

                    Q.   Which is fhe same outfit? - A. Yes, sir, effectively.

                    Q.   Then 1 d o n ’t understand. It is probably my fault, but I d o n ’t
                         understand the difference between the working party and the
                         advisory group at the moment. - A. There is none effectively.
                         It is simply a change of name.

                    G. Why do you call it something different? - A. Because that more
                       accurately reflected what it did, sir.

                    Q.       MR. COLLINS:   Are there two different bodies? One goes
                         and does the inspection and then reports back to another
                         group? - A. No, sir.

                    0. It is the same group? - A. It is the same individuals.            The
                H      individuals do not inspect as a group.

                                                                         D.   B OW N E S




                    Q. They inspect individually? - A. Yes.

                    Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What we have got then is a change
                         of nomenclature.  What was the officer working party is now
                         going to be the advisory group? - A. Yes, sir.

                    Q. And the officer working party can        be buried.    Is that it? - A.
               B       Yes.

                    0. As a name? - A. Yes, sir.

                    0.       MR. COLLINS:   I am sorry, but this meeting you attend at
                         the ground, is that all the advisory group going along on the
                         same day? - A. It is not a meeting as such.  It is an
                         inspection.

                    G. I am sorry.  This inspection of the ground, is this all the
                       advisory group going along on the same day? - A. Yes. it is
                       representatives from all the authorities going there and
                       inspecting.

                    Q. And then you have a meeting after that to decide what should
                        be done? - A. When the comments are in, if it is appropriate
               D       to do so.

                    G. Each after that'-inspection' writes you a letter indicating what'
                       he has seen that he considers ought to be put to the club? - '
                       A. Yes, sir.

                    Q. You receive all those letters? - A. Yes.

                    Q.    You then put them together and    decide what should go to the
                         club.    Is that right? - A. No,   as I have just explained....

                    Q. You have another meeting of the advisory group? - A. No, a
                       meeting, not another meeting.

                    G.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You have an inspection.  Now you
                         are having a meeting.   The same personnel? - A. Sometimes the
                         same personnel, sir.   It depends who is available at the time.

                    Q. That meeting is not on site.         That is round a table somewhere?
                       - A. yes, sir.

                    0. And if something like removal of a barrier is proposed at a
                       meeting of that kind you consider it is down to you to decide
                       whether it happens or it does not? - A. No, sir, that is not
                       right at all.

                    Q. Well, I have misunderstood what you said before about
                       delegation. - A. When the comments are collated and brought
                       together then they are submitted to the club acting under the
                       appropriate delegated power, sir, after they have been
                       discussed if necessary.
                H   0. They are submitted to the club, you say? - A.           Yes. sir

                        Q. And then? - A. And then the club takes action and the
                           individual members check the work has been done.

                        Q. Forgive me, but can I just get this clear in my mind. At what
                           point is the city's approval given and by whom? - A. At the
                           point the letter goes out to the club with the consolidated
                           comments, sir.
                    B
                        Q. But between the meeting of the advisory group and your sending
                           that letter out, has anyone other than you from the city
                           considered it? - A. No, sir, effectively not.

                        G. So it is your decision as far as the city is concerned as to
                           whether it goes to the club with approval? - A. Yes, sir,
                           effectively, after all the comments have been fully discussed
                           by the people who are making them.

                               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        I think we will break off at that
                           point.  2 o'clock.

               TUESDAY, 27th JUNE, 1989

                 (AFTERNOON     SESSION)

     MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, I hope you have received now
the memoranda from Mr. Bownes in the form of, I think
it is, five sheets.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        I think it is coming up now.

     MR. MAXWELL:    Sir, can I iust explain what         it is that
you are receiving?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes.   Thank you.




                                                                      rr OQ
     MR. MAXWELL:    Threeof the sheets are headed by a pa
narked delay and the other two are headed safety certifica
conditions schedule.

     MR. COLLINS:   Those behind me have only received
three sheets.  I do not know whether that is general or
whether we are being discriminated against.

     MR; MAXWELL:—   „The.r.e should.?.be a total of five,..'... ..

     MR. COLLINS:   Being discriminated against.  I have
got rive but I just wondered whether anyone else had
three sheets only.  I am told the five may have been
divided into three and 2 but I am not sure.

     MR. MAXWELL:   Sound engineering principle.          Sir,
do you have the five sheets?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I have got three and two
which takes one back a very long time.

     MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, yes.  What they consist of,
on the sheet marked delay, is a commentary on the
matter of delay and that is attached to a chronology
of what are called and explained in the body of the
first sheet exceptional events arising in Mr. Bownes'
workload and running parallel with that chronology
is a chronology set out under the heading safety
certificate condition schedule and the chronology
is divided up into six month blocks each and it is
hoped one can look across from the blocks in the
chronology of exceptional events to the corresponding
block in the safety certificate conditions schedule.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes.    Thank you.

                                                     D. BOWNES

                    DAVID BOWNES   Recalled

               Examined by MR. COLLINS (Cont'd):

Q. Yesj Mr. Bownes, perhaps the convenient thing to do would
   be to incorporate this into your statement, would it, as
   really part and parcel of it? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Mr. Bownes, we were dealing just before lunch with the
   change of the working party to the advisory group,
   advisory - I have forgotten the name now. - A. Group, sir.

Q. Group.   I was right, yes.  And you explained about that.
   Now, you were then going on to explain about the future
   administration.  That, I think, appears, does it not.
   at page 418 of our bundle and 129 of yours or does that
   deal with both, both the change of status of the advisory
   group and the future administration? - A. Yes, sir, it
   deals with both.

Q.We have dealt with the advisory group.      Can we go on to
   the future administration and can you tell us of the
   salient details of your understanding of the system
   after this was agreed? - A. Yes, sir. Basically it was
   similar to the old system in that there were some
   guidelines’ issued to r.the various officers.'indicatih^'-'-c .
   the areas in which they would have a particular
   responsibility, if you like.     I think that is dealt
   with in full detail in the report.

Q. The areas of responsibilities are those set out at
   the bottom of the first page or, rather, the .... - A.
   That is correct, sir, and over the page on 3.

Q. Yes. What I still want to know is the question of the
   decision making and that you set out on page 419. You
   say there is also, under delegations,  also a further
   question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
   to the day to day decisison making required for the
   running of the certification system? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. "At the moment decision making powers rest with the panel
   but this is a highly impractical arrangement which needs
   to be reviewed urgently."   Can I just pause there?
   That sentence suggests that you did not in fact have
   any decision making powers before this proposal was
   put into effect? - A. I do not think that is right, sir.
   The previous report that I mentioned earlier on dealt
   with the continuation really of the working party system
   as it was effectively and I believe that gave delegated
   powers  to deal with it.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Which report was that? - A.
     It was the May, 1986 report, sir.
                                              D. BOWNES

     MR. COLLINS:   313, I think.  Effectively he is
referring, as I understood it, to 316A, the panel being
asked to note the broad outlines or the administrative
system organised by the County Council and authorise
its continuation for the time being:

Is that correct, Mr. Bownes? - A. That is correct, yes.

You went into that but all I am noting is that sentence
on page 419 which reads, “At the moment decision making
powers rest with the panel but this is a highly im­
practical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently,
if that sentence is taken at face value and if the
reader believed what he was reading it would indicate
that you had no powers to make decisions at that stage
because the powers had only been delegated to the panel?
- A. No, sir, I think that is really referring to the new
administrative system in that sense.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Would you look at page 122
in your bundle? - A. I have it, sir.

well, (a), (b) and (c) there sum it up, do not they?    In
the meantime following delegations be approved.  All
powers delegated to the General Purposes Panel.  Right?
- A. Yes, sir.

Then emergency procedure powers under Section 10 go to
head of Administration and Legal Department. Well,
that is issuing prohibitions, is not it?- A. It is making
application to the Court for a Prohibition Notice.

That is right.  And (c) Power to authorise officersunder
Section 11 is inspections, is not it?- A. Yes, sir.

So so far as any decision making about what is to be
approved by way of a change in layout is concerned,
(a) is what applies, is not it, General Purposes Panel?
- A. I would point out that report is in March of 1986
before the Council actually became the certificating
authority.

Yes. Where is something different now? - A. In the
second report, sir, at point ....

     MR. COLLINS:   Your page 127, our page 317, I
think? - A. Yes, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, you derive it from (a)
there, do you? - A. Yes, sir.

     MR. COLLINS:   Mr. Bownes, forgive me, I do not thin:
that can possibly be right, can it. because come on to
our page 419, your page.130 and that sentence which reads
                                                           D. BOWNES

quite clearly at the moment, i.e., as of now before these
provisions are put into effect, decision making powers
rest with the panel but that   is highly impractical? - A.
Yes, sir, I think-that was a reference to the, if you
like, decisions that involve the change of capacity,
for example, at the Kop.

It does not say that and, indeed, it is wholly consistent
with the history, as Lord Justice Taylor has pointed out to
you, that you should have believed that at that time, i.e.,
September, 1987, decision making powers in general rested
with the panel? - A . I do not share that interpretation,
sir, I am afraid.

Well, with respect then, you do not write what you mean,
do you? - A. I think it is important to appreciate that
I knew perhaps what I x-;as talking about at the time but
perhaps did not translate it entirely accurately into
words.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Well, I am sorry to intervene
again but I do not see how a rather bland and vague
expression in (a) on your page 127 can be said to change
what can be read at page 122.        How does it change it? - A.
Well, sir, it authorises the continuation for the time
being toi?'the: :ol:d' County Council 'administrative- 'system-. •..'C’l.--.
It is riot drafted in the sane terms as the previous
delegation, sir.

Well, what was the County Council's system, that an
officer in your position should have the decision
making power? Where do you get that from? - A. Effectively
the working party operate in the way it did.

     MR. COLLINS:  You told us earlier you did not know
how it worked.  That was half the trouble? - A. Yes, it
was half the trouble, sir, yes.

If you did not know how it worked how could you know
that it worked to give you delegated powers? - A. I
took the view that the County Council in writing to clubs
or whatever making comments had the power then, if you
like, to make the decisions.  Effectively the working
party could be said to have made recommendations which
were then firmed up in the form of letters to the clubs
or whatever.

Can we just see what your thinking may have been at the
time? Could you be good enough to look at page 381 of
our bundle, please? This is a note of a meeting held in
March of 1987.  How, about half-way down - this is a
Fire Service Department note of a meeting apparently
held at the Town Hall.  Is that right? - A. No.  It
                                                          78


                                                                                  D. BOWNES

                                  says meeting held at Division Street conference rooms.

                               Q. Where is that?  Is that the Fire Service? - A. It would
                                  have been at the time, sir, I think, yes.

                               0. And it records your presence and various other of the
                                  City Council and a number of Fire Service.- Right? - A.
                                  Yes, sir.
                       B
                               Q. You remember this meeting, do you, Mr. Bownes? - A. Yes,
                                  sir, I think s o .

                               0. About half-way down, discussion on areas of responsibility
                                  and ground inspections, which presumably is relevant to
                                  what developed into the memorandum that we have been
                                  looking at in September? - A. Yes, sir. What followed
                       C          after this meeting was in fact an exchange of corres­
                                  pondence about this situation.

                               Q. It says, "On areas of responsibilities Mr. Bownes did not
                                   want to be tied down to individual references and even
                                   indicated that his department could not act independently
                                   but must refer all matters to the Council Committee
                                   responsible for the Safety at Sports Grounds Act."
                       D
                                   Now, it looks as if you were then saying that you yourself
                                ■ could -not make, decisions., .you had to ref.exv. everything
                                   back, does not it?' — A . Sir, I think t'he_ discussion
                                   really was there about the future administration of
                                   the system rather than the present one and it was an
                                   attempt to discuss what role the General Purposes Panel
                                 ■ should have and what role officers should have.
                           E
                               Q. Well, for the future you did not want to have to refer
                                  everything back.  What that appears to be relating to
                                  is the present, i.e., you cannot now act independently,
                                  you have got to refer everything back? - A. I would say
                                  not, sir.  I think that is referring to broad discussion
                                  about the future.

                           F   Q. I see.  It goes on, "Whilst all others present would
                                  prefer definitive areas of responsibility, allowing
                                  there must be some overlap, Mr. Bownes preferred to
                                  refer back to the future meeting following further
                                  consideration of the matter." That is to say that you
                                  were not then accepting definitive areas of responsibility.
                                  You thought further discussion was needed? - A. Certainly"
                                  further thought, sir.  That, indeed, did take place.
                           G
                               0. You then refer or it is recorded you referred to the recent
                                  Lords decision on ground inspections.  Did that refer to
                                  the Bill that was then presumably going through which
                                  became the 87 Act? - A. To be perfectly honest, sir, I
                                  do not know.  I do not know what that refers to at all.

                               Q. You cannot help on that? - A. No.
                           H

                                                     D. BOWNES

Q. This would mean a much more thorough examination than
   the present system of bi-annual inspections.  Did you
   believe that, that your future system would be more
   thorough, annual inspections? - A. I must admit the
   wording is a little difficult.  I do not really know
   what it is getting at there.

Q. Well, the difficulty is you did not apparently take a
   record of this meeting? - A. Sir, what happened following
   this was that detailed letters were sent to individual
   authorities dealing with the future administrative system.

0.. But. you see, this is the only record we have and since it
    refers to your thoughts I thought in fairness to you I ought
    to ask you" to deal with the matters in case any false
    impression may have been given?- A. Yes.   I think the
    matters were dealt with fully in correspondence sub­
    sequently.

Q. I see. Did you think it v/ould mean a more thorough
   examination than the present system because that was
   not said in terms, I think, in the correspondence? “ A.
   I do not know, sir, to be quite honest.          I think in
   principle an annual inspection is preferable to a bi­
   annual inspection in that it can be more detailed, no
 ' questiW-c)S;-tha'Cf‘'a-xnereas- a--bi-annual -inspect! on       :
   not be as detailed.

Q. I totally fail to follow that, Mr. Bownes.   It depends
    how detailed you choose to make the inspection, whether
  ' it be bi-annual or annual, does not it? - A. Yes, sir.
    I think an annual inspection tends to focus minds a
    little better than a bi-annual one does and an annual
    inspection is a common occurrence in all other licensing
    areas rather than bi-annual.




                                 / Q.       I hear
                                                         80

      SBD                                                                        D. BOWNES
      N1
                         }.   I hear what you say, Mr. Bownes.  Then it appears that the
                              fire service expressed some reservation about during
                              game inspections.  Do you recall that? A. There certainly
                              was discussion about that, Sir, yes.

                         }.   Do you remember over the page: "It was pointed out by the
                              fire service the new guide-line including the section which
                              defines in detail management responsibility.  Recommended
                     B        the club Certificate specifies as a condition of licence
                              that this be complied with".  Do you recall that point
                              being made? A. It certainly was raised, and in correspond­
                              ence subsequently, Sir, and at a further meeting later on
                              I believe.

                              Finally there is a note that you were reluctant to produce
                              minutes of meetings.   Is that right? A. I think that that
                              is a misinterpretation, Sir.   I would say that I would have
                              difficulty in producing notes quite as quickly as David
                              Vaughn had d o n e .

                         Q.   Were you reluctant   to make minutes?          No,    not necessarily,
                              no.              ?

                         Q.   Did you make minutes?    A.   Not of this particular meeting,
                     D        no .

                         Q.   Did yo'w m a k e 1minutes of any meetings?    A-    yes » :of'"which
                              you have copies.;

                         Q.   I do not think we have seen any minutes that you have made
                              of any meetings, Mr. Bownes.  Unfortunately the notes that
                              you made of the 1986 meeting seem to   have    gone astray.
                              A. With respect,   Sir, they have been passed on to you.
                              I can certainly have more copies done if that is of a ss i s t ­
                              ance to you.

                         Q    I will be corrected if I am wrong by your counsel but I
                              do not think we have any minutes made by you of any meetings

                         Q.       MR. MAXWELL: Mr. Bownes should be invited to identify
                              the meetings of which he says minutes have been passed on.
                              I certainly recall other documents being passed on.

                                  MR. COLLINS:   There it is.  There have  been letters,
                              of course, which   set out matters but I do   not recall seeing
                              —  and I shall certainly be corrected if I am wrong — any
                              minutes of meetings made by you, Mr. Bownes. A. Sir,
                              they were passed on to you in a bundle.

                                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Are there any in the bundle either
                              attached to your own statement or the core bundle that
                              you have seen? A. There is certainly on in relation to
                              an advisory group meeting, yes.

                              Is it possible   to pin-point    it or not?    A. Yes,      certainly,
                     H        Sir .

    MR. COLLINS: There is a note at page 408 of our
bundle which is a note of a meeting of the 16th July
but that I think is not yours but is a fire service
minute. 434(a) I think may be what you are referring
to in the core bundle.  You say in your own bundle
there is an example of another, you are quite right.
A. Yes, Sir. I cannot quite put my hand on it at the
moment, Sir.

I will find it for you if you will                    give me a moment.
A. Document 27, page 131, Sir.

131 and 132.  This is a note made by you, is it? A. That
is correct, of a meeting that took place on 28th April.

This particular one is merely an example                    because it does
not itself deal with anything to do with                    Sheffield
Wednesday save for the first item, which                    notes the annual
inspection date. A. That is correct.  It                    is put in there as
an example.  There are several others on                    the file.

It is entirely my fault because I had rather assumed from
that that since you used an example which did not really
relate to Sheffield Wednesday there were not any .Then we
were handed 434(a) which I had forgotten about. A. That,
if you recall, was during your introduction where you referred
specif ic ally'to*' the- -building- surveyors m e m o r a n d u m -
                                                                  . ".-r..-. -

That 434(a) was a note of a meeting in March.  This
describes itself as a meeting of the advisory group in
order to consider the building surveyors memorandum.
A. And also a number of other matters.

I am not concerned with the other matters, it is Sheffield
Wednesday matters I am concerned with.  It also contains
the comment about a pattern developing of people arriving
some 15 minutes before the start of the game hoping to gain
admission. A. Yes, Sir, it does.

This question of the Turnstiles.  Can you remember whether
that related to the Spion Kop or the other end? A. I do not
know, Sir, I think that it probably was a general comment
made by the policeman involved.

Someone appears in March, 1988, to have been put on notice
about a pattern of people arriving within fifteen minutes
of kick-off? A. I am sorry?

Your recollection now is that it was dealing with both
but I think that is probably wrong.  If you would be good
enough to turn to 434. A. Yes.

You will see that is an internal memorandum. A. Yes, I
see paragraph three, and you are probably right.  It does
in fact refer to the Kop end.

P a r a g r a p h   three   makes   it plain   that   it was referring    to

                         the Penistone Road   turnstiles.   A. Yes.

                    Q.   This was the memorandum that I referred to in my opening
                          and which I said that there appeared to be no record of
                          anything done.  Mr. Maxwell very properly pointed out that
                          was inaccurate and it was in those circumstances that the
                          document that is now 434(a) came to be produced.   That I
                          think is the history of that. A. Yes, Sir, 'I think that
               g         is right.

                    Q.   Apart from that and the one of which we have an example are
                          there any toher relevant m emorandum or minutes of meetings?
                          Presumably there are not otherwise I imagine they would have
                          been produced. A. I have to say that I was asked to produce
                          for Treasury Council copies of all the meetings that had
                          been held that I had notes of, which I did.   There are
                          probably six or seven of them here, Sir.

                          I will defer that because there appears to have been a possible
                          misunderstanding and breakdown of communication which is not
                          your fault or anyones fault, it is just one of those things
                          which sometimes happens.  Let me, if I may, move away from
                          that and come forward a bit.  Can we please go on to page
                          421.  This is a letter of the 15th October, 1987, which you
               D         wrote to the club referring to the revised guide.   That
                          is the 1986. A. Yes, Sir, that is right.

                         It takes you a year to get round to writing this letter.
                         A. The fire service pointed out shortly, before this letter
                         went —  I believe at an advisory group meeting —   that it
                         might be an idea to sent it and therefore it was done- as
                         quickly as possible.

                    Q.   Had you read   the new guide?   A. I looked through   it, certainly.

                    Q.   At what stage? A. It was received I thnk I said       in   November,
                          1986, some time around that time.

                         One matter that perhaps is fairly obvious is that you knew
                         there was a five year rotation of testing of the crash barriers?
                         A. Under the old Certificate that is right.

                          You saw in the 1986 Guide a recommendation that that ought
                          to be now four years. A. I have to admit I was innocent
                          of that requirement until the building surveyor pointed
                          it out to me.

                          When did he point it out to you? A. Some weeks ago now
                          when considering the revised Draft Safety Certificate
                          conditions.

                    Q.    You did not appreciate that there was something wrong
                          there? A. I did not at that time, no.

                    Q.    You get back, page 422, what I think could be described as
                          a somewhat pained letter to the effect that really he had
                H

                   had a copy of the Guidge for ages. A. Yes, I think that
                   it is a very direct letter without question, Sir.

                   Let me now go on to 481.  That is a leter which is written,
                   as we can see, on the 30th March, 1989, which refers to
                   the fire officers letter of the 13th August, 1987.
                   A . Yes.

          B        This is a delay of over 12 months occasioned, as one sees
                   from the document that was put in this afternoon, effectively
                   because during the whole of 1988 nothing was done in relation
                   to Sheffield Wednesday or indeed any safety on sports ground
                   licensing at all, apart from the annual inspection.  A. I
                   do see where you draw that inference from the document.
                   I have not said in there that no safety at sports grounds
                   work was done.  Taht would be incorrect.

              Q.   Nothing was done in relation to the up-dating of the
                    Safety Certificate. A. That is entirely accurate.

              Q.   The reason you give for that is that you had an excessive
                    work in relation to certain other licensing matters which
                    came under your department? A. Yes, basically.

          D   Q.   Since you realized that there was a very considerable delay
                    and you were clearly getting snowed under did you ask
                    for'more staff ? A. 'It was not a question of--being snowed ~
                    under, Sir.  It was a question of allocating priorities.
                    I formed the view, by this stage, that the Certificate
                    conditions were not of a top priority, if you like.     In
                    fact I understand they are still in operation in Barnsley,
                    Rotherham, and Doncaster in a very similar form to the
                    original counter system.

Q. That may be but the fact is, of course, that the Leppings
   Lane end of this ground had changed radically since the
   Safety Certificate was issued in 1979.   A.   It had
   certainly changed, sir, yes.

q   .        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What has happened at other
        grounds in terms of the Certificate may merely reflect
        that nothing had changed there.   A.   In terms of the
        drafting of theCertificate, I am referring to, sir.

Q.      No, in terms of the ground.    A.  Yes,         sir, it could be
        interpreted that way, certainly, sir.

Q.           MR. COLLINS:   As I understand your evidence this
        morning, you at no time appreciated that there were factors
        in the ground which cried out or - I will not use emotive
        words - that there were factors in this ground which
        required there to be some sort of a reconsideration;   there
        was a change of circumstances.   A.   As I believe I said
        this morning, sir, I think it is appropriate to review
        Certificate conditions after a period of time so that the
        interested Officers can have a look at them and decide
        what, if anything, needs to be done.    It would be true
        to say that I was not aware of any changes that would
        need to be made at that stage as such - any major changes.

Q.      And you were not aware of any problems that were arising
        in relation to the capacity of the pens at Leppings Lane?
        A.   Not at all, sir, no.

Q.'And you were not aware of any need for any sort of updating
   of the Certificate to deal with that specific matter?
   A.   To deal with that specific matter, no, sir.   In fact,
   I wrote towards the end of 1987 to the various Officers
   asking them if they had got any comments on the stadia
   generally in Sheffield and that exercise I would have
   assumed would have brought to the surface any problems
   that were outstanding.   I believe letters ---   The Fire
   Service letter is dated 3rd November, 1986 in fact.   I
   am sorry, it was not 1987, it was 1986.

             MR. MAXWELL:  Sir, these have all been put together
        in the form of a small bundle of correspondence which
        was also handed out this morning, some of which appears in
        other bundles but I think the majority does not.    it is
        a bundle of correspondence from the Sheffield City
        Council to various parties.

             LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:      Is that this?

             MR.   MAXWELL:     No,    those   are photographs,   sir.

             LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR;      well>   there is other      stuff
        with it.

             MR. MAXWELL;       It is the      "other stuff",   sir.      It is
        part of the other     stuff.

                                                D.   BOWNES



          MR. COLLINS:      I must confess it would have helped
     if I had been given    this, but there we are.   I am not
     blaming Mr. Maxwell    in the least.   It does help in
     examining witnesses    if one has the material to enable
     one to do so.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What is this bundle exactly?
     It just appeared here this morning.   It has got some
     reproductions of photographs.   I am told they relate
     to Bradford, is that right?

          MR. MAXWELL:   No, they do not, sir.    I am sorry,
     I cannot see what you are looking at, sir.    Those are
     photographs of Hillsborough immediately before it was
     refurbished for the 1966 World Cup Marches.    They show
     the Leppings Lane end and we thought they might be of
     historical interest at least in showing how far that Kop went
     up at that end, and you canalso see the tunnel as it used
     to be and the lay-out of the crush barriers as they were
     after that refurbishment, as they would have been before
     Dr. Eastwood did his work.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       I see.     Thank you very much.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:    Can I just flick      through this very
:     •quickly.’
               mi'th you, Hr : Bownes. The    first letter," Oct«be’f ,-       "
     1986, deals with the Kop development and is written to
     Eastwoods, is that right?      A.    Yes, sir, that is correct.

Q. And deals with      the question of plans largely,         I think.
  .'A . Yes, sir.

Q. And then we have the 3rd November, 1986 letter which we
   have already referred to asking for the Fire Service
   comments as to the condition of United and Wednesday.
   A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   Then the letter of 18th February, 1987, which is in our
     bundle at 374 which deals with the Fire Service comments
     and then we have a letter of the 19th March to the Club,
     19th March, 1987.    A.   Sir, could I just point out that
     is, in fact, a draft letter.   The actual letter to the
     Club went out on 22nd April.     It is included there to note
     the comments of the Fire Service.

Q.    And the letter   that in the end   went   out is in our bundle     and
     is page 383.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry, I must say I find
     this extremely unsatisfactory.    We have had bundles of
     documents and we have been through them and now, in the
     middle of the hearing we have got to faff about trying to
     fit some letters in which have jjst surfaced today and I,
     for the moment, am not finding it at all convenient to
     dot about to those that are in the bundles, those that
     are not.   It is very unfortunate that this was not
     produced earlier, I am afraid, Mr. Maxwell, is it not?

                           MR. MAXWELL:   Yes,          I think it is, sir.       I think what
                      has happened is that ---

                           LORD JUSTICE      TAYLOR:        We have been going    for some
                      weeks now.

                            MR. MAXWELL:    I think Mr. Bownes found that there
               g      was a further file   in his office which the Police had not
                       taken possession of and in this bundle are documents that
                      arise from that.    I think that is the explanation as to
                      why they were not available at the outset.

                            MR.   COLLINS:      Sir,    it is thoroughly unsatisfactory.

                    Q. Can I go back to 374, the letter of 18th February, 1987.
                       Unfortunately our bundle has an incomplete copy of that
                       letter.

                              MR. COLLINS:         Sir, you will note that we have s
                       letter which runs to 4 pages, that is through to 377.
                       If you would be good enough to look at the bundle that has
                       just been handed in, you will see there is an extra
                       page, and a rather important extra page, because it deals
               D      with specifically          the question of the sliding gates,
                       where the Fire Service are saying that they accepted the
                      '“
                       slidih'.g'/gates'. "t3ut -wish :bo point out that it'-ds." tbe'-vievv ;•- ■• »•;
                       that doors required' for escape should upen 'at'wards,..........
                       it is recommended that notice be given to the Club to
                       the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be replaced
                       then the replacements must open outwards, even if this
                       involves structural work to recess the           opening to avoid
                       impinging over footpaths which, of course, is wholly
                       consistent with Paragraph 64, I think it was, of the
                       1986 Green Guide, and they then deal with the method.
                       So clearly the Fire Service did specifically consider and
                       deal with that matter although, unfortunately, I was not
                       aware that that had been the case when I was putting the
                       matters to Dr. Eastwood whenever I was doing so.

                            Sir, this obviously is a page -- I do not know how
                       it has come about that the page is missing from the
                       document we have in the bundle.   It must have got itself
                       detached in the bundle from which we got the letter.    I
                       am not quite sure where that came from.

                            MR.   MULLER:      The     full letter   is in the Fire Service
                       bundle.

                            MR. COLLINS:   It is my fault because I have been
                       working from the core bundle.   Fortunately, it is not
                       a matter which is central.

                     . Then we were going on to the letter of 22nd April.    You
                       have got the draft of the 19th March which became the
                       letter of the 22nd and the letter of the 22nd is indeed
                H      the next in this little bundle, or a copy of it, our page 383;
                       right?   A.   Yes.

                                                     D.   BOWNES



Q. Then we have a letter to the Police - we are back now to
   November, 1986 - in which you ask the Police for their
   comments;  right?   A.   Yes, sir, it is very similar
   to the Fire Service letter.

Q. You get the reply from the Police of 6th January, 1987,
   in which they say both stadia, so far as the Police are
   concerned, conform or meet their requirements.   A.  Yes,
   sir.

Q. Then a letter of 3rd Mar c h , 1987 next. A. To the
   Council's Building Surveyor, sir, asking the same question.

Q.    Yes.   Memorandum from him in his turn of 24th June,
      1987, effectively saying, "Well, if you want me to do
      this, it is going to take some time."   A.   Yes, sir.
      I think he was referring to a full survey of both stadia.

Q. Yes, and that  memorandum is in our bundle at page 386.
   Then we go on to the Building Surveyor's comments, if I
   am right about that, of August, 1987.   A.  Yes, sir.

Q.    13th August,   1987,   and   those are in the bundle ---

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Apart   from identifying   them,
      what are we getting at?                       ' ' ' *'          ‘i :i

           MR. COLLINS:       I am not sure we are getting anything
      very much, sir.

Q.- Then we have seminar notes which I do not think we need
    go through, save that you were there.     A.    Sir, if I
    may, I think    the point was that I was asking them, the
    Fire Service and the Police, if they had any    comments
    at all basically.

Q.     Indeed, that is really what this all        boils down to.     You
      were seeking information from them.            A.  Yes, sir.

Q. We then come to the first draft Certificate which you sent
   out, page 387 of our bundle, in July 1987, is that right?
   I know we have got a bit out of date order but that is the
   first -- new draft conditions which you had prepared.
   A.   Yes, sir, that is correct.

Q. And effectively that follows, I think, as you saw it, the
   best of the conditions in the Safety Certificatess that
   you had seen copies of?   A.   Yes, sir, I tried to draw
   all the best bits, as I saw them, together and then
   obviously put them to the Officers who were experts in
   these areas for appropriate comment.

 Q.   To cut a long story short, we go on now to 483 and we
      see your -- 481 is the covering letter.    In April,
      1989 we see your final revised conditions.    A.  Yes,
      sir, which took into account the comments that had been
      made earlier, except where specifically noted there.

                                                                          D.    BOWNES



                      Q.   So far as you were concerned, it was your belief, was it,
                           that this draft in early April of this year - the end of
                           March, beginning of April of this year - took on board
                           all that needed to be dealt with in relation to Sheffield
                           Wednesday ground.    A.  Yes, I certainly hop^d it did,
                           sir, yes.

                      Q.   And it included in it - in fact it was to cover Sheffield
              B
                           United as well - but it included in it a number of
                           appendices;   is that right?   A.   Schedules, sir, yes.

                      Q. Schedules, I am sorry, one of which, of course, was the
                         schedule which dealt with the capacity.   A.   Yes, sir.
                         Schedule 3, page 506.

                      Q. This, in fact, is another copy of it, and that schedule
                         as we can see, of course, increases the Kop to 21,000
                         but so far as the others are concerned simply repeats the
                         figures that were in the old Certificate.   A.  Yes, sir.
                         I sm sure you will have noted that the previous draft
                         Certificate conditions did not include detailed schedules,
                         This was the first time they had been prepared for the
                         particular ground and therefore I am sure that comments
              D          would have been welcome on those areas.

                      Q.         bORD OUSTICE. TAYLOR :  I a m :s o.rr y , you sue -Sure'
                           what?    A.    I am sure fhat comments would have been
                           made on these particular numbers had they been necessary.

                      Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Are you saying that the old Certificate
                           did not include a schedule like this?   A.   No, sir, the
                           first draft Certificate did not include these schedules as
                           such because they were not ground specific at that time.
                           This was the first attempt to make them ground specific.

                      Q. But as I understand it you had taken on board by then and
                         you had asked for in-put on everything that ought to be
                         there.   A.   Yes, certainly.

                      Q. And yet no-one seems to have appreciated, and you
                         certainly do not seem to have appreciated, the need to
                         specify the individual pens.  A.   No, sir, I think that
                         is quite right.   Comments have now come back in respect
                         of these new conditions, though I have not had chance to
                         read them yet.

                      Q.   That is, of course,    since   the disaster,        A.   It certainly
                           is , s i r , y e s .

                      Q. So far as the general conditions are concerned, as is
                         clear and indeed as is referred to at page 493 in a Police
                         memorandum you have deleted the old u ? 5 and 6 which
                         required Police liaison, in effect, or the Club to liaise
                         with the Police in certain specified departments.
                         A.  Yes, sir.   That refers to the letter at page 496 v/hich
                  H      I believe caused the Inquiry some concern the other day.

                      Q.   That is right   and then you wrote    back the letter at 496,

                                  89



                                                D.   BOWNES



     the last paragraph of which says you are conscious of the
     very important Police role in connection with the safety
     of spectators, therefore have taken two steps to ensure
     this role is properly recognised.   A.   Sir, I think
      you have got the letters in the wrong order.   496 is
     dated 30th March, 493 is dated 13th April, sir.

Q. Yes,       I know.   .A.   I am sorry.

Q. But you were rightly saying that 496 was the letter which
   sought to deal with the Police concern about the omission
   of the old Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6.   A.   No, sir.

Q.   To pre-empt the Police concern, if I put it that way.
     A.   It was a first attempt to explain, sir, if I can
     put it that way.

Q. Because you say in you: second paragraph, "You will notice
   there are no references as such to the Police within the
   Certificate."   A.    Yes, sir.

Q. And then you go on, "I have carefully considered this
   matter and have come to the conclusion that the conditions
   which purport to delegate the Council's functions to
   outside bodies are unenforceable as they are. beyond the
   powers of the Council."'  Tell m e , was-'-that your view -on
   advice or your view independently of advice or what?
   A.   On advice, sir.

Q. On advice from whom?   I do not want to identify the
   individual but what status?   A.  A solicitor in the
   Department, sir.   I should say that the Police have now
   responded and made various comments that they would like
   specific conditions including where it is possible to do
     so   .
Q. Yes, and thus the situation existed at the time of the
   disaster.   A.   Yes, sir, that is correct.

Q. No-one having identified the problem and nothing      having
   been done to put an effective Safety Certificate      into
   position since 1986.   A.   If the problem is in      relation
   to the capacities at the Leppings Lane pen, then      that is
   right, sir, yes, according to the file.

Q. And no-one appears either to have considered the impact
   of the turnstiles, their position and lay-out in relation
   to spectators coming in and going on to the Leppings Lane
   terraces.   A.    I would have expected the appropriate
   adviser to comment on that should it have been necessary,
   but I think the appropriate adviser would probably have
   been the Police in this   circumstance.

Q. What about the direction signs at the Leppings Lane end?
   A.   Once again, sir, as far as the operational side,
   if you like, of the Safety Certificate is concerned,
   which deals with realty what happens on a match day, then
   the Council would have to receive advice.   Now, I would
                         90



                              D.   BOWNES



expect advice to come from a number of different sources -
the Club itself, possibly.  The Club has in the past related
various matters to the Council which it considered important.
Also, if there were particular difficulties one iisight
expect supporters to make comments.    Also, obviously as the
Police are there on the day and do, I understand, deal to
some extent with the control of spectators, if they had
anticipated or appreciated any difficulty, I would have
expected to receive comments from them.    Signing is not
really a difficult or expensive task and I would have
thought there would have been no difficulty in making
appropriate arrangements if they were felt to be necessary.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Collins, if you or one of
your juniors could identify for me the letter from Dr.
Eastwood referring to reduced capacity as a result of
the alterations, perhaps it could be done behind you.

     MR.   COLLINS:   It can be done behind me,      yes,   I
am sure.




                                   /Q.   Mr.   Bownes,   may I ask.

                                                                         D. BOWNES

                    G. Mr. Bownes, may I ask you this generally.  This was. of
                       course, thrust upon you as a result of the abolition of the
                       Metropolitan Council? - A. The function was transferred to the
                       Council, yes, sir.

                    Q. You, the Council, and I am not referring to you personally at
                       the moment....

               ®                 MR. TOULSON:   I have the page your Lordship wanted.   I
                            think you have in mind the letter at page 86.   169 in the core
                            bundle and the sentence at the top of page 170.

                                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Thank you.   That is what I was
                            looking for.

                    0.           MR. COLLINS:   Mr. Bownes, you the city, had no expertise
                            at all in connection with safety at sports grounds bet ore this
                            was thrust upon you? - A. That is wrong, in fact.   The
                            Building Surveyor of the Council had been involved in the
                            safety of sports grounds since its inception in 1979 as far as
                            Sheffield Wednesday went.

                    Q. What did that extend to, the Building Surveyor's
               j)      responsibility? - A. I think you have seen the schedule of
                       responsibilities that was put forward in the bundle somewhere.

                    Q. Let me put it this way.  Your Department had .had no overall
                       concern for safety? - A. It had none at all. sir.

                    Q   .   And effectively you and your Department had to learn all about
                            it? - A. Yes, sir.

                    Q. You were already considerably stretched.  You had a great deal
                       to do in licensing other matters? - A. It is certainly a busy
                       Department, sir, but there was, at least I perceived at the
                       time, room to accommodate this function.

                    Q. Without the need for any extra staff or any extra assistance?
                            - A. That was my feeling, yes.

                    u. And you depended really upon the advice of others, nameiy. the
                       Fire, the Police and your own Building Department, together
                       with some input from the Consumer Health side? - A. Yes, sir.
                       A licensing authority generally speaking does not have
                       expertise itseif within its own organisation to deai with all
                       matters.  For example, public entertainments licensing, it
                       relies on advice from others, the professionals, the Fire
                       Service.

                    0. Did it occur to you at any stage that it might be desirabie to
                       instruct someone like Dr. Eastwood, that is to say an
                       independent engineer, to have a look and advise the Council
                       specifically on the safety of sports grounds? - A. I think it
                       is right to say the Council has its own engineers.

                H   Q. Ail right.  Did you put your own engineers on to the problem?
                       - A. I think that is referred to in the Building Surveyor’s


J. L. Harpham Ltd
                                      92

                                                                D.   BOWNES


         memorandum and my memorandum to him.

 Q. Did you specifically think of briefing your in-house engineers
    or anyone to go and take an independent appraisal of the
    sports grounds which you were then being put in change of? -
    A. It could not really be an independent appraisal if ir was
    done by in-house surveyors, sir, who had probably been
    involved before.

 Q.      All right.   Did itoccur to you        to put anyone....

 G.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  It would be independent of the
         club, whose financial interest was to manage it? - A. Yes. but
         the same engineers who had been doing it were independent of
         the club, the Council's own engineers, and they had been doing
         itsince 1979.

 q   .         MR. COLLINS:    So    youtook   the view that if.therewas
         anything which needed to be dealt with it should have been
         spotted by the Council’s engineers in any event who had been
         dealing with it since 1979? - A. If it was a matter within
         their particular skill, yes, sir.

  0. But did it not occur to you that it might be desirable to have
     someone take an independent look, and by independent, I mean
*.independent 'of :.:those’Who ;had b e e n ' . . d e a l i n g h i t h T e r r t t r ? ^
     A. No, sir, it did not.

 Q. It did not occur to you that that might be desirable? - A. The
    thought had not occurred to me, sir, to be perfectly honest
    with you.

 Q. May I finally go to the point I hope I anticipate may have
    been in my Lord's mind when referring to the letter of Dr.
    Eastwood at page 169-170 of our bundle.  The reason I have not
    referred to it is it was before you time, but nonetheless it
    would have been on the files and you would have read it.   You
    would have been able to read it had you wished? - A. Yes, sir.
    I think that is a fair comment.

 0. How much did you actually read these old files? - A. I was
    handed some 8 files altogether, relating to Sheffield United
    and Sheffield Wednesday.  I think we have to remember it is
    not only Sheffield Wednesday we are dealing with here.  What I
    did was try to get a flavour from those in as much detail as I
    reasonably could in the time allowed.

  0. I think one could make the point if you had read these files
     and come across, for example, this letter, you would have
     appreciated that there would be or was a possible effect upon
     spectator capacity when you removed barriers or put up fences?
     - A. Two points I would like to make there, sir.  One is on
     taking over the licensing function I think the City Council
     had reason to accept that the grounds were reasonably safe and
     all relevant factors had been dealt with by that stage.   The
     other point is I am not sure that for somebody like myself who
     did not know an awful lot about sports grounds, which I think
                                93


                                                    D. BOWNES


        is the truth and nothing less than the truth, that 1 would
        have picked up on reading that what it actually meant, to be
        honest.

G.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I am not blaming you for not
        knowing about sports grounds, but it does seem a very
        unsatisfactory situation, does not it, that- responsibility for
        licensing a sports ground is given to a local authority whose
        officer in charge of it really knows nothing about the subject
        at all? - A. No, sir.   If you like in respect of other
        licensing matters I don't know in detail what the professional
        aspects of them are. My job is to administer and co-ordinate
        really, essentially, and to enable the appropriate
        professionals to have their input at the appropriate stage.

G. Somebody has to make the decision? - A. Yes, based on advice.

G. You thought you were delegated that power? - A. Yes. the
   decision is made based on the advice of the appropriate
   specialist, sir.

q   .      MR. COLLINS:       If you don't know what to ask them to look
      for you are not necessarily going to get the right advice, are
      you? - A. With this letter I imagine it would have been
      circulated to all the interested parties, and i am sure if
     - they felt At'- recess ac$. -they.would .have ..made, -a:,commertE

G. Is what you are really saying this, the working party which
   became the advisory group passed all these things and seemed
   to think all was well, and therefore there was not any need
   for anyone to worry, so far as the city was concerned? - A.
   No, sir, that is not right.  In relation to - I think what you
   are saying effectively is that the Council did not take any
   action at all when it got the safety certificate function.

G. It left it to the .working party and to the advisory group, did
   not it? - A. To some extent it should leave matters which deal
   with professional judgment to the professionals and to obtain
   advice on it.  The Council did not, however - there are
   examples on the file in relation to another sports ground in
   the city, where things were not all right and which were dealt
   with very promptly, sir.

G. Because you were told that by the relevant advisory group or
   working party professionals? - A. The appropriate
   professionals at the time, sir, yes.

G. There was no independent appraisal by the Council as such.  It
   simply assumed, rightly or wrongly, the working party had got
   it right hitherto, and there was no cause for concern? - A.
   That the County Council had got it right, yes.  I think it had
   to assume that.

G. Although it was apparent or obviously able to be made apparent
   from a cursory examination of the file that certain things had
   not been properly done in updating the safety certificate in
   certain respects? - A. I d o n ’t think that would have come

                                     from a cursory ex am in at io n of the file.   sir.

                               0. And you knew you did not do it right in relation to the
                                  increase in the Kop? - A. I certainly know now, sir.

                               Q. You did not appreciate then? -           I did not appreciate that.
                                  s ir.
                       B       G. Very well, Mr. Bownes, that is all I would wish to ask.

                                                    Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER:

                               G. I would like to see how far you regarded the Council's duties
                                  in these matters. Mr. Bownes.  If in January 1989. at a time
                                  when Sheffield United did not have a safety certificate you
                                  had known they had been invited by the Football Association to
                                  consider having a Semi-Final played at their ground, would you
                                  have taken any action? Would it have concerned you? - A. I
                                  would imagine what would have happened in those circumstances
                                  is that the Police, who are closely involved in these matters,
                                  would have raised the issue then and appropriate action would
                                  no doubt have followed.

                       D       Q. Would the Police have known that Sheffield United did not have
                                  a certificate? - A. Yes, they know perfectly well, sir, 1
                                  think v - ........                    -        - -

                               Q. Say for example, not being we understand a great devotee of
                                   football, you had not watched the fixture list and you had
                                   been on leave in April, you would have depended on the Police
                                 / to have stopped a Semi-Final being played at Bramall Lane in
                                   April? - A. Sir, I cannot conceive of a Semi-Final being
                                   played at Bramall Lane without there being a great deal of
                                   publicity and involvement of the advisory group, sir.

                               Q. Would it surprise you in fact that the FA had asked Sheffield
                                  United to consider having a Semi-Final at Bramall Lane in
                                  April 1989? - A. I have no views on it, sir.

                               Q. None at all? - A.        None at all, sir.

                               G. Can I now so back  to your take over. We are all, I hope,
                                  suitably conscious of the fact that this is originally the
                                  responsibility of  another authority, and the matter had
                                  been in their hands for very many years until you took
                                  over, but you did, of course, appreciate that you were
                                  taking on a responsibility? - A. Yes, sir.

                               G. You understood, did not you, that whereas there was an
                                  advisory guide from the Government, there was no compulsion on
                                  a club to follow the advice given inthe Green Guide? - A. Or
                                  on the authority, sir, that is quite right.

                               u. Or on the authority.        This was advice only.         Is that right?
                                  A . Y e s , sir.
                           H
                               G .   But you knew that once there was a condition in a certificate


J . L. H a r p h a m Ltd
                                                                 95


                                                                                      D. BOWNES


                                      there were very considerable sanctions against a club flouting
                                      the condition? - A. Yes, sir, if a club had breached a
                                      condition then there were criminal penalties.

                                Q. When you read the Green Guide did not it become obvious that
                                   some of the recommendations were somewhat more strict than
                                   others?  In other words, some were no open-to interpretation
                                   through common sense and professional judgment.  They were
                       B           plain, strong advice, whilst others might have been open to
                                   interpretation? - A. Perhaps you can give me an example, sir.

                                Q. Yes, I will come to the one I am going to give you.
                                   Stewarding:  have you got a copy of the Green Guide?            Chapter
                                   13 paragraph 195. just above that on page 56:

                                           "Effective stewarding should prevent overcrowding in
                                           sections of the ground, reduce the likelihood and
                                           incidence of disorder, help to disperse spectators in
                                           such a way as to reduce crowd pressure and provide the
                                           means to investigate, report and take early action in an
                                           emergency” .

                                      Now, there c a n ’t be any question of professional judgment or
                                      common sense overriding the need to prevent overcrowding in
                       D              any section of the crowd?      Would you agree? - A. Yes.  The
                                •     judgment comes in. iachQW many stewards:.you. provcide.-..

                                0. Certainly.  That is interpretation, application, common sense.
                                   - A. Yes, sir.

                                           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       And what you call overcrowding.

                                           MR. HYTNER:    Yes:

                                Q.     But the need to take some action is clearly imperative, is not
                                      it? - A. In what sense?   I am afraid I have lost you.

                                G. The Green Guide makes it clear that there must be some action
                                   taken by stewards to do those things? - A. Yes, sir. indeed.

                                0.     When you read the Green Guide and then you read the conditions
                                      in the 1979 certificate, did not you find it rather odd that
                                      the duties of the stewards did not appear to include those
                                      things at all? - A. As I recall from the certificate they
                                      include control and direction of spectators.

                                G. In and out of the ground.          Would you like to look?     It is in

                                           "The duties of the safety stewards, fit and capable to
                                           carry out their duties, properly trained and instructed,

                                      Did you think that that was clearly laying a duty on the club
                       B              to direct stewards to assist in preventing overcrowding in the
                                      sections? - A. I would have said the word "using" implied
                                      that, sir.

                                 Q. I don't suppose you can say what was clear to the club.  it
                                    was your view, was it, reading that certificate, that it would
                                    have been a breach of the conditions of the certificate for
                                    the club not to have stewards directing the dispersal of
                                    crowds in the particular sections to prevent overcrowding? -
                                    A. I think that is a question of cases, if I might say so.
                                    You would have to look at a particular example to decide that.

                                      what the club says.

                                                      Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

                                 Q. Mr. Collins has taken you through and you quite frankly admit
                                    that by 1989 you were not aware of the importance of the
                                    changes in the penning system on the Leppings Lane end; you
                                    were not aware of any discussion about the need for the
                                    alteration to the safety certificate.  Can we take the
                                    position as you say it was, that you thought everything
                                    depended on the figures given in 1979? Would you turn to page
                                    105 of your bundle.  There we see Schedule 2, paragraph 3:

                                            "The number of spectators admitted to the stadium and to
                                            the several areas of spectator accommodation within the
                                            stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1
                                            of Schedule 3".

                                      Clear, no question of opinion, professional advice or the
                                      like? - A. Yes, sir.

                                 0. Turn to page ....       - A. Page 112, sir?

   That will be the total of west terrace and north-west terrace,
   I believe, sir.

Q. In other words, we don't? - A. It is not stated there as
   1 0 .1 0 0 .

Q. In fact, quite the reverse.  It is specifically stated and
   always has been as two separate, completely separate areas,
   7,200 and 2,900? - A. That is quite right, sir, yes.

  Q. Would you tell me whether it became apparent to you, never
       mind whether the pens meant further alterations, whether
       anyone had ever applied their minds to the fact that the 1988
•'ir■~~Sem-i-”-

       comply-with the safety certificate?,- A. I am sorry, would you
       repeat the question, please?

 O. Forget all about pens 3 and 4. Did it ever occur to you that
   -the 1988 Semi-Final had been run in conditions that meant the
    club could not comply with the conditions of the safety
    certificate? - A. No, sir, it did not.

 G. If we were to look at the 1989 Semi-Final we would again see
    that the way in which the turnstiles were used meant that the
    safety certificate as it was could not be complied with? - A.
    I am sorry, what was the question?

 G. Would you look at the plan produced yesterday by my learned
    friend, Mr. Glasgow.   My copy is the penultimate document in
    Dr. Eastwood's bundle.   208 in Dr. Eastwood’s bundle. - A.
    Sir, what you are saying is that the allocation of the
    turnstiles was such that these capacities could not have been
    split?




                                   /Q. Yes, indeed.

Q. Yes, indeed. - A. I was not aware of that, sir, no.

Q. You now know that the layout of the turnstiles meant that
   the areas . of 7,200 and 2,900 were just lumped together?
   -A. Yes, sir, it appears that way.

Q. But it would have been apparent to you if you checked the
   figures for 1988? - A. I aa sorry.  What would have been
   apparent?

Q. They were lumped together. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. What action did you take? - A. None, sir, on that.

Q.Why not? - A. As far as the allocation of turnstiles is
   concerned, sir, that is a matter of operation ....

0.. Forgive me, I do not want to interrupt you, but I am
    not concerned with the allocation of turnstiles.  Clearly
    that is a matter for others.  But the effect of the
    allocation if it contravenes the safety certificate
    would be a matter for you? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. What action did you take? - A. None, sir.

   certificate- I would have expected to have been advised
   about it.

0. Do you mean the club would ring up and say by the way,
   we intend to breach the safety certificate.  What are
   you going to do about it? - A. Not at all, sir.

Q. What do you mean? - A. I would have expected advice either
   from the Police or, indeed, from the club to say that we
   have this problem, can we deal with it, please, which is
   the view the club has taken in the past.

0. You are saying you are surprised to find the club did not
   ring up to say we are going to breach the requirements
   of our safety certificate on two .... - A. No, sir.    I
   think what you have done there is twisted my words, if I
   may say so.

Q. Forgive me.   I apologise.  Are you really saying you
   e>:pect the club to ring? - A. The club may have felt
   it an appropriate thing to do, sir, if they thought
   there was a difficulty with the safety certificate.

Q.Did you check whether or not they were complying with the
   safety certificate? - A. In respect of this capacity, sir?

0. This Inquiry is about overcrowding. - A. Yes, sir.

     you did not know about.  I am merely restricting myself
     to things you did know about, 7,200 and 2,900. What did
     you do about the attempts of the club to circumvent the
     restriction upon them? - A. I did not check that, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Jackson,  I do not quite
     know what you mean by attempts of the club to circumvent.

          MR. JACKSON:    It would appear, sir, from my under­
     standing of the position once the turnstiles A to G
     were to be used for the entire West terrace and North
     West terrace the requirements of the existing safety
     certificate could not be complied with.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Because you could not li~iit
     2,900?

          MR. JACKSON:     I have forgotten all about the extra
     pens and whether or not they can be considered separate.
     I am merely suggesting when the plan to use A to G for
     the West terrace and the North West terrace the existing
     safety certificate c o u l d n o t be complied with and must
     have also not been complied with in 1988.

         .LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes.            ... - - ---

Q.        MR. JACKSON:   Did you in fact check at any time
     the attendance figures submitted by Sheffield Wednesday
     in respect of the 1988 .... - A. I have not, sir, no.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, it may have been complied
     with but if it was it was by chance is what you are saying?

          MR. TAYLOR:   You recall I asked the question of
     Mr. Evans, it could not be complied with because we
     know the turnstiles A to   G were again used.

          THE WITNESS:   Sir,   might I make the point that in
     fact if the Council was wanting - well, if the Council
     decided positively to establish how many people were
     in a particular area, perhaps with the intention of
     proceeding against a club, it would have a very
     difficult task in doing so.   I have been involved in
     prosecutions of places of public entertainment involving
     capacity and the only way of accurately establishing
     capacity is in fact to count people in and out.    It is
     virtually impossible, I would have said, to do that in
     respect of football stadia especially where you are
     talking about these sort of figures.

0.        MR. JACKSON:  I do not want to in any way seem to be
     rude to you, but do you really understand the layout of
     the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end? - A. I believe I
     understand the layout, sir.
                                                      D. BOW NES

And the use of them in 1988 and 1989? - A. I confess I do
not quite understand that, no, sir.

     MR.. JACKSON:     I have no further questions, thank you.

              Cross-examined by MR. MULLER :

Mr. Bownes, whatever your personal position may be or
what you regarded it to be in relation to the safety
certificate and the advisory group this much is
absolutely clear, is not it, that the licensing
authority was of course the local authority, Sheffield
Metropolitan District Council. Right? - A. Yes, sir.

 And precisely how they carried out that function \7as a
matter for them? - A. Yes, sir.

And as far as the various members of the advisory group
were concerned, namely, the building surveyors, the
South Yorkshire County Fire- Service and the South
Yorkshire Police, their position is also absolutely
clear, is not it? They were there to advise? - A.”
Yes, sir.

And you took the view that they were there purely as
advisors ,- not to make decisions? - A. 'Yes ,•'s-i-r, T-hat^ '’"r'‘
is right.

And the position is therefore this, is not it, that
whatever advice they may or may not have given ultimately
it was your function to make sure that a decision was
made and whatever decision was made was made known to
the club? - A. What sort of decisions are we talking
about, sir?

About anything that the advisory group were concerned
with. - A. Yes, sir, if it was appropriate to do so.

If advice is given there is no point in advice being
given to you unless you do something about it? - A. Yes,
sir.

And it was therefore your job, and surely you understood
it to be so, to make sure that when you got the advice
if it was unanimous advice no doubt you could recommend
to whoever was going to make the ultimate decision to do
precisely what had been advised.  Right? - A. Yes, sir.
I think it is useful to bring in the building surveyor's
memoranda at this point of 2nd February where the matter
was put to the advisory group and the Police representative
dealt with it there and then.

The position ultimately at the end of the day is that
it is your job, nobody else's job, to make sure that

                                                          D. BOWNES


     the decision of the local authority is passed on? - A.
     If it is appropriate to do so, sir, yes.

Q. And it is your job also to make sure there is a decision
   if necessary? - A. If it is necessary, yes, sir.

0. I an obliged. And it was your job to co-ordinate the
   work of the advisory group?- A. Insofar as. it needed
   co-ordinating, yes, sir.

0.   If a meeting was wanted you were the one who had         to
     organise it? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   If people wanted to know for their records  or you wanted
     to know for your records what had happened at a particular
     meeting it was for you to make minutes? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   But as we know, and I do not want to dwell on it, there
     were many occasions when you did not make any minutes for
     publication, you did not circulate any minutes on many
     occasions? -A. All the advisory group minutes have been
     written up and circulated, sir.

Q. I think there were many occasions when you - either you
   had private minutes which' you did not circulate.             I think
   you' have- already:- to-l'd Lord Jus tice :Taylor ?^.~;\A^Ye'r/i'; °    ...
   have said, sir, that' I have made various notes of various
   meetings that took place, for example, in July of 1936.

O..And obviously it was desirable if you were going to have
 ' minutes or to have any record of what happened at the
   meeting to make that record as quickly as possible
   so that action could be taken to save people getting
   into difficulties? - A. That is right, sir.  I can
   bring forward three meetings that took place in July,
   1986, which took place in a period of something under
   14 days which did not permit, if you like, proper
   writing up of those minutes in accordance with the
   previous system ....

Q.    Can I just ask you again, please, would you look at the core
     bundle"at page 418?    It starts at page 417. That was a
     document you put before the Local Authority.   Is that
     right? - A. It was a report to the General Purposes Panel,
     sir, yes.

Q.   And you x/ere making various - your concluded recommendations
     is that right? - A. Well, sir, it was setting out a number
     of items ....

Q. If you look on page 418 where you set out the areas of
   responsibility. - A. Yes, sir.

0. How, before that document actually went off there had been

                             some discussions with the advisory group, had there not?
                             You told us about one on the 10th of March, 1987, which
                             appears in the core bundle at 381 and there was another
                             one on the 15th of July, 1987, of which we have also seen
                             some minutes made by the Fire Service.  Right? - A. In
                             relation to this report, sir?

                      g    Q. In relation to the question of areas of responsibility.
                              There was discussion about that, was not there? - A.
                              Yes, sir, and I have explained subsequent correspondence
                              dealt fully with the matters raised.

                           0. Let's not deal with subsequent correspondence.  Let's
                              iust deal with correspondence and the meetings Drior to
                              that. - A. Yes.

                           Q. What you put down there was the building surveyor was
                              to be responsible for all matters relating to the structure
                              of the stadium, including crush barriers, walls, etc? - A.
                              Yes, sir.

                           Q. Of course the building surveyors were part of the Local
                              x\uthority? - A. Yes, sir.
                      D
                           Q. So you realised they were the competent authority to
                              advise on that matter? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q. Do you recall that when these matters were being discussed
                              Mr. Grimshaw of the South Yorkshire County Fire Service
                              told you that what you had written under the responsibilities
                              for the Fire Service, namely, fire precautions, fire alarms,
                              means of escape, emergency lighting and stadium capacity,
                              placed the Fire Service in difficulties? - A. Sir, I think
                              I can perhaps answer this question fairly briefly.   On the
                              17th of August, 1937, there was a letter to the Fire
                              Service asking for their comments on this draft report, I
                              believe.  I have got a note on my copy of that, sir, that
                              at 2 p.m. - I think I may have got the date of the letter
                              wrong, sir - I think it was 2 p.m. on the 17th of August
                              that Hr. Grimshaw rang up and said that O.K., they are
                              happy with the report but if there were problems in the
                              operation of the new system then they would cone back and
                              tell me, sir.

                           Q.Does not deal with the situation because there was a
                              meeting on the 16th of July, 1987.  Do you happen to
                              have any minutes of your own of that meeting? - A. I
                              do have some handwritten notes on the file, sir, yes.

                           Q. Are they available? - A. They are, sir, I think, yes.

                           0. Iz   t possible to see them? - A. I think it is, sir, yes.

                           0.. While that is being sought can I perhaps put the situation
                               to you? Did you appreciate that the Fire Service could not

                                Did you appreciate that? - A. They saw the report, the
                                draft report, and they approved it, sir.  I mean I cannot
                                be any clearer, I do not think.

                              Q. I am putting to you, you see, that what you have got set
                                 down there on page 418 .... - A       is what the Fire
                      B          Service approved, sir.

                              Q. Yes.  3ut they approved it subject to pointing out to
                                 you that the Fire Service could not deal with holding
                                 capacity because holding capacity was a natter for the
                                 structural people who would consider, as you have quite
                                 rightly indicated, for example, the crush barrier? - A.
                                 Sir, I have already said the;Fire Service approved that
                      C          report and I have a note on the letter saying exactly
                                 that, sir.

                                     MR. MULLER:   At an earlier stage when the Fire
                                Service was giving evidence about this matter reference
                                was made by Mr. Seaman to notes that he made on the
                                original document which was sent by the local Council,
                      D         indeed, by Mr. Bownes.  I have now recovered that from
                                the West Midlands Police and the annotations in relation
                                to the very matter I am talking about will clearly be
                                seen on that document.  Sir, perhaps I could put that ....

                                     MR. MULLER:   It is Exhibit 11 in the Fire Service

                                 put it to the witness as to whether that was what was said.

                                       MR. MULLER:   Sir, that is what I was proposing to

What was said in relation to the fire service, that they
could do stadium capacity based on exit system and that
as far as the building surveyors are concerned they should
all be concerned in capacity based on area and crash
barriers? A. Sir, can I ask you what document you are
reading from?

I am reading from a document which the fire service — it
was sent by you and I can show you the document.  It was
sent to the fire service and the fire service, when they
received it,made notes upon that document.  It was as a
result of that the information contained on that document
was passed on to you. A. I have no comment on it. That
was the document that I sent to the fire service.

What I suggest happened is that maybe you, because you do
not keep accurate records, have now no recollection of
this happening.          It may also be -- and I do not necessarily
criticize you for this -- that because of your lack of
knowledge in these matters you did not understand what
they were talking about. A. No, Sir, I once again put to
you -- and I can produce the letter now if it is of any
assistance to you -- that this draft report was submitted
in full, including the list of responsibilities, to the
fire service, the police, the building surveyor, and Health
and Consumer Services.          I have a hand written note and I
a p o l o g i z e that it is not very clear.  It says on it:'
"Ron G. 2 p.m. 17th August, okay.          If problems with op.
will come back".          I take it that means the operation of
the system, Sir.

I fully understand that but what happened, so that I can
make myself as clear as I possibly may, that before that
there had been a specific meeting on the 16th July in
which that matter which I have just put to you had been
discussed.  What you were saying at that meeting was that
it is all a very broad indication. You were taking on board
and indicating that you understood what was being said when
the fire service indicated that they did not have the
expertise to deal with crash barriers. A. Sir, if the fire
service had felt that in any way this report was misleading
or did not give a true reflection of what they were saying
I am quite sure they would have said so in writing.   The
letter specifically says: "As promised I now enclose for
your attention a copy of the draft report which I have
prepared for the panel".

Can I-ask you this, since you were devising the system and
changing the system from what it originally had been, did
you think that the fire service were in a position to deal
with all aspects of capacity? A. That would be a matter
for advice from them, Sir.

Did you, as a result of what you had discovered j;o far, think
that they were competent to deal with all aspects of
capacity? A. I knew at that stage that the fire service

                                did deal with capacity in respect of things like night
                                clubs, pubs, this sort of thing.

                           Q.   This was not a pub. A. Quite accurate, Sir.

                           Q.   They do not have crash barriers in public houses. A. No.

                           Q.   Can I just ask you to please have a look at a document which
                      B         has been provided to us today, I think by you, which is headed
                                "Institue of Building Control Safety of all Sports Grounds".
                                Is that a document which eminates from you? A. It is in
                                relation to a seminar which took place.

                           Q.   Could you turn, please, I gannot give you which page it is
                                because it is not paginated, but there is a part where it
                                says "The Role of the Fire Service". What is that document?
                                A. This I believe is a summary of matters that were raised
                                by the individual experts at this particular seminar.  I
                                do not think that it is a verbatim note by any means.

                           Q.   It is not necessarily a verbatim note. A. It looks like
                                a report.

                           Q.   Of something     that actually was said? A. It looks like a
                      D         report.

                           Q L o o k i n g at' the t o p ‘page "Extensive Invovem^nt" . Do you see
                                 the top of the page? The Home Office requested the fire
                                 service to inspect all sports grounds and report. A. yes.

                           Q.   When was that?    A. I have no idea.

                           Q.   Was that after    the Bradford fire? A. I do not know, Sir.

                                What was happening there was they were was that they
                                were asked to give a brief description of the ground, to
                                state what the capacity was, what the existing means of
                                escape were, and this is where their advice came,
                                "The basic requirements to up-grade means of escape and
                                fire risk to a reasonable standard to ensure life safety".
                                A. Sir, that is what it says here.

                                    MR. COLLINS: I think that I can help Mr. Muller about
                                this document.    If you look at the first of the typewritten
                                pages a little further back in the bundle it is quite plain
                                that this is a resume of the address given by the Home
                                Office representative to the seminar which this bundle of
                                documents is concerned with, the seminar having taken place
                                in October, 1987.    A. This bit here is my written note of
                                what happened on the day.

                                                You are recording the Home Office speakers
                                and I think that what Mr. Muller has been referring to is
                                the printed version which is a printed copy of what the
                                Home Office effectively were saying or were expected to

                                say. A. I assume it is an accurate record, Sir, I do not
                                know.

                                That is right, is it? A. I would assume so, yes.

                                    MR. MULLER: You can appreciate, can you not, that
                                in relation to means of escape of course the fire service
                                are in a position to give advice about it. A. Yes.
                      B
                                But that is not the only criteria, the means of escape, in
                                assessing capacity according to the Green Guide, is it, the
                                other vital one is the holding capacity. A. Perhaps you
                                could refer me to the appropriate paragraph, Sir.

                                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Cannot we take it there are other
                                factors apart from escape? A. Yes, Sir.

                                    MR. MULLER: If you go down a little   bit further, where
                                it deals with the West Yorkshire County   Council's safety
                                team, which I suspect was one which was   being offered as
                                perhaps a good system, do you see that?   Under Member of
                                Safety Team, Sir?

                                 Member of Safety Team.   You have sub paragraph two and then
                       D         (a) "Each discipline to be responsible for carrying out
                                 inspections on joint visits and recommending on those aspects
                                 on which they had expertise; (b) In the case of the fire
                                 service the inspecting officer was advised by the structural
                                 enginner building control officer of all structural defects
                                 including means of escape or fire resistance", and it gives
                                ,an example.  It made it absolutely clear there if you were
                                 present and heard all this that the structural engineers
                                 had a contribution to make even when it came to the
                                 question of escape. A. I think it is absolutely clear that
                                 the building surveyor, for example, would have an input on
                                 certain aspects of the County Fire Service input, as would
                                 the police have an input on the Fire Service, the building
                                 surveyor, and the police.

                                Do you not understand this, Mr. Bownes, that when it comes
                                to calculating the holding capacity the Green Guide makes
                                it absolutely clear that that can be affected by the position,
                                for example, of the crash barrier, does it not? A. I would
                                expect the question of capacity to be started off, if you
                                like, with the fire service.

                           o.   How? A. On basic means of escape, Sir.

                           Q.   If someone starts it the ultimate decision has to be made as
                                a result of corollating the information which comes from all
                                the different advisors, does it not? A. Yes, the ultim a te
                                decision, that is quite right.

                                In this particular case I do not know if you have applied
                                your mind to it at all but the critical question was what
                       H        was the holding capacity because the time for escape gave

                                              D. BOWNES

     ample opportunity for people to get out even if there were
     far more people in than the Green Guide's holding capacity
     allowed.  Do you not even understand that? A. I think that
     you are referring to something that was happening in 1985.

Q.    It is still applied in 1987. A. Yes. If there were any
     questions of capacity, if you take it now, for example,
     in relation to Owlerton the question of the Owlerton
     capacity was dealt with by the fire service and everyone
     else working together.

Q.   If you have a look so that you have no doubt about it at
     all.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Mr. Muller, if you are trying to
     establish that the fire service should not be thought to
     be the only body concerned in what is the proper capacity
     for the Crown I do nto think that you need press it.

Q.        MR. MULLER: Sir, I will not pursue that aspect any
     further in those circumstances.   (To the witness) Can I
     then please ask you about this. Would you please have
     a look in the core bundle at 374. A. I have it.

Q.   As far as 374 is concerned that is a letter which we have
     seen several times and it was in response, was it not, to
     that letter which we have now got which appears in the
     additional documents which you have provided, namely the
     letter dated 3rd November, 1986. A. Yes, Sir, that is the
     fire service response to that letter.

Q.   You were asking for general comments at that time, on the
     3rd November, 1986, from the fire service in relation to the
     conditions at both Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United,
     is that right? A. Yes.

Q.   When you got that response,and if we look now at your
     statement at page 20. A. Yes.

Q.   You say, on 6th August, you make the comment in the middle
     the paragraph "No comments were received from the fire
     service or the police".  Of course, as far as that meeting
     is concerned you have not circulated any document minuting
     what had happened until five or six months after the event,
     namely 4th December, 1987. A. We are talking about the
     inspection of 6th August, 1987?

Q.   Yes. ^A. And the building surveyor and Health andConsumer
      Services made a number of  written comments.

Q.   Yes.  You made the comment that no comments were received
     from the fire service? A.  That is right.

Q.   May I suggest to you that   because of the laps£ of time you
      had forgotten at that annual inspection because what actually
      happened at that annual inspection was that a considerable

                               amount of time was spent in discussing the letter of the
                    A          18th February, 1987. A, Can I ask who with, Sir?

                               the members of the advisory group, including yourself.
                               A. I am sorry. What is the question?

                          Q. What I am putting to you is, do you not remember that far
                             from there being no comment what had happened was there
                             was already in existence a letter dated 18th February, 1987 -
                             do you follow - which you yourself had asked for and there
                             was detailed discussion at the meeting by all present of
                             the contents of that letter and by the time, you came to make
                             your note of it and circulate it you had forgotten that
                     B       that had happened.   A.   I would have expected the Fire
                             Service to come back in response to any comments made on
                             that inspection and say which items had been resolved
                             and which were still outstanding.

                          Q. But the position was, was it not, that they would just be
                             repeating what was in that letter, a document which you had
                             already got, and you were the person who was there to take
                             minutes if there were to be any minutes, were you not?
                             A.   No, sir.   If the Fire Service had made those comments,
                             then I would have expected them to deal with them really
                             until the end, until they had finished with them.

                          Q. Just bear withme.   It was not just the Fire Service that
                             made comments about what was in the 18th February letter,
                             it was everybody who was present, including the Club.
                     D       Were you expecting everybody to write you a letter about
                             what had happened?   A.   I was certainly expecting the
                             Fire Service and the Building Surveyor and the Health and
                             Consumer Services, and the Police if appropriate, and
                             certainly Building Surveyor and Health and Consumer Services
                             did.

                          Q. Do you think it is a possibility that if you delay making
                             a report for many months you may forget what has actually
                             happened at that meeting?   A.   Yes, of course, sir.

                          Q. I want to move, please, to another matter.    We have
                             already been through the question of the re-drafting of
                             the Safety Certificate.    Your initial draft that you
                             sent to the Fire Service was a general certificate with
                             general conditions which were intended to apply to all
                             grounds in your area;   am I right?   A.   It was a first
                             draft, sir, yes.

                          Q. It may be a first draft.  Quite apart from your first draft,
                             those general conditions were not directed specifically to
                             Sheffield Wednesday, were they?   A.   Nor Sheffield United,
                             sir no

                             They were general conditions which were going to be used,
                             as it were, as the corner-stone for particular conditions
                             for each ground in the area.   A.   That's right, sir,
                             yes.

                             And after you had indicated at a very early stage that they
                             were reaching fruition, whatever expression you used, on
                             frequent occasions your contact in the Fire Service, Hr.
                             Binnington, asked you how it was getting on, did he not?
                             A.   I am sure he would have reminded me on occasions,
                             sir, yes.

Q.    And you told him it was getting on well, or words    to that
     effect.     A.   Well, sir, I would have said whatever was
     happening at the time, sir.

Q.    Whereas in fact it was moving incredibly slowly.         A.   It
     was moving slowly, sir, yes.

Q. Do you remember on one occasion when Mr. Binnington said
   to you that he wanted a better copy of the plan which was
   attached to the original Safety Certificate because all
   he had got was a photostat copy?   Do you follow?   You
   told him, "Don't worry about getting that plan because
   you will be getting a new plan very soon attached to the
   new Certificate" and that conversation took place very
   shortly after you had taken over.   A.   No, sir, I don't
   recall that conversation.

Q. And, indeed as a- result of that, you never sent him a plan
   at all.   A.   Well, sir, I don't recall the conversation,
   I am afraid, I am sorry.

Q. Of course, anybody in the Fire Service as a result of what
   you were saying would be thinking, would they not, that
   any minute you were going to be updating the Certificate?
   A.   Sir, they have had the correspondence and they read
   that'the way ---                                 ' '

Q. They could not read it any other way, could they?   The
   letters indicate it is imminent and what is more the various
   telephone conversations with your contact at the Fire
   Stations indicated it was imminent.   A.   The letters
   certainly did, sir, and indeed the report does and I think
   I have dealt with that already.

Q. Certainly nobody would get the impression that the matter
   was not in hand.   A.   No, sir.

Q. And, ofcourse, ary updating of the Certificate was a matter
   entirely for you, was.it not?    A.    Yes, sir, acting, of
   course,with the advisers who would comment on any conditions
   that were being --

Q. You were the one who had to decide to do the updating.
   A.   Yes, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I think we have covered that,
     Hr. Muller, have we not?

Q.        MR. MULLER:   Can I just ask you then about this:
     could you have a look, please, at Document 481 which, of
     course, is a document which comes into existence very shortly
     before this disaster.   This letter which you sent has
     got attached to it a Schedule 3, is that right?   A.   The
     draft conditions, I believe, are Schedule 3, sir, yes.

Q. Which ^ e specifically related to Sheffield Wednesday and
   the capacities, is that right?   A.   Is this Page 489, sir?

Q. 506.   Do you realise that when you sent that letter off
   to the South Yorkshire Fire Service you omitted to send
   that schedule?   A.   No, sir, I was not aware of that.

Q. Even though you had had a reply indicating that it was
   not there?   I think you had a reply dated 25th May.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Where is this?

          MR. MULLER:   I have just got it now in my hand.  I
     think it is not actually in the documents.   It has obviously
     been sent very recently.

          THE WITNESS:   Sir, if I had received that on 25th Hay,
     I have no doubt that what you are saying is correct but I
     think the Inquiry takes some precedence over dealing with
     that matter that was raised.   I mean, I would have thought
     that the Fire Service would have, if they had not got that
     schedule, would have rung up and said, "We have not got
     the schedule, can you let us have it, please."

Q.        MR. MULLER:   All I can put to you is,       and we can see
     this in the Fire Service bundle --

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If you are only going to prove
     that he has not sent it and there has not been a reply,
     do we really need it?   We were actually sitting here at '
     this time when all this was going on.

Q.        MR. MULLER:   All I am seeking to say is this, that
     as far as the Fire Service bundle is concerned which is,
     of course, only a photostat copy, the originals being
     with the West Midlands Police, it is quiteobvious    from
     the photostat copoies that no schedule was   sent to the
     Fire Service, therefore any point I am making to you is
     that as far as you wereconcerned, you were not drawing
     the Fire Service's attention to the fact that you were
     suggesting these capacities, so that they could not comment
     on it and say, "Well, that is wrong, the capacities should
     be otherwise."     A.   Sir, if there wasn't a schedule
     attached, it should have been.   it was a simple, clerical
     error.

Q. out the fact is that without that schedule they would have
   no idea that you were getting it wrong, would they?
   A.   Without the schedule they couldn't comment, sir,
   quite right, and I have no doubt they made that point
   in tfveir letter.

                 Cross-examined by MR. GIBSON-WATT:

Q. Mr. Bownes, one point.    From an answer you gave this
   morning, I think you are aware that the Popplewell Report
   expressed the hope that the Local Authorities Associations
   would get together and draw up a set of model conditions to
   be put in the Safety Certificates.    Y o j are aware of that,
   are you not?   A.    Yes, sir.   It would certainly have been
   of assistance to me.

                                             D.   BOWNES



Q. I think in fact, as far as you are concerned, it would
   in effect have cut but the whole year from the summer
   of 1986 to the. summer of 1987 in which you were engaged
   in trying to get together a set of model conditions for
   your area.    A.   Depending on how long it took them to
   achieve that exercise, yes, sir.

Q. I am right in thinking, am I not, that no set of model
   conditions as far as you are aware has ever been produced
   or has even been produced today by the Local Authorities
   Associations.   A.   That is correct, sir, yes.

Q. To get it complete, you in.fact have produced to us as part
   of that seminar bundle this morning a set of conditions
   which was, I think, produced by the Building Surveyor of
   Bradford as one of the speakers to the conference.
   A.   Yes, sir, there is a form.

Q. Do you know where that came from?   A.   I don't actually
   know where it came from without reading the bundle, sir.

Q. The point, of course, is it was not a recommendation in
   the Popplewell Report, it was merely an expression of hope,
   was it not?   A.   Yes, sir.    Could I just add that the
   Association of Metropolitan Authorities is really what
   you might describe as an interest group,'sir.     It is : '
   perhaps inappropriate for it to draw up model conditions.
   The view I had taken was that the Home Office was the
   appropriate one to do that, as it does produce model byelaws,
   model conditions and what-have-you in respect of other
   licensing matters.    I raised that with the Home Office
   on a couple of occasions and they said that they were not
   intending to do that, sir.

Q. Just to get it complete, Mr. Justice Popplewell did not limit
   it to the Association of Metropolitan Authorities;     he
   said he hoped they would get together with the Association
   of County Councils and the Convention of Scottish Local
   Authorities, the three of them to do it.      A. Yes, sir.
   I believe that is Paragraph 381, sir.

        MR. GIBSON-WATT:         That is quite right.

                 Cross-examined by MR. CALLAGHAN:

Q. Mr. Bownes, prior to the inspection which you attended on
   7th August, 1986, had you read the ----    A. Sir, I cannot
   hear you, I am afraid.

Q. The inspection of 7th August, 1986 which you attended.
   Prior to that had you read the Safety Certificate for the
   ground?   A.  Yes, sir.

Q. Could you have a look at the Safety Certificate, please,
   page 111 of the core bundle. Paragraph '8.1 deals with
   the provision of a suitably equipped First Aid Room.
   A.   Yes, sir, I have the condition.

                            Q. Did you arrange for anyone to inspect the First Aid Room
                               on the inspection of 7th August?   A.   Sir, I have some
                               notes, if I might refer to them.   In fact, in 1986 there
                               is no record of an inspection being made of the First Aid
                               Room at Sheffield Wednesday.

                            Q. Does that mean that you did not ask anybody to carry out
                      6        that inspection?   A.   I certainly didn't ask anybody
                               to carry out that inspection, sir.

                            Q. Did you regard such an inspection as being within the ambit
                               of any of the other people whoL. attended the inspection with
                               you?   A.   The people who attended the inspection were
                               the Fire Service, the Police and the Building Surveyor
                               and I considered the point that perhaps they would not
                               cover the First Aid facilities which is why the Department
                               of Health and Consumer Services was brought into the system
                               a little bit later on.

                            Q. That was later, was it not?      A.   It was in 1987, sir,
                               yes.

                       r»   Q. But you made no arrangement in respect of the inspection
                               of 1986?   A.   No, sir.

                            Q.        LORD’JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Who was brought in later?
                                 A.   It is the Council's Department of Health and Consumer
                                 Services, sir, who deal with miscellaneous health and
                                 safety matters.

                            Q.        MR. CALLAGHAN:    Would you turn, please, to page 398
                                 of the core bundle.    A.   I have it, sir.

                            Q. That, I think, is the draft schedule defining the lead
                               authority role which I believe accompanied the letter of
                               14th May on the following page.  A.   Yes, I believe that
                               is right, sir.

                            Q. On page 398 the last    section deals with the Director of
                               Environ rental Health   and Consumer Services, which is part
                               of the City Council,    I believe?   A.   It is a Department
                               of the council, yes,    sir.

                            Q. And in handwriting at the end of the paragraph on the right-
                               hand side there it says, I think, "First Aid and Medical"?
                               A.   Yes, sir.   I think that is what it says.   It is
                               unclear.

                            Q. That seems to suggest that it was accepted that it was
                               the City Council who was to be responsible for First Aid.
                               A. Sir, if you look at the report of September, 1987,
                               which deals with the responsibilities of individual
                               Departments or Officers, I think it makes it fairly plain.

                        H   Q. Would you turn to page 411.     A.    I have it, sir.

                                Consumer Services Department and under the heading,
                                "Health and Safety General Point 2" there is a reference
                                to the First Aid Room.   The paragraph says: "The main
                                first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
                                first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should
                                they become ill or injured within the sports ground."
                                A.   It does, sir.
                       B
                                And if you then turn, please, to page 417.     A.   I have
                                it, sir.

                             Q. That, I think, is your_ report         Yes, sir, it is
                                the General Purposes Panel.

                             Q. If you look then at the top of page 419.   A.   Yes, sir,
                                it refers to Health and Consumer Services being responsible
                                for First Aid, sir, yes.

                             Q. The Council indeed wrote to the Club as a result of the
                                1987 inspection and that letter appears at page 431.
                                A.   I have it, sir.

                             Q. There is a list of comments attached which accompanied
                        D       that letter and the second page of that list is at page 433,
                                Point 4.2:   "The main first aid room requires to be
                                supplied with, adequate first aid equipment for the treatment'
                                of spectators should they become ill or injured within the
                                sports ground."    A.   Yes> that is what it says, sir.

                             Q. Do you know the ways in which the First Aid Room was deficient
                                at that time?   A.   No, sir.   I understand - it might
                                help somewhat - that the First Aid equipment was only
                                actually present on the ground during specified activity;
                                it wasn't necessarily present during inspection.

                             Q. Doess that mean that it was never inspected?    A.   What
                                subsequently happened, sir, once this I think became clear
                                to the Health and Consumer Services Department is that
                                they talked - the Health and Consumer Services Department
                                talked to St. John's, asked them what sort of equipment
                                they would wish to have and then there were discussions with
                                the Club and that equipment was, I believe, provided, sir.
                                That discussion I believe took place in the early part of
                                1988.    I think it is also fair to point out that the
                                Health and Consumer Services Department were somewhat
                                hampered by the fact that there aren't any national or
                                nationally accepted standards of First Aid equipment.
                                There does not seem to be any guidance on what should
                                be provided.    I have no doubt the Club was also hampered
                                by that.

                             Q. Did they draw up their own check list as to what might
                                be suitable?   A.   Who, sir?

                         H   Q. The Health and Consumer Services Department.    A. As far
                                as I am aware, sir, there was simply an agreement between
                                Health and Consumer Services, St. John and the Club to

     that equipment was.

Q. Is it something which you have followed up with that
   Department to see that thet has been done?  A.   That
   the equipment has been provided, sir?

Q.   Yes.   A. I believe it has    been    provided, sir.

Q.    But you do not know what it is?      A.   I don't know what
     it is, sir, no.

Q. I do not think you rsn help us any more on that point but
   could you return, please, to the Safety Certificate,
   page 111. A.      I have it, sir.

Q.    Paragraph 8.2:  "The Holder shall ensure that during
     every Specified A ctivity a physician employed or retained
     by the Holder is available to attend at the First Aid
     Room if required and that his whereabouts are known to
     those in the Police Central Control Room at the Stadium."
     Have you ever taken any steps to ensure that that provision
     is complied with?    A.   I personally have not, sir.

Q. Has anybody at the City Council to your knowledge?
   A.   T-o my knowledge, no, sir.

                     Cross-examined by MR. GLASGOW:

Q. Mr. Bownes, while you have got the Certificate in front
   of you, if you need to refresh your memory go to page
   117, were you aware of the fact that the Certificate
   required specific areas of the ground to be covered by
   stewards?   Had you noticed that?   A.   Yes, sir, it is
   set out in--

Q. I know it is set out.   I wondered whether you had noticed
   it before?   A.   Yes, sir.

Q. You had?     A.     Yes, sir.

Q. When you re-drafted - and perhaps I should, completely
   to deal with it - did you notice the fact that in the
   sections of the stadium to be covered there were no
   stewards required as a matter of the Certificate on the
   terraces?    A.  I have to admit, sir, that I did not
   notice that.

Q. You did not notice that.        A.     I didn't notice that.

Q. To be fair to you, when you came eventually to redraft
   the certificate, you did think that some provision ought
   to be made for control of the numbers entering sections
   of the ground?   A. Could you refer me to the document,
   sir?

Q. Yes.   When you redrafted the Certificate, your redraft I
   think is most conveniently found at -- it starts with the
   letter at 387.   The only bit I was going to refer you to

  was on 390.   This, of course, was in the summer of 1987.
  You provided under Paragraph 10, as we see on 390, that
  the written instructions given to the stewards should
  include, as the first one, "the preventing of overcrowding
  by ensuring crowd limits in various parts of the ground were
  complied with."   A.   Yes, sir, that is what it says.

Q. And was that a. matter of conscious in-put from you or
   something which perfectly sensibly you had culled from
   a different certificate?    A.   I believe, sir, that
   that actually is in the Green Guide, if I am not mistaken.

Q. At any event, was it something which you had given active
   thought to as being a possible problem at this ground
   or just a matter of good sense generally, wherever it had
   come from?   A.   I must have given it active consideration
   to put it in the conditions, sir.   These conditions were
   not ground specific at this time.




                                    /No.   Mr. Bownes, what.

                             Ci. No.   Mr. Bownes. what you may be able to help on is when that
                                  was commented on specifically and fairly promptly by the Fire
                                  Service they raised with you the query of how this was going
                                  to be done.  Do you remember that? - A. Yes, I think it. is
                                  fairly well stated in their letter.

                             Q. It is noted in 390 as we can see, and if you want it more
                                legibly you find it on 409.  On 409 they were replying on I3tn
                        B       August to that letter of 7th July, and they say in respect of
                                section 10(a);

                                       "Whilst specified in the Green Guide” (which is right)
                                       "it is difficult to imagine how this task can be
                                       controlled by stewards.  This matter should be considered
                                       further".

                                  - A. Yes. sir.

                             Q. Does that refresh your memory? - A. Yes, that is what was
                                said.

                             0.   Was it considered further? - A. In the reviseddraft, which
                                  perhaps we could have a look at ....
                        D    Q. By all means.  You have to go well forward for the revised
                                draft. - A. It is 500 or so.

                             G.   499 is the relevant page.  We find it on 499 that your
                                  suggested solution to the problem there raised is simply to
                                  alter the wording to read:

                                       "Under the direction of the safety officer or chief
                                       steward or authorised officer, prevent overcrowding” .

                                  - A. That was my understanding, sir, but I think the Fire
                                  Service have made additional comments   on that,  but Ican't
                                  recall what they are at the moment.

                             Q. Can you remember any discussion about   it after it had been
                                raised by the Fire Department? - A. No, sir.

                             G. Specifically as to how this was physically to be achieved at
                                this ground? - A. No, sir, I c a n ’t recall any discussion.

                             G. Again, I wonder if it helps, when you went to this wonderful
                                seminar with everybody, including the West Yorkshire Police,
                                did you notice the fact that it was a matter specifically
                                raised by the Police at that seminar that the control of these
                                pens was part of the policing procedure at the ground? Do you
                                recall that or did that pass you by? - A. I am afraid that
                                must have passed me by, sir.  I c a n ’t recall that.

                             0. If we look at page 4, and this is I appreciate a digest of
                                what was said and not a report, you see the role of the Police
                                is discussed in much the same way as the role of the Fire
                                Brigade has been discussed which Mr. Muller was helping us
                                with? - A. Yes, sir.

                            0.   Do you remember the man from West Yorkshire telling everybody
                                 about the way the Police ought to do it? - A. Vaguely, sir.   I
                                 think my notes were the bits that I took real note of.

                            Q.   A summary may help us.   We get it on page 4. Perhaps it is
                                 the quickest way of doing it to save everybody time.  The role
                                 is defined under the three general headings, (b) being to
                        B        maintain safe and orderly crowd upon arrival at the stadia and
                                 to preserve that condition throughout the game. - A. Yes, sir.

                            Q. Then the point I wondered might have concerned you is under
                               the Safety of Sports Ground Act underneath.  If you go over
                               the page you see on page 5, "Normal policing methods".  - A.
                               Yes, sir.

                            0, I take it no further if your recollection does not go this
                               far. Mr. Bownes, but do you remember that as part of normal
                               policing methods the West Yorkshire senior Officers were
                               talking about the use of pens? It is the second matter after
                               "Segregation":

                                      "The use of pens:  as part of the normal policing we have
                        D             the use of pens, i.e. small segregated enclosures for
                                      supporters on the terraces greatly improves crowd
                                      control, etc".

                                 I w o n ’t waste time by reading it through. We can read it for
                                 ourselves. - A. Yes, I accept what is written there.

                            G.-My question is this.   You had raised the problem in the summer
                               of this year.  The Fire Service had very sensibly come back
                               and said to you, "Yes, but how on earth are we going to do
                               it?” . You then go off to a seminar in all modesty to be
                               better informed about these problems, and lo and behold the
                               Police Officer from the next County gets up and talks about
                               this specific problem.   I wondered if at least at that stage
                               did it ring a bell to you to say, "My goodness me, this is the
                               very problem we are talking about at Sheffield"? - a . Forgive
                               me, sir, I thought you were talking about stewards to start
                               with.  I have misinterpreted what you say.

                            Q. I am not trying to score points on that all, Mr. Bownes.     It
                               does not matter whose responsibility it was.     It so happens it
                               was discussed as part of normal policing.    That is not the
                               point.  What I wanted you to remember was whether or not this
                               rang a bell with you as to whether or not we had got a problem
                               of precisely this kind at Sheffield? - a . N o , the question of
                               pens I must say passed me by.

                            G. Finally, Mr. Bownes, in fairness to you is it right to say
                               when you did circulate your draft to the members of the
                               working party you were told by all of them - taking them in
                               turn - by the Police Force first, both in January and in
                               October, that they were very satisfied with the co-operation
                        H      of the club and the way in which it was dealing with its
                               problems? - A. Yes, sir, the Police have certainly said that,

                        Q. And that your own lead authority, the Environmental Health
                           Officer, had said precisely the same thing at 413. actually
                           saying he was impressed by the management? Would you like to
                           remind yourself of  that? I think it is 413 of the big bundle.
                           The last line that is relevant:    "I was noticeably impressed
                    g      with the level of ground management being maintained"? - A.
                           Yes, sir.

                        Q. The question simply for you, Mr. Bownes, having had your ideas
                           circulated and received the input from the members of the
                           working party, did you think that there wasanybody on that
                           working party who was at all unhappy at the way in which the
                           club had been behaving in relation to its safety functions? -
                           A. No. sir.

                        Q. I am sorry, one very last matter.  the question of alterations
                           being made.  I think you have said you regarded alterations
                           which would have required a variation to the certificate to be
                           put before the fully authorised committee, the panel? - A.
                           Yes, sir.

                    D   Q.    Matters of rearrangement which did not go to the root of the
                             certificate you regarded as being fit for the working party? -
                             A. Yes. sir.                                          -

                        Q. Would it be fair to say from your own attendance at those
                           working party meetings you would not have been surprised if
                           the club's officers had acted on the request of working party
                          'officers to carry out minor works around the ground? - A. It
                           is a question of what you mean by minor, sir.

                        Q. Of course. - A. Painting, that sort of thing,    I would not have
                             thought there was any difficulty.   Have you got a particular
                             point in mind, sir?

                        Q. I wondered whether the rearrangement of the barrier was one
                           that concerned you as being something that ought to have been
                           taken further or whether your reaction as the time was that if
                           that is raised by the working party it is not surprising it is
                           acted upon? - A. This is 144, sir?

                        Q. Yes. - A. Yes, in respect of that barrier at that time.     Yes.

                        Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What are you saying "Yes" to? - A.
                             That it was a matter that I would expect the club to act on.

                        0. On what was said at the working party? - A. What was said at
                           that particular inspection in relation to that particular
                           barrier, sir.

                        Q.           MR. GLASGOW:   Were you aware of any other matters? I
                             d o n ’t want to take time putting them to you if you d o n ’t
                             recall. Were you aware of any other variations to the ground
                             that were done after meetings to members of the working party
                             without them being formally referred to the panel? - A. I

                                should think there were quite a few of a routine maintenance
                                nature, sir, yes.

                           O. I w o n ’t press it further.

                           Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When the question of removing that
                                barrier was discussed was there specific mention of the fact
                                it would necessarily reduce the number that could be
                     B          accommodated in that pen? - A.   I would honestly say I can't
                                recall if any mention was made of that.

                           Q. I think Dr. Eastwood has told us it did.

                                     MR. TOULSON:   He was saying it on the strength of the
                                report he got from Strange, of   course. Sir, I will touch on
                                that if I may in a moment.

                                              Cross-Examined by MR. TOULSON:

                           0. Mr. Bownes, I am sorry to come back to the working party, but
                              would you turn in your statement to page 5 paragraph 18. where
                              you set out the background under the South Yorkshire regime:

                      j)             "The County Council set up an 'Officer Working Party
                                     (Sheffield District)' which consisted of
                                     representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the
                                     Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the
                                     South Yorkshire County Council Administration
                                     Department” .

                                Rightly, you d o n ’t include there the club or its engineers as
                                members of the working party because they were not, were they?
                                - A. No, sir.

                           Q. They would be present by invitation at the twice yearly
                              inspection of the ground by members of the Officer Working
                              Party when obviously matters would be discussed? - A. Any
                              comment on matters really before 1986 would be speculation on
                              my part....

                           O. So be it. - A .......but it is my understanding that club
                              representatives were present on inspections.

                           Q. That is right, but not at other meetings of the officer
                              working party? - A. No, sir, some meetings were conducted
                              without c l u b representatives being present.

                           G. Coming on to the change under your regime, your statement,
                              page 14, paragraph 4b, records or leads on to the description
                              of how in the next paragraph the advisory group came to be set
                              up.  I d o n ’t want to go over what has been gone over before.
                              Effectively that was going to be the same group but under
                              another name? - A. Yes, with some slight changes.

                            G   You were going to have on it, paragraph 49 page 15, the
                       H        Building Survey.  He had been on already? Correct? - A. Yes,
                                sir.

                           O. County Fire Service.   They had been on already. - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q. Police:   they had been on already? - A. Yes.

                           O. The County Council could not be on any longer because they had
                              ceased to exist, and you were in their place? - A. Yes.
                     B     Q. But before that change of name - it was no more than that -
                              took place, which we see from your statement was September
                              1987, you had been in the saddle for 18 months? - A. 'Yes. sir.

                           Q. And it was during that 18 months period that the inspection
                              had taken place in August when the removal of 14a was
                              authorised? - A. August, 1986, sir.

                           0. Exactly.  Do I understand it right that during that 18
                              months period you had been continuing with the old
                              system, the officer working party, but with yourself in
                              place of the now defunct County Council? - A.
                              Effectively, yes, sir.

                           0. You told the Inquiry that you had your own engineer - when I
                      J)      say "you", the City Council? - A. Yes, sir.

                           0. As indeed had the.County Council.beforehand? - A. No, sir.
                              The County Council used the City Council's Building Survevor.

                           Q. I am so sorry.  At any rate, the hat may have changed but what
                              was beneath the hat remained the same? - A. Yes, sir.

                           0. He was in fact, Mr. Don Sheriff of the Building Department? -
                              A. I think Mr. Sheriff attended meetings, sir, yes.

                           0. And he is a qualified chartered engineer? - A. I d o n ’t know
                              his qualifications, sir, but I am quite confident he is.

                           Q. If he was not there there was somebody else standing in his
                              shoes? - A. Yes, I imagine so.

                           Q. Under the old system, would you look in the core bundle page
                              27.   I expect you have seen it before. To avoid people not
                              knowing what their respective responsibilities were there was
                              an allocation of responsibilities, and if we look at
                              "Terraces" on the left-hand side, "Structural" was a matter
                              primarily for the building authority but with the Fire and
                              Police to be consulted. - A. Is that the third one down, sir?
                              It is~ a poor copy.

                           Q. It depends how you count, but do you see the word "Terraces"?
                              - A. "Egress from the ground", and it is below that?

                           0. Yes.  Over the page:  "Spacing of crush barriers;  strength of
                              crush barriers", both building authority? - A. Yes. sir.

                           0. "Estimation of safe ground capacity", Council? - A. Yes, sir.

                               Q. After the new authority comes into power, page 418, "Building
                                  Surveyor;  all matters relating to structure of stadium
                                  including crush barriers, walls, etc".  - A. Yes, sir.

                               0. So throughout, the licensing authority had the benefit of its
                                  own independent advice from the engineers in relation to
                                  matters of crush barriers and structures? ■=• A. Yes, sir, quite
                                  right.
                      B
                               Q. When we come to the 1981 radial fences we know as a matter of
                                  history that the impetus came from the Police, the club
                                  agreed, the club’s engineers prepared drawings ana the matter
                                  went before the working party.  Turn please to page 153. Here
                                  was the decision to introduce the radial barriers after
                                  discussion, and we see under (2):

                                       "Whilst there were drawbacks ....    the working party felt
                                       increased control should result".

                                  May we look to see who were the people   who were taking that
                                  decision.  When we look down at the people present there is
                                  nobody there from the club or its advisors, but you have got
                                  there represented each of the parties on the working party,
                                  including the engineer, Mr. Sheriff, from the Building
                       D          Department? - A. Yes, sir.

And I am not going to duplicate the exercise for 19S5.
Let's come on, if we nay, to the 1986 meeting, inspection
meeting, which was the first annual inspection you
attended although you had been to the ground previously?
- A. Yes, sir.

Turn, please, to page 341 in the bundle. --A. Yes, I have
it, sir.

I think you accept, Mr. Bownes, whether you had power
to do so or not you infact authorised on behalf of the
Council the removal of that barrier? - A. Yes, sir.

And, indeed, it was more than an authorisation, it was a
request, because it was not something the club were
asking to do, was it? -A. The Police raised the issue
and it was a natter of agreement really at the end of
the day.

Now, this document we have is a job list, is it not,
prepared by Mr. Strange from Eastwoods noting the various
things which the club was going to have to do after the
raised inspection? - A. It looks like    that, sir, yes.

Perhaps we can iust glance down.Do we get    an  indication
of the detail with which the group.had gone round the
ground by, for example, item 4, seat      3, row 8,in the
West Stand needs repairing? - A. Yes,     sir.

This was no   mere perfunctory glance. This was a detailed
inspection?   - A. Well, sir, there are a number of points
raised.

And so far as the radial removal - there were two radial -
two fences, I am sorry, barriers, to be altered. We are
not directly concerned with No. 1. That was in the
corner of the ground. It was a question, you agreed, one
piece of barrier should be taken out and replaced by
another? - A. Yes, sir.

We are concerned directly with Ho. 2. \ou have told the
Inquiry that there was discussion - but you, do I under­
stand, do not recall any of the details of the reasons
why the Police wanted it out? - A. Regrettably, no, sir.

 Do you recall this, that it was being put forward as a
matter of some urgency because it was now the 7th of
August and the season was going to start with a home
game against Everton who were, I think, champions, and
 that was going to coincide with the opening of Spion Kop?
 Does any of that ring a chord with you? - A. That would go
 beyond my recollection, sir.  I am sorry, sir.

Capacity, Dr. Eastwood has given evidence that Mr. Strange
                           124



                                                      D.   BOWNES


     reported back to him after this meeting when the Police
     raised this he had pointed out that this would result in
     some calculated loss of capacity which obviously the club
     were not keen to lose and that the view had been expressed
     and that the view had been expressed, however, there was no
     reason why that should be because the ground was going to
     be cade safer by this. Do you have any recollection or
     just no recollection? - A. I am sorry, sir, no.

0. Hay I just ask you a question or two about capacity?
   When you had taken over this job and been presented with
   your eight files one would not have expected you to have
   read every document with great care but obviously -there
   would have been certain documents you would have wanted
   to look at, would not there? - A. Yes, sir, I tried to
   get a flavour of the files.

Q. Had you, for example, read Dr. Eastwood's original report
   back in 1979, survey report, page 36 in the bundle?
   Would you care to look at it? - A. I have it. sir.

0. Had you read that? - A. I really cannot recall at this
   distance ....

0. If you were trying to see your way into the matter that
   might-have been-one of*the basic documents you looked at.
   You have no recollection? - A. Quite possibly, sir, but
   I do not recall reading that particular document.

0. You would no doubt have read the 1976 Guide and how
  / capacity was calculated? - A. I certainly read the 1976
    Guide, sir, yes.

Q. And how capacity was calculated because that was something
   which you were going to be responsible for? - A. Yes. I
   noted how the capacity was calculated but it is not - it
   isa technical matter which I would have to take advice on.

Q.    And no doubt did take advice from the engineers? - A. Where
     it was appropriate to do so, sir, yes.

Q.    It was appropriate to know how capacity was calculated, was
     not it? - A. If a question had been raised on capacity,
     yes, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose one short cut
     to all this would be when you took over from the
     County to have a meeting of everybody that was involved,
     including the club and its engineer, and say, " L o o k , we
     have taken this over. Vie are responsible for the
     certificate. Tell us if the situation at the moment is
     satisactory. Have there been any changes or anything to
     be done?"- A. Yes. Well, in fact, there was a meeting
     involving the working party, if you like, in the middle

                                     of March where those points were in fact raised.

                                Q. And the club? - A. Not including the club, sir, no.

                                Q- Almost inevitable, is not it, Dr. Eastwood would have
                                   said well, there have been considerable changes and
                                   it has altered capacity? - A. Yes, I think.in hindsight
                                   it would have been useful to have that discussion.
                     B
                                Q.        MR. TOULSON:   Just look, if you would, please,
                                     two pages here, page 56? -A. I have it, sir.

                                Q. Keep your finger in there if you would, please, and
                                   also go to page 117.  I am just wondering about your
                                   comparison - between the figure Dr. Eastwood originally
                                   suggested for standing on Spion Kop and the figure that
                                   had been certified. Dr. Eastwood had suggested that
                                   once the works had been done which were in fact then
                                   done they could certify for 16,000.  In fact the
                                   Licensing Authority was more generous from the point
                                   of view of the club's revenues by certifying for 16,850?
                                   - A. That is evidently true from the file, sir, yes.

                      v-v       Q. So clearly that authority had exercised its independent
                      ^            mind when looking at the question of capacity? - A. Yes
                                    sir.             ..........

                                0v. At any rate, when you - you have said, I think, in your
                                    statement that on "the occasion when the removal of 144
                                    was authorised the building authority were there and
                                    represented and able to advise you? - A. Yes, sir.

                                0. And they were the people who you understood you were
                                    going to be looking to for advice on calculations on
                                    capacity? - A. Yes, sir, as^far as the old revision of
                                    responsibilities was concerned, yes.

                                0. So either the question ofcapacity was discussed and the
                                   view concluded there was no need to alter the figure
                       p|         or the building authority did not raise it at all but
                                   you do not remember? - A. I am afraid I do not remember,
                                   sir.

                                     Now, finally, you produced today a bundle of correspondence
                                     starting with a letter of the 23rd October, 1986. I am not
                                     quite sure why the first letter was being introduced but
                                     it refers to previous correspondence and in case it has
                                     any materiality the position was this, was not it, you
                                     are there acknowledging a letter from Eastwoods of the
                                     15th of October in reply to a letter of the 9th October.
                                     I have copies of the letters there-but unfortunately we
                                     have just produced them. The position was this, was not
                                     it, on the 9th October you had written to the club saying
                                     that you did not seem to have any plans for the Spion Kop

end although the building work was well underway and
Eastwoods had replied saying that the plans had in fact
been deposited with the Council ten months earlier and
also copies had been supplied to the^-Fire Brigade and
the building authority? - A. Yes, sir.    As I recall,
what happened was    the advisor - I forget which   -had
said they had nothad copies of these plans and would
I raise it with Eastwoods.

And in fact had them all along? - A. Yes. What had
happened is that the normal system for submitting plans
had not been followed. Sir, I wonder if I may make -
I am sorry - a comment about the Spion Kop?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes, by all means.

     THE WITNESS:     Dr. Eastwood actually applied for a
capacity of 22,000 or so, I think, nearly 23,000 I think
it was, and the General Purposes Panel when it considered
the application for the increase in capacity on the advice
of the Council's various advisors reduced that to 21.000.

     MR. TOULSON:   Yes.

            Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Mr. Bownes, when you took over you made a point. I think
you said, of looking at the Green Guide, the 1975 Green
Guide? - A. Yes, sir.

And looking at the safety certificate? - A. Yes, sir.

Because you wanted to know what you were responsible for,
what you would have to enforce and had to have a firm view
about the meanings? - A. I certainly needed to familiarise
myself with it.

You could not do your job unless you knew what you meant
or what you were taking - to be responsible for? - A. Yes,
sir.

Did there come a time when you looked at the 1986 Green
Guide? - A. Yes, sir.

Did you notice the significant difference between the two
concerning the emphasis and importance attached to the
holder's responsibility and stewarding? - A. Yes, sir, I
think the accompanying circular drew attention to part­
icularly the section in relation to management respons­
ibility, sir.

Yes.  If one compares the two, and we do not need to do
it now, but it can be said, can it not, that there is
barely any reference to stewarding and the organisation
                                                 D.   BOWNES


of people at the ground but in the Green Guide of 1986
that is almost the primary emphasis? - A. Yes, sir.

Yes. The 1976 one effectively concentrates on physical         .
methods, barriers and that sort of means of controlling
people's positions? - A. I believe so, sir, yes.

Yes. Well, when you read the 1986 Guide did you give your
mind at all to. whether or not the safety certificate was
appropriate and sufficient in the light of the new
guidance? - A. It did occur to me that amendments may be
required and it was an ongoing process, if you like, of
redrafting the safety certificate conditions.

Of course you will have looked at the safety certificate
and you will have seen what was said, perhaps with some
prescience, under paragraph 9, under condition 9, con­
cerning the responsibility of stewards.

     MR. WOODWARD:   Page 111, sir, in the core bundle.

     THE WITNESS:    I have it, sir.   Sorry.   What was
the question?

     MR. WOODWARD: You will have perhaps noted when you
looked at the position of stewards to see there that in
1979 the drafters of the certificate had had some thought
about it? - A. Yes, sir, I noticed that the condition was
there, sir, yes.

And the only reference in the certificate to the ensuring
of safety by control and direction of the fans rests
insofar as it is dealt with in the certificate upon the
club and upon ftie stewards? There is the lacuna that
Mr. Glasgow pointed out in relation to the terrace.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Woodward, we have been
over this umpteen times and I have reminded you three
times of what your Senior Officers have said and I can
read what the certificate says and the Green Guide.

                                    MR. WOODWARD:
                                Sir, we will not go on with it any more.  That will be
                                a matter for argument and submision.  May I just ask you
                                please about some documents in 1987, concerning the gates.
                                Would you have a look, please, at document 381 in the
                                core bundle.  That is a fire service note of the meeting
                                that had taken place on the 10th March, 1987.  Do you have
                                it?  A. I have it now, Sir.

                      g    Q.   Page 381.  It is a note of a meeting that had been inspired
                                by the letter of the 18th February, 1987, which we see begins
                                at page 374.  The note for the file, page 381, refers to the
                                contents of the letter of the 18th February, and deals with
                                matters there to be discussed.  The third paragraph of the
                                note, may I ask you about that, 381.  Does that set out,
                                Mr. Bownes, in so far as you recall it, accurately what
                                was discussed at the meeting, the stewarding and securing
                                of all gates was discussed? A. I cannot accurately recall,
                                Sir, to be honest.

                                Not a limitation of that particular gate but so far as we
                                see it it says all gates.  Are you able to comment on whether
                                the discussion was wide reaching or restricted? A. I really
                                cannot say .

                      D    0.   The letter   that you wrote to the club we see at page 383,
                                it follows   from that meeting, the 22nd April, 1987? A. Yes.

                                At 'c' there "Some points in the letter have now been further
                                clarified as follows: gates must be unlocked and stewarded
                                at all times". A. yes.

                           Q.   You can look through the documents and endeavour to see what
                                that means.  Do you have any recollection of that matter at
                                all? A. No, I do not recall where that comment came from.

                           Q.   When you drew up the areas of responsibility — I am moving
                                on to another matter -- identifying the role of the police
                                in the advisory area. A. Yes.

                                And the fire service, would it be right to say that the
                                primary concentration for capacity was upon the fire service's
                                input? A. The fire service in September, 1987 report has
                                as one of their roles capacity.

                                All other matters of safety were swept up in the role of the
                                Health and Consumer? A. No, I do not think that is quite right.
                                The report does actually say that it is not an exhaustive
                                list _and it cannot possibly be.

                           Q.   That is accepted and it is not suggested that only one person
                                would have a particular role and only his voice would be
                                regarded.  Where aspects of general safety and general
                                safety management of the stadium are contemplated as being
                                anybodys responsibility, it is the role of the Health and
                                Consumer Services Department. A. In as much as all-the advisors
                                were advising on safety.  I would say that is not quite right.

                                    C ross-exam ined   b y MR.   MAXWELL

                           Q.   Some surprise has been expressed that you should be dealing
                                with this licensing function on behalf of Sheffield City
                                Council.  You, as a person who is a novice to sports
                                ground matters.  Your licensing functions cover a wide
                                variety of subject matters, do they not? A. Yes, they do.

                       B   Q-   Taxis, lorries,   wild animals? A. Taxis and wild animals,
                                S i r , yes .

                           Q.   Sex shops?   A. Yes.

                           Q.   May we take it that you have no particular professional
                                extramural interest in any of these matters? A. I think
                                that you could take it.

                                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Intramural would be more to the
                                point .

                                    MR. MAXWELL: It is the heat wave, Sir. (To the w i t n e s s )
                                May I now deal with a series of miscellaneous points.     The
                                first is that when you took on the certificating function
                                with regard to this you told Lord Justice Taylor the
                       D        Department was not increased in size.  Was a clerical
                                assistant taken on in order to make available more time
                                for you and others to deal with the licensing matters?
                                A. Yes, I believe what I said, Sir, was that the licensing
                                section consisted of six members of staff, of which I was
                                one.

                           Q.   Did   the clerical staff, was that increased        to allow for you
                                 to take on an increased work load? A. Yes,         that is correct.

                           Q.   May   I deal now with the question of delay. You prepared
                                 the memorandum that has gone before Lord Justice Taylor,
                                 have you not? A. Yes.

                           Q.   May I take it either that it is taken as read or to be
                                read rather than going through the detail of that.

                                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: If I want to ask any detail about
                                it I will.  I will read it overnight.

                           Q,       MR. MAXWELL: The seminar documents which have been made
                                available and which have been referred to relate to a seminar
                                which you attended? A. Yes, that is correct, Sir.

                           Q.   That was part of your in-service education,           was it not?
                                A. Yes, Sir.

                           Q.   The documents include  your notes of what the lecturers
                                told you? A. The points that struck me.

                           Q.    As well as apparently what the lecturers hoped that they
                       H         said or believed that they said in the perfected version

                              of what was said? A. Yes.

                              If you would be so kind, please, as to look at that document,
                              I only want to pick out certain references in it.  I begin
                              with what the Home Office spokesmen in the printed version
                              said to you under the heading Safety at Sports Grounds, the
                              introductory talk that you were given.

                     g   Q.   It is towards the beginning of the bundle.        You have that
                              heading, do you? A. Yes, Sir.

                         Q.   At the bottom paragraph do you have that? A. I do.

                         Q.   At the bottom there is a further reference    to this question
                              of flexibility in the paragraph: "In order    to assist Local
                              Authorities determine what are acceptable standards", and
                              I leave it there for you to read and for Lord Justice Taylor
                              to read it also.   It may be of interest to   go to your notes
                              to see what you noted the speaker as saying about that under
                              the heading "The Home Office". "The speakers indicated that
                              there were no plans to designate any further     grounds at
                              the moment.  It was explained that the whole concept of
                              the legislation was related to reasonable safety, bearing
                              in mind that existing grounds could not realistically be
                     D        rebuilt to modern standards.    It is necessary to work with
                              the existing structures and obtain the best result possible".
                              Looking back on it do you think that that is a matter which
                              has affected your approach to the certificating function
                              and enforcement  of the provisions under the Act? A. Yes
                              it has, Sir, that seems to be the role or the comment that
                              the Home Office makes quite frequently.

                              You were aware, were you not, from the files, that there was
                              such a comment at a very early stage from the Home Office
                              when they were approached for advice about the Green Guide?
                              A . Yes, Sir.

                              You have also,or I have put in on your behalf, a small
                              bundle of documents of correspondence with various parties.
                              Sir, may I try to make amends by undertaking that we will
                              provide separate sheets numbered in some appropriate way
                              so that they can be interleaved into the core bundle.
                              (To the w i t n e s s ) Tell Lord Justice Taylor what you see as
                              the purpose of those documents,         your letters to Dr.
                              Eastwood, the club, the fire service, the police, your
                              own building department, what were you trying to do when
                              you wrote those letters? A. In respect of the first letter
                              to Dr_. Eastwood dated 23rd October, 1986, this as I have
                              mentioned briefly before was in respect of a problem, if
                              you like, of receiving plans for the council.         I draw your
                              attention really to page two on the second paragraph.

                              The last paragraph but one? A. Yes, the penultimate paragraph,
                              Sir.  It indicates that if Dr. Eastwood has any suggestions

                          to improve the system or in saving          clubs from unnecessary
                          expense they should let me know.

                           Taking up Lord Justice Taylor's question earlier, which
                           I am paraphrasing and not perhaps putting it as well, but
                           in essence I think it came to: Why did you not gather
                           people together and say: "Look, we are taking over.   What
                           is the best way of going forward? Are there 'any matters
                      g   that need to be dealt with?"   Is that in fact something that
                           you put, for example,in the next letter to the Chief Fire
                           Officer, 3rd November, 1986. "I am writing to ask for your
                           comments in writing as to the condition of the two stadiums
                           from the fire service point of view". A. Yes.

                               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: One of the difficulties about the
                           letter to Dr. Eastwood that you have just read is: "If you
                           have any suggestions for improving the system".    According
                           to Dr. Eastwood he had no appreciation that the Safety
                           Certificate had not been up-dated.    He would have read
                           that, I imagine, as meaning anything to improve it on the
                           ground and not to deal with it in the Safety Certificate.
                           That is the sort of thing which might have come out if
                           we had had a meeting and the City had said: "We have now
                           got to take over this old Safety Certificate of 1979.    What
                      D   has anyone got to say?" and Dr. Eastwood might have said:
                           "Do you mean to say it has not been up-dated?    There has
                           been this and that and the other d o n e " .

                              MR. MAXWELL: You will notice that the last paragraph
                          provides a copy of the letter was sent to Sheffield Wednesday
                          and in the context of what you say it might have prompted
                          some appropriate response, Sir.

                                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes.

                               MR. MAXWELL: A similar letter —      I do not want to go
                           through the whole terms of the letter.      The next letter
                           after the Eastwood letter is to the fire service, 3rd
                           November, 1986, and you get a reply from them February, 1987.

                               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: What it comes to is Mr. Bownes is
                           capable of an opportunity to be heard.

                               MR. MAXWELL:      Yes and the responses as they were appeared
                           in this bundle.       Is that right? A. Yes.

                           Can I deal,    please,   with the question of barrier 144.

                                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Is that   going   to be convenient?

                                  MR. MAXWELL:   It is indeed,    Sir.

                                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     You have a few other things to
                           put?

                                       THIRTIETH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                                       WEDNESDAY, 28th JUNE,     1989

                                             (MORNING SESSION)


                                            DAVID BOWNES   Recalled
                 B                 Cross-examined by MR. MAXWELL (Cont'd) :

                        Q. Mr. Bownes, I was dealing with barrier 144 and perhaps
                           at this stage you could formally produce - it has already
                           gone before Lord Justice Taylor - the photographs showing
                           Leppings Lane terraces in 1965 and by reference to those
                           as they were refurbished, I think, in 1966 you can see
                           barrier 144 across the tunnel entrance. So far as that
                           barrier is concerned and the events of summer of 1986,
                           August, if it had been said at any time that the removal
                           of 144 would affect capacity on the terraces is that a
                           matter which would have been of concern to you?- A. Yes
                           sir, it would.

                        Q. And is there any action that you would have taken about
                  D        it had that been the position? - A. Yes, sir. I would
                           have asked the appropriate experts for their advice on
                           capacity.

                        Q. In that context who are the appropriate experts? - A.
                           The Fire Service, the building surveyor and the Police
                           have some involvement, sir.

                        Q. If such a suggestion had been made is it a matter that
                           you think you would have remembered? - A. Yes, sir.

                        Q. Are there any documents on your files or any of the
                           other files of the various parties that suggest that
                           this was stated? - A. Not so far as I am aware, sir.

                        Q. At the meeting in August, 19£6, who else was there apart
                           from Mr. Calvert for the Police? - A. There was, I believe,
                           Mr. Strange from Eastwood & Partners, Mr. Butler from the
                           Council’s building surveyors ....

                        Q. He is the Council building surveyor? - A. Yes, sir.

                        Q. Did he express any viewabout the removal of 144? - A.
                           Other than agreeing to it, sir, I cannot recall.

                        0. You recall that he agreed to it? - A. Yes, sir.

                        Q. Subsequently was any report ever made to you by way of a
                           complaint or comment about the absence of 144 after it
                           had been removed?- A. No.

                        Q. Did anyone ever suggest to you the removal of 144 reduced

     the power of control of the crowd on the terrace? - A. No.

Q. I mean in respect of crowd movement or crowd distribution.
   Was anything ever said? - A. No, sir.

Q. In that context, looking at the matter generally, did
   anyone ever suggest to you that there was any problem
   at all of crowd control on the terrace? - A. No, sir.

Q. If a report had been made to you about overcrowding on
   the terrace is there any action that you would taken? - A.
   Yes, sir. I would have immediately consulted once again
   the appropriate experts in that area.

Q. And, similarly, if it had been suggested to you that there
   was a need to monitor the numbers in some way, counting
   the fans in or counting them when they were on the
   terrace, if that had been suggested to you is that
   something you would have taken action about? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Did you know that there was
     a means of counting the numbers through the turnstiles
     as a whole? - A. Yes, sir. I was aware that the turnstiles
     do record numbers of people going through them if that
     was the question.

Q. Ann what did you think the object of that was? - A. To
   control the numbers of people on the areas for which
   you had access by the turnstiles.

Q/ But nobody ever raised at all in discussion at any of
   these meetings you attended the problem of subdividing
   the area? - A. Not as far as I recall, sir, no.

Q.        MR. MAXWELL:   In that context Lord Justice Taylor
     has seen a plan prepared by Dr. Eastwood’s firm of
     April, 1987, showing pens 3 and 4 with two figures on,
     1,000 and 1,200 respectively.   The plan is 8945/1. - A.
     Yes, sir.

Q. Did such a plan ever come to your notice before this
   tragedy? - A. No.

Q. Were you aware before this tragedy of such subdivided
   capacities? - A. No, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You mean you were aware of
     the subdivisions but not of the subdivided capacities?
     -A. Yes, sir, that  is correct.

Q.        MR. MAXWELL:   If it had been necessary for any
     person, including the Local Authority, to calculate the
     capacity for a subdivided area is that something that
                                                                      D.   BOWNES


you would have expected to find mentioned expressly in
the Green Guide? - A. I believe I would, sir, yes.

Do you find it mentioned expressly in the Green Guide?
- A*. I have not been able to find a reference, sir, no.

And, similarly, is it a matter that you would have expected
to be mentioned by the Home Office in the advice that they
have sent out to local authorities? - A. Yes, sir.

And is it something that has been mentioned by the Home
Office? - A. Not as far as I am aware, sir, no.

Or dealt with by virtue of any safety regulations? - A.
There have definitely been no safety regulations in this
area, sir.

It seems that in the past doubts have been expressed, I
think by the Police in documents Lord Justice Taylor has
seen and also by the club in other such documents, doubts
expressed about the holding capacity on the Leppings Lane
terraces. Were you ever made aware of any such doubts?
- A. No, sir.

So far as the crush barriers are concerned, quite apart
from any" inspection that Dr. Eastwood V f irm' makes of: f,.;~ -i
them, are they also-inspected by the Loohi Authority?
- A. Yes, sir.

And is that pursuant to the statutory guidance? - A. It
is, sir.

And i s t h e p o s i t i o n t h i s , t h a t a t l e a s t 10 p e r c e n t o f
th e crush b a r r i e r s are i n s p e c t e d f o r o v e r t s ig n s of
damage? - A. That i s c o r r e c t , s i r .

So far as first aid is concerned you told Lord Justice
Taylor that there is not any national index of the kind
of equipment that should be available by way of first aid
equipment. Have you in fact made efforts to see whether
such a national index is available?- A. Yes, sir. In
connection with the pop concert at Sheffield United, for
example, I obtained a copy of the Greater London Council
guidance on the sort of matter a local authority ought
to consider.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The sort of what?- A. Matters
the local authority ought to consider and there is in there
a vague reference to first aid.  It is not in any detail
at all, sir.

     MR. MAXWELL:   There is no detailed list of equipment
that you should provide? - A. No, sir, definitely not.

 I wonder if I could ask you quite briefly to return to the

                                                                                D.   BOWNES


     memorandum that you have prepared that deals with delay
     and which is now added to your statement only to do this,
     if you ould, please.   I think you have actually considered
     the length of time that these different items of exceptional
     workload, as you have described tl.em, have taken for each
     of the six month blocks that are referred to. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Could you please look at that memorandum and taking the
   blocks of time from January, 1987, could you tell Lord
   Justice Taylor what the exceptional workload amounted to
   first of ail for that period, January to June, 1987, the
   total time taken up on these other matters was what? - A.
   Approximately ten working weeks, sir.

Q. And July, 1987, to December, 1987, again the total period?
   - A. Approximately twelve working weeks, sir.

Q. January to June, 1988?- A. Approximately ten working weeks,
   sir.

Q. And finally July to December, 1988? - A. That was approx­
   imately 15 working weeks, sir.

Q. And I think you can give a breakdown if necessary of those
   total periods?- A. Yes, sir.

Q. I would invite you now, Mr. Bownes, to look to the future.
    Are you aware at least through this Inquiry and probably
    aware in any event of the assistance that the ambulance
    service can give you in respect of your certificating
  / function? - A. Yes, sir. I believe the ambulance service
    can have a useful input and I am sure they will be
    shortly invited to make comments to the Council.

Q. You will extend the invitation to them to be of assistance
   to you?- A. I will do, sir, yes.

Q. Both with regard to medical and paramedical matters and
   all those other issues on which they can quite clearly
   offer assistance to you?- A. Yes, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What, as part of your advisory
     group or simply on an ad hoc basis?- A. That would be a
     matter for discussion, sir.

                               >.   Their view, it is established in the documentation attached
                           A
                                    to your statement, that you did approach them, did you not,
                                    in 1987?  A. Yes, Sir.

                               ).   I think that you discovered that there was a policy decision
                                    that they would not be involved in the matter of inspections.
                                    A.  I think that is true.

                               J.   But do you think that they could provide again a useful
                                     input to a local authority in this context? A. Yes, I believe
                                     they could.

                               5.   The Certificate conditions which reached the stage of the
                                    final draft or re-draft before the tragedy, what state are
                                    they now in, what is the position that has been reached?
                                    A. They are currently being looked at again, Sir, but pe n d ­
                           C        ing the outcome of the Inquiry I do not imagine a lot will
                                    happen.

                               3.   Because why?  A. Because of the possible recommendations
                                    the Inquiry might make in that respect, Sir.

                               3 . I will ask you finally, Mr. Bownes.at this stage and
                                    before the Inquiry has made its recommendations, do you
                           D        think that your local authority has learned anything so
                                    far by virtue of the exercise which has been carried out?
                                    A. Yes', Sir ,    think that the Council hasN learned, a very.v
                                    great d e a l . In particular I would highli^Iit' .the point of
                                    communications.

                               Q.    In what sense, the point of communications? A. There have
                                    ’been fairly clear instances, I think, where communications
                           E         have not been as good as they should have been.

                               Q.   That is with regard to the administrative matters, is it,
                                    rather than the police with their talk-through facilities
                                    or the like? A. Yes, indeed.

                               Q . Thank you .

                           F                        Re-examined   by MR.   COLLINS

                               Q.   You were asked about the Green Guide and the Home Office
                                     guidance and the lack of it in respect  of individual
                                     capacities of the pens. A. Yes.

                               Q.   May I suggest it is a matter of commen   sense that if you
                                     have an area in which people are confined on a terrace
                           G         then it must have a capacity?  A. I think that perhaps
                                     the point being made, Sir, was that pens were a fairly
                                     common feature of football stadiums and that had it been
                                     seen fit to make comments on them those comments probably
                                     would have come from the Home Office.

                               Q.   It may be that the Home Office thought that it was a
                                     matter of commen sense and anyone who bothered to apply
                       H

his mind to the matter could not          but have realized that
their capacities were important.          A. It may be that the
Home Office took that view, Sir.

    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Just on that, have you got the
Green Guide there?    A. No, Sir, I have not. (Same handed)

If you look at page   64 when you said a few ‘minutes ago
that there was nothing in the Green Guide to suggest that
you needed to calculate capacities of sub-divisions had
you in mind the reference throughout that chapter seems
to be to terraces?  A. Yes, Sir.

But if you look back at page 33, paragraph 101, does not
that raise the point, with a reference to chapter 16?
"Ground should be divided into sections to prevent
potentially hazardous migrations by spectators.   Each
section of the ground has its own limit of safe capacity.
See chapter 16".  A. Yes.   Perhaps I have misread that
to read the terrace   as a whole.

I follow that it could be made clearer in chapter 16 but
apart from the common sense point that Mr. Collins just
made there is reference at 101, is there not?   A. Yes,
Sir .

  • ’MiK "M-AX-WELL   I: :vau:ld-invite .you , Sir * 'to look ;a.tL 102v ,

    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Yes.    It all depends what you mean
by   each section, each major section. It could be clearer,
I agree.

    MR. COLLINS: At the very least, Mr. Bownes, it is
something in respect of which you might have asked your
experts?  A. Possibly, Sir, yes.

Although one sympathizes with your work load, Mr. Bownes,
I think you will agree with me that it cannot possibly be
an excuse for not doing what ought to have been done in
relation to a particular function of the licensing authority
A. Yes, I would agree with that.

    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: If necessary the head of admin­
istration should have been told: "We need someone else",
is that right?  A. Possibly, Sir, yes.

    MR. COLLINS: And then no doubt the usual financial
constraints would have come into play.  A. I think that
the Council has a record when dealing with safety matters
of giving them an appropriate priority, Sir.

Finally, it was put to you and you have said that there was
no guidance anywhere in relation to firstly what sort of
first aid equipment should be available.  If you had
looked at the file you would, of course, have seen that
South Yorkshire had indeed asked for someone to provide

      A        a list, a raiminum list, of first aid equipment.  You
               were aware of that, were you?   A. Yes, Sir.  I believe
               I was referring to national guidance.

          Q.   I follow that but so far as this club is concened if you
                had looked at what is now page 88 or our bundle you would
                have seen Dr. Bailey's recommendations.  A. I am aware
                of those recommendations, Sir, yes.
      B
          Q.   That at least would have been a starting point?                A. It
               would, Sir, yes.

          Q.   Thank you .

                              Inspector CLIVE CALVERT, Called
                                 Examined by MR. GOLDSACK
      C

          Q.   Are you Inspector     Clive Calvert?    A. I am,      Sir.

          Q.   Now I think with Complaints and Discipline Department
                but for many years stationed at F.l sub-division?
                A . Y e s , Sir .

      D   Q.   Whilst there were you the liason officer with Sheffield
               Wednesday?   A. I was, Sir.

          Q.   Did that cover     the period   1979 until when?        . Until late
                1987, Sir.

          Q.   .So it includes the 1987 semi-final?  A. it includes the 1987
                semi-final and I worked closely with Mr. Sewell, who took
      E         over until the 1988 semi-final.

          Q.   You I think were the first person who had been designated
                as liason officer?  A. That is correct.

          Q.   What did you see your role as being?    A. It was a d e v e l o p ­
                ing role from virtually nothing to liason with the football
                club, planning in con junction with the senior officers,
      F         football matches, and dealing with most of the matters
                on their behalf and with their consultation.

          Q.   What sort of regularity of contact did you have with club
                officials?   A. I saw the club officials on every match
                day.   If we had a problem I would deal with them on the
                match days.   I would see them at the inspections, and if
                we had any reason to contact them on a day to day basis
      G
                it would usually be me who did it.

          Q.   Do we take it that barring exceptional circumstances you
                were always present at football matches during your years
                as liason officer?  A. If I missed one match a season
                during that time that would probably be the most.

      H   Q.   Did you have available to you from
                the Green Guide?  A. Yes.
                                                        1979 onwards access           to

FINAL SUBMISSIONS SUBMITTED ON BEHALF OF

        SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL




                   1
             FINAL SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF SHEFFIELD CITY COUNCIL




What happened?



Why?



What went wrong?




          The viewpoint of the City as certificating authority provides a

special perspective on these questions.    At best the factual investigation

appropriate to this Inquiry allows only a broad brush technique in the

assessment and interpretation of the facts.    So far as the City is

concerned the factual investigation involved produces a special difficulty

in that whilst the City, through the officers in the relevant departments,

has knowledge of matters concerning the certificating function since 1st

April 1986 the City has only imperfect knowledge of the relevant matters

prior thereto.    No canplaint is made on that account, but the cautionary

note has to be that there are areas of potential knowledge and information

which, as far as the City knows, have not been explored.    The purpose of

making this point is not to suggest that any conclusion’
                                                       .which this Inquiry

may cane to is inevitably jeopardised by any lack of total information.

Sensible conclusions can be reached on the information available.      The

point that is made, though, is that the City at this stage prefers to deal

with the "questions posed above in a broad manner.

       . The questions can be answered with what, it is hoped, is not
   J
deceptive simplicity in the proposition that the essential problem here was

one where too many people were in a confined area so that there was

crushing of sane of than who did not escape in time to avoid death or

injury.     It is possible to add refinement to that proposition and to

                                       2
produce an increasingly complex version of it by overlays of detail.       The

City, though, proposes to make final submissions here by reference to the

essential problem as so described.     In essence the City seeks to deal with

the question whether any conduct on the part of the certificating authority

helped to create that problem.     The formulation of the problem as set out

above gives rise to a series of issues:



(i)      Too many people

         Did the certificating authority contribute to any risk that there

might be too many people on the terrace? This involves a consideration of

the certificating authority's conduct in respect of, inter alia,

(a)      crcfrxi management outside and at theturnstiles;

(b)      limiting numbers of spectators within the grounds;

(c)      crcwi management within the ground.'



(ii)     Confined area

         Did the certificating authority, by permitting the development of

the pens, create seme dangerous area?                 ■
                                                      ,

(iii) Crushing

         Did the certificating authority create sane unnecessary risk of

crushing or take insufficient steps to guard against crushing?



(iv)     Inability to escape or avoid injury

         Did the certificating authority create or fail sufficiently to
          .*
          ij   •«

minimise a risk that spectators might be unable, in the event of local

overcrcwiLng or crushing occurring, to escape the injurious effects of it.

         There is a considerable measure of overlap between the issues which

arise.    That overlap reflects the reality that on the facts this tragedy

was the product of a canbination of various circumstances.

                                        3
       The essential submission on behalf of the City in respect of the

conduct of the certificating authority is that this tragedy was not caused

by any wrongful act or emission on the part of the certificating authority.

It is conceded that there were shortcomings in the execution of the

administrative system but it is, nevertheless, contended that the system as

practised was sufficient to achieve reasonable safety.



PRELIMINARY MATTERS

       It is necessary to consider as a preliminary matter the scope and

nature of the statutory function and duty of the certificating authority.

The City is the local authority presently charged with the duty of

enforcing the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 as

amended and is of course the successor in title to the County, which was

the local authority that granted the general safety certificate for

Hillsborough Stadium.   The questions "what happened?    Why? What went

wrong?" so far as the certificating authority is ^concerned need to be

considered in the context of the relevant legislation - the 1975 Act and

Regulations made under it.   The investigation involves the consideration of

whether or not any act or emission on the part of the certificating

authority, either in granting the certificate in the terms in which it was

made or in enforcing the provisions of the Act or relevant Regulations, was

a cause (and, if appropriate, a culpable cause) of this disaster.    A

material question for the later part of this Inquiry is of course whether

or not the machinery of the certificate or of enforcement of the
        ■#
legislation (in particular by inspection) could be used so as to prevent or

help/to prevent any further such incident.   There is, though, an obvious

danger that the considerable wisdem which has been amassed by virtue of the

painstaking nature of this Inquiry may cause views to be formed of past

conduct which are the product of hindsight. Whilst clearly, or at least

hopefully, all parties have already learnt frcm these disastrous events,

                                     4
and whilst the City can identify acts or emissions which will not be

repeated, it is still a proper conclusion that at the relevant time when

sane action was taken the decision was reasonable and proper having regard

to what was then knewn.

           There are certain features of the relevant legislation that need to

be taken into account as relevant and important background circumstances so

that the role of the certificating authority may be put into context,

namely:-

(i)        "Qualified person"

           Before granting a general safety certificate to an applicant the

certifying authority's first duty arising under Section 3(1) of the 1975

Act is to determine whether the applicant is a person likely to be in a

position to prevent contravention of the terms and conditions of a

certificate, i.e. a "qualified person". Clearly the certificating

authority must have in mind the terms and conditions referred to when

considering the question of whether the applicant is likely to be in a

position to prevent contravention.     When answering that question the

certificating authority would have to reply on reasonable grounds and they

would include, for example, in appropriate circumstances whether the

applicant has the personnel and means as well as the ability to organise

seme efficient system in order to prevent contravention.'. In concluding

that '-the Clubs was such a qualified person the County did not abrogate its

statutory function and duty and, of course, did not create an insurer.        It

would be impracticable for any applicant to guarantee that contravention

would not;occur.

          .However, the conclusion in favour of an applicant that he is a
      /
qualified person helps to establish a perspective of the certificating

authority's duty in the following way.     In issuing a certificate to the

Club, and in enforcing the Act subsequently, the certificating authority

are to be taken as having concluded that the Club was and remained likely
to prevent contravention of the terms seen in the certificate. The

certificate is tailor-made to suit authority's requirements for that

ground.        The Club was reasonably regarded asJLiJcel^to be in a position to

prevent contravention of its terms. In deciding in favour of the Club that

it was likely to be in a position to prevent contravention of the terms and

conditions such a vote of confidence in the Club is a factor of sane

significance.        Condescending to particulars, by way of example, the City

refers to Paragraph 3 of Schedule 2:        "the number of spectators admitted to

the Stadium and to the several areas of spectator accanmodation within the

Stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1 of Schedule 3".

Thus the certificating authority; regarded the Club as likely to be in a

position to prevent more than 7,200 spectators being admitted to the West

Terrace.        If the Club (or any interested party) had felt at any stage that

the Club could not prevent contravention of the term the Club (or any

interested party) had a statutory right of appeal in respect thereof.



(ii)         The Police and Fire Service

             Under Section 3(3) of the Act the certificating authority has to

consult other bodies about the terms and conditions to be included in the

certificate.        The Police and the Fire Service were in fact consulted by the

County.       The significance of this is that these were authorities with
       *:W

obvious expertise and knowledge of matters relevant to their respective

disciplines.       The Police would knew about crcwi control and matters of

public order.       The Fire Service would make a material contribution about

fire hazards and emergency evacuation procedures and so on.       Both

organisations are entitled to enter, the sports ground and make inspections
       y
of the ground.

             Consulting such organisations is clearly sensible since the

certificating authority is unlikely to have as much knowledge and expertise

as the Police and Fire Service in relation to those matters mentioned
above.    The fact that the relevant terms and conditions have been subject

matter of consultation and have been expressly or tacitly approved by the

Police and Fire Service again does not involve any abrogation of the local

authority's duty.     It is thought again a potent factor in leading to the

conclusion that these terms and conditions were reasonably regarded by the

County as sufficient to secure reasonable safety at this sports ground.

         Similarly, the regular involvement of the Police and the Fire

Service in the Officer Working Parties/Advisory Group and the annual

inspections and the consultation of appropriate officers on relevant

matters is an important factor in deciding whether the certificating

authority acted reasonably in the way in which it sought to enforce the

provisions of the Act.

         In this context is is to be noted that both the Police and the Fire

Service are eac^ofJt:fepiu"aru,interested party" to whan is granted by

Section 5(3) of the 1975 Act the right of appeal to the Court against the

inclusion of anything in or the emission of anything frcm a Safety

Certificate or the refusal of the local authority\to amend or replace a

Safety Certificate.    The fact that no appeal was ever made, or indeed ever

threatened, is sane indication that these authorities did not find fault

with the terms of the Safety Certificate and that in turn would support the

certificating authority in concluding reasonably that the Safety

Certificate was and remained sufficient and appropriate to secure

reasonably safety.



(iii) The encouragement towards a flexible approach

    ~~Gertificating authorities are given the following advice:

         "Procedure regarding applications for general Safety Certificates

         ... in framing such conditions local authorities will no doubt wish

         to keep in mind the principles or guidelines set out in the Guide to

         Safety Sports Grounds.   In this connection local authorities are
I




                  reminded that, as was pointed out in Paragraph 6 of the Annexed Hone

                  Office Circular No. 150/1975, this nan-statutory document is not a

                  set of requirements to be rigidly applied regardless of individual

                  circumstances.    The maximum flexibility should be maintained to take
           i
           j account of the different       circumstances at individual grounds
           f
           I deriving frcm differences in such matters as age, size and mode of

           | construction.         In this regard, it should also be noted that the Act

       | provides that the terms and conditions should be such as "necessary
       /
       {
       ■ or expedient to secure reasonable            safety" and it would be
       I
       |          unreasonable, even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute

                  safety of everyone attending the sports stadium."



                  The words quoted cane fran Hone Office Circular No. 130/76 (page 6

    of Core). Their relevance, even today, is preserved by virtue of their

    repetition in Annex C to Hone Office Circular No. 7/1986 (Core at 307).

                  This emphasis on "maximum flexibility" and the undesirability to

    slavish application of the Green Guide is important because it clearly has

    influenced a number of persons who had dealings with this football ground,

    for example Doctor Eastwood and Mr. Lock.

                  There are of course further references to flexibility.    On the 26th

    August 1976 the Fire Department of the Hone Office issued advice on

    ifiiehdrnents to the Green Guide and (page 14 of Core):
           ;',W

                  "It is again emphasised that the recanmendations made in the Guide

                  to safety at sports grounds are essentially guidelines and should be

                  applied to existing football grounds with the necessary degree of
                    ■*

                  flexibility to take account of the particular circumstances at

        /         individual grounds.    The aim of securing a reasonable degree of

                  safety should be kept uppermost in mind; it would be unreasonable,

                  even if it were practicable, to seek the absolute safety of everyone

                  attending a ground".

                                                  8
       Such advice echoes of course what is found in the Green Guide
                           '
itself:-

       (a)       In the 1976 Edition at Paragraph 1.4.:

                 "Deviations fran individual guidelines are possible without

                 necessarily detracting fran the overall safety of the

                 ground.   A flexible approach should be maintained to take

                 account of the particular circumstances at individual

                 grounds".

       (b)       1986 Edition Paragraph 6 :

                 "Deviations fran individual guidelines are possible without

                 necessarily detracting fran the overall safety of the

                 ground.     The variety of type, function and layout of sports

                 grounds means that a flexible approach should be maintained

                 to take account of the particular circumstances at

                 individual grounds",

                 and Parac

                 "It should be borne in mind that when losing the Guide to
             f
                 assess whether existing circumstances provide adequately for

                 the safety of spectators the criterion to be aimed for is

                 that of a reasonable degree of safety. 'It would be

                 unreasonable, even if it were practical, to seek the

                 absolute safety of everyone attending a ground"

                 and again Paragraph 11;

                 "The principles referred to in Paragraphs 4-10 above should

                 be kept in mind by both ground management and, where

                 applicable, by the local authority when applying the Guide

                 to an individual ground.     The Guide is an aid to, not a
   ✓
                 substitute for, professional judgment and cannon sense".

       This emphasis cn flexibility is still part of current orthodoxy as

can be seen by reference to Mr. Bcwnes' experience when he attended a

                                         9
Seminar in October 1987 (Transcript 29: 129G and following) and was told by

the Hone Office speakers (as evidenced inter alia by his note) that "the

whole concept of the legislation was related to "reasonable safety" bearing

in mind that existing grounds could not realistically be re-built to modem

standards; it is necessary to work with the existing structures and obtain

the best result possible".              In the literature made available at that

seminar is the following description of the Green Guide:

"It must be emphasised that the document is a voluntary code which although

intended to demonstrate standards of safety to be achieved is expected to

be applied reasonably and with a degree of flexibility"

       There is a problem in according the Green Guide this kind of status.

What is "flexibility" to one mind may be slapdash permissiveness to

another.               Clearly emphasis cn flexibility was and is well-intentioned but

the effect is to produce a code that is not applied tightly and where

non-compliance can be justified as falling within the scope of some

flexible discretion allowed to the relevant authority.              There is no

suggestion that at any stage the certificating authority has sought to

excuse itself from taking action by some contrived .reference to the

flexibility allowed under the Green Guide.              For the future perhaps the

Inquiry would wish to consider recommending that the approach of the Green

Guide should move away fran that of "flexibility" to, for example, an

approach of the following kind:-

       That the certificating authority, and where appropriate the Club

itself, should always seek to establish whether there is sane reasonable

cause why a relevant guideline is not complied with, and that in the
                   *                          — —
           .   ✓
absence'of sane such reasonable cause emerging then compliance with the

guideline should be achieved or insisted upon.              That, of course, was not

the orthodox approach when this disaster occurred.

       The suggestion of flexibility is, after all, a curious approach to

take with regard to the Green Guide whose very purpose is to provide
measures for improving spectator safety. Admittedly the Green Guide does

not have the force of statutory regulations but whilst the references to

flexibility do not go so far as to emasculate the Green Guide they

certainly reduce the impact that the Guide makes.

              As a final reference to this aspect of flexibility it is noted that

the County's OffiC6MC_Workinq Party...(xmslfibared^ther-TOipfc, Cfair1±e_3.Qt± March

1979 (Core at page 65) the County's Officer Working Party was told that the

County Council had contacted the Heme Office but little information

additional to that contained in the various circulars was obtained.

Basically the Hone Office had said that any new work or reconstruction had

to be a standard not lower than set out in the Green Guide but "the maximum

flexibility had to be maintained in the case of existing structures and

differences in such matters as age, size and mode of construction had to be

taken into account". The advice was in accordance with what has always

been the approach taken but such an approach, whilst being far fran              a
recipe for disaster, is likely to achieve less by way of reasonable safety

than is possible                                              \

(iv)          The practical implementation of the statutory function and duty

              What a certificating authority in practice is able to achieve in

carrying out its certificating function and enforcement of the statutory

provisions must necessarily be influenced by the nature and quality of any

advice available to the authority and, indeed, the time and money available
       ; \v

for action.

              As to the former it is inevitable that the certificating authority

will rely on advice fran various quarters as there are unlikely to be
                   ■t
               .

in-house -'experts who can advise the certificating authority on all relevant

matters.                It is quite clear that the County relied on experts fran the

beginning.               Although the Fire Service was "in-house" the Police and the

Building Authority were not.


                                                  11
        It is equally clear that the City relies on the experts who advise

and such was a repeated thane of Mr. Bcwnes' evidence.        For example, with

regard to the removal of Barrier 144 in August 1986 Mr. Bcwnes said

(Transcript 29: 61F) that he was relying there on the experts who were

present.        Again in connection with inspections Mr. Bownes said (Transcript

29: 70H and 71A) that as far as he was concerned he was not an expert but

he relied on the advice of experts who frequently gave advice on the

various natters relating to safety.

        Mr. Bownes' lack of expert knowledge on natters of safety is not, of

course, in any sense a disqualifying factor.        What qualified him to act as

co-ordinator of the experts available to him is his expertise in

administering a wide variety of licensing systems.

        The Act contemplates consultation with Police, Fire Service and

Building Authority. The Statutory Guidance, in accordance with which the

certificating authority has to act when carrying out its inspection,

contemplates the involvement of persons qualified for the purpose of

carrying out an inspection.        The reliance by the ;City on experts is,

therefore, the product of the legislation.

        On behalf of the City a general point is made here that there is no

reason to suppose other than that the persons available to give advice were

at all material times reasonably competent.        The abiding impression created

by the documentary evidence is that the certificating authority's work was

carried out conscientiously and, it is submitted, with reasonable care.

Specific examples of the conscientious approach can be given and in

particular reference may be made to the way in which the City made
           ■*
endeavours to keep the Club abreast of safety requirements:

    /   (i)          In May 1985 (post Bradford) the County sent a press release

                     to the Club (documents attached to Statement of Mr. Bcwnes

                     at page 135-6).   This was followed up on 9th August 1985

                     (ibid - page 137 and Core at page 274) by specific advice as

                                           12
               to evacuation procedures, stewarding, first aid and other

               matters

       (ii)    On the 15th October 1987 the City drew attention to the

               revised Green Guide and certain aspects of management

               responsibility (Core at page 421).

       As to the question of time and money available for action by the

certificating authority, there have to be limits and this is recognised,

for example, by the Hone Office in for example, Circular No. 72/987 (Core

at page 423) where it is suggested that the statutory inspections should

not result in significant resource implications but that in general

inspections are not expected to take more than about 2 man days per ground.

This point is made in the context of emphasising that the scope of

inspections together with associated report work are not intended to be as

detailed or extensive as that often required of the holder of the

Certificate.   (Even allowing for such limits the City always paid due

regard to the achievement of reasonable safety and accorded safety at

Hillsborough a high priority.)   In fact it is kncwn frcm Mr. Bcwnes'

evidence (Transcript 29: 70D) that an inspection took a day but since it

involved several experts clearly far more than 2 man days were taken up on

this matter.

       The availability of time is relevant of course to the suggestion of

delay in producing a replacement Safety Certificate and the City's answer

is given in detail at a later stage of these Submissions. The point can be

made though at this stage that it is hardly appropriate to expect a

certificating authority to take on additional staff to deal with its
        .<*
statutory function and duty when the Heme Office view is that there should

not .be significant resource implication.

      Although the certificating authority is allowed to charge fees in

respect of dealing with applications for the issue or amendment of a

certificate (by virtue of the Safety at Sports Grounds Regulations 1976) no

                                     13
express provision was made in respect of fees for the on-going work of

enforcing the provisions of the Act and dealing with the inspections that

have to be carried out at least once a year.   This Inquiry may wish to

consider whether express provision should be made to allow a certificating

authority to make sane reasonable charge.

       Mr. Bcwnes was asked to consider a suggestion, that on taking over as

certificating authority the City ought to have had a meeting of everybody

involved, including the Club and its engineer, in order to say in effect

"Look, we have taken this over.   We are responsible for the certificate.

Tell us if the situation at the moment is satisfactory.       Have there been

any changes or anything to be done?"    (Transcript 29:124G).     However, in

considering how far the City needed to go consideration has to be_gjy^n. to

the following matters:

(i)    The substitution of Mr- fr*mes..-fca2 Jfc^augban_of the County was

        effectively the only immediate change that came about in the

        certificating function. It was not a cage of the City taking over
                          ._..                    '           "         IIlIKta IIIUlU'Ml
        ...   m—

        sane function which had                                      (when a

        fresh start fran zero base would have been appropriate). It was not

       unreasonable for the City to proceed on the assumption that the

        existing system was one which had been operated in a reasonable

       manner.
                                                          ♦



(ii)   _The letters sent out by Mr. Bownes to Dr. Eastwood of 23rd October

        1986 (Core at 373A and B as copied to the Club), to the Chief Fire

        Officer on the 3rd November 1986 (Core at 373C) to the Chief

        Constable on the 13th November 1986 (Core 373D), and to the Building

       - Surveyor of the City on 3rd March 1987 (Core 380A) and finally to

        the Club (Core at 383) certainly gave other parties the opportunity

        to indicate their views about what was to. be done and of course, in

        the case of the Police, produce the encouraging reply that the

        ground met Police requirements under the 1975 Act (Core at 373E).

                                       14
       The approach taken by Mr. Bcwnes in this context is, it is

submitted, an appropriate and reasonable one.      There was no point in him

muscling in as the new certificating authority and making change for

change's sake.    His approach was more gradual.   He proceeded upon the

assumption that all parties were reasonably content with the system that he

was taking over    (T29:52E) and he sensible       supposed that the ground was

reasonably safe    (T29:63D) and was not given cause to believe otherwise



RELEVANT ISSUES ARISING

First issue : Too Many People

(i)   Outside the turnstiles

       The fact    that too many people were in Pens 3 and 4 was to a material

extent a consequence of there    having been       a very large crcwd especiallyat

a late stage prior to kick-off outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

Paragraph 44 of the Green Guide indicates that turnstiles should be of such

numbers as to admit spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crcwds are

kept waiting for admission and yet at no faster rate than the arrangements

for distributing spectators within the ground permit. This ground had a
t~' • - .....
total of 93 turnstiles., A capacity crowd could arithmetically be admitted

in.a little over 45 minutes.

      Leppings Lane end terraces and the West Stand were capable of being

served by a total of 23 turnstiles which at an ingress rate of 750 per hour

would require a little over 50 minutes to bring about full capacity.

      The kind of event which involves a capacity crowd e.g. semi-final is

one where most members of the public would have an expectation of sane
        .<*
delay in"gaining admission and where most people would make sane effort,

even/if not told do so, to arrive well before kick-off.     Fran the

certificating authority's point of view it is not unreasonable to have

concluded that the number of turnstiles was such as-to .-provide a reasonable

rate of admission.    It is not the sort of matter that would spring to the

                                       15
mind of the administrator. Any such consideration would need to be

initiated by for example the Police or even the Clubv No doubt was ever

expressed to the certificating authority that the turnstiles were
   g . * " 111 .I-Tr..     -


inadequate or that there were any crowd problems outside the turnstiles.

                If there had been a problem brought to the attention of the

certificating authority then sane reaction might have been expected, either

by way of suggesting an alteration to the layout or by way of asking what

contingency plans Club management had made to deal with such a situation.

Unless the certificating authority was made aware of such a problem it is

not reasonable to expect any action to be canmenced independently.                This is

not a case where to the certificating authority's knowledge the available

entrances at the ground had "proved insufficient to stop unduly large

crowds fran gathering outside" which is the kind of circumstance envisaged

in Paragraph 46 of the Green Guide as necessitating the provision of a

contingency plan.

                The Certificate impinges upon this topic to sane modest extent.

Under condition 6(1) the holder has to agree with the Chief Constable the

methods of admission to be employed';' under Condition 9 there have to be

stewards provided for the cpntrol and direction of spectators entering the

stadium;                 under Condition 11(4) all means of ingress have to be maintained

free fran dbstruction;                under Condition 29 that the stadium shall be

maintained with the entrances and means of access to the entrances in the

number, size and position existing at the date of the Certificate and

indicated on the plans.

                It;would be wrong to ascribe the presence of any large or excessive

crowd outside the turnstiles to any wrongful act or emission on the part of

the 'City.

(ii)   Safety Certificate provision in respect of Crow3 Capacity

       The Safety Certificate provides under Condition 2 of^Schedule 2 that

"the number of spectators admitted to the stadium and to the several areas

of spectator accomodation within the stadium shall not exceed the figures

specified in part jL of Schedule 3".   Part 1 of Schedule 3, headed "Crowd

Capacity", indicates that the number of spectators admitted to the stadium

and to the various areas of spectator accommodation within the stadium

shall not exceed in the case of the West Stand. 4,465, the West Terrace

7,200 and the North-West .Terrace 2r900>—

       These provisions have to be considered in the light of Section 2(2)

of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in its then unamended form and

which provided that:-

       "(2) Without prejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety

       Certificate -

       (a)    shall specify the maximum number of spectators to be

               admitted to the stadium;
                                                             \

       (b)    may specify the maximum number to be admitted to different

               parts of it

       It is clear that it was not obligatory to specify the maximum number

to be admitted to different parts of the stadium.

       Although Section 2(2) has been repealed the Hone Office advice is

nevertheless that such terms should still be included in a Certificate.

       The capacities specified in the Safety Certificate are plainly

derived fran Dr. Eastwood’s report, which was accepted by the County's

officer working party (page 60 of Core). Dr. Eastwood discounted the total

area on the West Terrace by 10% to allow for the absence of gangways.                                       He

then applied the rate of 54 persons per 10 square metres as suggested in

Paragraph 15.4 of the 1976 Green Guide.              That 10% discount was presumably

in accordance with the suggestion that an appropriate reduction should be

made in the area available for standing when the positioning and width of

                                       17
gangways did not meet the recanmendations at Paragraph 7.5.1 (every

spectator to be within 12 metres of a gangway or an exit). It was based

upon professional judgment.

            The approach taken by Dr. Eastwood found favour with the officers of

the officer working party.           It came fran a man who was highly experienced

in sports ground safety and for whan the question of .safety was paramount

(transcript 26:79F), who did not feel that he was acting solely for the

Club and was conscious of the public interest (transcript 26:79B) and who

would have felt it his duty to report had he any reservations with regard

to matters of safety (Transcript 26:86E).

            The approach has been challenged on the basis that Dr. Eastwood

ought to have applied the more restrictive provisions of Paragraph 15.4.3

of the 1976 Green Guide which applies "when the spacing of crush barriers

does not conform to the guidelines...".            However, the reference to spacing

is that set out in Paragraph 12, which deals with the maximum horizontal

distance between barriers. ,Dr. Nicholson's report at 2.5 indicates that in

Pen 3 only one spacing does not conform and in Pan 4 only 2 spacings do not

conform.           On the other hand it may be said that the. spacings are much

closer than they need to be which adds to the safety.            It is felt,

therefore, that Dr. Eastwood was in no way unreasonably in adopting the

method he did or in putting forward the figure which he did of 7,200.


       •>
(iii)       The Green Guide and Capacity

             It would be wrong to suppose that the Green Guide provides any hard

and fast rule for dealing with the assessment of safe ground capacity.            At
              •»

Paragraph'15.1 of the 1976 Green Guide what is described as "a method of

calculating the number of people that can be safely accantodated" is set

out.        The 1986 Green Guide at Paragraph 217 adds that the paragraphs which

formulate the suggested method of assessment "contain as of necessity


                                              18
generalised guidelines in view of the wide variety of types, sizes,

configurations of sports grounds, their use and general condition".

       Moreover, with regard to the packing density rates it is to be noted

that these are put forward as being in the nature of "allowances" for the

purposes of the calculation and whilst achievement of those allowances in

practice ought to produce safety it does not follow that non-ccmpliance

produces danger.   In localised areas, where fans may well prefer to gather,

higher rates of density are often achieved but without danger.

Furthermore, reference may be made here to the Fire Service photographs and

the experiments carried out.

       It is to be noted, moreover, that in putting forward "a method" of

calculating safe ground capacity ..Paragraph 220 (formerly (25.3) of the 1976

Green Guide) deals with the number of people that can be safely

accommodated "on a terrace".   -There is no unequivocal suggestion in the

Green Guide that a capacity needs to be estimated for an area such as a

pen.   If reference is made to Paragraph 101 of the 1986 Green Guide it is

seen that a recommendation is made that a ground should be divided into

"sections" to prevent potentially hazardous migrations by spectators and

"each section of the ground has its own limit of safety capacity".    There

is at least a hint that Paragraph 101 contemplates a larger unit than a pen

in its term "section" because it does provide "each section of the ground
                                                         »



for example each end or side should be self-contained..."

       Moreover, Paragraph 102 describes how each of the "major sections"

should be sub-divided by gangways and crush barriers.   Again in Paragraph

103 railings, fences etc. "dividing sections of the ground" should be of
         ■*

the strength of crush barriers.   One might be forgiven for thinking then

that'the Green Guide is not contemplating a pen when proposing that each

section of the ground should have its own limit of safety capacity.

Alternatively there is either a lacuna or an ambiguity here.



                                      19
(iv)         Revision of Capacity

             There is no evidence to shew that theCounty, through its Officer

Working Party, ever considered the question of holding capacity in 1981

when the radial fences were installed or 1985 when the layout of radial

fences was modified.        On the other hand it is not surprising that this is

so since no provision either in the Act or in the Green Guide or elsewhere

(for example in any safety regulations which          might have been   issued)

expressly dealt with the need to calculate capacity for          an area suchasa

pen.

             There is, though, a further and practical reason why such a capacity

was unlikely ever to have been calculated as. a holding capacity and that is

that the areas created in lmjffliLJLSaiLMeES^^                              with

the means of monitoring numbers at the point of entry.        The assessment of a

holding capacity would sensibly be understood to require assessment of the

number of spectators who would be held i.e. remain in an area during the

football game.        Since the spectators were free to move about fran one pen

to another, and since no pen had the mechanical means for checking the

numbers entering it, provision of a holding capacity .y^..quite-meanijagless.

             It might be said that a revised holding capacity should have been

calculated if only to reflect the access channel created between the two

runs of radial fences between pens 4 and 5 or, later, to reflect the

removal of barrier 144.        It is unlikely though that specific capacities for
       •'X
pens 3 and 4 would have been produced for the very reason that any such

capacity, even if it could have been monitored, could not have been

enforced as long as spectators were free-to move between the pens.---------

              . /•




(v) /        Not a cause of what went wrong

             Even if Doctor Eastwood's original calculation was higher than it

should have been or even if the certified capacity for the West Terrace

should have been reduced or sub-divided into the canponent areas it is

                                          20
submitted that the evidence does not establish that any revision of the

certificate to reflect these matters as for example by providing that the

maximum number to be admitted to pen 3 should not exceed say 800 was a

cause of what went wrong.                                Arsensible interpretation of these events is

that death and injury resulted fran the sudden influx of large numbers of

spectators once the gates were opened, and which were numbers so great that

overcrowding and crushing was ever likely to occur.



(vi)            Overcrowding

              ..Realistically the tragedy occurred because of localised areas of

overcrowding giving rise to intolerable crushing pressures'. The

certificating authority's position here is that crowd management within the

ground is essentially a management responsibility, and this is envisaged in
                 .. ....

the Green Guide.                  That is not to say that the certificate does not touch

upon this aspect at all.                             The emphasis at the manent though is on the

managerial respaisibility which _is envisaged for example in Chapter 13 of

the Green Guide:                  "Effective stewarding should prevent overcrowding in

sections of the ground, reduce the likelihood and incidence of disorder,

help disperse spectators in such a way as to reduce crcwd pressure ...".

Again at paragraph 195a a "basic" duty which a steward is called upon to

carry out includes that the duty 'to help achieve an even flew of people to
                                                                                                                                                            !


the viewing areas and safe dispersal of spectators on the Terraces or

viewing slopes'.                  By paragraph 197 stewards have to be fully capable of

carrying out the duties allocated to them.                                                                       Again at paragraph 204 the

Green Guide specifies '!As in other areas of safety, management- is-,                                                                                                                            ..

responsible for the crcwd control arrangements...M .

    / This responsibility is developed in chapters 5 (Ingress) and 8

(Terraces and Viewing Slopes).                                        In particular chapter 8 describes hew

"arrangements should be made to encourage the even distribution of the

crcwi on the terraces to provide ease of access and egress; to control and

                                                                                        21
facilitate movement, particularly if a local emergency should arise during

the event;          and to contain pressures before they reach dangerous

proportions



(vii)   Provision in the Safety Certificate relating to crcwd management

        The safety certificate provides quite apart frcm the limit of

spectator capacity on the West Terrace seme further specific terms that

impinge upon this issue.         Under Condition 6(ii) the holder has to refuse

admission to or evacuate spectators frcm any part of the stadium before or

during a specified activity upon receiving instructions so to do frcm the

Chief Constable (as defined). Under Condition 7 the holder has to arrange

for the attendance of Police Officers "to secure the orderly and lawful

behaviour of the spectators". Overcrcwding in a particular area may well

cause disorderly behaviour.         The Club and the Police would therefore have

an interest in ensuring that there was no local overcrowding and that might

if necessary be achieved by refusing admission to spectators to parts of

the stadium.                                            v

        Again Condition 9 provides for the holder to arrange for the

attendance of safety stewards who are to carry out amongst other duties
    —          "
that of control, and direction of spectators entering using .or leaving the

stadium.          It is true that the certificate provides expressly for the

minimum number of safety stewards required and this minimum number does not

include stewards specifically assigned to that duty on the West Terrace.

On the other hand the safety certificate makes no provision for such

stewards to be on the Spion Kop but the Club do provide stewards there.            It
           . «•

would be wrong to interpret the safety certificate as meaning that the

minimum number of stewards was the’correct number for each and every

occasion.         The minimum number has to be provided for every specified

activity and that presumably includes religious conventions, reserve

matches and so on.         In practice seme football matches would plainly require
more than the minimum number and this was recognised by the Club who

provided more than the minimum number on the occasion of this semi-f inal.

It is to be remembered that this is a general safety certificate and not a

special one for each game.     It makes general provision.

          The submission made on behalf of the City is that the general safety

certificate provided a sufficient framework within its conditions that

would have enabled the Club to fulfil its' responsibility of securing safe

crowd management.



(viii) Practical avoidance of overcrowding and crushing

          In practice in the past this was achieved by visual monitoring.     The

description of the methods used varies in the Police evidence but the

cctnmon feature is that of reacting to any detection that the density of the

crowd unless further restricted would becane excessive.      This has been

described variously as packing or filling the terraces.      It appears to be a

traditional method.     It was one used by Mr. Evans (transcript 26), new F.A.
                                                    \
Official but who previously as a Police officer used to walk the terraces

observing and detecting and restricting further entry to any area if he

felt that the level of canfort was at risk.     It would be wrong to

categorise this method as that of reacting only to discanfort or danger. An

informed and competent observer alive to the risks of overcrowding and

crushing ought to be able to detect that the density is within tolerable

limits.

          All the more so should that be possible where the area under

scrutiny is relatively small as was the case with pens 3 and 4 which

measured in round terms 13m x 14m and where there were advantageous viewing

positions for the person carrying out the monitoring task (either            frcmthe

West Stand or from the perimeter track or at the rear of the terrace).

          Such visual monitoring would be a necessary part of any system

because even with numbers in a particular area less than any recommended

                                       23
capacity there still is the risk of local overcrowding and crushing.                                   It

would be folly for anyone to assume that a totaliser was a sufficient

precaution and of course reliance on it might be dangerously misleading.

Spectators go to popular areas and may prefer to be a close-knit group.

The vital requirement is to know what conditions are like on the terraces

and there cannot be any substitution for careful visual monitoring.                                   That

is not an inefficient system if carried out by persons aware of the

potential risks.



(ix)              Lack of Knowledge by the City

                  The City was never told that_j:iiere^as-any^risk of locaJ---

overcrowding or crushing. Had there been any such risk that was known of

then it is likely that a member of the Advisory Group would have been aware

of it and that its existence would have been made known to the City.                                  Had

the City becane aware of any such problem then on Mr. Bcwne's evidence the

means was available for achieving safety and this, could have included, if

necessary, a prohibition notice.

                  It. is                                               the City believed reasonably that the

Club with the assistance of the Police would be able to achieve the safe

dispersal of spectators on the terraces in a manner that would avoid local
                                                                                         i
overcrowding and crushing.                                   The City can reasonably be forgiven for not

having included any more specific provision as to the manner in which

terraces should be filled or as to the need to look out for and guard

against local overcrowding.                                  These are matters which are of a basic nature,

which do.not need spelling out and which could safely be left to those

involved in the match-day operations to achieve.

      |   t   ^_____   n , _m   11,   --- - ....----------


                  Two aspects relating to ingress to the ground need to be considered:

Directional Signs and the Tunnel.

                                                                     24
(a)    Directional signs

       There is no provision in the Certificate with regard to signs.      The

1976 Green Guide made    erne provision under Paragraph 6.6 in reccrrmending a

comprehensive system of signposting being such as would clearly indicate

routes to various parts of the ground.       Unfortunately this is in a part of

the Guide dealing with egress and it does not obviously relate to

directional signs for_1^.J3»ti3QS^.-Of.-inciress.

       The same point can be made with regard to the 1986 Green Guide which

also deals with signposting under Paragraph 57 but is again in the chapter

headed "Egress". Management have to provide directional flow signs under

Paragraph 29(xv).

       The absence of any detailed recommendation in respect of signposting

for the purposes of ingress in the Green Guide is unfortunate. It is

thought, though, that the matter of signposting is better left to

management to deal with.     The information to be put upon a sign would

probably depend upon the operational requirements affecting a particular

match and for example if a small group of spectators attended there would

be no point in putting up signs which if relied upon'might allcw them use

of the full width and length of the terraces.

       The Police in those circumstances would wish to contain the fans

within a particular area and the signs ought to reflect that.

      hit is in any event submitted that any suggestion that spectators

were likely to create danger for themselves through being confused by the

lack of appropriate signs would have been treated as a remote possibility

prior to this tragedy.     The likely response of the Club and the Police to

such a suggestion would have been that if spectators found through lack of

signs .that, they had in fact gone into an area which was already crowded

then for reasons of their own. canfort they would have left that area and/or

looked out for sanewhere else to go to.


                                        25
       Fran the City's point of view it is another of those matters where

they would have expected to te told if there was a problem (transcript:

29:90A) and in the absence of specific comment arising fran probably the

Police or possibly the Club it is unlikely that this was an issue which

would ever have seen the light of day at any advisory group meeting.

(b)    Tunnel

       So far as the tunnel is concerned it is with respect submitted that

whilst its gradient does not accord with the Green Guide recommendation it

was not unreasonable for the Certificate to be provided in spite of that.

It would probably have been unreasonable to require extensive work to be

done (see Dr. Eastwood's evidence).

       It is unlikely that the tunnel had any effect on the events of this

day and there is a wealth of evidence to show that spectators proceeded

through the tunnel without mishap.    Mr. Foster (transcript 1:63) described

a solid mass in the tunnel walking steadily;        he was not buffeted and was

not even aware it was a slope (1:80).        Mr. Hennessey had no apparent

problem in the tunnel (transcript 2:48) and suffered no pushing.       Mr.

Cruice had no problem in the tunnel (transcript 2:94) . Mr. Cunningham

described the catapulting effect at the end of the tunnel as a result of a

surge in it (transcript 2:104) but that was the result of the numbers

involved rather than the gradient.                             :

      , m any event the "landing" effect of the level area at the bottom of

the tunnel needs to be stressed since this would have had a compensatory

effect after the gradient.

       Generally it is submitted that the tunnel had no effect at all on

the events of the day and whilst it may be Dr. Eastwood's view that the

tunnel would need to be looked at again that is a view dependent very much

upon hindsight.

       Dr. Eastwood evidently had what appeared to him to be good reasons

for leaving the tunnel as it was.     It is suggested that the City could not

                                        26
          reasonably have required extensive works on the tunnel since there was no

          evidence of any history of complaint or accident affecting the tunnel

          although its presence was well known and it was presumably used regularly

          and probably by the majority of spectators attending those Terraces.



          SECOND ISSUE: CONFINED AREA, (the pens)

          (i)     History and Purpose
 'A a J
*'7               The history of the pens is                        fairlystraightforward.The                                       perimeter

          keep spectators off the pitch.

                 The radial fences were provided in 1981 and 1985, as appears frcm

          the documentation.   The purpose of having radial fences appears to have

          altered.   Initially they were provided as

          "movement of spectators. In 19§5 the gcheme approved was for the purpose of

          effecting segregation of hone supporters fran away supporters on the

          terraces and to that end a sterile area between pens 4 and 5 was created by

          the addition of a radial fence there with the added option of creating a

          larger sterile area if necessary by shutting off pen 4.

                 The purpose of the radial fences changed again after the 1986 season

          when it ceased to be the practice to have any mixture of supporters at that

          end of the ground.   The radial fences then became available as a means of

          containing smaller groups of away supporters in specific areas. On the

          occasion of any big match where the whole of the Terraces might be needed

          the policy became one of letting the fans find their own level subject to

          visual monitoring.   Thus latterly in the case of sell out matches the

          radial fences have been restored to the purpose of controlling lateral

          movement.

          (ii)   The Reasonableness of the Certificating Authority's Approval

                 It is quite clear that the certificating authority approved the

          introduction of the radial fences in 1981 and the creation of the pens in

                                                                   27
1985. ,,It does not seem that after 1985 the certificating authority ever

had its attention drawn specifically, to the abandonment of the policy of

segregating rival supporters at that end of the ground.                                                 It is sutmitted

that the certificating authority at all material times acted reasonably in

approving the installation and continued presence of the radial for the

following reasons

(a)    The 1976 Green Guide provides at, paragraph 18.1:

       "Crowd movement on terraces should be severely limited in order to

       give the Police the fullest opportunity for crowd control.                                                    Less

       problems occur where the terraces are divided as far as possible

       into sections by the use of railings or barriers, both radial and

       lateral...".

The radial fences were introduced in 1981 largely as a result of Police

recanmendations and in the absence of any contrary view.                                                    Again in 1985 the

Police favoured the introduction of the central radial fence between pens 3

and 4 and the provision of the sterile channel for their access purposes

between pens 4 and 5.    The certificating authority would have needed

weighty reasons to challenge the Police view but it is in any event

submitted that the Police purpose was a sensible and proper one.

       (b)              The proposals both in 1981 and 1985 were supported by Dr.

Eastwood.    He had sane vacillation (transcript 27: 23 A) ’
                                                           .but never felt in

the event that there was any problem in controlling spectators (transcript

27:75A). He appreciated the manner in which in 1985 the pens were to be

filled by for example using the gates leading into the central pens so that

once either pen 3 or 4 was full it could be closed off and people

channelled into the remaining pen of the two central pens. It is important

to remember, fran the                                                                             of view, that Dr.

Eastwood felt himself able in the exercise of his professional judgment to

issue annual certificates of safety as for example that dated 2nd August

1988 (Core at page 475).       Dr. Eastwood intended such a certificate to

                                                          28
relate to those structures with which he sis engineer was concerned and this

included the radial fences, gates, perimeter fence, crush barriers and so

on.     He meant the certificate to be read as meaning that as far as those

structures which were within his remit were concerned the ground was safe

to use.     Such a certificate carries therefore great weight, caning as it

does fran an apparently reputable source such as Dr. Eastwood who would not

put his professional reputation in jeopardy.       It is to be noted that Dr.

Eastwood was certifying that the various structures in the ground were in a

satisfactory condition and appropriate for the stadium to be used to the

full capacity as laid down in the Certificate of Ground Safety.

          (c)    It was reasonable for the certificating authority to suppose

that the Club with the assistance of the Police had the ability to control

spectators entering and using the pens.       Properly organised the pens were

capable of being used safely.     There is no evidence that the certificating

authority was ever made aware of any disquiet on the part of anybody about

any risk attaching to the pens.       The certificating authority was never put

on enquiry, and that probably reflects the belief of the Club and the

Police that the pens could be used safely.

          (d)    It was not necessary to enshrine any particular method of

filling the pens in the terms of the General Safety Certificate.       The

method was best left as an operational decision to be made by the Club with

the assistance of the Police. The methods described in evidence vary from

the certificating authority's point of view it was reasonable to suppose

that those responsible for fixing a method would be able to do so without

difficulty.

                                  r


(iii)    Effect on Capacity

         At least to the extent that the sterile channel took away a part of

the area available for standing the provisions of the pens in their final

form could have had an effect on the holding capacity of what is left. It

                                         29
is to be noted though that the central pens created were relatively small.

Originally 10% of the area of the terrace had been discounted to allow for

the absence of gangways.   That discount might well be regarded as generous

and perhaps even unnecessary in the case of the central pens where the

majority of spectators would be within 12 metres of the tunnel exit.

       The fact is that it does not seem that the certificating authority

ever reconsidered capacity for the pens but the reason for that is probably

that it was meaningless to do so in terms of any ho

area which was not self-contained and in respect of which a number of

spectators could fluctuate.   The Fire Brigade were evidently satisfied

about the pen capacity in terms of evacuation times.



(iv)   Administrative Shortcomings

       The presence of the radial fences should have been noted up on the

plans and that would have involved an amendment of the certificate of which

the plans are part.   The same may be said of the additional perimeter fence

gate provided in 1985.   However, though the paperwork was not dealt with as

well as it should have been it is submitted that this did not contribute in

any respect to the tragedy.

       If it were said that appropriate advertising with regard to

necessary amendments might have allowed seme interested party to query what

was being proposed or done the answer must surely be that any such argument

is somewhat remote and unlikely but in any event if any interested party as

defined under Section 5(5) of the Act wished to challenge the introduction

of the radial fences then since the radial fences were obvious to see on

the terraces an appeal could have been brought to Court under Section 5(3)

if necessary.

       The perimeter gates which are part of the structure comprising the

pens are dealt with under the 4th Issue below.



                                     30
THIRD ISSUE: CRUSHING

       It is proposed to consider here the matter of the crush barriers

and, specifically, the removal of crush barrier 144.       The City's position

is that even allowing for differences between the crush barriers as they

were in pens 3 and 4 on the day of this tragedy compared with

recommendations in the Green Guide, nevertheless as far as the crush

barriers were concerned they were reasonably safe and sufficiently strong

for the kind of situation which could reasonably be envisaged.        Barrier

124a failed because of gross overloading arising in exceptional

circumstances.     The following points are made:

(i)    The adequacy of the crush barriers at the time of issue of

       certificate.                                             ~-—

       Deficiencies in the barriers as they were before the issue of

       certificate were noted by Dr. Eastwood and the Officer Working

       Party.    A Schedule of Required Improvements was drawn up.     Barriers

       were tested and where necessary replaced.       Additional barriers were

       provided,    The County took into account the professional judgment of

       Dr. Eastwood.     In the event what was provided was, it is submitted,

       a reasonable system of crush barriers.       Although there were

       deviations fran the Green Guide this was an area where it was

       appropriate to apply maximum flexibility since the '.system was so

       .greatly influenced by the presence of barriers which had been there

       for upwards of nearly half a century.

       Moreover, it is to be noted that the terrace in front of the West

       Stand is quite a narrow one fran front to back.      Effectively there

       are only 3 rows of barriers and the situation is quite different

      •' fran, for example, that which obtains at the Kop end where there is

       a much larger area of terracing on a much more significant incline.

       There seems little doubt that the barriers were strong enough to

       meet the recanmendations in the Green Guide.       The heights of the
       barriers are sanewhat variable tut it is submitted that the heights

       involved are not dangerous.

       So far as the layout is concerned Dr. Eastwood advised the Officer

       Working Party that the gaps should be larger than recarmended in the

       Green Guide (transcript 28:16A) and he took account of the fact that

       the barriers were materially closer together rcw to row than

       required in the Green Guide.

       It was very much a situation where approval of the system was

       influenced by professional judgment and cannon sense.



(ii)   Sufficiency of the Terms of the Certificate.

       The certificate makes specific provision in respect of the barriers

       by way of:

       (a) j   Condition 15(i) The holder shall at all tiroes maintain    all

             j structural parts of the stadium in sound order and to the

               appropriate and relevant standards in the Guide and in all

                cases to the satisfaction of the Council.

       (b)     Condition 25 in relation to the systematic testing of

               barriers by a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer.

       (c)     Condition 29 in respect of the maintenance of the crush

               barriers as indicated on the plan.

       Clearly the certificate has not kept up-to-date with the changes in

       the Green Guide in that testing under condition 25 was contemplated

       as involving a cycle of not less than 4.1/2 years and to be by way

       of a representative sample of not less than 20% of the total number

       of barriers.     Properly the certificate ought to reflect the fact

       that new testing should take place every 4 years (Green Guide 1986

       paragraph 38).    This made no difference on the day because the

       relevant barriers had been tested in July 1988.



                                       32
(iii)   Maintenance of a reasonable system of crush barriers after issue of

        certificate.

        It is submitted that the system of crush barriers present on 15th

        April 1989 was reasonably regarded by the City as a safe and proper

        system.     There have been sane alterations over the years since the

        certificate was issued both when radial fences were put in and,

        particularly, in July 1986 when barrier 144 was partly removed.        The

        significance of barrier 144 is dealt with further belcw.     At this

        stage though the City advance the submission that they reasonably

        concluded that the barriers were sufficient and proper having regard

        in particular to the following matters:-

        (a)       The barriers were subjected to regular and appropriate

                   testing in respect of their, strength and where necessary

                   remedial or repair work was carried out.

        (b)       Dr. Eastwood provided his annual Certificates of Safety

                  Testing and anybody reading such a certificate would

                  properly conclude that his professional view was that the

                  crush barriers were in good order, and sufficient strength

                  and made the terrace fit and safe for use.

        (c )      There were regular inspections by the Officer working Party

                  or members of the Advisory Group which included inspection

                  of the crush barriers.

        (d)    ...There were no canplaints of ._ai^danger arising frcm the

                  presence of crush barriers (except in relation to 144 - see

                  belcw) V There were no accidents arising frcm the presence

                  of crush barriers-.

        (e)       The crush barriers appear to have done their job effectively

                  in that they had been in regular use and on occasions

                  subjected to capacity crowds as for example in 1988.    It


                                           33
                                          would not be surprising if the certificating authority

                                          regarded the crush barriers as a tried and tested system.

                               (f)        The City on taking over the certificating function in

                                          respect of the ground would reasonably have concluded that

                                          the crush barriers as provided had been approved and that

                                          they could only be changed if there was reasonable cause to

                                          do so.                Given that the system had indeed been approved and

                                          subjected to regular testing and inspection the City would

                                          have found it difficult to assert any reasonable cause for

                                          changing what was there and any attempt to change would have

                                          been contrary to the recamiendation in favour of maximum

                                          flexibility in the application of the Green Guide.

                                                                   /
    (iv)                     Barrier 144

                             This was removed after the inspection of August 1986.                                 It is

   relevant because of the thesis advanced that the absence of barrier .144 was

   causative on the day in allowing a channel through which crcwd pressure

   flowed with the result that barrier 124A was broken down.

                            The circumstances under which barrier 144 came to be removed are

  unfortunate.                           No prior notice was given of the proposal to remove 144 and

   the matter seems to have been dealt with on an ad hoc basis on site.                                                    Sane

  time was taken up in probing whether Mr. Bownes was acting ultra vires tut

  he refuted any such suggestion (transcript 29:77E).

                            What can be said is that even if barrier 144 had been dealt with in

  a procedurally impeccable manner the same result was going to occur namely

  that barrier; 144 would be removed.,                                         .TTeasnnfnr,„rgam^2-Ma&»fehatr

  advanced by the Police (see Calvert and 318A of Core).
* ~ T > r » « i f a i m n — •■i- r* r>


                            There plainly were safety considerations in mind (see especially

  318A of Core) when the Police advocated the removal of 144.                                                     Those safety

  considerations were assessed by Dr. Eastwood and Mr. Strange and in
particular were assessed against the carpeting considerations including the

possibility of providing a replacement barrier.     The considered and

balanced view taken was that removal was in the circumstances a reasonable

course to take.    That was a matter of judgment based on reasonable grounds

and probably would have been the decision no matter in what circumstances

the discussion took place.

       Whether or not removal of barrier 144 was in the event causally

relevant is a matter of speculation because:-

(i)    even if present barrier 144 only partially intruded into the gap

       between the central radial fence and barrier 149.     If crowd pressure

       flowed through that channel then the presence of 144 would have had

       little if any effect in reducing such crowd pressure.

(ii)   it is by no means certain that crowd pressure did flew through the

       channel so as to have any effect upon barrier 124A.     The evidence as

       to the circumstances in which 124A came to be damaged is in sane

       conflict.   Gary Gains (transcript 2:150) described barrier 124A

       breaking down after a steady build up of pressure and he put that

       very clearly as occurring before kick-off.    Statements were received

       fran other witnesses for example Lewis Johnson who put the collapse

       of barrier 124A at the time when a surge coincided with Mr.

       Beardsley's shot hitting the crossbar.   As a matter of speculation

       it is possible to envisage hew a large group came through gate C,

       dewn the tunnel and then through the channel so as to cause

       increased pressure on barrier 124A but it is equally possible that

       the pressure which affected barrier 124A was generated on the pitch

       side of where barrier 144 would have been.

       It is unfortunate that the video recordings do not resolve the

       doubt.   There is a suspicious movement to be seen an tape at about

       2.47 but no certain evidence as to what was happening within Pen 3

       at that time.

                                      35
(iii)     Moreover the continued presence of barrier 144 might well itself

          have been highly dangerous in the circumstances of the 15th April

          1989 since it could well have lead to a different accident where

          excessive pressure was thrown onto barrier 144 itself or obstruction

          occurred with great risk of injury to persons in, say, the tunnel.

(iv)      The channel as envisaged is probably illuiory.                 In fact the removal

          of 144 opens up an area where any crowd pressure is likely to be

          dissipated and certainly it involves opening up another channel dcwn

          the length of the radial fence.        Whilst that might not be desirable

          in itself it would have had the effect of reducing any pressure

          caused by people flowing in frcm the tunnel.

to accident or injury at any match before the 15th April 1989 in spite of

the attendance of capacity crowds.        No report or carplaint was made about

its absence.         It was never suggested to the City that action needed to be

taken with regard to the absence of barrier 144 . .JltL^JBastMppd provided his

ground safety Certificate for 1988... It is respectfully submitted that the

City would reasonably have concluded that the removal of barrier 144 had

achieved the desired objective put forward by Mr. Calvert and that its

absence,had not given rise to any other risk.



(v)       The Strength of Barrier 124A

          This barrier failed.      It did so because it was grossly overloaded.

Dr. Eastwood's evidence about this as set out at the end of his statement

has not been challenged. .It is therefore submitted that barrier 124A was

sufficiently strong and probably carpi ied with the requirements of the

Green Guide as much in April 1989 as it had done in July 1988 when last

tested.          No one could reasonably have foreseen that such excessive

overloading would be applied to barrier 124A.

FOURTH ISSUE - Unable to escape or avoid injury or death

 (i)   Perimeter Fence Gates

       As a matter of history the majority of these gates were present

before certification although 2 gates were added later namely gate 4 in

1985 and gate 7 in 1987.    Because of the ample width of the exit points at

the Leppings Lane end of the Terrace the perimeter fence gates were never

regarded as part of the primary exit system but were simply a secondary

facility available.

       The gates are in round figures about 30 ans., or say one foot,

narrower than the recannended width for such gates according to Paragraph

209 of the 1986 Green Guide.   There was of course no recanmendation of a

specific width in the 1976 Green Guide.

       The width of the gate was evidently a matter of deliberate choice

when consideration was given to the point in 1985.   The carpeting interests

were on the one hand those associated with matters of security and public

order when for example the Police might need access within the Pen and

preferred a narrcwer gate as against those associated with emergencies and

evacuations when for example the Fire Service would prefer a wider gate.

       It is submitted that the certificating authority acted reasonably in

concluding that the gates as provided were of a width which satisfied the

relevant interests.

       One instinctive reaction in the face of this awful tragedy may be

that the gates were so narrcw as to hamper rescue and evacuation attempts.

It is submitted that such a conclusion is a tenuous one.   The evidence

suggests that spectators were crushed together inside the Pens tut that

when they reached the gate they passed through without being further

obstructed at that point.   Certainly if a conparison is made against gates

of the width recarmended in Paragraph 209 of the Green Guide it is

suggested that an extra foot or so would have made little if any difference

to the ability to escape or effect any rescue.
       The attitude of the certificating authority was ever likely to be

affected by the way in which the Green Guide is couched.        Paragraph 209 of

the Green Guide (which is in similar terms to Paragraph 18.3 of the 1976

Green Guide) advises that "access to the pitch must be made as difficult as

possible in normal circumstances while at the same time ensuring that the

Police have effective access to the Terraces for the purposes of crowd

control and enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event

of serious emergency...".   The priority consideration in the case of these

gates was ever likely to be Police access as the determining factor since

the gates were only intended as a secondary means of exit.        Conditions were

different at the Kop end (see Core page 82) where gates of the minimum

width were necessary.

       It is therefore submitted that the certificating authority acted

sensibly and properly in allowing these gates to be present, that there was

no sufficient reason to require alteration prior to the 15th April 1989 but

that in any event the particular reduction in width in the order of a foot

compared with the recannended width in Paragraph 215 of the 1986 Green

Guide made little if any difference.



(ii)   Evacuation and Emergency Procedures

       It^is^'suSECHE^”€ M t ”'these are-not-matters that can be dealt with by

way of specific detail in the Certificate which ought to provide generally.

The relevant Certificate does make provision as follows:-

(a)    By Condition 6(2) the   C ly b   ..have to ^^CT^^S^pectators from the

       stadium or any part thereof upon receiving Instructions so to do

       fran the Police.

(b)    By Condition 9 the Club have to arrange for stewards to man the

       exits, to patrol the stadium and deai.isth any emergency and have to

       arrange for training exercises relating to the action to be taken by

       such stewards in the event of an emergency.
 (c)   By   Condition 10 the Club have to ensure that egress routes are as so

        secured as to open inrnediately and easily fran the inside and to be

       manned at all times.

 (d)   By   Condition 11 the Club have to sign, illuminate and maintain exit

       routes.

 (e)   By   Condition 14(3) a public address system audible in all parts of

       the stadium and available for priority .use«by the Police has to be

       provided.

 (f)   By   Condition 17 emergency procedure notices have to be posted as

       required by the Chief Fire Officer.

       There are of course other and specific provisions relating to

emergencies involving fire.

       It is the City's case that the provision made within the Certificate

is sufficient to ensure that appropriate means for dealing with an

emergency were available and that it would not be reasonable to require the

certificating authority to have done more.   The specific training of those

who might have to be engaged in dealing with an emergency and bringing

about an evacuation is not a matter that would need to be dealt with by the

certificating authority and ought to be left to those services with the

expertise and where appropriate authority to deal with the relevant events.

Moreover, since the kind of emergency likely to arise is one which would

probably require a Police presence it would have to be a Police decision as

to hew many Officers to have available and what kind of expertise might be

required.   This is not a matter that can be dealt with in the Certificate

and of course under Section 2(2)A of the Act the provision of Police

services is reserved for the determination of the Chief Police Officer.



(iii) First Aid

       The Certificate makes provision under Condition 8 in requiring the

Club to provide and maintain a suitably equipped First Aid roan (adequately

                                     39
signed and lit), a physician to be available at the First Aid roan if

required and the provision of First Aid assistance.

       Mr. Bcwnes told the Inquiry that there was no nationally available

index of appropriate equipment for these purposes.    He had made specific

enquiry of the G.L.C., a body which had experience of major pop concerts,

but was unable to discover any specific detail.

       Originally the County's Officer Working Party had made enquiry of

Dr. Bailey, Caimunity Physician, and he had provided a list of equipment

which the Officer Working Party had in turn put to the Club.

       However, that list had it is submitted ceased to be relevant by

April 1989.    After the City became involved their Health and Consumer

Services Department had been introduced as a member of the Advisory Group

and had made specific enquiry of the Club with regard to First Aid

facilities (see the evidence of Mr. Graham Mackrell) and the position which

resulted was that the Club undertook to find out frcm St. John's Ambulance

Brigade what equipment they reccrrmended and to comply with their

suggestions.   The evidence of Mr. Wells of the St. John's Ambulance

suggests that this arrangement was put into effect.   Certainly the Club

relied upon St. John's Ambulance to provide First Aid assistance and to

suggest"what equipment was needed.

      Having regard to the obvious expertise of the St. John's Ambulance

Brigade it is submitted that it was entirely proper and reasonable to rely

on them as the source of advice. It is though further submitted that the

Certificate by Condition 8 makes sufficient and appropriate provision in

respect of the subject when by virtue of the 1986 Green Guide Paragraph 29

the provision of First Aid facilities and First Aid staff is stipulated to

be a management responsibility. It would be unfair to require the

certificating authority to do more than was in fact done here.

      One consequence of relying on St. John's Ambulance Brigade was that

in so far as they relied on their cwn equipment that equipment was not
likely to be available at the Club on the occasion of any annual

inspection.    However, it was reasonable to believe that St. John's

Ambulance Brigade would attend any specified activity with appropriate

equipment because they invariably do attend and provide First Aid at the

events of mass entertainment.

       Two specific points call for further comment.     Firstly Dr. Bailey's

list did provide for a Minute-man Resuscitator and it seems that such an

item of equipment was not provided by the Club or St. John’s Ambulance

Brigade.     It is thought that the absence of such an item of equipment was

not culpable because had such an item been required then St. John's

Ambulance would have advised accordingly.     Its absence, moreover, was not

causative.    In the event various resuscitators were made available by the

Fire Service and Ambulance Service.     It is unlikely that any resuscitator

in the First Aid roam would have been got into use earlier than the

resuscitators which were in fact used.      It is unlikely that a Club

resuscitator would have made any difference to these events.     Mr. Wells

felt that mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was at least as good.     It was his

view and that of other witnesses including Mr. Higgins of the Fire Service

that no equipment would have made any difference to what occurred.

       Secondly there is some confusion as to whether or not a Club

Physician to attend at the First Aid Room was provided.     The Club believed

that this was so, in the form of Dr. Purcell. Dr. Purcell was regarded as

the Club Doctor.    Doubtless he would have attended if required so to do,

even though he felt himself to be more specifically the Team Doctor.     It is

though submitted that the absence of a Club Doctor to be available at the

First Aid room (if such was the-position) made no difference to these

events and that was essentially the evidence of Dr. Purcell.

                            DRAFTING NEW CONDITIONS

        Attention was drawn to the lapse of time between 6th May 1986 when

Mr. Bcwnes first referred to re-drafting the conditions (Core at 314) and

the absence of any perfected revised version by April 1989.      Mr. Bcwnes'

personal answer is as set out in the memorandum supplied to the Inquiry in

the course of his evidence and which was incorporated as part of the

written evidence on which the City rely.     So far as his position is

concerned it is with respect submitted that Mr. Bownes has not acted

unreasonably or in a dilatory way.

        So far as the City is concerned it must be remembered that:-

(i)     Analysis of the conduct of the Administrative and Legal Department

        in respect of the alleged delay in a maimer appropriate to dismissal

        of an action at law for want of Prosecution (of the suggestions that

        the delay was inordinate and inexcusable) is inappropriate.      This

        was not a matter of litigation nor even a matter of any kind of

        dispute or confrontation between the parties.   The task which Mr.

        Bcwnes had set himself and canmenced by way of the re-drafting was

        exactly that kind of work which could be put to one side when work

        of a higher priority demanded attention.

(ii) ; Mr. Bcwnes did not feel that there was any risk which arose fran the

    . . conditions as they were in the original Certificate.    As mentioned

        earlier he believed that the system was working reasonably well and

        assumed that the ground was reasonably safe. His letters to the

^   ...„various parties Involved in the Off i c ^ Working Party which have _ .

        been referred to above and the answers he got would have confirmed a

        view that the re-drafting”was not a matter of any great urgency.

(iii) Whatever time was taken up in re-drafting the new conditions it

        should not be supposed that work in respect of administering the

        system or enforcing the provisions of the Act stopped.    The

        inspections carried on.   Work continued.
(iv)      It was suggested that additional staff should have been taken on.

          That ought not to be required where the work involved in dealing

       with the certificating function ought not to have any significant

          resource implications. In any event one member of staff was taken

          on as an extra namely a clerical assistant in 1986.

          It is though submitted that the absence of a re-drafted Certificate

was not a cause of this tragedy.

          The system as it was was such as to enable reasonable safety to be

achieved for spectators at a football match.     The system under the existing

Certificate dealt with issues which were raised and responded to those

issues.    There was clearly a general belief amongst those involved in

organising such an event as this semi-final that it could be organised

safely at this ground, with its fixtures and fittings as they were, and

with the manpower which would by arrangement be available.      That belief was

ever likely to affect the City in dealing with its certificating function.

       I am employed by Sheffield City Council in the Administration and

Legal Department as Chief Licensing Officer.                             I have been employed by the

City Council since September 1971 and have held my current post since 11

July 1977.           I have a HNC in Public Administration.

       My job entailed the management of the licensing section which deals

with 33 licensing systems including taxis, private hire vehicles,

operators and drivers, cinemas, theatres and places of public

entertainment as well as the safety of sports grounds licensing system.

       In the course of these duties I prepare written reports for Council

Committees.           The job also involves liaison with other departments and

outside agencies such as the Fire Service and the Police.

       On 1 April 1986 South Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council ceased to

exist by virtue of the Local Government Act 1985.                               The County Council had

responsibility for the discharge of functions under the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1975, and these were to be taken over by Sheffield City

Hillsborough.         This entailed the City Council making arrangements to take

over this function.

      I recall that in February/March 1986 I spoke to Mr VAUGHAN of the

County Council who was then dealing with the Safety of Sports Grounds, at

his offices in Barnsley.                I also spoke to the Police and the Fire Service

and Building Surveyors about Safety of Sports Grounds.                                       I did not receive

any information to the effect that any serious safety issues were

outstanding.

      In order to establish a framework within which Sheffield City Council

could exercise its functions which would be acquired on 1 April 1986 I
                                                                      *
prepared a report which was submitted through the Head of Department, to

the General Purposes Panel which was a sub committee of the Municipal

Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee (referred hereafter as

MEGS) which is in turn a Committee of the City Council.                                        The report was

submitted to the Panel on 3 March 1986.                            I produce that report,              (Ref DMB1)

(Ex          ).

      The report "recommended that the following delegations be approved:-

      At its meeting on 3 March 1986 the Panel resolved in accordance with

the report.         The minutes of the Panel were subsequently approved by MEGS

at its meeting on 17 March 1986.                 In turn the minutes of MEGS were

approved by the City Council at its meeting on 9 April 1986. I produce an
                     I
extract from the Council Summons dated 9 April 1986 which contains these

minutes (Ref DMB2) (Ex                    ).

      As from the 9 April 1986 the delegations approved by the Panel came

into full legal effect.

      All the County Council files (which consist of some thousands of

documents and plans) in relation to Sports Grounds in Sheffield were

handed over to me on the demise of the County Council.                                    Consequently I was

able to examine their administrative system more thoroughly before making

a further report to the Panel.

       The Council now having acquired the functions, it was necessary to

 establish an administrative system within which it could fulfil its

 functions under the legislation.                 To achieve this I prepared a further and

 more detailed report which was submitted via the Head of Department to the

 Panel on 6 May 1986.             I produce the report (Ref DMB3) (Ex                                ).

       The Panel considered the report at its meeting on 6 May 1986 and

 resolved (amongst other things), "that

       a)      the broad outlines of the administrative system organised by the

               former South Yorkshire County Council under the Safety of Sports

               Grounds Act 1975 be r.oted and authority be given for the

                continuation of such system for the time being."

        The resolution also deals with other non material matters.

       As the Panel had full delegated power to deal with this issue the

 resolution took effect immediately.                                    __________________________

      As a matter of routine the minutes of the Panel meeting were seen by

MEGS and the City Council.               I produce an extract from the Council Summons

dated 4 June 1S36 which contains these minutes (Ref DMB4) (Ex                            ).

    The administrative system adopted was based on the former County
                     i
Council system and comprised two main components. These were meetings of

an Officer Working Party at which bi-annual inspections of sports grounds

were carried out and meetings of the Working Party on other occasions to

discuss various matters.

      Dealing with the bi-annual inspections these were carried out by

representatives of the Police, the Fire Service and the Building Surveyors
                                                             *
Division of the City Council.

      Also in attendance would be myself and representatives of the Club.

Inspection^ involved a thorough check of the stadia and the identification

of any defects.           Any defects found were brought to the attention of the

Safety Certificate holder and/or his technical representative if present.

Depending upon the nature of any defect steps were then agreed for

rectification.

      The Ofricer Working Party meetings comprised representatives of the

same organisations but representatives of the Club or their technical

advisors were not members of it.                 Dr EASTWOOD and/or a representative of

his firm and/or of the Club could of course be present during inspections

and during General Purpose Panel meetings when relevant issues were being

discussed.        I do not recall inviting Dr EASTW00D,etc. to attend Working

Party or Advisory Group meetings.

      Examination of Officer Working Party minutes pre 1 April 1986 show

   representative of the club attended meetings.                     I am unable to comment upon

   the extent of the involvement of Dr EASTWOOD,his company or Club

   representatives in the Working Party system prior to 1 April 1986.

         The Officer Working Party, post April 1986, considered all aspects of
                                 I
   safety of spectators at sports grounds, acting as a co-ordinating body

  which attempted to ensure that a balanced and consistent approach was

  maintained to current issues.               For example the          provision of disabled

   facilities in the North Stand at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, which

   involved the construction of ramps etc.

         In adopting the administrative system from the County Council the role
                                                               *
   of the constituent agencies was divided and defined in accordance with a

   schedule drawn up by the County Council.                   This gave responsibility for
O r*
 .."the carrying out of inspections, re inspections and making final

   technical recommendations..." to ’primary authorities’.                        For example the

   ’Primary Authority’ for the spacing and strength of barriers and strength

   of perimeter walls and terraces (structural) was the building surveyor and

   for terraces (means of escape) the Fire Service.

         The Council was the prime authority for estimation of safe ground

   capacity.        I produce the schedule which was in force until 1987 (Ref DMB5)

   (Ex         ).

         As part of the administrative arrangements the Officer Working Party

   in addition to making "agreements" (for example in respect of work to be

   carried out) could make recommendations to the Panel.                        Recommendations

   could cover any issue in relation to safety of sports grounds, examples of

   issues in which the working party did make recommendations to the Panel

   involved the South Stand roof and the Spion Kop (both of which are at the

   Hillsborough Stadium).

      If the Working Party were unable to reach agreement on any matter tlen

it would be referred to the Panel.                   If the Club refused to implement

something agreed by the Working Party then this would be referred to the

Panel.

      Minutes of the Officer Working Party were taken by me due to my

position with the Council.               So far as my involvement with the Working

Party is concerned I acted as Clerk/Secretary and took the lead as the

occasion demanded although in practice this did not arise very often,

owing to the smooth operation of the Working Party.

      Regarding the reduction of Barrier 144, this arose at the bi-annual
                                                                     *
inspection attended by the various agencies at Hillsborough on 7 August

1986.     Representation was made by the Police for two sections of the
                        ifkZC SOUTH
barrier in the'IlocthyCentral Pen to be removed so that persons entering

the terrace from the tunnel would not be obstructed by it.                                     According to

the Police some difficulties had arisen in this area.                                Following

discussion it was agreed by the Officer Working Party that the barrier be

reduced.       In attendance at the time that the discussions were taking place

were representatives of EASTWOODS on behalf of the Club, although I am

unable to name the individual(s).

      During the course of the discussion in regard to the reduction of the

barrier I am unable to recall whether any mention was made on the question

of crowd capacity of this part of the ground.                              My personal notes taken at

the time are not available.

      So far as I am concerned the working party arrived at an "agreement"

which was wholly consistent with past practice and the administrative

procedures briefly described in the report of 6 May 1986.                                  Such

’agreements’ were expressly authorised by resolution 4(a) of the General

Purposes Panel meeting held on 6 May 1986.

      In the period after May 1986 a review was carried out by my department

of the administrative system relating to safety of sports grounds. As
                     i
part of this review consultation took place with the Police, the Fire, the

Building Surveyors Department and the Health and Consumer Services

Department (of the Council).                This led to a draft report being prepared,

and circulated for their comments to these authorities on 3 August 1987.

I produce a copy of the letter circulating the draft to the Fire Brigade

(Ref DMB6) (Ex                ), Letters and memoranda to the other agencies

followed the same format.                                                                ■:

      Following receipt of replies from the agencies a report was submitted

to the Panel via the Head of Admin and Legal Department on 7 September

1987 which reflected the consultation process.                       I produce the report (Ref

DMB7) (Ex              ).

      A resolution was passed by the Panel on that date and took full legal

effect immediately.            The minutes of the meeting were passed to MEGS and

the Council for information only.                 I produce an extract from the Council

Summons of 7 October 1987 which includes these minutes (Ref DMB8)

(Ex           ).    The purpose of the review was to update the administrative

system and to try to clarify and simplify the system.

      The Panel resolved that:

      "a)     the details contained in the report now submitted regarding the

              operation of the Councils Certification function for the safety
                                   f ir *

              including the establishment of the proposed Safety of Sports

             Grounds Advisory Group comprising representatives of the Building

              Surveyor, tne South Yorkshire County Fire Service, the South

             Yorkshire Police and the Director of Environmental Health and

              Consumer Services to advise the Council on matters relating to

              the Safety of Sports Grounds be approved and

      c)      authority be delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

              Department to deal with all routine matters in connection with

              the administrative system."

      It will be noted that there are minor differences between the
                                                             *
resolution and the recommendations in the report.

      The significant changes arising from the review were that the Health,

and Consumer Services Department now had a role, the inspection system was

made annual (instead of bi-annual) and included inspections during

specified activities.             The practical effect of the change to the

inspection system was that written reports were submitted by each

authority to Head of Admin and Legal Department following an inspection.

The Officer Working Party ceased to exist and it was replaced by the

Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group.                    As the report says:          This:-

      "would function as a forum for discussion between officers; its most

regular use would probably be the discussion of items of advice to the

Council before they are finally formulated by the appropriate Authority.

Meetings of the Group would be held at the request of one or more

Authorities and cn receipt of a request the Head of Administration and

Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a list of items to

be discussed.     At the conclusion of the meeting a further list of items

would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be taken by each

Authority would be noted.         It is then anticipated that detailed written

advice would be provided by each discipline and be acted upon as
                     t
appropriate.

     In addition the Head of Administration and Legal Department will keep

copies of all relevant correspondence which will be available to all

participants in the Group."

     The roles of the various agencies were also simplified from those

previously laid down in the schedule referred to (Ref DMB5).                        Thus the
                                                         *
Building Surveyors Department had responsibility relating to the structure

of stadia, including crush barriers, walls etc. and South Yorkshire County

Fire Service were responsible for amongst other things, means of escape

and stadia capacity.       The Health and Consumer Services Department had an

input on Health and Safety matters including First Aid.                      Built into the

system was a general provision for flexibility.                      There was no role in the

Advisory Group for Clubs or Eastwoods.

     Dealing with the delegation given by the Panel to the Head of

Administration and Legal Department in relation to "routine" matters.

Interpretation of the phrase "routine matters" is a matter for individual

judgement to be exercised in the circumstances of a particular case.

Generally the operation of this delegated power is very similar to that in

other licensing systems operated by the Council.                      It is in no way           *

of the Department during 1986/81? and his assistant Head of Department was

Mr WEBSTER.

      This administrative system was in force at the time of the

Hillsborough Disaster on 15 April 1989.
                     i
    As far as I am concerned the members of the Officer Working Party and

subsequently the Advisory Group were regarded as the Council’s source of

professional advice in relation to Safety of Sports Grounds matters.                            The

methods of communication between the authorities comprising the Advisory

Group were general ones, telephone, meetings, memos and letters and this

would include liaison with the Building Surveyors Department.
                                                            *
      Communication with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was on the sanrce

basis as with the other authorities.

      Dealing with the relationship between the Football Club, the Advisory

Group and the Council, I would describe this as reasonably satisfactory.

The impression I have is that the Club were reasonably safety conscious

and generally complied with requests made of them.                       I am aware that a

number of issues involved more discussion than others but eventually

agreement was reached.

      Post April 1986 when the City Council took possession of the files

from the County Council in regard to the Safety of Sports Grounds I read

through them including the file on Hillsborough Stadium.                          I also read

about this time the Green Guide on Safety at Sports Grounds 1976.                          There

was a very large amount of paperwork and I cannot specifically recall any

particular issues raised in the files and this includes the erection of

radial fences in the West Terraces in 1981 and 1985 or the crushing in the

terraces in 1981.

       On 1 April 1986 bearing in mind that the Safety of Sports Grounds

system had been operated for a considerable length of time by a

responsible body (South Yorkshire County Council), I was entitled to

assume (in the absence of any contrary evidence), that the sports grounds
                     t
in Sheffield, including Hillsborough Stadium, were reasonably safe.

       I have been asked to comment on my knowledge of the following issues

in relation to the Leppings Lane terraces of the Hillsborough sports

grounds -

(a)         The elevation of the tunnel beneath the West Stand;

(b)         The configuration of crush barrier on the terraces;
              w >drU Sf                       z
(c)         The^gates in the perimeter fence;

(d)         The reduction of barrier 144;

(e)         The capacity on the West terraces;

(f)         The capacity on the Safety Certificate;

(g)         All these issues with regard to the Green Guide;

(h)         All these issues pre and post 1 April 1986.

       My comments have been sought on the basis that some or all of issues

(a) to (e) involved variation from the Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds -

the Green Guide.

       It is necessary for me to re-state the following three facts

(i)         I am not technically qualified;

(ii)        I was not involved in safety of sports grounds prior to 1 April

            1986;

(iii)       I am an Administrator.               It follows from these facts that I cannot

            authoritatively comment on any technical issues or on any issues

            pre dating 1 April 1986.

         Bearing in mind my comments, issues (a) to (g) are technical issues

upon which I cannot comment.            Issue (d) I have commented on elsewhere in

this statement and in my submission to the Inquiry - and I have nothing to

add.      With regard to issues (e) and (f) I am aware that allegations have

been made that the certificate should (for example) have specified

capacities for the pens on the terraces.                 At no time prior to April 1989

has anyone suggested to me that capacities should be imposed in respect of

the pens.       Had such a suggestion have been made I would have taken

appropriate action (as I did for example in relation to the Spion Kop).

Those changes that had been made, in particular I am thinking of the
                                                         *
erection of radial fences in the West Terrace, in 1981 and 1985, which

could have an effect on capacity, were not brought to my attention either.

       I have also been asked to comment on the questions, "Did the Council

undertake a full survey of each sports ground in Sheffield after 1 April

1986 to discover the extent of compliance/non compliance with the Green

Guide?       If not why not?"

       Up to 1 January 1988 the duties of the Council were set out in the

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (as amended).                       These duties were

summarised in Annex ’A ’ to Home Office Circular 7 of 1986 (Ref DMB12)

(Ex            ) which I produce.       No mention is made of inspections.                        The 1976

edition of the Green Guide suggests that annual inspections are

appropriate.       (Paragraph 4).                                                                   *


         From 1 January 1988 two more duties were added to the list                               the lire

Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.                    These are a duty to

enforce the legislation and to carry out inspections.                       The Home Office

issued statutory guidance on annual inspections, see Home Office Circular

      refers to a limited inspection.

             Bearing in mind these facts there is clearly no obligation on the

      appropriate.

             The method by which I arranged for reasonable safety to be monitored

      are well documented in the files. The second element we^e the written

      available if required.                     The third element was the review of the Safety

      of Sports Grounds system covered in the report to the General Purposes

      Panel in September 1987 (Ref DMB 7) (Ex                                         ).

             Had any of the experts identified any issues relating to reasonable

      safety then the system I have outlined should have encouraged them to

      raise them and have them resolved.                                 There are examples of such issues on

      the Advisory Group notes.  It is also relevant to note that it is the duty
                                          . <W!-j & ***
      of professional officers involved in the Licensing System to bring safety

      issues to the attention of the Licensing Authority.                                           I am aware that the

      Green Guide does have a relevance to reasonable safety issues as does

      other guidance.

             Regarding amendments to Safety Certificates my view is that it is not

necessary to physically alter or amend the original certificate document.

Where amendments are made by the council in accordance with legislation it

is sufficient that notice procedures as specified (in the Safety of Sports

Grounds Regulations) are followed.                      This involves notifying by letter

various parties involved and notices in the Press.                               With regard to the

increase in capacity for the Spion Kop this procedure was followed with

the exception of the notice in the press.

     As part of the third element referred to previously the Safety

Certificate conditions were reviewed on two separate occasions, the second

and most detailed draft being circulated to the authorities for comment on
                                                                  *
30 March 1989.           I produce the letter, to the Chief Fire Officer-^ together

with the draft conditions (Ref DMB 9) (Ex                                 ).    A similar letter/

memorandum and draft were sent to the other authorities.

     At the time the second draft which considered crowd capacity was

circulated no amendment to the crowd capacity in the West Terrace was

proposed.         Obviously officers comments on the draft, which may have

included reference to capacities, were not made prior to the disaster

occurring on the 15 April 1989.

      The Council as the licensing authority have a duty to enforce within

their area the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and

regulations made under it and for that purpose, to arrange for the

periodical inspection of designated Sports Grounds.                                In carrying out the

functions I have described I consider that they (the Council) have

fulfilled their duty.

      A written submission was prepared by me and submitted to Lord Justice

TAYLOR’S enquiry on behalf of Sheffield City Council.                                    This submission

should be read in conjunction with it.                   I produce a copy of the submission

(Ref DMB 10) (Ex               ).

    Subsequent to the submission, I gave evidence to the TAYLOR enquiry on

27 and 28 June 1989. I produce a copy of the transcript of my evidence

(Ref DMB 11) (Ex               ).

         I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the transcript.                      I am

conscious however that some points referred to in the transcript require

clarification.         Some of these issues are referred to in this statement and

clarified; I reserve the right to clarify other points.

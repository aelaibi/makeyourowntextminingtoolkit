just     a trickle.                   I was       under          the     impression              that     perhaps           more

this       v as t     crowd         someone          tugged            at    my       coat.         I turned             round and             saw an

said,        "P l e a s e ,        please         get     me      out       of    this."            The       c r o w d w as        stil l

what       seemed         quite          a    long       time,         I managed             to     get       them       through          and       out

 ran      into      the    West     Stand       and    as    I ran          down       towards          the     tunnel         I could

 see      people         being     carried         out,     s om e    of     these         looked        conscious,             others

young        girl's         body.          She     was       dressed           in a L i v e r p o o l       tracksuit             with       the

up     her       legs     and       shouted        to a n o t h e r         officer          to    pull     her      up     so    th at      we

could        move       her      o nt o    the     pitch*           I remember               her    face       and     hands       were

purple.            We     moved        her      through         the      g at e    which          had    been       opened.        I

turned           round      to      see     a Liverpool             supporter,,              mal e,      white,        who       was

An     officer           c a l l e d me      off       the    stand         and    on to      the       pitch.         Once       on       the

pitch        I     helped           someone with an ad v e r t i s i n g                     board       from       the     side       of    the

stood        on    the      West       Stand       facing          what        supporters           were       left       who     were       by

now     throwing            insults          at    us.        I was         told      to     go    back     onto       the       pitch.           1

consoled           and      spoke         to as        many     f ans       who    were       upset       as    possible,              trying

to     help       them      if      possible.            After          which      we      were     told       to    go     to    the

           After        the    majority               of    fans        had    left   one L i v e r p o o l           fan     came up        to me

           and    asked        me         the     emergencytelephone                     number        which          he    c o u l d co n t a c t ,

           were     d e a d or a l i v e ,             I told        h i m to w a i t         where         he was          and     I would            find

           out,         I went          to S e r g e a n t        Whitlam       who      i n f o r m e d me      what        the       telephone

           number        was,           I wrote            it d o w n    on a    p i ec e    of    pa per        and        handed          it    to    the

           After        all    the       supporters               had    left    we      returned           to    the      North Stand

           where        we    were       spoken            to   by s u p e r v i s o r y    officers,             after        which         I

           returned           to E c c l e s f i e l d .

           My     fears       were       for      the       f an s    outside      the      g r o u n d at L e p p i n g s             Lane       who

           could        have       so    easily            been      injured     or      killed.            If    the       gates       hadn't

           have     been       opened            my    feelings          are    t h at     all    the       supporters             waiting             to

           My     observations                a re     that       thousands        of      supporters             turned          up    late       (some

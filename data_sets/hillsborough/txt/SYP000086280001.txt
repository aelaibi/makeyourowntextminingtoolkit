was a l l owing Liverpool                 fnas    into the store s p <                    at a time     for the

purpose        of    purchasing          beer and       lager     in carys.

Later     on in the day this mana ge r                    found        it n ec e ss a ry to        close      the metal

shutters         on all      the store         entrances        leaving         the   exit door         open to

allow     local        shoppers      into      the    premises.          The     rowdy behaviour              of

Liverpool           fans a p p a r e n t l y o bs es se d       with     the     need to purchase and

consume as m uch alcohol                  as     possible,       had been the              cause    of this

a c t i o n . M a n y of the fans          e x pr es se d extreme a nn o ya n ce at not being

a l l o w e d to enter        the    store.          Their     general      a tt it ud e was        that      this

amounted         to an i ntrusion           into their          civil      1 i b e r t y .At £.45       pm many

to    reach the ground              in    tvme    for    the kick        off a p p e ar e d to have

little       effect.        M an y of     t he/Tans       concerned were              seen to be         in

When     the     call     came for all           officers       to a t t e nd     the      ground     I went        there

and w al k ed onto           the    pitch.

At    that     time all       the bodies          I could see were a t t t e n d e d by P ol i ce

Officers/Ambulance                 crew and       it was not n e c e s s a r y for me to handle                       them

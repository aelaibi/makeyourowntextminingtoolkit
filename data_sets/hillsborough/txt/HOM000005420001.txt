                     Fhave seen the Home Secretary's letter of 20 August to you
                   seeking agreement to legislate for four new criminal
                   offences as recommended by Lord Justice Taylor in his final
                   report into the Hillsborough Stadium disaster,

                   I see these new offences as a key part of Lord Taylor's
                   proposed package of measures for combating football
                   hooliganism and I fully support David Waddington's proposal
                   that a place should be found in the legislative programme at
                   the earliest suitable opportunity.

         /       I am sending copies of this letter to members of QL and H
                 Committees, First Parliamentary Counsel and Sir Robin
                 Butler.

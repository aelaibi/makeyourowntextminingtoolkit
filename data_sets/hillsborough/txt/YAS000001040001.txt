                  SOUTH YORKSHIRE METROPOLITAN AMBULANCE SERVICE


                                         REPORT


NAME:       ADO - Support Services, Mr Roger Morley

            Duty Officer


DATE AND TIME OF INTERVIEW:           19 April 1989, 1430 - 1639 hours


Following a routine patrol of the Sheffield area to ascertain the general
traffic and crowd situations,            I was returning to Ambulance Headquarters
when I heard radio messages from Control to Alpha 3, relating to a fleet of
Ambulances being required at the Leppings Lane end of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Ground.


Shortly    afterwards,    I    arrived      at    Headquarters     at    the   same    time   as   Mr
Hopkins was leaving the Control Unit.                He approached me and said there was
trouble    at   Hillsborough.          He    drove    the   vehicle      and we       proceeded     to
Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.


Enroute, at Mr Hopkins request, I contacted Control to have vehicles clear
and available     as   soon as possible,            in anticipation of large numbers of
casualties.      I heard a radio message informing all vehicles to change to
ERC.


We arrived at the Ground at 1523 hours.                We went directly to the recognised
Casualty    Clearing Point       at   the    Gymnasium.       We   parked our vehicle with
difficulty near the top of the slope leading directly onto the pitch.                              The
area was heavily congested by Police Horses and Police vehicles.


I   informed    Control   of    our   arrival       and   asked    for   as many       vehicles     as
possible to be made available.                   Mr Hopkins went into the pitch area to
assess the situation.          I stayed with the vehicle to maintain communications
with Control.     ERC proved to be un-usable.




                                                                                         /continued

People from the crowd were constantly approaching me for help.                               Casualties
were being brought up              the    slope    from    the pitch         to the   area under      the
Penistone Road end of the North Stand by spectators to the vicinity of the
First Aid room.           Many of the fans were extremely distraught.                   I was trying
to stay in a position where I could give help and direction to as many
people as possible.


Mr Hopkins returned from the pitch and asked me to ensure that the Major
Incident vehicle was attending.                   I supervised the marshalling and loading
of    vehicles.          There    was    still     a     lot   of    aggravation      from    extremely
distraught people.          I was anxious to shield Ambulance crews from as much of
this as possible.


Due   to    the    restricted      access    to     the    area,     it was     inevitable     that      on
occasions Ambulances actually caused obstruction due to the length of time
that crews were away from vehicles rendering aid.


I was approached by Doctors, Nurses and volunteers from all areas of the
ground.         These    I directed to the most appropriate area as indicated by
their skills.            This    involved Ambulances           and staff from Nottinghamshire,
Derbyshire and West Yorkshire.               Red Cross volunteers were also directed to
the First Aid room.


Arriving        crews   were     directed    to    the most         seriously    injured     cases.       I
attempted to keep myself informed as to casualty locations.                                As the back
doors      of   Ambulances       were    opened,       spectators     were    attempting     to   remove
anything from           the vehicle which          they thought would be of use.                  This    I
restricted as much as possible.               Vehicle crews were inevitably split up and
in some cases not re-united until much later.


                                                                                             /continued

After most      of the       living casualties     had been moved,        I handed over        the
marshalling role        to an Officer         from West Yorkshire.        The operation was
eventually transferred to the Gymnasium yard and by this time all the live
casualties had been moved to Hospital.


I was     asked   by   Mr     Hopkins    to   ascertain   how many    bodies      were    at   the
receiving hospitals.           This was in order to establish how many bodies would
eventually require disposal and to where                  this might be.         I visited the
hospitals to find out this information.               There was uncertainty as to where
the bodies would eventually be taken.                 There were 11 bodies in the 118
casualties     taken to the Northern General Hospital and 1 body                     in the 80
casualties taken to Royal Hallamshire Hospital.


Staff at      the Royal Hallamshire were expecting the imminent arrival of a
large number of bodies.            I ascertained that the bodies were going to the
Medico Legal Centre and I informed the Unit General Manager at the Royal
Hallamshire Hospital of this.


I returned      to Hillsborough,        plans were made      to recover bodies           from the
Royal Hallamshire and the Northern General.                  Most crews were then stood
down.


I was then briefed by Mr Hopkins in the presence of the Coroner, as to the
plan    of   action    for    identification and      eventual    removal    of bodies         from
Hillsborough      to   the Medico       Legal Centre.      I had three      crews,    plus     one
reserve plus                     and Mr Eason at my disposal.


Station      Officer                coordinated     movement     inside    the   morgue     after
identification.        He was also instructed to report progress to Control every
30 minutes.
                                                                                     /continued

Station Officer Eason was     put    in charge    of   transport   and documentation.
Each body was   accompanied   by a Police   Officer whose collar number   was
noted, together with the patient's name if known, and number.


I took overall charge of      this   operation    overnight and    attempted tolook
after the welfare of staff as best as possible.


The operation was concluded at 0550 hours on Sunday 16 April 1989.

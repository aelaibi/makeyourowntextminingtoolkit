U p o n arrival        we set up barriers at about                    10.45arn (1045)       in order      to

stop v ehicles           parking        in the       road w hi ch didn't      belong     to residents and

to control           the flow of         pedestrians.



By this      time Liverpool             and N o t t i n g h a m fans     had begun to arrive and

w ere a sking         for direc ti on s         to public       houses and o f f - 1 i c e n c e s .     We

t ried to e xp la i n that              local    pubs were       closed or only open for               local

residents.             This    did not       deter      them as m any stated that             it was     early

a nd they w ou ld walk a mile                   or so for a drink.



At this      time the m o od of the fans was                     very    cheerful     and jokes were

being m ade          from all      quarters.            During     the next     four hours       the

f ol l ow i ng    events      I remember         took    place     but   not n ec es sa ri ly    in

ranks a bo ve were            in a b u n d a n c e    outside    the ground early on but as the

s t r e n g t h of    people     i ncreased senior            officers were         in less abu nd an ce

w orse    for drink and at one               point two fans              of about 20 years were

a s l e e p on the      pavement        in Leppings Ln o pp osite Fielding Rd and were                           in

a state        that    I could only         call    drunk and         incapable.         As time

p r o gr es se d more and more            fans a r r iv ed and many were              very boisterous,




                                                      /
throwing        food and       litter around as wall                as    swearing and chanting.



Fans     were     turning      up without        ticl/ets and were asking               other   fans      if

they had spare tickets.                     This at      the time         sounded    l i k e / ’Spurs'    and we

had jokes with the Liverpool                     lads    that Spurs          played a/t White Hart Ln.

I could say that              I saw about 200 d ifferent                  people asking      for spare

tickets        d ir ec tl y   in front      of us and this was               in a /p er io d of about 2

hours.



By    1.30pm      (1330)      there were       hoards      of      people    on Leppings Ln and many

asking     for toilets as there was a l r e a d y m a s si ve queues                       forming       outside

the    t urnstiles        on L ep pi ng s Ln.



At about 2 . 1 0 p m          (1410)    I remarked to POL PC P a t t e r s o n that the train

carrying Liverpool               s upporters was          just      pulling    into W a d sl ey Bridge

R a i l w a y Station.           Traf fi c was       using L ep p i n g s Ln and fans were walk in g

in amongst         the traffic          because of their            sheer     numbers    they couldn't

p os sibly keep to the              pavements.



C l u b S te wa rd s    from S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y   p e r si st en tl y tried to     park

their     cars     in F ie ld in g Rd,        w hich by now was a l r ea dy full with

off'     for    not a ll ow in g       him to park.             The general      behaviour       from the

s te wards was         poor and        I would have        e xp ected       better   from them towards

us.       If they treat us as               they did what w o ul d they treat the                   fans

like.          Many used an excuse             that     their      boss had given them           p ermission

to    park where        they w an t e d and were            not    slow to drop names             of    certain

Insp ec to rs       in the force.              However,       they      left and found suitable

parking      elsewhere.


                                                /
The time       by now was about E<f2Qpm (1420)                       a nd we had dealt with a lot of

people who were not               v e r y / am us ed with both the Police and stewards at

the turnstiles.                 Man\/Li ve r poo 1 a n d N o t t i n g h a m Forest          fans      showed us

tickets and were             g e n e ra ll y   convinced that            they had gone to the wrong

entrances.              Many,/and       I w ould say to be              conservative,        about      500

people       stating      ^at     they had tickets             for seats            in the N orth stand and

be ca us e    of the      prefix      letters        before    their         seat    numbers,    had been told

that    they had to go             into the football              ground via the turn st il es                on

P e n i s t o n e Rd.       T hese were Liverpool                 suppo rt er s and       it was       obvious by

their accents.               After      being       sent down L ep pi ng s Ln and onto                 the

t ur ns t il e s    on Pe ni st on e Rd they were              rather         disma ye d whe n they          came

back and saw the mass                of    people waiting,              or     rather   pushing     to get         in.



B y about 2.4 5 p m         (1445)      the    crowds were         so        immense outside      the

w ay w o u ld all        these     people get         in in time to see the m atch kick-off.

Pe o pl e were        pushing     that much that            people were             retreating    back towards

us a nd stating           that     no way they w ould get                    in and they were       going      to

sell    their tickets.               Police         horses were         in a t t en da nc e and seemed to

be having          little    effect       in controlling           the       crowds.

Fans were          climbing      over     fences and walls/ but                 I couldn't      say whether          it

was    to a v o i d     being    crushed or because               they had not tickets.



On entry towards             the ground several               fans      from Liverpool          had o bt ained

the    street.         At about 3pm        (1500)    or      a little before tXere was a cheer

from wi th in the ground and               I assumed         that   the players         had   come out

onto    the field.            T here were    still       about 200 0     pe/fple outside        the

ground.           I said to G r a h a m Patterson,          'They w/l 1 have to delay the

m a t c h to    let them all       in'.      At just       leaving 3 pm        (1500)    I made my way

down Fie lding Rd towards Pen is to ne Rd to meet                        up with POL PC 2752

J owit and POL PC 2 584 Musk.                    After    d i sc us si ng w hich one was        going     to

take    their meal        first,     we wa it ed for any officers               from our serial          to

walk along         towards C la yw h e e l s Ln.          Instead officers were walking

t owards       the turnstiles at          the Pe ni st on e Rd end.             I remarked to both

o ff ic er s    that   there were        still    a few      t ho u s a n d fans waiting to get          into

the N o r t h and West         stands     on Leppi ng s Ln.



W hi ls t     standing    here Traffic        patrol      cars were      very muc h      in a b u n da nc e

a nd senior        officers     were     returning       to the    ground.        POL PC Musk asked

them    if our       presence was        required as we had NO RA DI OS - Onl y Ser ge an ts

and above         had them.        We were       told to    remain where we were.                 Some

■Fans came out of the ground and                   remarked that a pitch invasion was                     in

progress.           These were Notts.            Forest    supporters.           Over    the next 20

m in ut e s    or so a mb ul a n c e s   and fire engines a r r i v e d on Pen is to ne Rd and

after       several    beat    cars arrived,        some    from A Division,            we began to ask

them q u estions as to what               had happened.            We got the      impr es si on that

there was         trouble w it h i n the ground and a m e s sa ge               had been sent          out to

get    e ve ry a v a i la bl e m an to the ground.                This   had been done so q u i ck l y

that    there was a distinct              smell    of burning       clutches      from the      cars.           I

looked back         up the     road to see my        colleague G ra h a m P a t t e r s o n and

several        other   officers waiting around.

didn't     have much of an           idea.        Res id en ts    came out of the houses                 and

were     stood    looking      rather     shocked.          I went       to one   lady and all           she

could tell me was             that   it was      terrible and these were               people dead,            but

she didn't        fill    in any details.



I return ed to the            barriers and w a tc he d the Liverpool                 fans    spill       back

out onto Leppi ng s Lane.                 Many    initially were            very distressed,         tears

were fre ely flowing and there was a great                           deal   of a gg re s s i o n   being

s hown towards        the Police.



I remain ed behind the barriers                   oblivious        to what was happening and

tried my best         to soak        in what     had h ap pe ne d     in the football          ground.

Ambulances        were trying         to get up Leppings             Ln being     led in turn by

either a Police m ot or c y c l e          or a traffic           car.       The fans were         not

prepared to move              to one side to         let the e m e r ge nc y services          through.

As more        fans   came onto       the street we were met with fans who were

e x c e p t i o n a l l y a gg re s s i v e and were    calling      us from fucking         bastards          to

cunts and a ny th in g          linked.        Our     so   called    incompetence and all               we

were     doing was       standing a ro u n d while           their    friends     lay dead an d we

didn't     care.         Of    course we did         care   but    they knew more         than we did.

A   lot more.



W h e n there were        so many      people on the          streets we were getting a lot of

a ggro    from the       residents      to stop them          coming       from Leppings Ln end               into

F i el di ng    Rd.      As more      protests were a im ed           personally at me and

insults        several    fans   spat     in our general          direction.           Insults and

a b us e were     c onstantly hurled at us and whe n threats were a d m i n i s t e r e d

I really felt         threatened.            We were alone,           no    radios   to   call     for

help,     nowhere     to go or hide and              I felt    frightened,        so muc h so       I had

               wi th ou t    notice.             I feared for my safety so much as we were so

               helpless.              I remember             seeing a sergeant who             I don't know stood            in

               front       of me.           He was          trying       to   calm the a rea down as we tried to

               a l l o w Doctors,           nurses and fire                   personnel    into Fielding Rd        in order        to

               keep L e pp in gs Ln open for the em er ge nc y services.                                  While    I m o v e d the

               ba rr ie rs      out the L iverpool               fans          did nothing    to help only jost l ed and

               in su lt ed us as well                  as    push the sergeant away.

               a mbulance.             Eventually             I got through and about 20 minutes                    later an

               a m b u l a n c e a t t e n d e d and took            the man who          I only know as

               from Ha li fa x a w a y to Hospital                        who was still       in deep shock.              He had

               rung       home to say he was                  fine and after           ringing      off went    into an

               ep il e pt i c       fit.       I o b ta in ed a t el ephone               number   from him and       said    I

               w o u l d try a nd          ring home for him.'



               We then went            back      into L e ppings Ln to find our serial                       and enquire what

               we       could do,      if anything.                  We       came across S er geant Mosley and

               inf or me d him that we had some                           property w h ic h was handed to us

               p e rs o n a l l y    in the day to hand to                      central    control.



               We then went            into the ground still                      not aware    of what      had occurred.

               P r o p e r t y was     h an de d to a sergeant and we then                         looked for a telephone.

               I remember            looking          t hr ou g h the         passageways    under the North S t a n d and

               seeing       debris         s c a t t e r e d on the floor.

I pro ce ed ed towards          the gy mn as iu m       in order   to find a phone and once

inside         I was met   by a mass      of     people      standing around.           As   I w al k e d

t h r ou g h    I was aware     of bags     of    clothes and d ir ectly behind              I saw one

body on the floor a p p a r e n t l y          being searched.            C u r i os it y got    the

better         of me and   I noticed      rows of dead bodies with no real                      outside

injuries.            I w asn't aware      that     they were dead at this time.                    I just

remember         feeling   numb.        I event ua ll y found a phone and tried to get

an o utside         line to no avail.             As    I hung   the   phone up a p o l i c ew om an         in

the    police       room went    hyusterical           and   I knew something was wrong                but

what     I didn't      know.         I proceeded w ith POL PC P a t t er so n to Clay wh ee ls

Ln w here        I a w a it ed the    rest of our serial.              Eventually       retiring        from

duty at 6. 4 5 p m       (1845).        On my way back           to the   car    I remember       seeing a

h e l i co p te r   h overing   over    the ground.            Once alone       in my   car and

tr av el l in g     back home    I remember        listening       to Radio Hal lam.

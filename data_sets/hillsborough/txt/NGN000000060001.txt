     Thank you for a most moving and human document. Your plea
     is heard. Rest assured that The Sun will not fail to
     respond in the way that is required.

     May your anguish and sadness soon be helped by happier

                                                               Liverpool.
Dear Mr, Donlan,                                         __________________
                          i'hank you very much for your prompt reply to my letter concerning
Hillsborough and the Sun Newspapers coverage of the event.                     However, I would
be grateful if you could answer the following questions for me, this would be
greatly appreciated.
            1).     In your letter to me, (dated 10-8-89), you write, quote,'Your plea
                    is heard. Rest assured that the Sun will not fail to respond in the
                    way that is required.'            Wliat -exactly does that mean, do you intend
                    to print the Heal TruthV             Do you intend to admit to the rest of
                    the Country that the allergations where untrue and it was a mistake
                    to print them, in fist place?            Do you intend to undo the damage you
                    have done and give the people of Liverpool back their pride?


            2).     Has the sale of the Sun fell in Liverpool since these allegations
                    were made,           and do you realise that by admitting the stories should
                    never have been printed under the headings they were, many people,
                    including myself would reame buying the Sun?


            3).     Do you, personally, feel that these stories, and that is what they
                    are, stories, should not have been reported in the way it was? And do
                    you realise the amount of pain your stories added to those already
                    suffering pain?


 I sincerely hope youi will look further into this matter.                    I still believe the bun
 Newspaper to be one of the finest and most entertaining around,                     and assure you
 that only pride in my City and in respect to our freinds that have died                     keep
 me from purchasing the above named publication.

                                        Please help me and other citizens of this Wonderful City
 hold our haeds high, and help us regain our pride, and our good name.

                                                 Yours Sincerely,

                                        Hoping- to hear your comments soon,

Liverpool


Dear Mr.

I regret the delay in replying to your August 11
letter. I have been out of the office for a longer
period than usual.

In. reply to the three points raised by you, I want to
stress that although The Sun has fully corrected the
erroneous material published in the aftermath of
Hillsborough. A full and sincere retraction was also
made by the Editor on radio and TV. The mistake was
admitted. How we undo the damage which you point out
then that is harder for a newspaper to answer. All
that is feasible and any reasonable suggestions will be
considered by the newspaper. A dialogue of this kind
with people like yourself is very helpfui*.
As regards my personal feelings over this dreadful
chapter, then I can only express my sorrow for the harm
that was done to all concerned. As a Mancunian who has
happy memories of Merseyside, then I believe the hurt I
felt was sincere and heartfelt. May I say that your
sentiments are a shining example to us all.

Yours sincerely,




Kenneth Donlan

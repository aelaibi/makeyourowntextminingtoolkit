FA/HILLSBOROUGH   i

I spoke to           fringing in connection with Mr Kelly's
letter to me for information containing a letter from
Mr Whalley to Kelly.   Lord Justice Taylor was obviously
asking some very wide-ranging questions. For.instance how
could transfer fees be justified? Should football be run by
one body? How is safety    going to  be funded in future?

 I confirmed I had not received Kelly's holding response
which was the pro f o r m a w i l l  be replying to in due course.'
 I said the way I thought      would be the best to deal with this
would be to immediately tell Lord Justice Taylor that
meetings would have to be convened with the Football League
and perhaps in particular those members who sat on the
committee which produced the wider issues document to come
up with some answers.    One could not answer easily on paper.
Therefore Mr Kelly ought to write back to Whalley and say
that the FA were considering the points with committee
members and when answers had been agreed upon perhaps the
way forward would be to set up a meeting with Lord Justice
Taylor to discuss the responses with him. We did not want
to give the impression that a short documented reply would
be coming back quickly. Once the letter had gone out the
necessary meetings and thinking would have to sjtart. Of
course the joint body point was extremely polidbally
sensitive and may be difficult to resolve.      If that were the
case they would just have to tell the judge what the
position was.       thanked me for the advice and said she
was seeing Kelly this morning and would let me know what he
thought.

know where to park so we drove ar o u n d until we saw some                                     cars      parked on

an a rea of ground,             it w a s n ’t an official             car park,       just a place              to

park,    it was the other side               of the town             centre    from the ground.                 We

h a d n ’t been directed by Police,                 and    I c a n ’t recall          seeing any doing

traffic       control.

We found some friends,               other Liverpool             fans,     at a pub on route                to the

ground,       we were wit h them for about                 fifteen minutes,                a l t h o u g h we

d i d n ’t have a drink.            I noticed other           fans      inside       the     pub.      We then

left and walked to the ground,                    the three of us wa l k e d through

H i l l s b o r o u g h Park and had a can of cocacola.                       We a r r i v e d at the

turnstiles at about 2pm.                  During     our walk          from the       car to the ground                 I

had not seen any disorder                 or d r u n k e n e s s .

On a r r iving at the t urnstiles               I could see that there were                         people

arriving       to go    in but      it w a s n ’t too      crowded.           The   girls       had seating

tickets and        I had a standing            ticket.        We      could see w hich t u rnstiles                  to

use so at that          point we       split    up and       I entered the            ground through the

terraces       turnsti 1 e s y ^ s u r r e n d e r e d    my ticket and             retained the stub.

There was a Ro l^Te horse               to the      left of the blue gates,                     and P o l i c e m e n

        i ng for,       I noticed other Police                officers         on the ground side of

 he turnstiles.               I d o n ’t recall     seeing any stewards a n y where                       in the

nor   did     I see^anybody         climbing      in over        turnstiles          or other walls.

I bought a / pr og ra m and then entered the terraces.                                I c o u l d n ’t see any

signs   dj^ecting me to the terraces,                      but       1 could see that the general

flow of the entering               crowd w a y g o i n g    through a tunnel                so I. joined them

nothing       impeeded my        progress,      other      people were walking                  through but

I had    plenty of space and on entering                      the      terraces       I could see that

they w e r e n ’t too full.               I seem to remember a\sst>rt?ard at or near                   to the

end of th               >1.        The    crowd seemed good natured and                in a good mood,

there were       no fights          or a n y thing    or drunks       that    I saw.     I do    remember

that a fan had          climbed onto          the dividing       fence       between Pen 3 and Pen

4, at     the top by the tunnel,               and he was       told to get down by a

P o l i c e m a n standing above me           in the West S tand seating area.

                                                                                       t the    front of

P « f 3 behi nd thexjoal,                at a point    I have    indicated on the grid as

                                                                                       tarted to       read

my    program.      I h a d n ’t seen anyb o d y drinking alcohol                 and at that          time

there was       no crush,          e ve ry b o d y around me was       still    in good spirits and

good     natured.

J. was    reading my      program and was aware                that    some    players were       on the

                               The       crowd around me was          increasing w hen s u d denly at

abou                               reason that       I saw,    there were a couple of heavy

surges       from the    crowd behind me.              I was    forced forward up

agai n s t    the fence at the front,                dividing    the terraces          from the    pitch.

The    pressure of the             crowd,    which was    like the       pressure       I would expect

in the m iddle       of a game eased slightly,                  and by putting my hands                onto

the fence       I was able          to force myself       back slightly,          and    I m oved to the

left     slightly    closer         to the fence       dividing Pen 3 from Pen 4.

S u d d en ly the   pressure         of people       behind me    increased d r a m a t i c a l l y and        I

was    forced forwards             up against    the fence,       to the       position    I. have

ma r k e d as £ in grid squaj^T H8.                  I put my arms       out straight and took

hold of the fence             to    push back but the          pressure       behind was       such that

my arms       started to give way so I folded my arms apd                         put my elbows

aga          ,he fence,       but even       like this    I was       fyrced up against          the

fen          was aware        of a small       child,    I think       it was a boy,       who was

trap p e d    in front    of me.           I had to keep       constant       pressure    on the       fence

to a llow him enough space to breath.                         I was    unable    to move       in any way

     or    even    look down to see                if he was alright.                 A chap by my side was

     trying       to get out          by    climbing       the fence         to get       onto    the     pitch.      I

     m a n a g e d to grab his             trouser    belt with my            right       hand and        I lifted him

     as    far as      I could,        then he got          his foot         on my      right     leg,    w h i c h was

     jammed at a bit of an angle                      and he m a n a g e d         to get over,           I thought        it

     m ig h t make a bit of space,                   but his        place was          immedi a t e l y    taken and the

     pressure        d i d n ’t d e c rease at all.              ^At about         this    time    I was aware            of

     the    game     starting,         and saw Jfe'fte people were                 s t a rting    to    come over         our

     heads,       over       the    fence    amto the       pitch-         I could also           hear     people ar o u n d
<0
     me    scr e a m i n g    for    help and shouting              that     'People are          dying       in here"         and

     'Open the gate.'                 At    that    time    the Police were               telling       the escaping

     fans     to get         back,    although       they     possibly didn't              know what was

     happening.

     It was       obvious          to me from the          onset      that    som e t h i n g    had gone wrong,               the

     pressure        on me was            unlike a n y thing        I had ever /experienced.                    I had

     t raiib 1 e breathing , I had the                   boys head         pressi ng on my stornach, and

     people       pressing          on my back and sides,                it was        so bad that         I was     unable

     to    cont ro 1 my bowe 1 s a n d suf f ered a bowe 1 m o v e m e n t , whi ch a dded to my

     g e n e ra 1 d i s c:o m f a r t .

     I was      stuck        like this       for about        thirty minutes,              although        it could have

     been     longer,         it was       d i fficult     to assess         the      passage     of time.          It was a

     case     of hanging            on and trying          to keep s u f f i c i e n t      space       for   the    boy       in

     front      of me to breath.               Up until          I got a way          1 could feel         him moving

     and    know that he was                still    alive.

     E v e n t u a l l y the       pressure     s u d d en ly eased,         and      I was able to back away.

     I felt       sick and dizzy and                had no feeling            in the       lower       part   of my       left

     arm w hi ch had been up aga i n s t                   the    fence and my            ribs were aching            from

     the    pressure.

     I ^ot      my breath           back and s ta r t e d to make my way up the                         terraces

     towards       the       tunnel.        I was aware          of s o m e b o d y    lying     on the terrace
floor       to my       left w ith other            people       standing       round.     I made my way

thro u g h    the       tunnel       and no ti c e d      that    there    didn't       seem to be all          that

many       people about.              1 came out of the              tunnel      and    could see a lot of

fans       milling       about,       most    of them        crying.       I went       through open gates             to

my    right       into       the area       behind the West S t a n d turnstiles.                      1 saw a

g ro up of about              four    stewards?          and what a p p e a r e d      to be an       injured fan

be i ng     comfo r t ed by a P o l ic e w o m a n .

I didn't          know where          to go so       I     stood by the         stewards.        I heard one        say

'Take       the y e ll ow jackets             off    they might          get    nasty.'        One of them a s k e d

me    if    I was alri g h t          and    I said        I wasn't too         bad but    that there          looked

to be more          injured          inside.        He     said    ’I d o n ’t know how to handle

s om et h i n g    like       this.      I t ’s the       last    game    I ’ll steward at."               He then

w a l k e d off.         I went       towards       the N or t h S tand         intending       to    locate

                  but    there were          so man y       people      in the    stand    it w o u l d have        been

impossible,             so    I went     back and         left the g r o u n d via an exit              gate    by the

t e r ra c e s t u r nstiles.            I n t he a r e a by t h e blue           gate    I saw a n amb u 1a n c.e

and a body          lying       on the       ground       covered by a blanket,                near   to    it was a

P o l i c e m a n who was        crying.        I noticed a g roup of P o l i c e m e n standing                     on

the    pavement at the                river    bridge,        one a s k e d me      if I was alri g h t and

then       told me to stand              the other         side    of the       road,    p r esumably to keep

the e n t rance          clear.        At    this    time my back          s t a r t e d hurting and my            left

s h o ulder       star t e d to hurt,          to the extent             that    I supported my            left arm

w i t h my    right.

I s ta r t e d to make my way                 back to the          car,    I went       through the         park and

s t op p e d for a few m in u t e s            to try to          compose myself,          I was      very upset,

a nd a man,         anot h e r L iv er p o o l       fan.        Came    to me and helped me until                 his

two    sons       came to him.              I carried on to the                car and met                 , but

              h a d n ’t got         back,    they were          in d i fferent        parts    of the      same

stand.        We w ai t e d for a bit,               then w a l k e d     part way       back to the ground

and    then back             to the    car and found                           who was    very upset.

During the time of the game                     I d i d n ’t notice anything         I w ould   class as

c r im i na 1 .

Looking       back    I thought the gates onto                    the   pitch were   far   too small     and

I was a st o n i s h e d that        there was        no way of getting         the fences      down

quickly*          to ease    the    pressure.         Also    I was     s u rprised by the apparent

lack    of training          for   the ^ ^ a r d s , they didn't             seem to know first aid,

or what       to do.

Ha v i n g   seen    it on TV there were o b viously other                    def f i c i enures but from

my own experiences             I c a n ’t comment on them.               I did attend the m atch in
                                                                         -------- <7^---- -------------
1988 and haven't             really noticed any

differences          in Policing,           the major      difference was       that   last year       there

weren't any          road works          on the m o t o r w a y    causing   hold-ups.

I think       that    the game       should have been delayed,                because of the amount

of    people       still    trying       to get    in at 3pm.

                1 must     have        been there              for about         half an hour and                 1    could not move.

                My ar m went           dead during               this     time    from the           elbow downwards,,                   I can

                w o u l d ease     the      pressure           on me.        Eventually            the     crowd did           start       to thin

                out     behind me so              I    pushed        Back    into      the    gap and m a n a g e d           to event u a l l y

  a p p a r e n t l y were      the gates          that    had been opened               to   let the      crowd       in.

• T h e y were      b i g , double         gates,,        As    I came       out    I saw bodies          covered       over

  with      blankets,           They were          obviously          dead    people       there.

  half an hour            later w a l k i n g       towards       the    car,,       It was at       that       point    that

  X was      just     g s11 i ng some         feeling          back    i nt o my a r m „       I decided         not    to

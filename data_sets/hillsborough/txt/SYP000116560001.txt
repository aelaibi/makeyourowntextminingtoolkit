From     first        taking      up the    point,       n o t i c e d that    there was a l r e a d y a

s t e a d y flow of s pe c t a t o r s       entering L e p p i n g s Lane from this                 roundabout

and heading            towards      the g r o u n d .     There were,          throughout      the time at

this     point a large             number    of supp o r t e r s a s k i n g other         supp o r t e r s    if

they had any spare                 tickets.        A large number of Liverpool                   supporters

e n q u i r e d about a pub near to the seven arches where                              they had been

t old    to meet         to    purchase     spare    tickets        for the match.

We were also a sk ed               by a great       number      of s upporters         of all      age    groups

where      the nearest            "pub" was     that was        open.         They were all        a d v i s e d that

to the best            of our      knowledge all          public     houses      in the area were

closed.         A great         number     of s upporters were            carrying 4 packs with

them.        The m a j o r i t y    of the     people       carrying 4 packs a n d asking                 for

d irec t i o n s      to the      public    houses were all            in groups of 5 to ten                  people.

T hr o u g h o u t    the     tour at L e p pings Lane R o u n d a b o u t         there was       no

a g g r e s s i o n s hown by the s u pporters who a p p e a r e d                 to be    in good spirits

and     looking        forward       to the g a m e .       It was     noticed that         from about

1.30pm a grow i n g             number     of the       persons w i t h 4 packs were             seated on

w alls     in L e p p i n g s Lane        close to the j u n c t i o n with Peni stone

Road.       There a p p e a r e d to be no problems                   w i t h these as        there were a

number       of officers           in the v i c inity w i t h them,             and also a highly

visible       presence          of officers        in the area.

The a t t itude          of the supporters           towards        us was      very jovial        in fact

comments were               passed to the effect             that    they were       not used to Police

officer s       (Bizsys)         smiling and talking              to them.

During      the       tour at L e p pings Lane R o u n d about,               whilst    there      had been

continual            flow of spect a t o r s       both towards         the Liverpool          side      of the

g round and Notts.               Forest     end,    as    far as     I am aware        there were         no

problems w ith              control    of the      crowd and        no a g g r e s s i o n shown towards

the Police            or opposing         supporters.

P e a r s o n and    Inpector Mill ett               began to stop traffic                    from entering

L e p p i n g s Lane      from the        roundabout.

At 2 . 4 0 pm the         same     date m y s e 1f and PC 2 7 3 5 Wade                  relieved the 2

offic e r s and         s to p p e d all    traffic         from e n t ering L e p p i n g s L a n e , to the

annoyance          of m a n y m otorists.              Inspector tiillett had                  informed us that

there was          problems at the L e p p i n g s Lane                   entrance        to the gr o u n d and

that due to the             large     volume         of s p e c t a t o r s    in L e p p i n g s Lane      no

v e h icles       could get        through.          Serv i c e      buses were a d v i s e d of the

s i t u a t i o n and     they took a lt er n a t i v e           routes.         To the best          of my

kno w l e d g e    the youths        who had been sat on the walls wit h their 4 packs

must have          set off towards              the ground after               I took up traf f i c           control

at   the    end of L e p p i n g s L a n e .

3.00pm        The a r e a see m e d d e s erted of suppo r t e r s                    so we began to walk                to

our P hase 2 position.

As    I approached           the    ground there a p p e a r e d to be a large                        number      of

s uppo r t e r s    w a l k in g a way from the gr o u n d                towards L e p p i n g s Lane

Roundabout.

A    lot of       local     residents were             compla i n i n g about           the     problems      caused

by the      large       number      of supporters             that had been there and the                        large

a mount     of     cans a n d fish and             chip w r a p p e r s       thrown      into their        gardens.

Upo n   re aching         the L e p ping s Lane           entrance         I was      informed that           there

had been trouble              inside       the ground an d that with other                          serials,       had

to   cordon off           the Leppi n g s        Lane     entrance         to the ground.              At   this time

there were a large                 number       of s u p p o r t e r s    leaving       the ground and

walking       up towards L e p p in gs Lane Rounda b o u t ,                      they were         v i s i b l y shaken

and upset and             some were        shouting abuse                to Police        officers.         Virtually

i m m e d i a t e l y our   serial        was    called       into       the ground to the             rear      of the

I i m m e d i a t e l y saw medical             staff    giving a t t e n t i o n to a boy           in the         rear

of an a m b u l a n c e .        The re were a large           number       of    injured       persons

sca t t e r e d a bout       this are a with P o l i c e           offi ce rs and        civilians

administering           first aid.              The area was        in total        confus i on as other

s u pporters         were    cons t a n t l y    running about         carrying        c a sualties and

sea r c h i n g    for friends and              relatives.         I was    i nstructed to           c 1 ear a way

for a m b u l an ce s       to get    through.          A l o n g w i t h other      officers       the       centre

part    of this a r e a was            cleared to a l l o w access               for a m b u l a n c e s .     X was

then told to s tand w i th other                     o f f icers    forming a cordon a round a

number      of bodies         lay on the floor at              the     perimeter w a 11.            At       this

time    I had no         idea at all what               had happened,        all     orders were given

v e r b a l l y as    the    radios were still             unreadable.            The r e we re a large

amount      of s ho ck ed        civilians w al k i n g about             in the area,          there were

also a large a m o u nt            of spectators           s h o uting abuse          d i r e c t e d towards        the

police      officers and a m bulance                 staff    trying       to give       first     aid and also

towards       the fire        service officers who had arrived.

An   in s t r u c t i o n was     given to clear e v e r y o n e           from that area,            and the

m a j o r i t y of the youths were e s c o r t e d out                 of the L e p p i n g s Lane

entrance,          these     leaving      under      protest.         It was quite          obvious       that an

incident          of a p ar ti cu la rl y serious            nature       had occur r e d and         it was

noted that a lot of the officers                          there     let a lot of the youths                    leave

the are a that w o u l d have               been a r r e s t e d    for    public      order     offences

go   back to their            respective          t r ansport and do head counts                   to asc e r t a i n

if any of their              party were missing.               The m a j o r i t y of the          people       I

           O nce     the s tand was        cleared along w i t h PC Wade       I went      into    the seating

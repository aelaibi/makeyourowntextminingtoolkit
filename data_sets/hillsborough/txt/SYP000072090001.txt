             I am a married man living at the above address.

             On Saturday 15th April      1989,    I went to Sheffield Wednesday Football

             ground at Hillsborough,      where I work part time as a turnstile op er ato r.

             I have worked for the club in this capacity for the past 12 months.

             My hours of duty on this day were 11.30am to approximately 3.20pm when

             the turnstiles were closed.

             On the 15th April      1989 I was detailed to work in the Spion H o p , on I

             think it was                     but I can't be sure.

             The Spion Hop on this day had been allotted to the Nottingham Forest

             Supporters as it was an all ticket match.

             At about      1215pm the same day I took up my position at the t urn st i1e

             and I opened it as soon as I got there.            As there was a police officer

             on every turnst ile , I asked the officer on my turnstile         if he
                                                                                                      PAGE         2
                                                                                                      SI 635

                             was going to stop there until 3pm, and he said that he was.Having

                             opened the turnstile    fans started to come through at a steady flow.

                             During the course of    the next 3 hours I would estimate       that about   1000

                             people came through my turnstile alone. Out of those people,          I would

                             say that about 2 dozen of them smelled strongly of alcohol although I

                             never saw any of them drinking.     I was under the impression that the

                             Police Officers on the turnstiles were supposed to search every person

                             that   came to the ground however the one on my turnstile only searched

                             the ones that looked suspect.

                             On one occassion pne    fan came to my turnstile    without a ticket and

                             when I asked him for    his ticket he d i d n ’t say anything   but drew a

                             knife from a pocket in his coat and pointed it menacingly at me. This

                             took me totally by surprise and I suppose it scared me to an extent.              I

                    ^        d o n ’t know why I did it but I just pressed the pedal that opens the

                             turnstile and he ran through into the ground.

K           g       * *      Under normal circumstances    I would have reported this but with the

                             amount of people crowding up to get in and the events of the day,            it

\LrtL                   a    just went out of mind.    I feel that if an officer had been on the
vtZ.. *                  J
                        ^    inside of the ground searching a nd not on the outside he would have

                             obviously seen him.

                             Nothing else significant happened after that until about 3.05pm when I

                             heard the tannoy and someone saying "Will every body clear the pitch"

                             I thought that people were fighting,      it was at this point that about

                             15 police officers    came down from the Kop and told us to shut the

                             .doors, I told him that I had still got people queueing but he said,
I       W
                             "I d o n ’t care just shut it." I did this and as soon as I did the fans
    5       C
                             who were still outside started kicking the doors. A short time later

                             I noticed the large consatina gate which is situated to the right of

        ^                    my turnstile was open and about     150 supporters    charged in.   I c a n ’t say

^               '            whether they had kicked the gate open or whether someone had opened it
                                                                             PAGE       3
                                                                             S 16 3 5

for them.

After that I locked my stile up counted my tickets and took them to

the office.

I then went to watch the match from a gangway in the middle of the

south stand.   It was at this point     that I   saw that there were hundreds

of people on the pitch,     I could see fans     climbing over the fences

behind the goal of the West stand.

I could also see people being carried away on the advertising

hoardings and stretchers,     however I c a n’t say whether they were

injured or dead and basically,       I couldn’t believe what     I was seeing.

At about 4pm I met up with my father, who also works at the ground in

the south stand and we walked out into the car park which leads onto

Leppings Lane.     It was then that we saw about 20 bodies      lying next        to

the fence near the river, we could also see that         there were a        lot of

people being treated by Ambulance       men, and St J o h n ’s men and   Police

officers for various     injuries.

The people lying by the fence all had coats over there faces and were

obviously dead.

We then walked out of car park and to where I had parked my car in

Bi ckerton Road.

While we were walking towards my car I could hear a lot of people

verbally abusing the police officers standing at the side of the road,

but the police did not retaliate at all.

We then got in my car and drove home.

Whilst walking to my car and hearing the abuse being given to the

police,   I got the impression the fans were blaming them for the

disaster.

I would also like to say that I have never received any first aid

training from the club.

I would not recognise the youth who threatened me and I don't want the
                                                                               PAGE      4

         police to persue the matter,

         I was shown a map of the ground by                   and I marked where I was

         standing with an X (marked            )   (Ex. No,       )

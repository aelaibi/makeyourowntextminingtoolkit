               I. l iv e     at     the    above          address.       On S a t u r d a y         15th      April       1989       I left          rny

               home       address         at    about       11.3 0 a m , and           caught          a G L       I ravel     Coach       which             was

               to     take    us     to    the F A         Cup    Semi       Final      between          Liverpool           and Nottingham

               Forest        Football           c l ub s    which       was      being       held        at    the     Sheffield Wednesday

              Football            c l u b at       the     Hillsborough               football           ground.

               The       coach      journey          was    uneventful            with       the       exception          of a d e l a y         at

              Stockport             due    to R o a d       works       being         carried          out.    The      coach arrived                   at

              Sheffield             at a b o u t      1.45pm       on     the     same       day,        the       coach parked where                    all

               th e      other      coaches          were    parked.          I am      not       aware       of    the    name.

              0 n g & 11ing          off       the    coach                             and                                went       into       a      pub

              which        I believe           was        called       the    Plough         or     something           similar        it w o u l d           be

              about        2.10pm         t ha t     we    went    into       the      pub.       We    had    three       p in t s    each          before

               leaving        the      pub      to    make       our    way      to    the    football             ground.       We    got       there

about         2.40pm         outside           th e      Leppng          Lane       entrance.                It wa s         at    this        point

that      1 met          a man          whom       I know          as    Vincent             F i tss immafrf. I h a v e                   known         hi m

for     about        four          months          and    his       nickname                is Victffey. I. s t o p p e d                 to      talk       to

Vincent         for       about          five       minutes             and    discussed                the       forthcoming                match.          He

appeared            to    be       by    himself,             and       he    had a          ticket          to     get      into       the

terraces,            I carried                on    towards             the    entrance                of    the       football           ground          he

remained            where          he    was       I didn't             see    Vincent             Fitzsimmons                  after        that.

There         was    at      this        point          a very          lar ge      crowd          outside             the      Leppings            Lane

entrance            to    the       ground          there          w a s n ’t a n y          queues          I made          my w a y        towards

t he    turnstiles                 in    the       crowd.          Just       before             the    turnstile               t h ere      was       the

small         blue       gates          they       opened          just       as    I got          there          and      I entered              the

ground         that       way.          There       was       a    surge       through             this          gate      and     there          was     no

way     I could           prevent             myself          from       being          pushed          through            this        gate       which

nad     opened.           I didn't             see       who       opened          this          gate       having         gone        through          the

gate      the       large          blue       gate       was       also       open          and    I went           through            that       I would

estimate            t ha t     o ve r     a    thousand             fans       c am e        through             the      ga te s .     Once        I had

got     through           the       big       gate       1 was          able       to       gain       control            and     infact

purchased            two       programmes.                I made             my way          then       to       the      stairway           to     the

stand         showed         the        steward          my       ticket       and          he    let       me    in a n d        I made          my way

to     th e    seat       I was          allocated.

and     there        was       a     s'srge        of    the       crowd       in       the       terraces             to m y      left.          It wa s

then     that        I saw          people          trying          to       climb          out    of       the     terraces           and        up    into

couldn't            understand                what       was       going       on.

It w a s       shortly             after       this       that          I saw       people             being        carried            out     of      the

terraces            and      they a p p e a r ed              to    be       dead.          At    about          3.45pm         I left         the

g round.

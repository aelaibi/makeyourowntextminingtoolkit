           I am a Police Constable          in tmr S Yorkshire Police Force presently

           s tat ioned'at^Hexbo rough in the Doncaster Division,



           On Saturday 15th April,          1989 (150489),    I was on duty in company with a

           number of other Officers          involved in football duties at the Semi final

           match to be played at the Hillsborough Stadium between Liverpool FC

           and Nottingham Forest FC.



           I was attached to Serial 32 along with si:< other Officers under the

           supervision of A PS2895 Thomas.



           At 10 am       (1000 h r s ) I attended a briefing held in the North Stand at

           Hillsborough along with all the other Officers                involved in duties that
                                                                         PAGE        5
                                                                         S31S1

day.        This briefing ended afequt 10.50 am <1050 hrs) and after a word
                               n. \      *3-2*
from our Serial 'S^mmander, Inspector Mi 11e t t , we were directed to our
                  \ \    -AJ3                                x
positions along Peni>sXone Rd N / Halifax Rd situate in c l o s \ prox imi ty

to the Gate Public House.        At this time I was in company with PC 1968

Tamms.



Upon arriving at my position at 11 am (1100 hrs)         it became obvious to

me that the area was quite busy for the time of day and I was

surprised at the number of Liverpool supporters walking          passed me up

Halifax Rd in the opposite direction of the Hillsborough ground.

During this time I received numerous enquiries as to the location of

the nearest Public House or off licence,       I answered these queries by

directing these supporters towards the two Public Houses at the top of

Halifax Rd ie The New Bridge       Inn and the Railway Inn.



At 12.30 pm (1230 \ r s ) myself and PC 1968 Tamms were joined at our

location by PC3087 Keenan.        At this time the atmosphere was good and a

number of supporters stopped to chat to myself and the other Officers.


       \\
At 1 . 5 \ pm (1355 h r s ) a t rai n was seen arriving M t Wads ley Bridge

Railway station and it soon became apparent that this train was

carrying Liverpool supporters,       the majority of whom were escorted down

Halifax Rd by mounted Officers,       these supporters were generally well

behaved and jovial although a large number of them,         I would estimate     1

in 5 were carrying\and consuming some form of alcoholic beverage.



About 2.30 pm (1430 h r s )\/e we,re joined at our location by another

serial and by Inspector TownW>d.        It was around this time that the

area became very busy with vast numbers of supporters walking down

Halifax Rd,       having either just arrived at Wadsley Bridge or returning
                                                                                    PAGE         3
                                                                                    S31S1

from the public houses                in this area.     The pavements were now just a

sea of people,       the majority of whom were young males.                At this time we

were instructed to carry out checks of these persons and to prevent

anyone from progressing any further along Halifax Rd with any alcohol,

this was done by asking these supporters to either drink their beer at

this   loction or to leave their cans,                 bottles etc on the surround wall

of the car park belonging to the Gate Public House,                     this they did with

little or no complaint,                the majority elected to consume their alcohol

at that location.



                                              with other Officers   I attended              te
        FTT)      r e n u tfS n Q
                                          I    from a customer that "All Hell had broken

loose",   inside.        On arrival we found that the external doors were

locked and as no other means of entry could be found Officers forced

the front door open,                once inside the building it was clear that some

sort of disturbance had occurred,                   the floor around the pool table was

covered with broken glass and pieces of smashed pool cues.                       After

speaking to a regular customer it was ascertained that a fight had

broken out between rival supporters and that some Liverpool supporters

had tried to pull a man outside to try to enable the fight to

continue,      these supporters had failed to do this and had left the

premises prior to my arrival.                   As I was talking to this man other

Officers had spoken to the Landlord who had agreed to close the bar

down and to empty the premises as soon as possible.                      I then returned

along with other Officers to niy original                  position on Halifax Rd.



At 3.05 pm (1505 hrs)                I was instructed by A PS2S95 Thomas to return,

with the remainder of the Serial to Hillsborough,                     but whilst en route

a radio message was r e v i v e d that instructed all available Officers to

attend at the Leppings Ln erTiKgf jthe ground.                  On arrival   I noticed
                                                                            PAGE         4
                                                                            S31S1

that the area was virtually clear of football supporters and along
                                         \      ftA /N <5*^
with other Officers I was ordered to form a\oi\don across the entrance

and to then await further        instructions, whilst in this cordon an

ambulance arrived at the ground,        this ambulance was    immediately

directed to the small     lane    (that runs parallel with the river)       behind

the Leppings Ln stand.



At 3.15 pm <1515 hrs) a number of people could be seen milling around

inside the ground,    shortly after this     I was   instructed along with my

Serial and other Officers to enter the ground and give assistance.                  As

I tried to enter through the main gates        I had to move around,     and step

over    injured persons who had been removed from the terraces by other

supporters or Police Officers.



As iNlravelled towards the tunnel        that, leads onto the terraces      I saw a

tXis man I immediately checked to see if he w a sNja^e^thi n g , he w a s n ’t •

and n     mlse   could be felt at the carotid,       I then commg^ced artificial

reVftiiration while another Officer      performed external    chest

compression.     We continued this for about     10 minutes or so, but by

this time it was obvious that this particular man was

unfortunately beyond help.         I then covered his face with his jacket

and left the two other Officers       to move the body while I went through

the tunnel and onto the teraces, as I did so a supporter grabbed hold

of my arm and led me towards a young man who was weeping

uncontrollably,     after speaking to this man I ascertained that his

brother had just died in the tragedy.



I attempted to consol him and arranged for some nearby stewards to

             take care of him while     I offered my assistance elsewhere,       by this

             time the area behind the stands was a mass of supporters who were

             just wandering around,     some were attempting to help the injured

             although others seemed intent only on causing           problems for the Police

             Officers,   that is to say they were hurling threats and abuse at myself

             and other Officers as we attempted to remove the bodies of the dead

             and injured and one man in particular had to be physically restrained

             by other supporters to prevent him from attacking me,           this man was

             obviously drunk and he hadNlost all trace of self control.            Once
                                            \
             through the tunne lxI ass isted\g|,her Officers and supporters        in the

             removal of the b o d ies^ the bodies were carried through the tunnel and

             placed in a temporary moVtuary, which had been Nset up on th e Lane

             outside the stands.     I assisted in the removal ofNijpree bodies to

             this   location.

             this attempt failed and along with the other Officer and a couple of

             supporters we moved this man to the m o r t u a r y .   Once there I was

             ordered by an Inspector to make a makeshift barrier around the bodies

             to protect them from publie view.        Then along with other Officers        I

             joined a cordon that was formed to protect the eleven bodies that

             by this stage had been placed there.        I remained in this cordon for

             some time until    it became obvious that help was required inside.



             When I returned inside the majority of bodies had by then been

             removed although,    there were some still     remaining at the foot of

             the' terraces adjacent to the retaining wall.           These bodies were being

              removed by other Officers so I assisted the walking injured out to

             where the ambulances were waiting and then onto them.

      '   I remained in that area for the rest of the day helping the ambulance

          crews to load the stretchers onto the ambulances and from time to time

          offering   comfort to some of the injured.    By this time the supporters

          had started to leave the ground and a vast number were hurling threats

          and abuse at us,   calling us "Murdering bastards" and saying that w e ’ll

          pay for this.    I again joined the cordon around the mortuary and

          remained there until PC3087 Keenan came to me and told me to rejoin my

          Serial and then go around to the North Stand where at 6 pm <1800 hrs)

          we were stood down.

            Further to my previous statement         I can clarify the description of the

            bodies I mentioned.



            In particular the body I mentioned on page 4 paragraph 3 was already




            He had two uniform officers around him.           We commenced ^rti/icial

            resuscitation.        I would describe him as white 20-25 yea^s

            build,   light brown hai r .   He was clean s h a v e n .   He was        i ng blue

            jeans and a short sleeve Liverpool shirt.



            Next to him was another man who was injured and he was being te                       d
                                                                                                    PAGE     2
                                                                                                    S318 '1A
       t

                to by another fan,        I got the impression that this other fan knew both

                the injured and dead man I was with.                      In between the injured and dead

                man was a blue nylon short jacket and a Liverpool                     scarf.   I

                presumed the jacket belonged to tihe dead man and covered his facewith

+ 04            it.     I distinctly remember the dekd mam had a large gold
JX/i
          ■*“  wrist watch.  I c a n ’t recall tyhic? /'ist it was on but a few days
<3Q/s(Slfe££_ --------------
               later I saw a picture of this p a n in the daily MIRROR in their

                coverage of the disaster.               I could see that the picture showed the man

l£)                   Ve a      rows i5ack 'frorn the ffont of the terrace.               He had his arm

IX )       ID   up above the people       in front.           He was holding onto the fencing and I

                recognised his watch.
                 ujint

                      Page 5 I mention helping with three bodies.                   I can only recall the

                description of one ~ a white malel anout 25 years - medium build but

                with a slight     ’beer b e l l y ’ .      He hAd af-white buttoned up shirt with a

                collar that was undone.          He was clean shaven.              He had blue jeans and I

                think trainers although I c an’t recall the colour.



                When I first saw him, he was being lifted b y two other officers.

                They were having difficulty because of his weight.                      He was 4 or 5

                steps up from the front of Pen 3 near to the dividing fence between

                Pens 3 + 4 .     I remember that at this time there were a lot of bodies

                still on the terracing.          Myself and the other officer had to barge our

                way up the tunnel with the body and we placed him by the river

                together with the other dead.



                Also on page 5 paragraph 2 I mention assisting attempting to revive
 fc o p y s i

             Further to the statement        I made on 19 October              1989 (191089),   when I

             was shown a Photograph of Peter Ruben THOMPSON by Officers of the West

             Midlands Police,         I would like to clarify what I said by saying that I

             recognised him both from the facial               photograph and the clothing

             photograph.         On this occasion I did state that Mr THOMPSON was dressed

             all     in white,     I now realise that the clothing appeared white in the

             photograph but in fact he was dressed in a light coloured shirt and

             blue jeans as stated in my statement of 5.9.89                     (050989).

             Also     in my statement of 19.10.89 (191089)                I refer to two    casualties.

             One     I describe as having a slight beer b e l l y .             I can confirm that

             this is in fact Mr THOMPSON.

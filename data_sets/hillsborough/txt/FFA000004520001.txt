5, The final of the EA Cup Is played at Wanbley Stadiwn to
London.     3«mi Finals are played on neutral ground (ie on the
■ground o i a club not connected with either contestant). Tbs venue
is decided by the Cup Ccranitte© appointed by the Council mdar

involved,, and semi-finals are great occasions in the football fear
 *ith a great demand for tickets. She Cup Corroittee invites the
owners of grounds which it considers suitable for the staging of
such ;ibig!S matches to say whether they would be willing to
accept such a match on a date in that year, the staging club
dharging a percentage of -receipts as a fee. Over the last 20
•years the semi-final ties or replays have been played on the
psDunete set ait in Appendix 1.

10, The 1A Cup Rules (Rule 26) indicate that tickets should be
allocated 50/50 to each team subject to variation iy the 2&(it
is customaty for the M to hold back         sots tickets for the use
of the elub staging the match and for its own distribution to
MHribers or officials as a reward for service to tha gams much
o£ <which will have been -unpaid).   The purpose of tills is to
prevent m e team* supporters gaining a prspaidaranca of tickets
and thereby creating a Hhoms tie" atmosphere. Because o£ the
necessity of segregating the rival fans to prevent violence„ both
 Inside and on entrance. and egress   tothe ground, it has bacons
difficult to apply this rule. Inpractice, tha M. takes       advice
from the police cm proposed crowd managenent and tidteat allocation
follows the policing proposals.

course a fair point and       but for the advice crcm the polica it

following day,, the police view being known, Mr Hobinson again
telephoned Mr Clark to state that        Liverpool would be making their

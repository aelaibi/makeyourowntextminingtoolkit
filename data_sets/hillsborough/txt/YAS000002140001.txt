1.   I was born on 2nd March, 1950

2.   I am a Qualified Ambulanceman andmy base is                   Hoyland.        I

     joined SYMAS in approximately 1974 or 1975.                       My training

     involved   attending        a   basic     two   week    induction       course,

     followed   by    a   six   week    residential         training    course    at
     Markfield just outside Leicester.                 After completing this

     course   and    taking     an   examination,     I     became a     Qualified
     Ambulanceman.        Subsequently,        I have continued to attend

     residential      refresher      courses    at   Markfield     on    a    fairly
     regular basis.       I do not have any paramedic training.

3.   I was on duty on Saturday 15th April, 1989, between

     1000 and 1800 hours.       This is known as the          emergency shift.

      I   travelled    to work       from   home,    and     prior to    becoming

     involved with the Hillsborough incident,                 my day had been
     fairly routine, but with a few emergency call outs.

4.   I first became aware of the Hillsborough                 incident when my

     vehicle was on route to Barnsley District General Hospital
     with a patient on board.                I was attendant for the day,

     whilst my driver was                                                     and I

     heard on the vehicle radio that there was an incident taking
     place at Hillsborough, at which point in time I would say we

     were approximately five minutes away from Barnsley District
     General Hospital.

5.   When we arrived at Barnsley District General Hospital we
     heard on the vehicle radio that an ambulance was being sent
from Carlton        (the other    Barnsley    Station)     to    pick      up    a

medical      team   from     Barnsley    District      General    Hospital,
Casualty       Department,        for    transportation           down          to

Hillsborough.         As we were        already at Barnsley District

General,     I informed      Control    whether   we    could    be   of    any

assistance.         Control asked me whether a medical team was
standing by, at which point in time I went into casualty to
ask if the medical team was ready.             I was informed that the

team would be ready within a few minutes.                I then went back

out to                  , at which point in time the ambulance
crew from Carlton had arrived.            One of the crew,

     , told me that he had come to take a medical team down

to Hillsborough and that a Major Incident was taking place
at the ground.

The medical team were now ready to be transferred down to

the ground, and I helped load their equipment into

vehicle.      The medical team got into                   vehicle, and

I informed Control that the team was ready for transfer down
to Hillsborough.           I was advised by Control to go to the

Medical Centre at Hillsborough, which I presumed to be the
gymnasium.                   was not familiar with the location of

the gymnasium at Hillsborough,           and I received confirmation

from Control to escort                   vehicle to the gymnasium.

We approached the ground via Leppings Lane, and entered the

ground at the point marked A on the attached plan, whereupon

we   travelled      around    behind    the   South    Stand     along     the
perimeter road, out on to Penistone Road and joined a line
of ambulances waiting to enter the ground,                 presumably to
gain access to the gymnasium area.                               and I got

out of our vehicle,        helped     pick   up the equipment       in

         vehicle   and   ran   into    the   ground   at   the    entrance

marked   B on the attached plan.               I specifically       recall

seeing masses of people at this point in time, with quite a
number appearing to be hysterical or in a trance.

On entering the ground,                        and I were met by an

Ambulance Officer who told us to go into the gymnasium.                  On
arrival at the gymnasium, I reported to Mr Alan Hopkins who

appeared to be in charge of the gymnasium,                 informing him

that we had with us a medical team from Barnsley District

General Hospital.        Mr Hopkins informed me that the medical

team were no longer required at that point in time.
             and I went back to our vehicle, along with the
medical team and                 At that time I was requested to
fetch all body bags       from a line of stationary ambulance

vehicles on Penistone Road.         After collecting all body bags
I took them into the gymnasium where I noticed a number of

fatalities laid on the floor in rows.                 Some people were

walking around the bodies,          presumably trying to identify

them.    Mr Hopkins instructed me to lay the body bags by the
side of each body,       and I was then requested to obtain as

many blankets as possible from the ambulances parked outside
the ground on Penistone Road.          I collected as many blankets

as possible and then went back to the gymnasium and laid two

blankets on each transparent body bag.           I was instructed to
      report back to                           , although I was unable to find

                       as he had left the scene.             I made enquiries as
      to the location of my vehicle and was advised by another

      ambulanceman that                          had teamed up with another
      colleague.

10.   I reported back to Mr Hopkins at the gymnasium,                    and I was

      requested to go back out to a point marked C on the attached
      plan,    where a number of          trolleys were       situate,   and when
      ambulance crews came in with a number of fatalities,                   I was

      to unload the bodies onto the trolleys and then back into

      the gymnasium.        I carried out this task and when I got back

      into the gymnasium with            the bodies      I took     them off     the

      various trolleys and laid them on the floor.
11.   As the     situation began to ease off,               all ambulance crews

      within     the   vicinity     of   the    gymnasium    were    requested   to
      congregate in the car park area.               It was during this point

      in time that                       returned into the ground with his

      vehicle.         After a short while,          David Jones ascertained

      which crews were on afternoon shifts etc.,                    and those who

      were on afternoon shifts were instructed to return to their

      Stations and resume normal duties.                               and I were
      advised that we were no            longer    required at the football

      ground, and we left the ground at approximately 1810 hours

      and returned to Hoyland.

Dated this             M   day of                1989.

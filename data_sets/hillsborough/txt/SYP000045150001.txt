           Dear Mr Jones
           COMPLAINT AGAINST ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE MR W JACKSON
           BY MR TREVOR HICKS
           I refer to your letter of 4 December confirming that you had received a
           complaint from Mr Hicks alleging that ACC Mr Jackson and Chief Superintendent
           Duckenfield colluded to present a false statement to the representatives of the
           various Clubs and Football Association and, by implication, to the Inquiry
           conducted by Lord Justice Taylor.
           The Police Authority at its meeting today decided to register a complaint and to
           ask your Chief Constable, Mr Geoffrey Dear, to carry out the investigation. I
           have already been in contact with Captain Noel Taylor of the Police Complaints
           Authority and it has been decided that he will supervise the investigation, he
           has also confirmed to me his Authority’s approval to the appointment of Mr
           Geoffrey Dear as investigating officer. Will you please formally confirm that
           Mr Dear will so act.

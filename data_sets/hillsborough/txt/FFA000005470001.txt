•rC                Dear Sits,
                  Hillsborough inquiry

                  We refer to our telephone conversation# this morning with your
                                                 frtnfarnlng               fh#        ptihl t a n t i on             at         tho          prelim inary
                   report.
                  Wo appreciate that The Football Association will be asked for
                  their comments on the terms of the report.       Clearly, The
                  Football Association will be mindful of the dangers of
                  providing hasty comments which, ultimately/ they would not
                  have done had detailed consideration been given to the terms
                  of the report. Further, and as they already appreciate, your
                  clients should not make any comment which could, in any
                  circumstances, be seen to prejudice their position in relation
                  to the third party claims.
                 We recognise that both your clients and yourselv«« have these
                 points in mind but we felt it appropriate, in view of the
                 press coverage which the publication of the report will no
                 doubt receive, to raise them with you.
                 Yours faithfully,




                                                                                                                                                                               Bivn*b

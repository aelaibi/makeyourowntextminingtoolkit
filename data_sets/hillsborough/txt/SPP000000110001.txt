Mr. Christopher P. Dorries,
HM Coroner,
The Medico Legal Centre,
Watery St.,
Sheffield,

Dear Chris,

                              Hfllsborongh

I enclose a copy of the letter I sent to Judge Stuart Smith on 3rd December.

I sent you today a copy of the letter date 3rd December 1997(with its enclosures) from
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith regarding the changes which were made to the coronerâ€™s
certificate for Kevin William in 1994. There was no covering letter with it.

I cannot recollect whether I put a copy of my reply on this topic in the envelope so I
enclose this now in case I forgot.

I would be interested to receive a copy of your reply to Sir Murray.

Would you thank Julie and Pauline for their help and the immediate way they dealt
with my requests.


Yours sincerely,


    /
S. L. Popper.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 vfft.L TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE LACK OF OVERALL POLICE COMMAND ANDyCOMMUNICATION. NO ONE SEEMED TO BE IN

 CHARGE. NO ONE SEMED TO HAVE G,         WHAT WAS GOING ON. THUS ALL THE OFFICIALS

 SEEMED TO BE DOING THEIR OWN TFflNG. SOME WERE ACTIVELY ASSISTING. OTHERS WERE

 JUST STOOD AROUND AS IF THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO, AS IF THEY WERE w XT t I'NG'

 FOR INSTRUCTIONS. ALSO THE TICKET ALLOCATION TO THE GROUND WAS TOTALLY

 WRONG BECAUSE THE LIVERPOOL END WAS THE SMALLEST CAPACITY, EVEN THOUGH

 WE HAVE MORE FANS.

                                                                                PAGE     9
                                                                                Q SL2609

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE SEEMED TO BE MANY PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS I MET EN ROUTE TO THE GROUND

 FROM THE POINT OF PARKING.       THESE WERE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO ANY CRUSH AT

 TURNSTILES BUT QUITE CLEARLY THEY HAD TRAVELLED TO THE GROUND THEREBY BEING

EXCESS TO EXPECTATIONS OF TOTAL FANS.

 I BELIEVE THE FUNNELING EFFECT AT THE MAIN GATE TOWARDS ALL TURNSTILES AT

 LEPPINGS LN END CREATES A BOTTLE NECK SITUATION.       FURTHER - PERSONS NOT

 KNOWING THE GROUND WOULD NATURALLY HEAD FOR THE TUNNEL AREA.

 I FEEL THAT IT WAS ONLY MY OWN EXPERIENCES OF LAST YEAR AT THE SAME MATCH THAT

I N V E N T E D ME FROM ENTERING THE MAIN DANGER AREAS (PENS 3 AND 4) THIS YEAR.

 LAST YEAR I DID IN FACT USE THE TUNNEL, SAW THE EXTENT OF CROWDING, BUT WAS

 ABLE TO LEAVE THAT AREA AND FIND MY WAY TO A WING TERRACE.       WHAT I AM SAYING

 IS THAT WITHOUT MY EXPERIENCE OF LAST YEAR I TOO WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE

 FOUND MYSELF   IN PENS 3 OR 4.

 I FEEL THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT MEDICAL AND EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT,      IE. TOOLS

 CUTTING EQUIPMENT ETC. AT THE GROUND,      IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY. THERE

 APPEARED TO BE A LONG DELAY IN THE ARRIVAL OF EMERGENCY SERVICES GETTING TO

 THE GROUND. THE FIRST FIRE ENGINE I SAW WAS APPROX 3.35PM (1535) HEADING FOR

 THE GROUND.

^FEEL,   AS AT 'HEYSEL" THAT THE RELEVANT AUTHORITIES DID NOT RESPOND TO THE

 EARLIEST SITUATION, THEY DID NOT READ THE SITUATION AT ITS EARLIEST POINT,

 VIZ TICKET ALLOCATION, FILTERING OF FANS, OPENING OF EMERGENCY EXITS ETC ETC.

 THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?    ,^^

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 4.20PM (1620)

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT THE GAME BEING ABANDONED AND TO LEAVE IN AN

 ORDERLY MANNER.


G18

 G52

       YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONISDERyTO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 THE PRESS WERE DISGRACEFUL.    A PHOTOGRAPHER TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF A DEAD BODY

 AND HE WAS GRABBED BY THREE SUPPORJ^RS WHO SLAMMED HIM AGAINffT A FENCE.         HE

 WAS PULLED AWAY BY A POLICE OFFyf^ER.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE WERE TOO SLOW TO REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPffillNG.    THERE WAS A TOTAL

 LACK OF ORGANISATION, ALLOWING THE EMERGENCY SERVICES THROUGH.      IT SEEMED

 T^T   THE POLICE WERE JUST THERE, THEY DI D N ’T/SEEM TO BE DOING ANYTHING.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE CHOICE OF VENUE WAS WRONG - FROM TRAVEL PURPOSES THE TICKET ALLOCATION

 IS POOR.   THE POLICE ORGANISATION WAS DISGUSTING,   INSIDE AND OUT THE GROUND.

 THERE WAS NO LEADERSHIP TO FORCE CROWDS BACK.     AN ANNOUNCEMENT WHILST IN THE

 CROWD OUTSIDE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE DELAYING KICK O F F .   THEREFORE, CALMING

 THE CROWD, RELAXING THE PUSHING.    THE PRESS HAVE TOTALLY DISTORTED THE FACTS

 AND I FEEL IT SHOULD BE IGNORED IT IS PRESS HYSTERIA.

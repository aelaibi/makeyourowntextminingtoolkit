               On Saturday 15 April         1989,   I commenced duty at W o m b w e l 1 Police

               Station at 0900.       There were about twelve officers from B2 headed by

               Sergeant B u r n s .

               At about 0910 we were transported to Hillsborough where at 1000 we

               were briefed and sent to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

               At about 1135 we commenced searching spectators who had started to

               arrive,   behind gates 9 - 16.            There were only a few coming into the

               ground at- this point but as          t   looked through the turnstiles i oouia
               see a few youths who seemed to be hanging around outside the g a t e s .

               At this time the atmosphere was relaxed.

               At about 2pm there was a large build-up of spectators trying to get

               into the g r o u n d , some of them were expressing concern about the bui ld­

               up outside.

               At about 2.20pm there was a large number outside the g r o u n d .                  There

               were some youths trying to get over the wall               into the g r o u n d .    I

               could also see through a small pane of glass in one of the main gates,
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 R2i

that there were people being pushed against the gates by the crowds.

As 1 was searching a couple of the spectators I could smell alcohol

on their breath.         When questioned about this they said they had had a

couple of pints wi th their         lunch.

At approximately 2.20pm I felt a blow to the right side of my f a c e ■

X turned round and saw a scuffle between PC 1074 Thickett from D2 and

a man called                   We then escorted                 |o the detention

room and ejected him from the ground.

At 2.45pm I returned to gates 9 ~ 16 to recommence s e a r c h i n g .           The

spectators at this time were agitated and complaining about the

crush.     I could see through the turnstiles that there were a couple

of thousand outside.         Some of the spectators entering smelled of

alcohol but did not give the impression of being drunk.

At 2.55pm I could see a small scuffle taking place between a man, who

1 now know to be

           Liverpool and PC 78 Booth and WPC Pearson.             I went over to

assist the officers and grabbed hold of                    Left a r m .

W h i 1st on the way to the detention room I could see about ten youths

urinating along a w a 11.        I shouted to them to stop but they didn't

take any n o t i c e .

     was struggling and thrashing about when PC Booth was knocked to

the floor.

I noticed at this time a group of youths started to move                   in closer

with the apparent        intention of a s s i s t i n g e s c a p e .     Three other

officers arrived on the scene and dispersed the crowd.

     was then escorted to the Police room.             After about 20 minutes he

was fingerprinted and p h o t o g r a p h e d .   I then went outside with the

prisoner    to lodge him in the cell bus which was parked outside.                 It

was then I saw several stretchers with both dead and injured persons

on them.     I assisted in carrying one of these s t r e t c h e r s .

                                                                                    R21

#        I, along with PC Booth attempted to locate our serial Sergeant 1757

         Burns at the rear of the turnstiles as previously located but found

         that PS Burns and the other officers had left the area.          It became

         apparent that something had gone wrong but I d i d n ’t really have any

         idea what it was.

         PC Booth and myself     looked from the rear of the Leppings Lane

         quadrangle area to       see if we could gain access to the front of        the

         terracing.    Due to     the large numbers of persons there we attempted to

         gain access by different means.       Whilst doing so we were approached

^        by   a person who said he was a doctor and wanted to know where all the

         casualties were being t a k e n .

         PC Booth then escorted the doctor to the casualty a r e a .

         In the meantime some Liverpool spectators had started          to leave     the

         ground.    Most were     abusive and some were th rea te ni n g,some had    to be

         escorted from the g r o u n d .

         On the steps leading to the seating area,       youths leaving the ground

         were punching or kicking the plastic sheets and shouting abuses at

         the Police.

^        At 5.30pm we returned to the stands to be stood d o w n .

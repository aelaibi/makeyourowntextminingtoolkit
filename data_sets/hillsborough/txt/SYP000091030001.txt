            There was a stej*ard and a policeman by the gate.                                        I had seen

the gate     had been^S'pened by a policeman.                              Going    in thro ug h the gate                 I

was    not asked for my ticket.                      Whe n   I got     inside       I went        to the toilet.

We were all        then going          to go ar ou nd the outside                  of the stand and             into

the    terraces     in Pen       1.         As we    tried to walk           past the tunnel             entrance

due to the amount           of    people       going     that way we were              pushed        into the

lunne 1 even tht?tigh            we did rrdT~~w*ijtt o go that way.                         I had not s e e n

any police        officers       or stewards           by tpe tunnel          e n t r a n c e.       I was

sep ar a te d from the       others          in the f u n n e l .      I was       pushed along          the

■^^urne 1.T h ere M A3--TT5 way        I could have            gone back.                The        crowd was

walking      fast    through the            tunnel.          I w as    pushed      into          Pen 3 a nd     about

half way down the terrace.                       The    game was       being       played as         I got     in the

pen.       I was being       s qu ashed and            I £H3'uld not m o v e .           I was      being m oved

about and at one my back was against                           the    bar.         I was very w o r r i e d          I

did not think        that    1 was aiding to get                out.         After a few minutes                the

gate     in the    pen at    t heyr rant was            opened and          people made a surge

towards     the gate.        /        was    going     to go towards          the gate whe n someone

grabbed me arki sa/fd            d o n ’t go you won't get out.                      I stood         where I was

still     crushed.      I saw          people        climbing over the fence and                     on to the

pitch.         I saw about 5 people                  go out     of the gate. Beca us e              of    the

crush they        could not       get out of the gate.



A fter about       10 - 15 minutes             there was a sudden surge                    from the back and

 I was    pushed straight             down to the fence.                   There was       just a girl

between me and the fence.                       I was    trying       to    push back off the fence to

stop squashing           the girl.           People     then started to move            towards        the

gate again.            The    pressure       eased and      I saw a lad on the flajsw^at the

side      of me.       I first       saw his    feet     then     I looked d o n rtT "and I saw him



about 20 yrs of age about 3*9"                      tal 1 y-Vafverage    b u i l d , fair    to blond

hai r .      Short at the sides a nd^ronge r at the                      back    clean s h a v e n .        He

had blue jeans and a beic^rjumper.                          He had a black         shoe      on his        left

foot      bixt the    righ>^one was missing,              white     socks.        Someone      bent        down

and    lifted his head.                I bent down an d opened his eyelid and his eye

was    just fixed a nd staring.                 He felt       cold to the touch.                1 thought

that he was          dead and      I was     shocked.         1 knew then that          1 had to           get

out of the r e .          There was another             surge and       I jumpedJ»«Sfck.          I decided

to climb out over the                fence.         I climbed onto^Ene          fence a n d was            stood

on the top.          A policeman           on the pitch              jump,      I jumped and he

caught me,         a s ke d me   if I      was alright.         He told me to go onto              the

pitch and sit down.                  I wa lk ed to the        centre     circle a nd sat down.                    My

legs where         like jelly and           I sat down for about            13 minutes.           I saw

people      being     s t r e t ch er ed   off to the    other     end of the ground.              I then

got up and wa lk ed a ro u n d             trying to find the others.                  A friend     in          the

s ta nd saw me and           came onto the          pitch an d took me to sit               in the stand

for a bit.



A fter a while we went and                  looked for      the    others.        We   could not see
                                                                                                       \



them.        The     cameras were          on the    pitch,     people were       going      up and

talking      to them.         My friend said something               to them.          I don't know

what      it was.        I went      forward and        showed them my complete               ticket and

said,      "Look at this         no one took         it off m e ” .



We    carried on looking             for the others         but    could not find them.                    We

ev en tu a ll y    left the ground at about               16.20 hrs       (1620).           As we w al ke d

              back through Pen 4 I saw                      he was      looking      for the others.         I could

              see     in Pen 3 a broken barrier and a pile of                       clothes    by the gate    to Pen

              3 on the        pitch,      I wa lk ed out of the tunnel              and back     to the    railway

              stat ion.



              W hen    I got home      I noticed that         I had ^/tTises on my r i b s .          My mother

              w an t e d me to go to the         do cto rs b u r l      did not bothe r ,



              I did not see a ny thing at the m atch that                     I w ould    consider    to be a

              criminal        offence..



              I think that        there    shoul              been a greater          police    presence    outside

              the ground to c o p t r o 1 a /m        organise        the   crowd        The kick    off   should

              have    delayed and               "owd outside          informed,



      /      Liverpool         supporters     should have           been given the .larger end of the

              ground and more          tickets a l l o c a t e d     to them.       There     should be more

              larger     gates    from the      pens on to the          pitch.

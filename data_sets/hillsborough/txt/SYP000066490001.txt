I n o ti c e d that a few fans               had e n te re d the S p i o n H op by 11.40 am                   (1140

a g a in on the S p io n K o p          (Notts F or es t         fans).



Meal     was     taken at a p p r o x i m a t e l y      1.15 pm      (1315 hrs)         on the d i r e c t i o n of

I r et ur ne d to my          previous       p ositi on on the track at a p p r o x i m a t e l y               1.40
                                                                                                                          j

being t aken up by Notts F orest                        fans.     At this        same    time    I n o ti ce d that

the N o r t h S t a n d was        perhaps        only half       full a nd this also             being the

q uite full         but the L iv er p oo l         fens    in the seats           d ir e ct l y facing me were

very     intoxicated.            At normal S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y m a tc h es        such yout hs

It was q ui c kl y evident              that      these L iv er po ol        fans were very h o st il e and

 track       (when P olice S e r g e a n t C h a p m a n      r et re a te d    into the     players

 a p p r ox i m a t e l y 3.05    pm )(1505 h r s ) I could see fans                 being a l l o w e d onto

 the track         from the      pens.       At this       time the d ru n ke n L i ve rp oo l            fans    in

 the N o r t h S t a n d d i r e c t l y    in front of me were                shou ti ng a bu se and

 came ra towards           the L e p p i n g s Ln terraces,             I r ea l is e d that        these fans

 w er e so hostile that              I told the P h o t o g r a p h e r        to go a wa y as         I b e l i e ve d

 he was       in danger      of being attacked.



 T he re w er e now Live rp oo l            fans    running     down the track             in front of the

 N o r t h S t a n d o b v i o u s l y having      come onto the         track     from the L e p p i n g s Ln

 were    going.        T he y all     produce d N o r th S t a n d seat           tickets      so      I d ir e ct e d

 them to go towards              the S p i o n K op then turn            left to get         into the

 s ea ti ng area.          By now all        I could see at           the L ep p in g s Ln end was

 people s p i l l i n g out onto the track a nd P o l i c e O ff i ce r s                    trying        to

 prevent       t h ery going     onto      the    pitch.      I then saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

 The    play*rs all         then went        off the f ield a nd by this                  tirefe there were

I was at this             time     in the same        p os it io n on the           track to prevent the

d r u n k e n L iver pool         fans    invading     the     pitch,     but       a s s i s t e d by a n ot he r

Serial      who were         s pr ea d out     in front of the N o r t h Stand.



By 3.1 5         pm (1515 hrs)           a number     of cas ua lt ie s were          being       carr ie d across

the    pitch on stre tc he rs a nd shor tl y a f t e r w a r d s                  I n o ti ce d    c asualties

being      carried on a d v e r t i s i n g        h oard in gs   by other         fans.       It was       now

a p p a r en t    that a large           number    of fans      had been crus he d            in the      central

pen.       It was        not until        about 3.15      pm    (1515 hrs)         that     the scale        of

the d is ast er          became apparent.             I was     by now very f r i g h t e n e d for my own

s af et y as       the    crowd in the N o rt h S t a nd were more                  hostile a nd          I feared

they w o u ld       invade        the    pitch en mass at any moment.                     I b egan to feel

very sick as there a p p e a r e d                to be total m a y h e m e ve rywhere.                 C a su a l t i e s

were     being      carried a cross          the    pitch in their dozens and m a n y were

o b v i ou s ly dead.         By about 3.40           pm (1540 hrs)         the Fire B r i g a d e a nd

medi ca l        services we re present a nd              people we re receiving                  t re a tm e nt     over

the full          length of the           pitch.      I was a p p r o a c h e d    by a male L iv e rp o ol

fan a ge d about 45 years who was                      gasping      for b re at h but able              to walk.

I a s s i s t e d him toward the track at the                     corner        of the S p i o n Kop,           but we

were     unable      to get up the           track to the          rear    of the N o r th S t an d due

to the a m ount           of people a nd cas ua lt ie s           being     carried on a d v e r t i s i n g

hoardings.           The man s ta te d he w ou ld sit down for a w hile                            on the       track

at the       corner       of the S p i o n Kop.          I then n ot i ce d a number               of P o li c e

O f f i ce r s    trying     to    place a male        casualty onto an a d v e r t i s i n g             hoarding

on the       pitch so        I went       to assist.         I then h e lp e d       carry this         c a s u a 1ty

up the track to the g y m n a s i u m at the                    rear    of the N or th Stand.                There

was a serial             of P ol ic e     formi ng a cordon to the e ntry at the                        rear of

* c a su alty    into the gym w h er e         other    offi ce rs        pulled the m an     in on the

 advertising         hoarding.         The man was        s em i- co ns c io u s,   white,    a g e d about

 25 years.



 The gymnasiurn was          full      of bodies a n d       c asualties       still a l i ve were       being

 taken to the far end.                 I am unaware who the offi ce rs were who                      took

 over my        casualty or who a s s i s t e d me as they were                 from other       divisions.



 T he re   s eemed to be no o r g a n i s t a t i o n or radio m es s ag e s            from about 3.15

 pm   (1515 hrs).         It was a case of e very officer                     doing what      he could

 wherever       he h a p p en ed to be.



 I did not notice any            s i gn if ic a nt     d if fe r en c e   in the    policing     of this

 semi •“ final        com pa re d w i th others.



 My own feelings were            of fear and horror a nd a severe                      s ic kl y feeling




 My own view         is that     the disaster was            caused m a i n l y by L iv er p oo l      fans

 going drinking          in local       public houses and e x p e ct i ng             to gain e nt ry to

 the grou nd just before               kick    off.     Also     that     due to their       d ru n ke n state

 they had no regard for a nyone                  else     in g ai ning       entry.     I felt    that      had

 the kick        off been de la ye d and a P o li c e a n n o u n c e m e n t made           to that

 effect     prior     to 2.5 5    pm    (1455 hrs)        the s e ri o us n es s    of the days       events

 ma y have       been less severe.



 I feel     that     the noise of        the    crowd     inside      the g r ou n d at a n d a ft er       the

 kick off may have           caused e x c it em en t and h y st e r i a a mo n gs t          those

              outside.          I also     feel       that   s om et hi ng   shou ld have been done e a rl ie r to

              ensu re        that   the   central       pen did not o v e r c r o w d a nd that the a d j o i n i n g

              pens w h i c h were         not    full    be used for d i r e ct i ng       fans   into.    There was

               cl early no fa ci li ty           to    close    off the      packed    central    pen.

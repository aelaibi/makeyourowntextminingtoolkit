Dear Sirs,

Re:   RESUMED INQUESTS                  1 9 th N O V E M B E R 1990.



If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m y o u represent,
on the 19th of N o v e m b e r 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue wil l be n o t i f i e d in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already b e e n taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal i n v e st iga tion w h i c h y ou wi l l recollect is not a d vers ari al but
inquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is m y res pons ibi lit y to select the
w it nesses who w i s h to give evidence.     I a m at present engaged in c o n s i d e r i n g
this and in d ete rmi ning w h o                      I w i s h to invite   to attend.

Witho ut prejudice in any w a y to m y rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
to give you an o p p o r t u n i t y to dra w to my at ten tion the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or wi tnesses w h o m y o u w o u l d like me to
c onsider calli ng to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask y o u in c onsi der ing w h e t h e r you w i s h to d r a w any names                            to my
attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also wa nt to make it absolut ely clear that the submis sio n of a name or
names for c o n s i d e r a t i o n is n o t h i n g more than that, and that the d e c i s i o n as
to who to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
he ard from you by the end of September I w i l l assume you have no names to
submit.

Yours       fai/thfully,

           Sirs,
He: JAKES P. DELAHEY (deceased) Ho.33.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not-to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

S c h o l e y a n d PC L e a k e .       Football       traffic was           i mmediately        in evidence

from Upwell St r e e t             to Fir Vale.          At Fir Vale we queried the signing

of the        car    route      for N o t t i n g h a m Forest.          We   continued towards

H i l l s b o r o u g h via Herr i e s Road,          checking         traffic       points.          We    then

checked traffic                points    from the football               ground to Grenoside,

s p e a k i n g to all         offic e r s   en r o u t e .

At about         11.SO am we met Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit                    on P e n i s t o n e

R o a d outside          the    f o o t b a 11 ground and briefed him re t raf f i c

arrangements.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    11.45 am we t r a v e l l e d to the M1(S)                 via Upwell

S t r e e t , W i n c o b a n k and Tins l e y V i a d u c t .         Trave l l i n g    south to Woodall

we noticed h eavy traffic                    on the n o r t h b o u n d       carriageway,        there       being

large amounts              of N o t t i n g h a m Forest      supporters.            At Woodall            we turned

north and           came    back     to J u n c t i o n 33 C a t c 1 i f f e .     F rom about          IS.05 pm to

12.30 pm we a s s i s t e d at Cat c l i f f e                regarding       the i m p l e m e n t a t i o n of a

traffic        d i v e r s i o n via the Parkway.                Chief     Inspector L a x , Chief

Inspector S haw and                Inspector C a w t h o r n e were also seen at C a t c 1 i f f e .

We were all           s a t i s f i e d at this stage that               traffic was         flowing well.

Chief        Inspector S haw stated that                  the      new A 61 6 S t o c k s b r i d g e      by-pass

was a s s i s t i n g      t raff i c f 1ow on that side of the ground e n o r m o u s l y and

that traffic was well                   d i s t r i b u t e d betw e e n all     routes.        He a d d e d that

J u n c t i o n 35    (the e m e r g e n c y d i v e r s i o n     route)     was a v a i l a b l e     for   use    by

N otts Fo r e s t        traffic as there wre              no problems           on Liv e r p o o l        routes.

At about         12.30 pm we          left C a t c l i f f e and t r avelled down the P a r k w a y to

Pr i n c e    of W ales R o a d where we             left and went            towards D a r n a l 1.          At    this

location        Inspector S c h o l e y spoke             to PC       Zalad and a s k e d him to do

point        duty at D a r n a l 1 lights          owing      to    congestion.          This was           quickly

eliminated           by the o f f i c e r and our vehicle                  continued to Bri ghtside Lane,

At Driv i n g School,              Inspector S c h o l e y         checked on the s i t u a t i o n           re the

Cit y Centre).             We    then had a cup of tea and                  resumed     patrol.

At about       1.30 pm we             returned to the m o t o r w a y and tra v e l l e d n orth to

D o d w o r t h where we turned              round and tra v e l l e d south to Woodall

checking       signing on             routes.       At this       time we not i ced that          the

m o t o r w a y was ver y quiet and was                 carrying        little traffic,         both north

and southound.              At Woodall we s poke briefly to                     Inspector Steele who

was on Pu b l i c Order               detail.       We then went back onto the nort h b o u n d

ca r r i a g e w a y and whilst           travel 1ing north,            just   prior to Tinsley,             we

checked a coach full                   of N otts Fo r e s t      supp o r t e r s and a d v i s e d   them    re

their     conduct.

We    continued north and                 left the m o t o r w a y at T a n k e r s l e y trave lling

along     the A&1         towards Sheffield.               The     route was      clear    until      we   came

to Bu r n c r o s s where we turned off after                       seeing     the tail      end of

traffic.       I w o u l d estimate           the time as shortly after S . 00                  pm perhaps

five     past.      We     then went         through Chape 1 t o w n , E c c l e s f i e l d and

S h e f f i e l d Lane T o p and e v e n t u a l l y       returned to the A 6 1 , rejoining                  it

at S o u t h e y G r e e n R o a d .       The    road at this          point was now cl ear            (2.SO pm

ish)

I was m o n i t o r i n g       the    radio m e s s a g e s    concerning      traffic m o v e m e n t .         It

was     clear by now that with the e x c e p t i o n of the N e e p s e n d area,                          all

traffic      on routes           to the ground had              returned to their          normal       levels.

There were        no      reports of any delays w h a t s o e v e r             on the Liverpool

routes at this t i m e .

We    p a trolled the a r e a           of the gr o u n d t r a v e l l i n g a long P e n i s t o n e Road,

and e v e n t u a l l y    into R u t l a n d Road.            By the time we a r r i v e d      in this area

(about 2 . 4 0      pm)     traffic        had also      cleared from the N e e p s e n d area,               I

t h erefore      passed a message                to O p e r a t i o n s Roo m stating      that all        routes

w ere   now clear          of traffic an d asking                that   ground     c o n t r o 1 be informed

of that      fact,

W h i l s t ^ w e were     in R u t l a n d Road,      Operations         room r e q uested a car,
equip p e d w ith P.A.,              to go to         L e p p i n g s Lane and ask        fans    to stop

pushing.           At    first       there was        no reply so after checking our                     car was

e q u i p p e d w i t h P .A. , Inspector S c h o l e y             passed a radio mess a g e             to the

effect      that we w o u l d attend.                   We then went to Leppings Lane                    end of

the ground.              En    route via P e n i s t o n e Road,           we remarked to each other

a bout    the number            of supporters           still making         their way on foot to the

g round and others               still      drinking       outside       public     houses.

O n turning         into L e p p i n g s Lane we were               confr o n t e d with heavy

p edes t r i a n traffic,             our d r i v e r , PC L e a k e , drove slowly and gave a few

short     horn w a r n i n g s        w hich seemed to            incite    resentment          of our

presence.           I a d v i s e d PC Leake not to use the horn any more                            than

n e c e s s a r y an d PC Leake             responded to this.              We stopped outside             the

L e p p i n g s Lane       entrance where           there were a large              number       of Liverpool

s uppo r t e r s    still       trying       to enter      the     ground.       I could see and hear a

P.A.     ope r a t i n g      from    a police Lan d R o v e r , requesting               the    crowd to stop

pushing.           Inspector          S c h o l e y spoke brie f l y w ith PC             Trcek and whilst            he

was    doing       this       I was watc h i n g     the    supporters.           The re was an

atmosphere          of     resentfulness          towards         the   presence of our           vehicle and

m any of the s u p p o r t e r s a p p e a r e d the worse                 for drink.           It did not

ap p e a r we      could be of any furthe r a ssistance,                         I the ref ore      instructed

PC Leake        to 1eave         and turn        left    into C a t chbar L a n e .         I did this

because       our       presence       seemed d etrimental              to the situation.

We    then travel led to Fir Vale via P e n i s t o n e Road and R u t l a n d Roa d

intending          to    return to the Driv i n g School.                    At Fir Vale,          Operations

made     haste      to D r i v i n g School        where      I turned all          the    personnel       out.

All    personnel           carriers were d i r e c t e d to the ground w i t h PS L i g h t f o o t

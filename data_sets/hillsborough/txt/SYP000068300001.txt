On the day of the                game,       Saturday,           15th April         1989    <150489),         we     left

N o t t i n g h a m at    12.30       pm    (123D),        we t r a v e l l e d to S h e f f i e l d     in

                   car,    along       the Ml M o t o r w a y        to J u n c t i o n 30 where we             left

t h e M ot or way a n d he a d e d           i nt o S h e f f i e 1d .



We stopped at             the N o r t o n Hotel            in S h e f f i e l d where we had Lunch,                     Our

journey       had been u n h i n d e r e d and we a r r i v e d at the Hotel                           at     1.30      pm

<1530),       having       parked          the    car    in the Hotel          car    park.



On our       journey       t h r o u g h S h e f f i e l d we      saw m any Fo r e s t S u p p o r t e r s

drinking       from glasses                and    cans,       outside Public Houses,                   some    sup^rtar

were also          drinking          from    cans whilst           walking         towards       th®    ground.



We    left    the    hotel       at 2.15          pm    (1415)     and    headed toward the                 ground,          we

had    no Police          escort       nor       did we       receive     any Po l i c e     directions,

however,       I know S h e f f i e l d well               and   the r e f o r e    did    not    need directing.
                                                                                                              PAG E
                                                                                                              SI 256



W hilst      walking    to the gr o u n d        I saw several            Fo r e s t    s u pporters     who were

blind drunk and were                stagg e r i n g about        in the      streets.,



We did not         however    exper i e n c e       any    problems w i t h those              people.



We a r r i v e d at    the   ground at about 2 .5 5                  pm   <-1455),      on our way to          the

ground,       many    fans   had a s k e d     us    if we had any           spare       tickets,      we had

not,    so    we   ignored them a n d           carried on our way.



when we       got to the gate at the S p i o n Ho p end,                     that       leads    to the se a t e d

area    in    the S Stand,          we     came across a group of five                    supporters.



They a p p e a r e d to have         been d r i nking and one was                  particularly          loud.         He

was    stood on a wall             by the    gate,        he was     shouting at          the other

supporters,          including       us,    as we     filed     in.



He shou t e d at       the   top of his          voice,      "Have an y of you fucking                   bastards

got any fucking          tic k e t s . "     All    of us who were             walking         past,   just

ignored this          y outh an d        carried on in thro u g h            the       gate,    we   did not have

any    p r o b 1ems wit h his        four    companions.



H aving      got to our      respective          t u rnstile w ith no d i f f i c u l t i e s          in finding

it, we ente r e d e a s i l y as the re were                 queues.



There        was   not any Police           d i r e c t i o n s at   this    point       and a lt h o u g h

           Inside     the       ground we saw signs                   d i recting    us to our         seats and

           experienced           no d i f f i c u l t y    in finding        them.



          At no time            on this     day did         I enter        the L e p pings LN end of the                  ground,.



          Between         our    entry     point and            taking     up our     seats,       I did not w i t n e s s any

          disorder         or other        incidents,,           or did     I witness        the     c o n s u m p t i o n of

          alcohol.



          From where            I was    seated,          I could not see the               bar    break      in Pen 3.



          We were         first     seated at 3.02               pm    (1502),      the   game     having       just     started

           I was     sat    in a row of           seats         together w ith all           of my t r a v e l l i n g

          companions

          I did not witn e s s any                crowd         crush,    but    I did see/a d i a g o n a 1 surge                of

          people      in the Pens           situated            in the L e p p i n g s    Li\r end behind the             goal.

          The     surge     began at        the    top of the Pens               on the S S t a n d side and                ran

          d i a g o n a l l y down      toward the N Stand.



          Just     before       the     game was          stopped,       I saw L i verpool          Supporters           climbing

          out     of the two          centre Pens           behind the goal.                There were          c 3.in/p i n g o v e r

          ^the    perimeter         fence     onto        the    pitch and       over     t h e s e g r e g a t,i nVg   „

          in the W Stand.

          As     the trag e d y       began     to unfold             I saw bodies        lying m o t i o n l e s s      on the

          playing area.               1 w a s no t i n a pos i t i on t o as s i st anyone w ho may                             ha ve

           I believe       that    1 did not witn e s s           anything       I consider to have               been a

           factor     in the deaths           or   injuries       to any      person.



           I do not      recall      at what       time    I left the         gr o u n d but     itwas fo l l o w i n g          a

          The   only o b s e r v a t i o n   that     I have      is that      there was a lack of

           c o m m u n i c a t i o n between the      officials        and the       supporters,        many      of whom

          had no      idea what was          happening.

          he had short          dark s t r aight       hair.        He was wearing,            light    blue      denim

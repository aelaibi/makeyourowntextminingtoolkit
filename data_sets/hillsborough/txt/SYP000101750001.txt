before the match(to be reallocated during the mateh to the Spion Kop to form a closed
cordon between Notts Forest supporters and segregated Liverpool fans holding tickets
for that end.
At 12*00 duty at rear of turnstiles.           Mood of people entering was quite good and
anticipating a good game.          Not a great deal of influx of people at this location
possibly due to it being slightly out of the way.              The main body of people must have
been entering via turnstiles on Penistone Road.            We were visited on numerous occasions
by P.S. Marples as a security check as tnis turnstile area is in a well out of sight
    m the Kop and other officers.           During one of these visits we were told that the

t   nd was filling up fast and that we may possibly be required on the cordon before
    Kick off depending on the ratio           of supporters.    It was arranged that we should make
ourselves visible at the head of the stairway from the well to the Kop.                  If we were
required he would signal to us.
1.00pm Head of stairway.
1.10pm Signalled by P.S. Marples to join up with officers seperating fans. Single cordon.
2.30 approx dai)le cordon.         Large capacity of Liverpool fans in our small area possibly
more than anticipated, many of whom had filtered through the cordon of their own
volition without any directions.
3.00pm Number of Notts Forest supporters in proximity to cordon quite drunk heckling
Liverpool fans.          It was quite clear that during the match there would be trouble at
our cordon without much influence from the game. Just after Kick off I                  saw there
•Qb a number of people on the pitch at the other end. This caused a number of Notts
Forest supporters near us much antagonism causing shouting and swearing directed at
our segregated fans aswell as Police.           As the players were lead off our attention was
drawn to adjacent fans not the incidents at £he other end. It was only when the
Ambulance came onto the pitch it became clear that the situation was serious.                          Shir
serial was penned in,still on original instructions throughout,to maintain seperation.
We took no part in the events at the Leppings Lane end.             The Kop was later cleared of
all supporters before we were relived of this duty.

                    *F2*    area officers          controlled by Inspector Sykes.                           Only a few           coaches

As    I patrolled the are a outside             the turnstiles         I noticed a number of

youths    stood ar o u n d the small        shop close        by the    'A' Gate an d also a

number walking       past    the ground,        the m a j o r i t y of who m doned           seme form

of    'Liverpool    Memorabilia'?         who were    drinking from          cans    of      lager or

other alcoholic       beverage,        On a couple of occasions                I spoke with

these supporters and warned them regarding                      their     entry to the ground

with alcohol       or being worse         for drink.      I also       saw a number          of other

officers    do the same and some d i r ected youths                to get       rid of        cans they

were    carrying    or drinking      from,      e s corting   them to nearby           ’waste        bins*

and    throwing awa y the      cans.       By   12 noon the gates at L e p p i n g s Lane were

opened,    but the m a j o ri ty    of the fans       refused to enter            the ground,          being

content    to gather       on both sides        of L e p p i n g s Lane and outside            the

turnstiles.

Over    the next 20 minutes         the    crowd outside        the turnstile          increased        in

number as did the number            of s upporters       on both sides          of Leppings

Lane.     During    this    period the      'mounted o f f i c e r s ’ patrolled the area

outside    the t urnstiles      requesting        the supporters          to move      towards        the

turnstiles and       into the ground.            A number of buses a r r i v e d             outside

the ground and occupants were               diver t e d towards        the t u rnstiles and

searc h e d on   leaving the       buses.       I could still      see a number              of fans

drinking    from    cans and empties were            lined up on the wall              on the far

side    of Leppings Lane.

As the    numbers    outside    the turnstiles          increased myself and the                 other

two officers       returned to assist Serial             17 in there duties.                  I must

say that at      this stage     the m a j o r i t y of fans      I saw were         good humoured

and a small      number     had o b v iously been drinking             but a p p e a r e d    fully    in

control    of their    faculties.          I returned to the turnstile                 I had

orig i n a l l y started at and there           spoke w ith Sergeant Whitlam.                   I think

it was at this       stage that Police C o n s t a b l e Pulf r e y from our serial

left the t u rnstiles        to take a prisoner he had found                   in p ossession of

OllT flj                e ntered the       ground at this        point,      Their      s e a r c h e d were       selective        and

                        not everyone was          searche^as         this would have          been       impractical          to

                        carry out.         The m a j o ri ty of fans       who    entered were either               children         or

                        the older fans who wante d to get                  their seats early.              Orderly          queues

                        had formed outside           each turnstile         but these were           only of a short

                        len.gth? and       it a p p e a r e d that   the   m a j o r i t y of fans were waiting

                        outside    the ground        to enter at a         later    stage.

                        outside the turnstiles.                At one stage a couple              of the fans          jumped the

                        was   reminded of       law and the          lager was    disposed of.            Some       of the        other

                        y ouths who       queued were obv i o u s l y under        the effects           of alcohol,

                        increased and        people waiting at the            turnstile           opening were         being

                        get them to move          back or      people were       getting      crushed,         but all        I could

              Inspector Sykes,          he then directed us outside.             I w ould estimate

     POLICE CONSTABLE 29 3         J

     'F 2 ' ECCLESFIELD




     Following       the    match       briefing          in    the North        Stand       at Hillsborough,                I,   along

     with    other members             of Serial          17,   attended        the enclosure             behind       'C'    gate    at

     the    Leppings       Lane    turnstiles.             We arrived           there       at around          11.15     am to take
••




     up our position outside                  the    'A'       turnstiles in order to search Liverpool fans

     entering       the    ground       and    to keep Public                Order.         At    the    time of arrival             the

     turnstiles       were        closed       and        there       were     very        few    Liverpool         fans      waiting

     outside the ground.

     At    around    11.30    am,       we    were    deployed          to     the    outside       of turnstiles             *A'    and

     took up our positions,                   one officer to each turnstile entry,                               I myself taking

     up position at the second turnstile along from 'A' gate.

     At    around    11.45    am,       myself       and       two    other     officers          were    requested          to   leave

     our     positions       and       assist        another          serial        with     the        off-loading        of     buses

     outside    the turnstiles on Leppings Lane.                               This serial consisted of 'F2' area
••




     officers       controlled by Inspector Sykes.                            Only a few coaches arrived at this

     point    and    it appeared that most of the fans arriving were either walking to

     the ground from the direction of Penistone Road or from Catchbar Lane.

     As I patrolled          the area outside                  the turnstiles I noticed a number of youths

     stood    around       the small shop close by the                        'A'    gate and also a number walking

     past     the    ground,       the        majority          of     whom     donned           some     form    of     'Liverpool

     Memorabilia',          who     were       drinking              from     cans    of     lager        or     other       acoholic

     beverage.       On a couple of occasions I spoke with these supporters and warned

     them    regarding       their       entry       to    the       ground     with       alcohol        or     being    worse      for

     drink.     I also saw a number of other officers do the same and some directed
youths       to       get       rid    of    cans they      were carrying        or    drinking       from, escorting

them to nearby                  'waste bins' and throwing away the cans.

By 12 noon,            the gates        at Leppings Lane were opened,                    but the majority of the

fans refused             to enter       the    ground,         being content         to gather on both        sides      of

Leppings Lane and outside the turnstiles.

Over     the      next          20    minutes, the         crowd outside        the     turnstile       increased        in

n u m b e r , as       did    the     number      of     supporters       on    both    sides    of    Leppings       Lane.

During       this        period,       the'mounted         officers'      patrolled       the    area    outside        the

turnstiles requesting the supporters                             to move towards the turnstiles and into

the    ground.          A number of buses arrived outside the ground and occupants were

diverted         towards        the    turnstiles         and searched on leaving the buses.                     I could

still       see a number             of fans      drinking       from cans      and empties were          lined up on

the wall on the far side of Leppings Lane.

As    the    numbers            outside       the turnstiles          increased,       myself    and    the other      two

officers         returned        to assist Serial               17   in .their duties.          I must    say that at

this    stage         the majority of fans I saw were good humoured and a small number

had     obviously             been     drinking          but     appeared       fully     in    control     of      their

faculties.               I    returned       to    the     turnstile      I    had     originally started        at    and

there spoke with Sergeant Whitlam.                              I think it was at this stage that Police

Constable         Pulfrey        from our serial            left the turnstiles to take a prisoner he

had    found      in possession of Cannabis                     to the Police room.             I was working with

Police Constable Elsam on the turnstiles and we carried out searches on fans

who entered the ground at this point.                                Their searches were selective and not

everyone was             searched as          this would have been impractical to carry out.                           The

majority         of      fans    who    entered          were    either       children    or    the older    fans      who

wanted      to     get       their    seats       early.        Orderly    queues       had    formed    outside      each




                                            ■pa?n
turnstile      but    these were          only of a short     length,     and it appeared             that   the

majority of fans were waiting outside the ground to enter at a later stage.

As 2 p.m.      approached the queues lengthened and the crowds increased outside

the turnstiles.         At one stage a couple of the fans jumped the turnstiles and

entered      without       tickets    and    some   youths   tried     to enter    the       ground   via the

wall next to Gate            'A'.

On    searching      one     youth    I   found a tin    of lager      hidden     in a pocket,          he was

reminded of law and the lager was disposed of. Some of the other youths who

queued were obviously under the effects of alcohol,                         slurred speech etc, but

by    2.20   p.m.    the     queue    had   disappeared      being   replaced     by     a    large mass      of

people, making searching and the dealing of the unruly impossible.                                    Over the

next    10   minutes        the     crowd   increased   and    people    waiting       at     the   turnstile

opening were being crushed and pushed,                   people were trying to push their way

to the front and gain entry.                  I shouted back towards the crowd in an attempt

to get them to move back or people were getting crushed, but all I could see

were people smiling back at me and the crowd pushing towards me.

It was now getting very difficult to move at all and people were obviously in

a distressed state.            Children and some of the women and OAP's were struggling

to get through the turnstile and were obviously scared and frightened by the

circumstances which were arising.

At this point it was decided that Police Constable Elsam would fight his way

through his turnstile and see if officers inside the ground could help. This

was at around 2.40 p.m. and the crowd was now beyond control.                                 I was pressed

up against the wall of the turnstiles and was unable to move, having to fend

off    the   crowd     who    were    pressing up against        me.     I could see           and hear      the

crowd who were gathered beyond the screen outside                       'B' gate. They were
chanting           and    shouting          and     some    had     managed       to climb on              to    the    screen       and

were      scrambling             over       the     turnstiles          into     the     ground.           Officers          situated

there were              trying to send some back but it appeared the impossible                                              task.     I

was unable              to contact Sergeant Whitlam as I had no radio and had lost sight

of     him.         Members           of    the     crowd        were    shouting         at    me     telling          me    to     get

something done about it,                         "disgusting" and "someone's going to get killed out

here"       were        words    used.           I decided        that    I was not helping                 the       situation by

being pushed to the turnstile wall,                               I was also frightened for my own safety,

so    I   forced         by     the       people    moving        into    the    turnstile           and    went       through       the

turnstile           into       the    ground.           I went    to Inspector Woodward                    and explained the

circumstances              to him.          There appeared to be a lot of noise over his radio at

this      time      and    so     I moved          back    to    give me        a chance        to    get       my breath back.

People      were         moving       through       the    turnstiles           and were        shouting         at    us    as    they

went      past,         "get     out      there     and    get     something       done,        someone's          going      to get

killed",         "you're         no good in here                get out        there".     Everyone             was    complaining

as they passed us.

Supporters          were       jumping          the metal        railing and getting into                   the enclosure by

gate      'C' giving them access to the Leppings Lane Central Terrace.                                                   There was

nothing        we        could       do    as     there     were        supporters        grabbing          hold       of     us     and

complaining.               The       gateman       on    gate     'A'    was    having to hold              the bolts         in the

top    of     the       doors    as       the    supporters        outside       were     trying       to break          their way

in.

At    around        2.55       pm,    we    formed        a cordon       from gate        'A'    to direct             fans around

the    back        of    the    North       Stand.         The    gate was opened and                 the       fans   poured in,

shouting         angrily         at       us.      "You     should       have     opened       the     gates       earlier"          was

quoted        at    me        several           times     and    many     of     the     supporters             were     obviously

     disgusted by the arrangements outside.

     The   gates    were     only     opened    for       a   short     time     and     then    were   closed    by

     Inspector     Sykes,    he   then directed us            outside.         I would estimate         that   there

     was   only    200     fans     outside    as    we       got   there.        Police        Sergeant   Whitlam

     immediately     received       a message       to    the   effect    that     the    crowd were       invading

     the pitch so we ran through the turnstiles and made our way around the back

     of the stand into the North West enclosure end on to the pitch.

     I would like to mention that during the three hours leading up to the start

     of the game,     I noticed a large number of fans and spoke                          to a number who had

     no tickets.      They    added    to the mess            outside    the    turnstiles       and obviously a

     number got into the ground when the gates were opened.

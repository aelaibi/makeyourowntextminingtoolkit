             I am a married man living at the above address with my wife and two

             children.        I am employed as a heavy plant operator.

             I was born in Liverpool and have from a very young age been a regular

             football follower and keen supporter of Liverpool. Since the age of 9

             I have attended matches and when rny work allows,                                 if I am working away

             from home,        I will go and watch the nearest senior match I can find.I

             have followed the Liverpool football team both at home and away venues

             and was among supporters             in May 1985 (000589) at the H e y s e 1 Disaster

             in B r u s s e l s . I have been living at my address                        in __________for nine

             years.     I have on several occasions attended the nearby Hillsborough

             ground of Sheffield Wednesday F o o t b a l 1 Club to wat ch cup sema-fAnaLs

             involving Liver pool and I was amongst the spectators of the semi-final
106*3
             in 1988 between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.

On the day of Saturday IS April        1989 (150489)   I was working a 7am

(0700)    to 10.30am (1030)     shift in my capacity as heavy plant operator

in Coxhoe in County Durham. On conclusion of my shift I returned home

and having previously made the decision I was going to try and attend
                                               *V
the semi-final at Hillsborough I set out aj^stiout 12.50pm (1250) for
            TiCvC^r
the ground. I had not got a t i c k e t game, but it has always

been my experience that even orfT al1-ticket matches tickets are

obtainable either at the^^ate or from sellers outside the ground. Last

year, at the same ground for the same semi-final           between the same

teams,    I attended on my own and on the way to the ground was able to

buy a ticket off a passing person.

I arrived in Hillsborough at about        1.40pm (1340)    having taken nearly

an hour travel. On the way I encountered a minimal delay due to other

travellers to the game.

Having parked on the Foxhill Road estate, which is on a hill,           I walked

down onto the main road,        the A61 and headed towards the ground.

There were a lot of Police around although I did not have to ask

directions as I knew the way. There were a lot of fans about even this

far from the ground, as I got closer towards the ground in the

Leppings Ln area the number of fans increased.         I did^not drink any

alcohol myself nor did I go into any pubs,        but^-iT was quite evident

that the pubs that were open were full, jj^that fans were st an ding
r         ...- .-          '   '■— ..
drinking in the doorways. It was alsj/around this time that I heard

one or two supporters who were c ] / e k r i y Liverpool   fans from accents and

scarves, asking around for tickets.        The majority of fans making their

way towards the ground were also drinking from cans,           the majority of

whom had two cans in their hands.        I did not witness any bottles,       nor

could I     say which types of beer the cans were.     None appeared   drunk,

nor did     any in my opinion    behave disorderly. I would not say    the

crowd was particularly boisterous.

I would have said thjrtT I first reached the Leppinj^r’iTn end at about

2pm   <1400)    to^ZTlOpm    (1410). At that time t h e       crowd around the ground

would hay,* been n o rm al , there was no crusft and people were steadi ly

going   into the ground.

On reflection I think there were a lot more Police in the vicinity of

the entrance,     there were two to three on each road off Leppings Ln on

barriers.      I also recall seeing more Police about the actual

turnstiles,, as many as one per turnstile although I do not recall the

Police searching fans.

I have in the past at Wembley, Anfield, J f i n e Rd and other grounds

gone to turnstiles,         offered the man     the turnst ile a couple of

pounds over the ask i ng price for Jackets, and been all owed to c 1imb

over the turnsti le and into tfajr ground.        I remember on this occasion

looking at the turnstile ajW thinking there was too heavy a Police

presence to try that mai^riod of entry. I resigned myself to buying a

ticket outside the around.         I s 1owly

walked along Leppings Ln in the general           direction of where I had

parked my car. On the way I asked what seemed hundreds of people if

they had spare tickets.         I remember one or two others asking the same

and even remember two men coming up and asking me for tickets. They

told me they were from Barnsley.          I told them with their accents they

would be better trying the Nottingham Forest end.                I would describe

them both as white males,         early twenties, about 5 ’6 - 5 ’S,     I could not

describe them further.                                    ,

As I went along Leppings Ln I recall there did not appear to be much

evidence of fans drinking until you reached the petrol station at the

end of Leppings Ln, where         it joins the A61. There was a lot of

drinking from cans but the atmosphere was happy.I went into a

bookmakers that      is next door to the petrol station and

put a bet on a horse         in the 2.30pm (1430) at Newbury races.         This would
                                                                              PAGE           4
                                                                              S -19.19

         be 2.15pm   (1415).

         I left the bookmakers and again headed along Leppings Ln back towards

         the ground asking people     if they had spare tickets.   There was a steady

         stream of fans going along Leppings Ln and again I was aware of two or

         more others asking for tickets, although I cp*il d not describe them.           I

         must have reached the actual Leppings JdCfT turnstiles at about 2.20pm

         (1420). Again I was deterred froj^trying to pay on the gats by the

         heavy Police presence. The ^/owd still appeared to be making gentle

         progress and there was ne evidence of crush at the turnstile and

         queues were moving sireadily. Although at this stage there was a build
                               C/
         up outside the entry gates to the turnst i le^ar iea. I recall there were

         two Police on horseback around the         nity and a number of foot
 * r r
U-<_.    Police about the area of the        es adjacent to the shop and near the

         ground entrance and in        vi cinity of Vere R d .

         The Police appearg^f’'to be leaving the crowd to their own devices

         whilst   creating an obvious heavy presence.    I would not say they were

         neglecting their duty.     I have been to other grounds where you are

         herded like cattle,    the Police were clearly in this case giving the

         crowd the dignity of being treated like human beings and by their

         presence,   ensuring good order.

         The   crowd appeared to be getting through the gates at a rapid pace and

         at the same time the build up was occurring due to the sheer volume of

         people now building up and arriving from both sides of Leppings Ln.

         I went back to the bookmakers at the other end of Leppings Ln and

         listened to the end of the race, my horse, Otter Gayle won and so I

         collected my winnings and started to head back towards my car having

         given up hope of getting a ticket. As I walked past the pub I know as

         The Gate on the main rd,     I was still asking for tickets.

         As I was going past a lad who was walking down the road said he had a

         spare ticket.   I was surprised so I asked how much he wanted. He
                                                                                        PAGE         5
                                                                                        S 1919

          offered me the ticket worth £6 for £7,          I ’d just had a win at the

          horses so I gave him £1Q. He g a y ^ m e ^twr^ticket which was for the

          Leppings Ln end.

          I retained the ticket number LL2 3755 and still have both portions.                    I

          would not be prepared to give the ticket up although I would be

          prepared to produce and identify it to an enquiry             (marked       )(exhibit

          No      ).

          The youth only appeared to have one ticket as he pulled it straight

          from his pocket.      I would describe him as a white male, aged £0-30 yrs,

          5 ’8, stocky build and he had a Liverpool accent.            I coul^K not describe

          him further.

          I returned down Leppings Ln towards the ground Jfhe time now being

S.o.e    _ £ .50pm (1450)   to 2.55pm <1455). At last y e a ^ f semi-final        I remember

L. U .    arriving at the ground at about 2.50pm          (jCs 0)   and there being hardly a

          person outside.     I was surprised as I approached the entrance gates how

          many more people were awaiting e n t n y . The area was packed tight. The

          crowd was virtually solid from tVe point of the shop (newsagents)

          o n w a r d s . I could see from when®   I was that within the turnstile area

          there was a lot of pressure Jhy o ve rc row di ng, and it did not help it

          being a hot day. People ware getting excited and niggly at the same

          time. We were all jockyi^g towards the turnstiles.

          I could see three or four P olice Officers werjfr/on top of a wail

          above the turnstile.     The Police were pullju^fg people from the o u t s i d e ,

          onto the w a 11 and into the ground into/what was presumably the inside

          of the ground.     I saw a steady stream of people, about twenty getting

          over   in this way.

          Just   near where I was there / e r e two Police Officers on horses trying
                                          /
          to block across the crowd and stop people getting inside the gate

          They were near to useless in the size of the crowd as had now

          gathered,    but they were doing all they could have done.
                                                                      PAGE      6
                                                                      S 1919

I would not say I was pushing but there was a natural movement from my

side of the crowd towards the gates. The crowd could not have been

moving   in as fast as we were moving.    It was clear to me at this point

that the crowd nearer the centre of the entrance would be getting

crushed and a clear danger zone was beginning.

By about 3.02pm <1502)   I would,   by way of unvoluntary crowd movement,

have reached one of the turnstiles.      I think it was about the fourth

turnstile from the left as you approach the ground.        I reached the

turnstile and passed my ticket through the gate to the man on the

turnstile. He said I was at the wrong gate.      I said there was no way

that with the pressure I could get to another gate. The man returned

the ticket and retaining both ticket and stubb I was allowed through

what was a free-wheeling turnstile and to the best of my recollection,

people were passing through freely behind me.        I can not remember    if

there was a Policeman on the gate.

Straight   in front of me as I entered was stairways, which I knew to

lead to the seating in the W Stand. There were Police and Stewards at

the stairs.   I could only describe the turnstile man as a white male

in excess of 50 years.   I could not describe him fur th er.

I surrendered my ticket to a Policewoman at the bottom of the stairs.

She examined it and told me it was for standing and advised me to go

around and through the tunnel.      I remember actually saying to her,

"People are going to be killed here today,      I've never known anything

like it coming through those turnstiles."

Knowing the ground as I did,   I did not want to go down the tunnel as I

knew I would be fenced in too much.      It was my intention to go around

the side of the stand and into the terracing near the Police control

box.                                            jf

As I was going along   I remember seeing sodfe/large blue concerteena-

type gates with a perspex viewpiece window near the handles. The gates
                                                                                    PAGE       7
                                                                                    S i 919

are on the exterior wall            leading out to the turnstile area and are

roughly in line with the t u nn el .

I could see a fans face through the perspex a j m r e m e m b e r             thinking    I

could give my ticket out and let someona/Blse get in.

There were some Police on top of th e/w a11 still and a few more around

the back of the gate and the turjjfstile, about ten in total.

I went up to the gate,           knocked the p e r s p e x ^ o t   the l ad ’s attention and

started to pass the ticket underneath Jm e gate. As I did a Policeman,

a Sergeant         I think,   because he had yn,ripes, knocked me, told me not to

do it but to get my ticket and gjft, myself off into the ground.                    I could

only say this Policeman was whivte, male 45 yrs, 6*0,                     pointed helmet,

well   b ui 1t .

The Policeman suggested to me I was trying to open the gate which I

was not,    but I could clearly see the gates had no locking device and

could have been opened very easily by anyone. They would only                       have had

to lift an alloy pin into the ground and pull the gates                       open. The

gates appeared to open from side to side to the be^;t of my knowledge.

On bei ng_ told this I went straight around J^Jst^right side of the stand

into the wings and stood on the terr^€fe near the ba c k . By the t ime I

had took my position the game wajT'al ready on.                    I was roughly in line

with the eighteen yard line.

Almost as soon as I had got in I noticed fans were climbing over the

perimeter fencing onto the track behind the goal and Police were

pushing them back in.

I noticed it was very full            in the area behind the goal.            I did not know

what was going on but only a minute or so later fans

started to spill onto the pitch and a Police Officer went to the

Referee. The game was stopped and the players milled around.                      I can not

remember any Police in the terrace but I do remember a Policeman

asking the crowd to move out around the sides.

A young man who was crying came past and said the game would not go

on,   there were dead bodies. Although I did not know what was going on,

nor were I tightly packed or crushed,          it was obvious ^sojjMrthing t rag i c

had occurred.                                               ^

Together with others      I started to assist    i n jj-fifss ijpgWomen, children

and others up the back wall      into the W S#apdf'seating. These people

were very concerned and had come f rpdpThe front of the terraci ng and

without question we passed themy^Tp to the upper         levels.
                                     ./
I would not say I saw or did^anything more of a vital n^rtrfe.             I stood
                                                 O iyc               5 )n/ G p
in shock watching      what was going on and     assisted^Dy passing the odd

broken advertisement hoarding forward          to hp/'u.sed as a stretcher.

My only observations of what occurred/<St+ter was a lack of

announcements      informing people of/what occurred and what we should do.

I would also comment that although I saw a Pol^fCrian and Policewoman

in the right side of the eighteen yard boa^givj.ng heart massage and

mouth to mouth,     there appeared to be j f   lot of Pol ice Officers standing

around apparently doing very 1itt^fe. T he casualty I saw had a light

beige pair of trousers, was a r / e 1derly gent with a beer belly.

There did not appear to be A n y order in the emergency services u n t i 1

the arrival of the Fire ^rigade at 4.15pm         <1615).

I continued to watch the scene until       I left the ground at about

4.30pm   (1630).   I could not offer any further      information regarding any

specific deaths.

I would describe myself as a white male 34 years, 5*11,            fair

complexion,   fair medium length smart hair.       I would have been wearing

red shoes,    blue jeans,   red open neck t-shirt and a grey jacket with

red flash on my left forearm.      I have a Liverpool       tattoo of the club

motif and name.

I would be prepared to attend the enquiry and produce my ticket as an

exhibit.

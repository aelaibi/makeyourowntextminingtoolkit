Dear Mr Budgen


You wrote to Mr Moynihan on 22 April 1989
enclosing one from Mr           about the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Miss Bannister,
in her letter of 18 May 1989, mentioned that
your letter and your constituent's had been
forwarded to me as the Secretary to the
Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
Taylor who has noted it.

                                Yours sincerely

As you know, your letter of 22 April to Mr Moynihan enclosing
  is one from Mr                         of
  lverhampton, was passed on to the Home Office for a reply.

Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the Inquiry set up under Lord Justice
Taylor, to investigate the events at Hillsborough in order that
the Inquiry may take account of the points your constituent
raises.   Mr Whalley can be contacted at this address.

                          Dear Mr Budgen

                          You   wrote   to   the Parliamentary   Under
                          Secretary of State on 22 April     enclosing
                          a letter from Mr               about safety
                          at football grounds.

                          However, as the matter seems to be primarily
                          for the Home Office, I am passing your letter
                          to that     Department asking them  to reply
                          to you d i r e c t .

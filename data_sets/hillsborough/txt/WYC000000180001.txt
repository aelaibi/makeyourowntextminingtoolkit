Dear Dr. Doherty,

Thank you for your letter of the 9th May, which I have received today. Of course the
evidence given at the inquest is technically public in that the public are not excluded from
Court proceedings. However this does not mean that the post mortem report in full is
public property. I am concerned in all cases to observe appropriate confidentiality. If you
have a copy of the post mortem report you will see that it is headed "Private and
Confidential, not to be disclosed to any person without the consent of the Coroner". Before
I go further I should be glad if you would let me know how you came by a copy of the post
mortem report, if indeed you have it. I see that you refer to post mortem findings. Would
you be good enough please to clarify this point, after which I will endeavour to be as helpful
as I possibly can.

Yours sincerely,



J. A. Turnbull

  Dear Mr Turnbull,

  May I request your opinion.  I have in my possession a copy of the
  post-mortem findings on Tony Bland.  Is this now public knowledge
  and if so would it be in order to include it in a future edition of
  the Catholic Medical Quarterly?.

  May I also ask, if this is possible, could we also have a copy of the
  neuropathological examinations?.

  I am the editor of the Quarterly .

  Yours sincerely,




  Dr Peter Doherty

        Dear Mr Turnbull,

        Thank you for your letter regarding my request for permission to
        publish the post mortem findings   on Tony Bland.

        As a member of SPUC they allowed                         me to see a copy of thefindings
        for which I understand they paid                         an appropriate fee.

        Our members, who you will understand are medically qualified, would
        find the report particularly interesting especially the neuro
        histopathology which was not included with the prime report.

        In fact one of our members, a deputy coroner himself, gave me his
        opinion that it would be in order to publish the findings as they
        were made public at the inquest.

        Thank you for your assistance.

        Yours sincerely,




        Dr. Peter Doherty

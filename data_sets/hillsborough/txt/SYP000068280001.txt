         As I said we were tightly packed and I could not move I could not turn

         around even if I had wanted to, there was no room to move.

         We were possibly half way to the turnstiles where two girls stumbled

         in front of us, they did not fall onto the floor,                    I don't think there

         was enough room they were compressed as I was.                     They managed to regain

         their balance and move with the crowd again.

         around to check on my son,           I could see that his chest was close to

         the wall of the turnstile and that his left arm was up against the

         wail to stablise himself, and save him from being crushed up against

         the wall.        pushed him back and shouted at people behind him to eas

         off.   I managed to move him backwards and then pull him into the

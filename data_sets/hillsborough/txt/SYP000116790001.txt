                      conclusion,         I was directed to take up my point.

                      I was a member of serial           13 under the supervision of Police Sergeant

                      Constable 2592 Sh i m w e l 1.      We were deployed at the base of the

                      stairway leading up to the seated area in the West S t a n d .             There are

                      two such stairways and we were positioned on the one leading into

                      the stand above the pens numbered f o u r , five and s i x .           Our duty was

                      to assist the six stewards also at this location.                 When the fans

                      entered the ground from the/Lepp^r^s Lane end at 12.00 a.m.                  they were

                     admitted to the^West S t a n d , having first had their tickets checked by

                      the s t e w a r d s , each were then torn at the corner to prevent         it being

                     used again by fans            in the terraces below.      A steady influx of fans

                     were admitted throughout the a f t e r n o o n .        All tickets were checked and

                     admission gained only by those in possession of a ticket for the

                     seated a r e a .      Throughout this process many tried to come back down

a St. John's member who then assisted f u r t h e r .                  This then enabled

Pol ice Constable S hi mwe l1 and myself to continue onto the perimeter

track,         where we joined several other officers also attending in this

area.          On our arrival on the pitch we were confronted by the sight of                      j
many Police Officers immediately in front of the West Stand terrace.                               j

I also saw numerous fans standing on the pitch and my immediate

thoughts were that there had been an incident          involving fighting.          As

I approached the perimeter fencing I saw a Pol ice Inspector assisted

by two male Pol ice Constables p u l 1 ing people through the gate of pen

number 2.    This area of the terrace appeared to be well packed

although I was not aware that anyone was being c r u s h e d .      I could see

people immediately behind the fencing and they did not appear unduly

distresed although the officers p u l 1ing people free were having

difficulty because the volume of people seemed concentrated around

the g a t e . At this time I also saw further officers climbing onto the

advertisement boards in front of pen 3.          These officers shouted at

the fans to move back away from the f r o n t .      Again I did not see

anyone unduly distressed and from my position I saw that although the

pen was full of f a n s , there was room toward the back to accommodate

more.    A short time later I heard fans inside pen number 3 shouting

that they were being crushed and that there were people un d e r n e a t h .

I then spoke briefly with Police Sergeant 1288 P a y n e , who averted my

attention to an elderly gentleman pressed tightly against the f e n c e .

He was purple coloured and his mouth gaped o p e n .        I could see he had

been crushed to death and the weight of fans behind him was holding

him tightly against the f e n c e .   Yet still there was room at the back

of the pen and we cont inued shout ing for them to push b a c k .        I was

now fully aware of the situation occurring before me and I looked for

the exit gates from where these people could be released from the

pressure.    I could see only one gate providing an exit from this

pen.    At the gate several officers were attempting to pull the people

free.   This was made very difficult by the bodily pressure of others

immediately at this p o i n t .   H o w e v e r , one by one bodies were pulled

out of the p e n .   Whilst this process co n t i n u e d , other officers

standing against the fencing encouraged people to reach for their
                                                                              PAGE    4:

hands and tried to pull them up and          over the perimeter fence.    For          i

some reason they were reluctant to do so, perhaps because they were

so tightly packed they could not get an arm free to reach up.                 Many

fans were successfully recovered by this method and ushered onto the                   ;

pitch to clear the immediate area.           During this process I recall              ■

looking up onto the seated area above the terraces and saw many fans

being pulled from the terraces into          the stand.                                t

On the arrival of Chief Superintendent Nesbit,             1 was instructed along

with other officers to form two lines on each side of the gate to pen

3.   This I did and from this point I assisted with the removal of

bodies being pulled from the pen.           As each one was freed then the

line passed them along u n t i 1 the last two officers removed them to

the pitch and rendered first aid.           As the process continued I saw

many bodies r e m o v e d , all of which were purple coloured and had

urinated onto their clothing,          they seemed to be dead, but even so they

were given mouth to mouth resuscitation and heart massage in an

attempt    to revive them.       Whilst assisting with this process many of

the fans already freed approached the area in a distressed s t a t e ,
                                                                                       1

         to the effect that the fans In the Vest Stand were becoming

         increasingly agitated and together with other officers,                  X stood in

         the terrace below the stand where I could hear the fans shouting

         abuse and pulling the boards away from the front of the stand.                      1 was

         then concerned for my safety and returned to the pitch where I was

         asked by a Police Sergeant to remain with his serial until further

         instruction. After a short while I again located Police Sergeant 1288

         Payne and further          'El’ o f f ic er s.    Together we waited for further

         instruction and when the match was officially called off, we made our

         way into the North Stand.                   Before doing so I located and joined

         Police Sergeant 2001 Burman in the seated area of the West Stand,

         where I assisted serial                13 search for property that may have been

         left behind.

               At 8.30 am on Saturday,          15 A p r i 1 1989,    I came on duty at Hackenthorpe

L              Police Station in relation to duties to be worked at the F.A. Cup

               Semi-Final at Hillsborough later that d a y .

               I was under the direct supervision of Pol ice Sergeant 2001 Burman of

               Hackenthorpe Pol i c e .

               Together with other officers I was conveyed to Hi 1lsborough via a

               Police Transit van and upon arrival             there I attended a briefing in

               the North S t a n d .   The briefing w a s /t'ale           Chief S u p t . Duckenf ield

               and on conclusion of this briefing I nad a p&ciigsi lunch m e a l .

               My duty was to patrol        in the Vest Stand paying particular attention

               to the front row in order to prevent persons standing on the terraces

               of the Leppings Lane end from climbing up into the seated a r e a .

               I commenced these duties at 11.15 am that day after having consumed

               my m e a 1.

               Once in the West stand I was assigned to work at the front right hand/

               centre of the stand,       looking directly over Pens 2 and 3.

               Initially there was only a few fans enter ing into the g r o u n d , these

               filtering through from about 11.30 am.                 All were good humoured and

               appeared to be either middle aged or parents with young children.

From talking to the fans as they started filling the stand all were in j
                                                                       i
good spirits and generally pleased to be there. Quite  a few said how  j

pleased    they were to be    at Hillsborough again and commented on    how

good a ground it was.

From mid-day onwards the ground generally started to fill and it was

apparent that the Kop end of the ground was filling quite quickly.

By 2 pm the West Stand was still only about 1/4 full but I saw that

the standing areas of the Leppings Lane end had filled nicely.               The

Pen marked 3 was completely full by this time with Pen 4 still having

spaces.    Pens 1 & 2, 6 & 7 were thinly covered with people.

The behaviour of the fans in Pen 3 was generally good.           They were          j
                                                                                    I
singing songs and larking about amongst themselves.                                 j
                                                                                    i
At about this time I saw a youth who I would describe as being               white, j

m a l e , 20 yrs heavy/fat b u i I d , 6 ’ tall with short dark curly hair           j
                                                                                     i
wearing a green open necked shirt.           This youth was stood on a barrier       j

in Pen 3 and was gesticulating to the rest of the crowd in order to                  ;
                                                                                     i
get them singing e t c .     In hindsight I believe this barrier was the             I

one that collapsed.

Also around this time another youth with a red shirt and blond hair
                                                                                     ■i
was climbing on a barrier      in this pen and was diving forward into the

crowd.    He did this several    times u n t i 1 it appeared that the crowd

had had enough and a few words exchanged.

Throughout this period there was a lot of pushing and shoving within

the P e n , this being the "normal" sway as is found on most Kops and                j

standing areas at football m a t c h e s .   Another youth who stuck out was a       j
white m a l e , 18 y r s , siim buiId with blond/peroxide/straw shoulder             j
length hai r wearing a chain m a i 1 type shi rt coloured silver/charcoal,           j
                                                                                     i
This youth was sat on a s m a l 1 wall directly under the front of the

stand.    This wall was at the entrance to Pen 3 directly at the end of

the tunnel   that allows fans to enter the Pens from the tu r n s t i l e .
                                                              n<r      page

He was asked several times by Sgt.      Burman to get down but he replied:

"Fuck off" and just blatantly ignored the instruction.          After about

5 minutes the youth eventually got down and then      ’got lost in the

crowd'.

As it approached 3 pm I saw that both Pen 3 & 4 were totally full and

still    there was ample room in pens 1 & 2, 6 & 7.       By 2.50 pm the

stand was full with a lot of people congregating at the front of the

stand.    Throughout this time I had to tell several youths to get down

from standing on the small wall at the entrance to the tunnel and

from standing on the dividing fences between Pens 2/3/4.           All the

youths spoken to complied straight away.

By the time the game kicked off all people in the stand had returned

to their seats.     I took up a position at the very front right hand

corner of the Vest Stand next to the emergency e x i t .      I was also

joined there by PC 1494 N a y l o r .

A few minutes into the game I became aware of several youths trying

to climb up from the standing area of Pens 3/4 and into the seating

area.    As it was my duty to prevent this from happening I went to the

area but by this time several youths had      'escaped'    into the stand.    I

returned to the emergency exit.

The next thing that I became aware of was when people were climbing

over the pitch perimeter fence from pens 3/4 and onto the ground.

The game was then stopped and the teams left the field.

By thi s time people were pour ing onto the pitch and total confusion

as to what was happening was apparent.

At first I thought    it was a bit of fighting in the crowd that was

causing the disturbance and it was about 5-10 minutes before I

realised that people were being hurt      in the pens below.

Whilst this was happening on the pitch and in the pens I noticed

quite a lot of fans were entering the ground to the right of the
                                                                                   PAGE      4
                                                                            fS     ^39        I

stand   (near to the Police r o o m ) .        As they passed under where I was               j

standing several shouted up towards me:                 "IT'S A SHAME WHAT YOU                j

BASTARDS HAVE DONE OUT THERE,             YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE OPENED THE D O O R S ."

Others said that they had either climbed over the fences or broken a

door down.      Obviously I was in no position to comment since I had no

idea as to what had occurred at the turnstiles.

As the minutes passed it became quite obvious that people were dying

on the pitch.        Several were already laid out dead whilst               lots were
                                                                                              ■

being r e s u s ci ta te d.    The attitude of the fans became very aggressive                j

towards us (Police) and we had to take a lot of verbal abuse since                            ;

they d i d n ’t think we were doing a n y t h i n g .      Reports from the radio        (BBC)i

had reached the fans that people were dead and then panic appeared to                            j

get into the f a n s .        A lot wanted to leave the g r o u n d .      Some wanted to        !

know if the match was going to be r e s u m e d .           Many were openly crying

and saying no not again            (reference to H e y s e l ).

As the events on the pitch progressed more and more people wanted to

leave the ground but I had received a message from Pol ice Control                               1

order ing that no fans were to be allowed to leave in order to assist                             ;

the ambulance/fire s e r v i c e .       When asked by the fans why they c o u l d n ’t          ;

leave I informed them of the r e a s o n .          A l 1 complied with the order                J

agreeing it was for the b e s t .                                                                j
                                                                                                 i
On the pitch I saw several fans either assaulting or simply pushing                              |
                                                                                                 i

resuscitating p e o p l e .      Personally I think this action was due to                    j

panicked people finding friends etc dying and simply wanting more

done for their f r i e n d s .

More and more people tried to get to the front of the stand in order

to see what was happening in the pens below.                      It was apparent that

fathers were in the stand w h i 1st their sons were stood in the p e n s .

Due to this many people in the stand were getting extremely agitated
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                          es     R39

         and upset wanting to get down to the pitch level.

         By now I had been joined by PS Burman and we decided that our best

         course of action was to stick together near to the emergency exit

         from the stand in order to prevent people from leaving.

        As time passed more people from the back of the stand came to our

         position trying to l e a v e .   A lot were clearly intoxicated and we had

         to suffer a lot of verbal a b u s e .

         As fans from the pens below started to leave the ground lots were

         urinating against the walls.        Eventually by about 4 pm the ground was

         cleared.    Following this together with the rest of my serial I went to

         the North Stand for debriefing.

         I must point out that throughout this incident I remained at the

         front of the West Stand and had no involvement with the events taking

         place on the pitch.      I felt it necessary to remain at this point in

         order to prevent people evacuating the ground and p a n i c k i n g .

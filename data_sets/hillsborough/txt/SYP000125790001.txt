AT THE TIME TWO OF THE OTHER PEinPT.fi! TH&rp MRPR WITH ME WERE KILLED IN THE
CRUSH, THEY WERE PAUL BRADY,                                I,LIVERPOOL
AND JOSEPH MCCARTHY, ADDRESS NOT KNOWN.
t o b imwTPn PT?PWON THAT WAS WITH ME WHO ALSO SURVIVED THE INCIDENT WAS
                  J ADDRESS NOT KNOWN, TEL. LIVERPOOL           (WORKS NO)
IN MY OPINION TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE LET IN AT THE SAME TIME THROUGH THE
SAME GATE IN THE MIDDLE WHICH CAUSED THE CRUSH.

T ^ CALLER HAS STATED THAT HE WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR INTERVIEW FOR A WEEK
AS HE IS GOING AWAY TO VISIT RELATIVES.

WHEN THE CRUSH FIRST STARTED THE POLICE JUST LOOKED THINKING IT WAS THE
NORMAL SURGE. I WAS DISGUSTED WITH THE PRESS THEY COULD HAVE HELPED RATHER
THAN STAND AROUND TAKING PHOTOS, I KNOW SOMEONE HIT ONE PRESSMAN AS HE WAS SO
ANGRY. I GOT OUT OKAY I'VE JUST PULLED A MUSCLE IN MY BACK. I ATTENDED THE

 SAW THE WHOLE INCIDENT, BUT WAS NOT AWARE THAT ANYONE HAD BEEN KILLED. WHEN I

THE GROUND BEFORE SO I MANAGED TO MOVE TO MY RIGHT AND GO INTO PEN 2. THERE
WERE NO STEWARDS OR NOTICES TO ASSIST PEOPLE TO MOVE TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT OF
THE TUNNEL. I COULD SEE THAT THE TUNNEL WAS COMPLETELY FULL OF PEOPLE BUT
MORE WERE TRYING TO FORCE THEIR WAY INTO IT.I HAVE NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT
FIRSTLY IF THE GATE HAD NOT BEEN OPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE
GROUND WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN STEWARDS TO ASSIST
PEQgLE INTO THE GROUND AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE SHUT OFF PENS 3 AND 4 WHEN
TH^P COULD SEE IF WAS FULL

AND I FELT QUITE SORRY FOR HIM BECAUSE THERE WERE NO POLICOFFICERS ON FOOT
UNTIL WE GOT INTO THE TURNSTILES. THERE WAS NOONE TO TELL YOU WHBRS TO GO AND
YOU COULDN'T SEE THE ENTRANCES UNTIL YOU GOT TO THE TURNSTILES. IT WAS QUITE
CONFUSING. I WENT TO MY SEAT. I REALISED THERE WAS SOME TRAOUBLE MORE OR LESS
AT THE KICK OFF AND I WENT TO LOOK OVER THE WALL INTO THE TERRACES. THERE
WASN'T A LOT PEOPLE COULD DO. I DON'T THINK THE POLICE COULD HAVE DONE
ANYTHING. I THINK THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THERE WAS NO ONE TO DIRECT PROPLE INTO
THflkEMPTY PENS, AND EVEN BEFORE THE KICK OFF THERE WERE PEOPLE BEING PULLED
UMcNTO THE STAND FROM THE TERRACES AND THEY WERE CLIMBING OVER THE SIDE
FENCING.

MOST OF MY FRIENDS WERE IN THE NORTH STAND.

IMPRESSION THAT ONCE ON THE TERRACING I WOULD BE ABLE TO WANDER ALL OVER.
MYSELF AND MY FRIENDS WERE STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE GOAL DIRECTLY
INFRONT OF THE BARRIER. AT ABOUT 2.45PM THE TERRACING WAS STARTING TO GET
REALLY CROWDED, I DECIDED TO MOVE AS I COULD SEE THAT THE SIDE PENS WERE
EMPTY. I TURNED TO MOVE BUT WHEN I SAW JUST HOW CROWDED THE PEN WAS I KNEW I
HAD NO WAY OF MOVING. IT WAS GETTING VERY FRIGHTENING, I COULD HARDLY BREATHE
I WAS NOT REALLY AWARE OF ANYTHING ELSE UNTIL THE GAME HAD STARTED. PEOPLE
WERE SHOUTING TO THE POLICE THAT THEY WERE BEING CRUSHED BUT THE POLICE WERE
NOUL DOING ANY THING. I WAS BEING CRUSHED, SOMEBODY FROM ONE OF THE SIDE PENS
    |ED ME TO SAFETY, ONCE I WAS IN THE SIDE PEN A POLICE OFFICER CARRIED ME

STARTED. I COULDN'T BREATH AND WAS LIFTED UPWARDS WITH EVERYBODY'S PUSHING.
PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING TO STOP THE GAME. I SAW SOMEBODY TRY TO GET OVER THE
FENCE BUT A POLICEMAN PUSHED HIM BACK INTO THE CROWD. THEN THE POLICE
REALISED WHAT WAS GOING ON WHEN OTHERS TRIED TO GET OVER THE FENCE AND A
POLICEMAN RAN ONTO THE PITCH, HE MUST HAVE STOPPED THE GAME. THE BPOLICE WERE
SHOUTING FOR US TO MOVE BACK FROM THE FENCE WHILE WE WERE STILL BEING
CRUSHED. I EVENTUALLY GOT OVER THE FENCE AND ONTO THE PITCH. FANS WERE
RIJEING THE ADVERTISING BOARDS DOWN AND A POLICEMAN THREATENED HIM WITH
AI®3T. I WAS REALLY DIZZY BEFORE I GOT OVER THE FENCE AND A POLICE WOMAN
HELPED ME OVER.

INFO      »  THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION AT THE TURNSTILLES. WHEN WE GOT THROUGH
             THE TURNSTILESEVERYBODY HAD TO GO THROUGH THE TUNNEL. AT THE END
             OF THE TUNNEL WERE TWO GATES.BOTH THESE GATES WERE LOCKED. THERE
             WERE NO MARSHALS OR ANYONE TO DIRECT US. I DONT KNOW HOW I
             MANAGED TO ESCAPE BUT SOMEHOW OR OTHER I WAS LIFTED ONTO THE
             BARRIER AND HAD TO CLIMB OVER THE BODIES TO ESCAPE. THIS WE HAD

THE POLICE CONTROL BOX IS IN THE NORTH STAND AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE
MIDDLE PENS WERE HEAVING AT 2.15PM WHY COULDNT THE POLICE CONTROL BOX SEE
THIS AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT EARLIER ON. PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING TO BE LET
OUT BUT NOBODY TOOK ANY NOTICE. I HELPED CARRY THE DEAD BODIES AND RIPPED
DOWN THE BOARDS TO USE AS STRETCHERS. I JUST CANT BELIEVE THIS HAS HAPPENED.
LACK OF ORGANISATION

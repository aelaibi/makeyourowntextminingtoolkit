              1 am a m ar r i e d man and                  live at the above        addr e s s    with my wife and

              daug h t e r .

              I have a part time                 job at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football     C lub where       I

              work as a turnstile                  operator.        I have held this             position for the        past

              four       or five years.

              3! was     at work          on S a tu rd ay     "15th April    1989    < 150489) , at the

              H i l l s b o r o u g h ground for           the Semi Cup Final          b e t w e e n Liverpool     and

              N o t t i n g h a m Forest.          I sta r t e d work at about          1130 hours/-          I was    posted

              to the S p i on Hop P e n ni st on e Roa d and                 I believe       it                  kile No

                    ]-•- I was        in and o p erating         my turnstile at akourx            1200 hourfe.        This

              tur n s t i l e was ma i n l y for N ot t i n g a h m Forest             fans a l t h o u g h   1 had been

              b r ie fe d       earlier       that an a rea of the S p i o n Kop had been d e s i g n a t e d              for

              Liv e r p o o l     fans.

             This was an all          ticket m at c h      no money had          to be taken. There was a

             gradual        trickle   of N o t t i n g h a m Forest       fans thro u g h my

             tu r n s t i l e - there was      no queuing - pushing              or    rush to enter        the

             ground.         To my k n owledge       no Liverpoi          fans went      through my turnstile

             although        I c^an't be     certain as their             club colours are          the same      red ant

Ca   t       whi t e .

TICX£T       Be twee.              hrs and    1445 hrs one man           came    to my turnstile           he offere?

                                  entry.     I think      it was a £.5 note •■■■■ it made me              laugh

                ‘cause      the   tickets were £6 w hi c h were all              sold out anyway,            I told

             him to go away ~ I ’ve never                 accepted a bribe            there,     I enjoy the        job

             a n d the      security w a t c hi ng   us    is excellent         its not w orth        it to fiddle,

             This    is a regular o c c u r re nc e        of   people    trying       to bribe us m a i n l y at

             the    big all       ticket m at c h e s and usually         the a way      supporters.         Beca u s e

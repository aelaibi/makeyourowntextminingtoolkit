STREET POLICE STATION, ROTHERHAM.


REPORT RE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 1989



At 8.00 am, on Saturday,         15th April 1989,   I commenced duty at

M ain Street Police Station,        Rotherham.   At this time I was in

full Police uniform forming part of Serial 38 which was under

the supervision of Detective Sergeant Tissington, with our

serial,     together with Serial     37 under the direct supervision and

control of Inspector Ellis.



A short time later together with other officers, we were

c o nveyed via a force coach to Hill sborough Football Ground.        On

our arrival at this stadium,         we all assembled in the North Stand

of the ground where we received a pre-match briefing regarding

the F.A.      Cup Semi Final between Liverpool and N o t tingham Forest.



On conclusion of this briefing at approximately 10.50 am, all

m embers of our Serial made our way to phase one of our duties

being to position ourselves at the junction of Halifax Road with

W a l l s e n d Road.   The duties of our Serial at this location were

to meet mini-buses and vans which mainly contained Liverpool

fans as they travelled down Halifax Road after leaving the Ml

motorway.        The drivers of these vehicles were then asked to park

them along Wallsend Road.          Tickets were then to be checked and

supporters       searched for any form of offensive weapon which they

may be carrying.
                                  - 2 -



Shortly after positioning ourselves at this point a steady flow

of m i n i-buses and vans began to arrive.      Most,   in fact,   nearly

all of the occupants of these vans accepted our instructions and

advise regards to the parking of their vehicles particularly

when it was pointed out to them it was possibly the nearest

available    location to the ground,   they were going to find.

Whilst speaking with the supporters as they alighted from their

vehicles,    it became apparent that some of them had been drinking

heavily, w i t h large quantities of empty beer and lager cans

littering the floors of their vehicles,       although the general

mood of these persons was one of high spirits and good humour.



Du ring the time spent at this location the level of both

vehicles and pedestrians passing our point grew progressively

heavier as the kick-off time of the Semi-Final approached and it

was noticeable that large amounts of canned beer was being

consumed by these persons although their mood was still one of

good nature.



On numerous occasions,    my colleagues and I were approached by

persons alig h ti n g from mini-b uses and   passing our point asking

where   they may find a public house that was open and where they

could gain entry.     The Railway Hotel which is situated at the

junction of Halifax Road and Wall send Road, despite giving the

appearance   of being closed was in fact open for business at this

time,   but the licensee had on this day adopted a policy of

a l lowing selected customers only into his premises via a rear

door.
We c o n t i n u e d     to c a r r y out our d u t i e s            at this       location       and ev en

fifteen         or t w e n t y m i n u t e s    be f o r e k i c k - o f f    tim e we w e r e     b eing

approached            by fans,      many carrying              an d c o n s u m i n g can s      of alco h o l

asking        for d i r e c t i o n s    to the H i l l s b o r o u g h St adium.                I got the

impression            tha t m a n y of t h e m di d          not k n o w or a p p r e c i a t e      exactly

how     far     the     ground actually            is f r o m this           p oint    (at l east      | of a

mile     away      f r o m w h e r e we w e r e       stood)        an d as a r e s u l t m a n y h u r r i e d

off d o w n      Halifax       Road towards            the     Stadium .

Just     before         kick-off        time,    Detective           S e r g e a n t T i s s i n g t o n gave

the     order      for us      to leave         this    l o c a t i o n and w a l k to C l a y w h e e l s

Lan e   w h e r e we w e r e       to r e c e i v e    refreshments.



As we w a l k e d d o w n H a l i f a x         Road,       a la rge n u m b e r of s u p p o r t e r s

were     still making            their way towards                  the g r o u n d and       I again     saw

tha t m a n y      of t h e m w e r e     c a r r y i n g a n d c o n s u m i n g cans      of    beer as

they     di d    so.       As we w a l k e d a l o n g       the     footway,         I could     see that

on b o t h      sides      of the p a v e m e n t s ,       surrounding walls              a n d gard e n s

were     littered with what seemed                      hundreds          of e mpty bee r         cans.



Upon     nearing Claywheels                  Lane,     Detective          Sergeant Tissington,                  the

only member             of our     Se r i a l w h o ha d a radio,               s t o p p e d us and

informed         us that       there were          crowd       problems         at the L e p p i n g s    Lan e

end     of the        ground.       By this        time,       we we re       joined by s e v e r a l

other     Serials who were                under       the    c o m m a n d of    I n s p e c t o r M e e k an d

Inspector          Charles.         Inspector Charles                  the n a t t e m p t e d to c o n t a c t

between         tha t    o f f i c e r an d c o n trol,        he    i n s t r u c t e d us all    to h e a d

towards         the     S t a d i u m via the L e p p i n g s        Lane e n t r a n c e .
On n e a r i n g        the g r o u n d s     entrance        at L e p p i n g s Lane,       Inspector

Charles         o r a n g i s e d all       the    officers       in t heir r e s p e c t i v e       Seri a l s

at its        road       j u n c t i o n w i t h V e r e R o a d w h i l s t he a g a i n       tried          to

contact         ground        c o n trol.         Eventually,          he r e c e i v e d a m e s s a g e      to

the     effect          that a s s i s t a n c e was        now a matter          of u r g e n c y    and as a

result        he     instructed         us to e n t e r the gr o u n d and go to the

Leppings           Lan e end.



Upon       r e a c h i n g the L e p p i n g s        L ane en tr ance,        we w ere    a p p r o a c h e d by

a number           of    supporters who               w e r e v e r y host i l e and s h o u t i n g abuse

towards         us.        I saw t h a t       some    of the         fans w ere      b l o o d s t a i n e d and

som e      a p p e a r e d to be      i n j ured,      c l u t c h i n g at t h e i r ches t s .          As    I

neared        the       tunnel w h i c h g ives          ac c e s s    to the t e r r a c e s ,      b e l o w the

West       Stan d,       I sa w s e v e r a l      people      lyi ng on the          flo or w i t h others

attempting              to give      t h e m the      ki ss    of life.         The    scene      as a w h o l e

was     one     of      gre at c o n f u s i o n      w i t h fans p u s h i n g and s h o v i n g oth er

persons         both       in a n d out of            this tunnel.            I c o u l d see     tha t

officers           an d s u p p o r t e r s    alike were         ha v i n g g reat d i f f i c u l t y        in

trying        to c a r r y w h a t a p p e a r e d       to be mor e         injured persons              f rom

inside        the       tunnel,     but w e r e       b e i n g h a m p e r e d an d f r u s t r a t e d by

those       supporters           s till       t r y i n g to e n t e r the tunnel.              Together

with       other members            of m y S e r i a l        I wen t in to the t u n n e l           an d     found

it to be c o n g e s t e d w i t h m a n y m o r e              i n j u r e d people,       so me     actually

lying       in the         tunnel     its el f.        As     I t r i e d to p u s h m y w a y        through

the     tunnel          I saw t h a t m a n y       of the people wer e               in an h y s t e r i c a l

state       almost         one of b l i n d        p a n i c all around.           Fans w e r e       shouting

at m e d e m a n d i n g to k n o w w h e r e we ha d been and why                          it h a d t a k e n

us    so    long,        in t heir eyes,            to get      to the terra ce s.
They were           all v e r y      hostile         towa r d s    us,    clearly very         frightened

by w h a t       ha d h a p p e n e d .        I c o u l d hea r m ore       shouting       and screaming

coming       f r o m the d i r e c t i o n         of the t e r r a c e and on r e a c h i n g this

se c t i o n ,    I pushed my way                 to the left of the d i v i d i n g               fen ce past,

more      supporters were                 i s s u i n g abu se     towards      us b o t h v e r b a l l y and

physically.



As we      tried        to get to the              front of the t e r r a c e , I c o u l d see that

it w a s     b l o c k e d by p e r s o n s        who were        frantically          trying      to get

o n t o the       p it ch .     As     I t r i e d to get to t hese p e r s o n s ,                I, an d

other      officers,          were        spa t    at,     k i c k e d at a n d p u n c h e d at,      as    I

attempted           to do so.             As    I r e a c h e d the p e r i m e t e r    fencing

surrounding             the pitch,             I saw in fro nt of the p e r s o n s                still

pushing          t o g e t o nto the           pit ch ,     a p ile of a p p r o x i m a t e l y     tw o        or

three      bodies         lyi ng at        the     base of the           fencing.         By this       time,          I

had      become       detached         f r o m m y Serial w h o ha d o b v i o u s l y             gone to the

right      of the dividing                     f e n c i n g but    t o g e t h e r w i t h a n o t h e r Police

Officer who             I didn't          know,      I d r a g g e d one     of t hese      bodies      by his

legs      out     of the pile.                 On d o i n g so,     I sa w that         it wa s     a ma n       who

f ac e    a n d b o d y was       almost          ashen     in colou r,        and eyes      gl azed.            The

other      Police Officer                 b e g a n m a s s a g i n g his    h eart w h i l s t     I b egan to

give      h i m the kiss          of      lif e    although         I s u s p e c t e d tha t he c o u l d

possibly          a l r e a d y be dea d.            I would        say tha t he was m e d i u m to

late      twenties,           overweight           w i t h d a r k hair.



As we      c o n t i n u e d to try a n d rev i v e                this man,      I c o u l d s ense that

other      p e r s o n s wer e       kicking         the    fencing away          just a b o v e m y h ead

An    officer     then s h o u t e d at me and stated tha t                      they had created a

gap    in the     fencing        a n d as a res u l t         t o g ether w i t h the       assistance

of o t h e r o f ficers,         we    l i f t e d this ma n t h r o u g h       the    g a p an d h a n d e d

the    side    of the goa l           post.       I the n f o l l o w e d this m a n        by als o

climbing       t h r o u g h the      ga p in the f e n c i n g        but on s e e i n g th at the

officers       had s t a y e d w i t h       this man,        I then w e n t      towards       a large

other     persons who          f r o m the      facia l      appearances         were    obviously

I remember        one bod y         in p a r t i c u l a r   of a w o m a n w h o      I and oth er

                                                                                                   two

other     officers         had b e g u n     to gi ve her        first aid,         I went      bac k to

A s h o r t time       later,          I r e t u r n e d to the w o m a n

                                                                                                          Two or

with     these       officers          I assisted          in c a r r y i n g he r a c r o s s       the p itch

Throughout           this         time,     the m o o d of the S t a d i u m was             one     of pan ic

frightening            situation            to be in.

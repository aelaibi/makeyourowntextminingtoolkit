 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 JUST AFTER WE ARRIVED OUTSIDE THE GROUND (AT ABOUT 1420/1425 HRS)           IT APPEARED

 AT THAT TIME THAT THE POLICE ON HORSES MOVED THEIR POSITION TO ALLOW FURTHER

 PEOPLE INTO THE CROWD AT T H E TURNSTILES.         IT WAS APPARENT AT THIS STAGE
             CA < -  S ckX a , O tffa a te .
 IH E POLICE HAD LOST CONTROL OF TbjjE / R Q K D.    ONE OTHER OFF ICER ON HORSE BACK

 WAS OVER BY THE TURNSTILES T f ^ P E D ^ L N   WITH THE CROWD.   HE JUST RODE THROUGH

 THE PEOPLE TO ESCAPE.

 ONE OTHER THING THAT SURPRISED ME WAS THAT NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO SEARCH

 PEOPLE GOING INTO THE GROUND.

ft>M OF THE OPINION THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO OPEN A GATE INTO THE GROUND

 IN ORDER TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE ON THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE AT THE TURNSTILE.

 I CONSIDER THAT THE MAIN CAUSE WAS THAT PEOPLE WERE NOT QUEUEING.

 I DO FEEL THAT THE FANS INVOLVED SHOULD HAVE BEEN INFORMED OVER THE LOUD

 SPEAKERS OF WHAT WAS OCCURRING AND INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO

 THOSE ON THE TERRACES IN AN EFFORT TO RELIEVE THE CRUSH SITUATION.

 WHEN I HAD CALMED DOWN I ASSISTED MOVING A BODY ON AN ADVERTISING BOARD,

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE POLICE STOOD IN THE WEST STAND COULD HAVE SEEN WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE

 i#     BUT THEY HAD ALL LEFT BY 3PM (1300).   THE WIRE CUTTING EQUIPMENT WAS

 DIRECTED TO THE WRONG PLACE.     I SAW IT IN THE TUNNEL ON THE WAY OUT.      IT

 SHOULD HAVE SEEN ON THE PITCH.

 THE POLICE WERE FORCING PEOPLE BACK OVER THE FENCE INTO THE PEN WHEN THEY

 SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE.     THEY WERE GEARED FOR A RIOT AND NOT A DISASTER. THERE

 WAS A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING BY SOME OF THE POLICE.

 G!30

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 4.30PM (1630).

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS          STOPPED?

 THE POLICE STILL TREATED US AS HOOLIGANS , EVEN AFTER THE DISASTER.

 THERE SEEMED NO CO-OPERATION BETWEEN ALL THE EMERGENCY SERVICES,

 THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK Or COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE THEMSELVES.

 I DID NOT SEE ANY USING RADIOS.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT       YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 EVEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME, THE POLICE SEEMED AS IF THEY HAD NO

 i ^ W L E D G E OF HOW TO CONTROL CROWDS.    IT WAS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT AT A BIG

 GAME.    I WAS AMAZED AT THE NUMBER OF POLICE JUST WANDERING AROUND DOING         S(Cyl^

 NOTHING. PEOPLE WERE DRINKING AND DOING WHAT          THEY LIKED ANDTHE POLICE WERE

 JUST WALKING PAST. THE       TICKET ALLOCATION WAS WRONG, LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE       GONE

 TO THE BIG END.

 AT LEAST 20 PEOPLE ASKED ME IF I HAD A SPARE TICKET.          IT MUST HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS

 TO THE POLICE THESE PEOPLE WERE AROUND, AND THEY DIDN’T DO ANYTHING TO GET RID

 OF THEM, EVEN AT THIS EARLY STAGE.          IT WAS BUSY OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND THE

 POLICE WEREN’T EVEN TRYING TO CONTROL IT.

 ^y H E   GAME LAST YEAR THE POLICE WERE FAR        SUPERIOR,THEY   WERE CHECKING PEOPLES

TICKETS, ANYONE WITHOUT TICKETS WA SN ’T ALLOWED NEAR THE TURNSTILES.           LAST YEAR

WHEN I ARRIVED AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME THERE WAS AT LEAST 2 POLICEMEN   StO'! 3
                             Lu& c-       i^vm:
CONTROLLING THE CROWD AT THE TUNNEL AND THERE GENERALLY SEEMED TO BE MORE

POLICEMEN THERE.

WHEN POLICE FORMED A CORDON ACROSS THE PITCH IT HEIGHTENED THE TENSION. THESE

POLICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING WITH THE DEAD AND INJURED, AND NOT JUST-

BOTHERING ABOUT THE VIOLENT SIDE OF IT.

THE POLICE COULD & SHOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE SYMPATHETIC & UNDERSTANDING & NOT

TREATING US AS HOOLIGANS,.

THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE AND THE FANS AS
                                                                               f M UC          H..i

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

WITH REGARD TO THE POLICE, THEY D IDN’T REALISE WHAT WAS HAP~PENXNG AND WHEN

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THE PENS INSIDE GROUNDS SHOULD BE ABOLISHED AND TAKEN DOWN,    IF

 NOT MORE EMERGENCY EXITS MANNED BY PEOPLE TO LET PEOPLE IN AND OUT.

 RE-DESIGN THE FENCING SOMEHOW, TAKE THE SPIKES OFF ESPECIALLY.

 THIS YEAR IT WAS A NONENTITY REGARDING THE ORGANISATION.

 AFTER TyE MATCH WAS STOPPED?                       ( X   J U   J (    2    ■

 I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY NEED FOR THE LARGE AMOUNT                OF POLICE WHO STOOD

 ACROSS THE PITCH TO SEPARATE       THE FANS, ALSO THERE WERE ABOUT 30           STANDING

 AROUND THE BROKEN     BARRIER IN   PEN 3 APPARENTLY DOING       NOTHING AND SOME

 OF THEM COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER EMPLOYED HELPING THE INJURED.                   IT SEEMED TO BE

 ALL THE FANS WHO WERE DOING THE FETCHING AND CARRYING.


020

 054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

iftbAN APPRECIATE WHY THE GATE WAS OPENED BECAUSE OF THE HUGE CROWD OUTSIDE,

 BUT ONCE THEY WERE LET IN THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN POLICE TO TELL YOU TO GO

 TO THE SIDE STANDS AND THEY COULD HAVE SHUT THE GATE TO THE TUNNEL ITSELF.

 I DON'T THINK THE     TERRACE DESIGN    WAS A CONTRIBUTORY       FACTOR JUST THE SHEER

 NUMBERS OF PEOPLE     IN IT.

 THE POLICE WERE NO USE AT ALL.       FEOp/ e     WERE SCREAMING AND THEY WERE

 BEING PUSHED BACK IN.     THE POLICE ^AGGRAVATED THE SITUATION.

 WHEN THE CROWD HAD THINNED OUT,       I SAW A LAD LYING ON THE FLOOR, THOUGHT

 HE WAS ABOUT 7 YEARS OLD OR SO.        THERE WERE TWO OR THREE LADS KNEELING

WITH HIM, SAYING HE WAS ALIVE, BUT THEN THEY SAID THAT HE WASN’T.
                                                                              r    tl>-
 HE WAS ACTUALLY LYING AT MY FEET.        I WAS LOOKING DOWN AT HIM, HE WAS

 WEARING A STRIPED TEE SHIRT, HE HAD SHORT DARK, CURLY HAIR.        I TRIED TO

 BRING HIM AROUND, STARTING WITH HIS CHEST, WE GAVE UP IN THE END.

 ABOUT THREE YARDS TO MY RIGHT,       I SAW PEOPLE STANDING UP, THEY LOOKED

 ALRIGHT, BUT SOME OF THEM WERE OBVIOUSLY DEAD, THEY WERE JUST STILL, LEANING

AGAINST EACH OTHER, AND I SAW A BLUE FACE UNDERNEATH.         WHEN I GOT OUT,

EVENTUALLY,        I HELPED PEOPLE ONTO THE PITCH WHO COULDN’T BREATHE.   PEOPLE

 WERE GIVING EACH OTHER THE KISS OF LIFE.

^ERE         WERE SOME AMBULANCEMEN TRYING TO BRING A MAN ROUND, AND I SHOUTED

 A POLICEMAN TO HELP ME, BUT HE STOOD THERE WITH HIS HAT IN HIS HANDS AND

 DID NOTHING.        THEN THEY COVERED THE MAN’S FACE WITH A TEE SHIRT.   I

 WASN’T ACTUALLY STANDING ON ANYONE.

END OF REPORT

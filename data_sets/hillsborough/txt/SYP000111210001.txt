At    1200       hours          the       remaining               turnstiles             were          opened        in t hi s       area        and a

steady          trickle             of    Liverpool               f a ns       started           to    enter        the    ground.           This

continued             until          1340         hours       with         s m all      but       steady         numbers         filing          in.

The    fans          were       sufficiently                  f ew     in n u m b e r            t h at     we w e r e     able      to    search

the m a j o r i t y            if    not      all       of    them         before        entry.               Many    of       the   fans,           even

fr o m as        early          as       1 130     hours,          were         entering              the     ground with            breath

smelling             of a l c o h o l .            They were               not     however             sufficiently affected                          by

the    drug          to    be       denied         entry          or a r r e s t e d         (or       there        were       not   the     u su a l

In a n y        case       to       h av e    arrested             all         persons           affected would                 have      depleted

the P o l i c e           presence            in the          area         to     nil    extremely               quickly.            I saw

dozens          of    fa ns         sitting         and       hanging            about           in the        Leppings          Lane      area

and    in       particular                on the         bridge            over        the       river,        who    were       consuming
intoxicants                out    of    cans.           These        people         were        in the          main male               and        in

the    teens          to    thirties             age    range.            There       were       also        dozens           of    p eop l e

who    were       without             tickets          for    the        match.          They were              milling            around

outside          the       turnstiles             and       in the        r oa d    generally              causing            a    nuisance

and an          obstruction.                 I personally                 told m any            to      lea v e       the         area and              on

several          occasions             the       mounted        officers            were        used       to    sweep            them        out       of

the    area.           They       k ep t     on    returning              and      the     ideal        would         have         been        to

arrest          them       for    obstruction                however         this        again would                 h a ve       been

counter          productive             in       reducing           the    Police          numbers           in the           area.

1.   believe          t hat      there       were       about        30     to 40 P o l i c e           Officers              in the

Leppings Lane                   area    at       that       t ime    as    w el l     as    the       officers             forming             my

At    1340       hours ,         Police          Constable           3066 Huckstepp                   and       I arrested               S.

       '     , a male            and    a female,             who        were      trying        to     enter         the         ground           with

several          cans       of    l a ge r       secreted           in    the      females           large       handbag.                Both

                      were     treading           on    but    t h e y w o u l d n ’t l isten.               Many    of    these       people

                      smelled         strongly         of     intoxicants            and      in m y     opinion many            were       drunk.

                      There      was     an all         pervading           sm ell    of      stale      alcohol         in the     air.

                      I   then    saw      that        officers        outside        the       pen    on the       pitch,       together           with

                      fans     in the       pen w e r e        pulling        and     kicking          at    the    mesh     fence       at    the

                      front      of     pen CN.          They       succeeded         in t e a r i n g       the m e s h     away      and     via

STEPHEli JOHN PAYNE.   33YRS. BORN       FOLIOS SERGEANT 1288. E DIVISION
HACKSNTHORES


At 083O on Sat 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at Hackenthorpe Police
Station Sheffield and together with other Police officers was transported
to the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground at Hillsborough for duties in
connection with the Football association cup semi final between Nottingham
Forrest and Liverpool which was due to take place later that day*
On arrival at the ground I was given my match serial briefing sheet by
Inspector Purdy to whom I was to be directly responsible throughout the
game. We then moved to the North stand for the full briefing by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield and others* My serial was number 16 which
consisted of myself plus 10 Police Constables* These were 1* PC 3066
Huckstepp 2. PC 2980 Wright 3. PC 1715 Best b. PC 115 Huckstepp 5. PC
259 Coney 6 , PC 607 Taylor 7, PC 963 Evans 8 , PC 620 Yates 9. PC 1C&7
Duffy 10. PC 2076 Cerrone* My briefing sheet outlined duties at the
Leppings lane end of the ground, both outside and inside the West stand*
It also showed the Inspectors in that area to be Insp Purdy and Insp.
Sykes*
On completion of the main briefing, Inspector Purdy and I briefed serial
16 in detail about our duties and responsibilities* At 1100 hrs we moved to the
rear of the West stand where we were furthur and similarly briefed by
Inspector Sykes* In phase 1 (from 1115 hrs to kick off) serial 16 would
be responsible for turnstiles A to G of the Leppings Lane end, outside
the turnstiles* Maintaining order, queues, searching people for alcohol
banners, missiles etc* Phase 2 ( during the game) we were to move into the
upper West stand and maintain order and in phase 3 ( 10 minutes before
the end onwards) we were to be on duty outside the ground in Leppings
lane*
At 1130 hrs, one of our turnstiles opened and in view of this I deployed
my serial outside the ground in the area directly outide the turnstiles
A to G on the attached plan.These turnstiles give access to the West
end terraces which is standing room* They are formed as 1 single turnstile
with the other 6 formed in pairs, a total of 7* This makes in effect k
doorways to Police, In view of this I deployed 8 officers in pairs to
cover these doors and the remaining 2 officers were teamed up with Insp
Purdy and myself* PC 10k? Duffy being my partner*
At 1200 hrs the remaining turnstiles were opened in this area and a steady
trickle of Liverpool fans started to enter the ground This continued until
13^0 hrs with small but steady numbers filing in* The fans were sufficiently
few in number that we were able to search the majority if not all of them
before entry. Many of the fans, even from as early as 1130 hrs , were
entering the ground with breath smelling of alcohol* They were not however
sufficiently affected by the drug to be denied entry or arrested ( or
there were not the usual symptons of drunkeness to have enabled a
succesful prosecution*) In any case to have arrested all persons affected
would have depleted the Police presence in the area to nil extremely
quickly* I saw dozens of fans sitting and hanging about in the Leppings
lane area and in particular on the bridge over the river, who were
consuming intoxicants out of cans* These people were in the main male and
in the teens to thirties age range * There were also dozens of people who
were without tickets for the match* They were milling around outside the
turnstiles and in the road generally causing a nuicance and an obstruction,
I personally told many to leave the area and on several occasions the
mounted officers were used to sweep them out of the area. They kept on
returning and the ideal would have been to arrest them for obstruction
however this again would have been counter productive in reducung the
Police numbers in the area.
I believe that there were about 30 to 40 Police Officers in the Leppings
Lane area at4"that time as well as the officers forming my serial.
At 13bO hrs, Police Constable 3066 Huckstepp and I arrested 2 people, a
male and a female, who were trying to enter the ground with several
cans of lager secreted in the females large handbag* Both smelled of
intoxicants and both admitted having been drinking lager prior to the
attempted entry. The female was arrested for attempting to enter the
ground in possession of alcohol, and the male v/as arrested for obstructing
me in the execution of my duty in that he had physically and violently
tried to stop officers from searching both himself and the girl. In view
of these arrests, PC 3066 and myself left the Leppings lane end with the
prisoners in order to take them to the Police Hoom for booking in •
The detention procedures were completed by 1*KX) hrs and the arrest papers
then had to be completed. PC 3066 was unable to complete hers as she was
required to act as warder for the female and in view of this I went to the
gymnasium and there completed the paperwork. In view of this I did not
return to the outside of the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
Whilst in the gym I had ray radio switched on and between 1W? hrs and 1500
I could hear ever increasing traffic concerning the crowd conditions
at the Leppings Lane end of the ground* I recall hearing recmests for
assistance and more men, I recall hearing messages that people were being crushed
injurred and that the crowds were out of control, the Police overwhelmed*
I heal'd reference to opening a gate or a request to open a gateand then
a few minutes later 1 heard a voice say ’open the gate, open the gate*
This would have been about 1^55 to 1500 hrs.
About 1500 hrs someone came in to the gym and rounded up all complete
serials which were there, some eating meals. They left and I was left
in the gym with just a few officers, some doing paper work and others
in charge of radio issue etc* About 1505 hrs I heard a radio message to the
effect that all officers available were to attend on the periudter track
of the pitch at the leppings Lane end of the ground. No reason was given*
1 immediately left the gym and walked briskly onto the pitch area from
the corner between the Kop and the North stand. I saw that play had stopped and
the teams were just in the process of leaving the field. I walked across
the pitch and as I did so I lookeed at the large clock on the South stand.
It showed about 7 minutes past 3* I saw a large number of Police on the
track facing the West stand and terraces and I saw fans either climbing or
attempting to climb the fence from the terraces onto the pitch from the
2 centre pens which are indicated as CN and CS on the attached plan. These
2 pens looked full where as the outer pens N and S on the plan did not.
At first I thought that the crowd were attempting a pitch invasion or were
otherwise misbehaving however as I reached the fence I could see straight
away that people were being crushed against the wire fence on the perimiter
and were trying to escape this crush.
I went to gate 5 as shown on the attached plans. This gate leads into a
channel or alleyway between pens N and CN. this alley is formed by a
substantial spiked top fence about 7 feet in height on either side and
running from the front to back of the terraces. I could see that people were
climbing from the front EH corner of pen CN into this alley and from there
out of gate 5 onto the track I spent several miniates pulling people out
of this gate along with another sergeant and a constable. I then forced
my way into the alley with the constable and we both assisted people to
climb over the spiked fence from pen CN into the alley. This was accomplished
by allowing people to use us as a ladder. After 5 minutes or so the crowd
in this pen thinned out sufficiently for me to see in at ground level*
                                                                                 ■\
                           3.


I saw that there was a female form laying on the floor beneath the front
boundary wall of the pen CN close to my position. There were 2 or 3 people
knelt over her giving heart massage and mouth to mouth resuscitation.
I climbed up and over the spiked top fence from the alley into the pen
and at the same time I used the radio to request an ambulance for her*
Once in the pen I had no sooner checked that the women was being properly
treated than I saw what appeared to be a fight furthur along the front
fence by gate k as shown on the plan. This gate opens onto the pitch
close to the rear of the goal. I went across and saw that people were fighting
to get out of the gate. There was a heap of bodies laying on the ground
tmder the wall where this gate is situated,:,about 3 or 4. Other people
were clambering ontop of these bodies which appeared lifeless in an effort
to get out. people had fallen and the result was a log jam effect through
which no person could escape. I informed control by radio about the
apparent dead and requested more ambulances. I then tried to pull people
away from the gate in order to reach the injurred/ dead underneath. As I did
so many fought and punched out at me, many were in a blind panic. I tried
to explain that the danger was over as the crowd had thinned out and I
tried to point out the people who they were treading on but they wouldn’t
listen. Many of these people smelled strongly of intoxicants and in my
opinion many were drunk. There was an all pervading smell of stale alcohol
in the air.
I then saw that officers outside the pen on the pitch, together with fans
in the pen were pulling and kicking at the mesh fence at the front of pen
CN. They succeeded in tearing the mesh away and via this route the bodies
were removed along with 2 or 3 who were carried from the rear . I then saw
other officers enter the pen from the rear who were in the process of
clearing people out into the rear tunnel.
Once pen CN was cleared I left it and climbed into pen C S where bodies
both live and dead were being removed in large numbers. I assisted in this
process until this pen was clear and then moved to gate 2 in the S pen
where furthur people were being carried out from the rear. I then spent
quite a long time on the pitch near the goal assisting with heart massage
and sorting out the living from the dead. This process was being constantly
interfered with by liverpool fans who were drunk and being a nuicance although
the majority of fans in the area at that time were well behaved and of
tremendous help. During this period I did see several young male fans
picking up money, wallets and other items which had obviously fallen from
the pockets of casualties. Some of this may have been with good intent but
some was no doubt theft as the 'offenders* made off quickly when I made to
challenge them.

STEPHEN JOHN PAYNE



Police Sergeant 1288



At 0830 on Saturday 15 April 1989 I caimenced duty at Hackenthorpe

Police Station, Sheffield and together with other Police Officers was

transported to the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground at Hillsborough

for duties in connection with the Football Association Cup Semi Final
                                                                                       i
between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool which was due to take place

later that day.

On arrival at the ground I was given my match serial briefings sheet

by Inspector Purdy to whcm I was to be directly responsible throughout

the game.   We then moved to the North Stand for the full briefing by

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and others.     My serial was number 16

which consisted of myself plus 10 Police Constables.     These were 1.

PC 3066 Huckstepp; 2. PC 2980 Wright; 3. PC 1715 Best; 4. PC 115

Huckstepp; 5. PC 259 Coney 6 . PC 607 Taylor; 7. PC 963 Evans; 8 . PC

620 Yates; 9. PC 1047 Duffey; 10. PC 2076 Cerrone.     My briefing sheet

outlined duties at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, both outside

and inside the West Stand.     It also showed the Inspectors in that area

to be Inspector Purdy and Inspector Sykes.     On completion of the main

briefing, Inspector Purdy and I briefed serial 16 in detail about our

duties and responsibilities.     At 1100 hours we moved to the rear of

the West Stand where we were further and similarly briefed by

Inspector Sykes.     In phase 1 (frctn 1115 hours to kick off) serial 16

would be responsible for turnstile A to G of the Leppings Lane end,

outside the turnstiles.    Maintaining order, queues, searching people

for alcohol, banners, missiles, etc.     Phase 2 (during the game) we
                               -   2 -




were to move into the upper West Stand and maintain order and in Phase

3 (10 minutes before the end onwards) we were to be on duty outside

the ground in Leppings Lane.

At 1130 hours, one of our turnstiles opened and in view of this I

deployed my serial outside the ground in the area directly outside the

turnstiles A - G.   These turnstiles give access to the West Stand

Terraces which is standing roctn.    They are formed as one single

turnstile with the other 6 formed in pairs, a total of 7.     This makes

in effect 4 doorways to Police.     In view of this I deployed 8 officers

in pairs to cover these doors and the remaining 2 officers were teamed

up with Inspector Purdy and myself, PC 1047 Duffy being my partner.

At 1200 hours the■remaining turnstiles were opened in this area and a

steady trickle of Liverpool fans started to enter the ground.     This

continued until 1340 hours with small but steady numbers filing in.

The fans were sufficiently few in number that we were able to search

the majority, if not all of them before entry.     Many of the fans, even

frctn as early as 1130 hours, were entering the ground with breath

smelling of alcohol.   They were not however sufficiently affected by

the drug to be denied entry or arrested (or there were not the usual

symptoms of drunkenness to have enabled a successfull prosecution).

In any case to have arrested all persons affected would have depleted

the Police presence in the area to nil extremely quickly.      I saw

dozens of fans sitting and hanging about in the Leppings Lane area and

in particular on the bridge oyer the river, who were consuming

intoxicants out of cans.   These people were in the main male and in

the teens to thirties age range.     There were also dozens of people who

were without tickets for the match.      They were milling around outside

the turnstiles and in the road generally causing a nuisance and an

obstruction.   I personally told many to leave the area and on several
                                   -    3 -




occasions the mounted officers were used to sweep them cut of the

area.   They kept on returning and the ideal would have been to arrest

them for obstruction however, this again would have been counter

productive in reducing the Police numbers in the area.       I believe that

there were about 30 to 40 Police Officers in the Leppings Lane area at

that time as well as the officers forming my serial.

At 1340 hours, Police Constable 3066 Huckstepp and I arrested 2

people, a male and a female, who were trying to enter the ground with

several cans of lager secreted in the females large handbag.       Both

smelled of intoxicants and both admitted having been drinking lager

prior to the attempted entry.   The female was arrested for attempting

to enter the ground in possession of alcohol, and the male was

arrested for obstructing me in the execution of my duty in that he had

physically and violently tried to stop officers from searching both

himself and the girl.   In view of these arrests, PC 3066 and myself

left the Leppings Lane end with the prisoners in order to take them to

the Police Rocrn for booking in.       The detention procedures were

completed by 1400 hours and the arrest papers then had to be

completed. PC 3066 was unable to complete hers as she was required to

act as warder for the female and in view of this I went to the

gymnasium and there completed the paperwork.        In view of this I did

not return to the outside of the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

Whilst in the gym I had my radio switched on and between 1445 hours

and 1500 I could hear ever increasing traffic concerning the crowd

conditions at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.        I recall hearing

requests for assistance and more men, I recall hearing messages that

people were being crushed, injured and that the crowds were out of

control, the Police overwhelmed. I heard reference to opening a gate

or a request to open a gate and then a few minutes later I heard a
                                  -   4 -




voice say 'open the gate, open the gate1. This would have been about

1455 to 1500 hours.

About 1500 hours someone came in to the gym and rounded up all

complete serials which were there, some eating meals.      They left and I

was left in the gym with just a few officers, seme doing paperwork and

others in charge of radio issues etc.       About 1505 hours I heard a

radio message to the effect that all officers available were to attend

on the perimeter track of the pitch at the Leppings Lane end of the

ground, no reason was given.    I immediately left the gym and walked

briskly on to the pitch area from the corner between the Kop and the

North Stand.    I saw that play had stopped and the teams were just in

the process of leaving the field.      I walked across the pitch and as I

did so I looked at the large clock on the South Stand.       It showed

about 7 minutes past 3.    I saw a large number of Police on the track

facing the West Stand and terraces and I saw fans either climbing or

attempting to climb the fence from the terraces on to the pitch from

the two centre pens.    These two pens looked full where as the outer

pens did not.   At first I thought that the crowd were attempting a

pitch invasion or were otherwise misbehaving, however as I reached the

fence I could see straight away that people were being crushed against

the wire fence on the perimeter and were trying to escape this crush.

I went to Gate 5.     This gate leads into a channel or alleyway between

one of the outer and one of the centre pens.       This alley is formed by

a substantial spiked top fence about 7 feet in height on either side

and running from the front to back of the terraces.       I could see that

people were climbing from the front right hand corner of one of the

centre pens into this alley and from there out of Gate 5 on to the

track, I spent several minutes pulling people out of this gate along

with another sergeant and a constable.       I then forced my way into the
                                  -   5 -




alley with the constable and ws both assisted people to climb over the

spiked fence fran the same pen into the alley.     This was accomplished

by allowing people to use us as a ladder.     After 5 minutes or so the

crowd in this pen thinned cut sufficiently for me to see in at ground

level.

I saw that there was a female form laying on the floor beneath the

front boundary wall of the pen close to my position.     There were two

or three people knelt over her giving heart massage and mouth to mouth

resuscitation.   I climbed up and over the spiked top fence from the

alley into the pen and at the same time I used the radio to request an

ambulance for her.    Once in the pen I had no sooner checked that the

woman was being properly treated then I saw what appeared to be a

fight further along the front fence by Gate 4.     This gate opens on to

the pitch close to the rear of the goal.     I went across and saw that

people were fighting to get out of the gate.     There was a heap of

bodies laying on the ground under the wall where this gate is

situated, about three or four.    Other people were clambering on top of

these bodies which appeared lifeless in an effort to get out.     People

had fallen and the result was a log jam effect through which no person

could escape.    I informed control by radio about the apparent dead and

requested more ambulances.    I then tried to pull people away from the

gate in order to reach the injured/dead underneath.     As I did so many

fought and punched at me, many were in a blind panic.      I tried to

explain that the danger was over as the crowd had thinned out and I

tried to point out the people who they were treading on but they

wouldn't listen.     Many of these people smelled strongly of intoxicants

and in my opinion many were drunk.      There was an all pervading smell

of stale alcohol in the air.
I then saw that officers outside the pen on the pitch, together with

fans in the pen were pulling and kicking at the mesh fence at the

front of one of the centre pens.   They succeeded in tearing the mesh

away and via this route the bodies were removed along with two or

three who were carried frcm the rear.   I then saw other officers enter

the pen from the rear who were in the process of clearing people out

into the rear tunnel.   Once the other centre pen was cleared I left it

and climbed into the adjacent pen where bodies both alive and dead

were being removed in large numbers.    I assisted in this process until

this pen was clear and then moved to gate 2 in one of the outer pens

where further people were being carried out from the rear.    I then

spent quite a long time on the pitch near the goal assisting with

heart massage and sorting out the living frcm the dead.    This process

was being constantly interferred with by Liverpool fans who were drunk

and being a nuisance although the majority of fans in the area at that

time were well behaved and of tremendous help.     During this period I

did see several young male fans picking up money, wallets and other

items which had obviously fallen from the pockets of casualties.       Sane

of this may have been with good intent but some was no doubt theft as

the 'offenders' made off quickly when I made to challenge them.

               On    the way          to H i l l s b o r o u g h       we    did    not     stop,       but w e r e     delayed         by

               volume          of    traffic         on    the      M56 Stockport.                I d i d see        other     supporters

               drinking             alcohol         outside         Pubs     in S h e f f i e l d .

               We    arrived          in S h e f f i e l d       at    134 5      hours     and    parked      off      M i d d l e w o o d Rd.

               Whilst          walking         to    the      ground        I saw m a n y      groups       of P o l i c e     but      we    d i d n ’t

               require          Police         direction            as we      followed        the      crowd.

               On    th e      way    to   the       ground         I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y      ten N o t t s       Forest      fans

               picking          for    fights           but    we     ignored       them and           they were        quickly         dispersed

There    were       j u st     too      many      pe ople.            I did          not       see a n y       stewards.

I did    not       have      any     difficulty               finding           the       entry       p oint        but     did    have ■

difficulty          trying         to     get     to      the    tuih%^tiles.

Eventually          I sa w a g a t e            to     the      r ight         of    she       turnstile            being       opened

although       I d i d n ’t see w h o                by    so                   and       I went         through          it    i n to       the

ground.        We      were     followed             in by a b o u t            t en      to    twelve         other        p e opl e.

Whilst       I was       waiting          to     enter        the     gr o u n d ,        I saw       children aged

Jiir te en     to      fourteen           years,          climbing             on    to a w al l           which       separated                 the

terrace    turnstiles and West Stand turnstiles.

I did    not h a n d m y t i c k e t in but I do not s t ill                                         h av e    it as        I eventually

ripped       it up.

Once    i nsi d e      the     ground          I saw a          big       letter          8 above          a tunnel.              I took

this    to    be    leading          to    the       terraces             so    I went          into       the      tunnel.            I. ha d

free    passage          along       the       tunnel.           I*did          not       see      any     stewards            or P o l i c e

in or a r o u n d        the    tunnel          area.

I did    not       see    any      disorder            or a n y       other          incidents             in the         ground         at

this    time.          The     atmosphere              wa s     happy          and       everyone          was      singing.             I

did    not    see      anybody          drinking           alcohol.                            \           A ,

I made       my way       to    the       left       of    the       tunnel          and       into^ P e n f o u r , w h e r e               I

stood    near       the      back.                                         x

I did    not       see a b a r r i e r           break        in P e n         threh^.         I was       no w h e r e        nea r     it.

The     time       I stood         in P e n       fo ur       wa s    about          1501       hours.

On    entering         Pen     four,       I was          subject          to       crushing.                          even       remarked

that    there       was      no w a y      we w o u l d         be a b l e          to    stand       h er e     for      90 minutes,                  I

agreed.

Even    at    t h is     time      people         were        shouting              to    open       the      ga te s.

I found myself                  being          gradually              carried and            pushed               down        the Pen.               I ha d

some     control             o v er    my      f eet       but      I was       on   tip     toe.                At    one        time                    and

I had        to    stoop        below          a    c r a s h b a r r i e r to a v o i d            being              crushed

I fel t       a gradual               surge         as     s o o n as       I entered Pen                    four.            The       pressure

b e h i n d me      k e pt      coming             in.      I did         suffer        a bruised                 r ight          hip.        I think

this     happened             when       I tried            to a v o i d a           crush     barrier.

I had        nearly          cleared           it w h e n m y            ri ght      leg    and         hip       became              crushed        on

th e    corner          of    it.

Further           down       the P e n         I saw a n            elderly          gentleman               aged 50-60                 y e a r s,    with

black        and    grey        hair,          with        a stubble,             slightly              bent          over        a    crush

barrier.            He       w as     crying          out       for      help.        I saw       tears               weld        in his       ey es

and     his       face       w as     a grey          co l o u r .        I spoke          to h i m a n d              tried           to    push     him

ba ck    with my arm                  that         was     f re e     but    there         were         too m a n y           people          behind

him,     forcing             him      forward.              There         was     nothing         el se               I could          do.

As     I continued              to     be      pushed           along       the      Pen,     I remembering                           seeing       t h is

man     again,          th is       time       his       face       was     blue.          I think               he     had       died.

I know                       got      out      of     the       Pen      before       me.      I sa w             him        on       the    pitch and

wa s    able       to    ra ise        my      hand        to    let      him     know      I was            alright.                  Luckily        I
                                                                            pen G A T e         .
had     been       pushed           towards           the       pens      o p e n ga te.          I stepped                   up       onto    the

step and was                 pulled         out       by    two       Policemen.

I lay        on    the       pitch       and        got     my      breath        back      and         then with                             I walked

around        the       pitch         j us t       talking          to    other       fans     from Runc or n

stood        in P e n S e v e n .

After        the    game        wa s     stopped,               I noticed            that     it t o o k a b o u t                    twenty

minutes           before        an am b u l a n c e             arrived         on th e      scene.

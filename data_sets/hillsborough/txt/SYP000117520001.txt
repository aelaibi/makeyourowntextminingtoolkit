POLICE CONSTABLE 122

ATTERCLIFFE POLICE STATION D2




At 8.00 am Saturday 15 April 1989, I reported for duty at Attercliff Police Station.

I expected    to work until approximately 8.00 pm that same evening.

At 8.30 am I attended at West Bar Police Station, for a briefing regarding the FA

Cup semi-final at Hillsborough.        The Sergeant in charge of me that day was Police

Sergeant 840 Wright, Serial 13.        Our duties were to attend at the Midland Station

and supervise the arrival of the Liverpool fans frcrn both service and special trains

and to escort them to the ground, via PSV vehicles.         At this tiiae.I was partnered

with Police Constable 2118 Beaumont.

At approximately 12.20 pm we left the Midland Station on a PSV full of Liverpool

suporters and stayed on the PSV until we arrived at the Leppings Lane entrance to

the ground.     Upon our arrival at approximately 12.45 pm,       I saw several- thousand

Liverpool suporters,       stood and sat outside the ground.     After all the fans had

disembarked fran the PSV, we attended at the Police Rocm, to await the arrival of

the rest of our Serial.

At approximately 2.50 pm, Sergeant Wright received a radio message, requesting our

attendance at the Leppings Lane entrance.       Upon attending at the ground side of the

turnstyles, I saw several police officers, the ranks of which I do not know, looking

through the glass panel in the gates.        They seemed to be debating whether or not to

open the gates.       It was decided that due to the large number of fans outside, this

was not practicable.       As I made my way to the gate at the far left of the turnstyle,

Gate B,   I saw several people sat on the floor and they appeared to be short of

breath.   Several people came up to me and stated that people would die outside the

turnstyles unless we did something about it.         I could see through the turnstyles
that there were serval thousand people outside, pushing against the turnstyles.                We

then went to the main gates at the left of turnstyles B and to the best of my

knowledge this was open by the steward, to let myself and Police Sergeant Wright

through.     As far as I am aware no other officers followed us through this gate and

the gate was shut immediately after us.                 As we walked round the corner, I could see

that the area up to the turnstyles and beyond the blue gates prior to the turnstyles

was ammassed with fans.              Myself and Sergeant Wright appealed to the fans to move

back and give     the   people           near to the turnstyles rocm to move and breath.        We
                           t   ' v   t       1

informed them that unless they did so there was a great chance that scmeone would be

injured.     At this time there were several police horses also in attendance.               As we

were shouting to the fans, scmeone behind me, I don't know who, shouted, "Let the

fans through this side gate."                    There was then a sudden surge as both fans frcm

within the barriers to the turnstyles and those outside, moved towards the gate.

After abot 10 minutes this area started to clear.                During the push on the turnstyles

several fans climbed the wall to the left of the turnstyles and over the roof of the

turnstyles and into the ground.

Sergeant Wright then shouted that we were requested on the pitch infront of the West

Stand.     We re-entered the ground, via the gates that we had ccrne out of and gathered

the rest of our Serial and ran down the right hand side of the ground behind the

South Stand.     At one point our way forward was blocked by a gate, which needed to be

opened by a steward.     This took about 2 minutes.             We then ran down a tunnel and onto

the pitch, infront of the West Stand.                  As we attended infront of this stand, I saw

that several supporters were already on the pitch, several of them ran up to me and

said, "Get in there, there are people dying in there."                We ran towards the stand and

entered a pen to the left of the centre stand.                 We made our way towards the fencing

between these two.      I could see that the volume of people was so greaty^that it was

virtually impossible to move.              We started to lift people over the fence and into the

next pen, with the assistance of sane of the supporters.                I cannot remember who else

attended in that pen with me.               I do not remember how many people I assisted out of
that pen, but I do know that on removing sane of them, I could not find any signs of

a pulse, or breathing.    I saw several people collapse by the railings and be crushed

by the people behind them.      I spent about half a hour in that pen, taking people

over the fence and to a small exit gate that led onto the pitch, where I handed them

to other police officers.     At this time I was spat at and verbally abused by fans

who stated that it was all our fault.      Seine of the fans inside the pen in which I

attended, appeared to have consumed large amounts of intoxicants.      Upon clearing the

front end of the centre pen, I could see that there was approximately twenty people

layed, either unconscious or dead on the terrace.     These people were either removed

via the gate in their pen, or lifted over the fence and taken out through the gates

in the pen I was in.

Upon ensuring that there was no injured fans left within that stand, X returned to

the pitch.     I was then aware that the fire brigade and ambulance services were in

attendance.    I saw layed on the pitch several bodies, which were covered by items of

clothing.     The Liverpool supporters were tearing down advertising boards and using

them as stretchers to convey the      injured to the far end of the pitch.     I made my

way towards the centre of the pitch and joined Police Sergeant Wright and several of

our Serial.    Whilst stood with those officers, several fans approached us and said,

mYou couldn’t give a fuck about how many have died today, all you re interested in

is how much you're being paid."

After approximately 20 minutes to half a hour, Inspector Dews informed us that our

Serial was required to escort the Liverpool supporters to the PSV's and return them

to the Midland Station.     The PSV's were parked on Penistone Road.    We escorted the

fans in the direction of these PSV's.    The majority of the Liverpool supporters made

their own way to the Midland Station, as only a few PSV's were used.       As we were no

longer required to escort the fans, we were informed to return to the North Stand

for the de—briefing.     We attended in the North Stand and after approximately half a

hour,   Superintendent Bates asked for officers to work public order patrol in the
town centre.   Myself and several other officers, including Inspector Dews and Police

Sergeant 1415 Ashmore, worked the public order patrol in a Transit van.

At about 7.10 pm we were stood down and told to return to West Bar Police Station,

to await a de-brief.

At approximately 7.30 pm we were told to stand down.         I returned to Attercliffe

Police Station and went off duty at approximately 8.00 pm.

BRIAN ROBERT HUCKSTEPp




POLICE CONSTABLE 115




HACKENTHORPE POLICE STATION



At     8.30    am    on    the      date     shown,   I    commenced         duty    at Hackenthorpe         Police

Station.        We were then taken to Hillsborough by bus arriving at the ground

at     approximately            9-00     am.    I was      detailed       to    work       in    Serial    16 under

Inspector Purdy and Police Sergeant 1288 Payne.                                     At 9-55 am the briefing

wes given in the North Stand.

 Our    serial       was       to   be   deployed     directly        outside       the 7 turnstiles A-G at

 entrance B at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

 At    11.15     am,      we     made    our   way    around     to    the    rear    of the West          Stand     in

 preparation for the turnstiles being opened about 11.45 am.

 At     11.45       am,    I     commenced     duty    directly        outside       turnstiles       A    and   B   in

 company with Police Constable 607 Taylor.                              In the early stages there were

 just small numbers of fans entering in l ’s and 2's.                                  I turned various fans

  away,       who had either no tickets                   or   tickets       for the Kop.            All   fans were

  being searched at this time, the mood was friendly and jovial.

  From approximately 2.00 pm onwards,                          the number of fans entering the ground

  at     this       end    steadily        increased.          During    this       build       up   the   number    of

     officers       in     our      serial     were    steadily        depleted       by        officers   escorting

     prisoners through to the Detention Area, so much so that from about 2.30 pm

     onwards    it seemed that there was only myself and Police Constable Wright

     left directly outside the turnstiles.

    After       2.30    pm,      the crowd     outside              the      turnstiles       appeared to   swell

    enormously within a few minutes and from the queues being orderly and well

    defined,       it suddenly became one large mass pushing towards the turnstiles.

    I    found    myself       beingpushed     into       the wall           at the    side    of the turnstile

    entrance.          A Police horse came up to the entrance in an effort to regulate

    the crowd but this had very little effect as the pressure from the back of

    the crowd grew.            Eventually myself and Police Constable 2980 forced our way

    into the turnstiles              and into the ground.                  We went around the back out of

    the       large    Exit Gate     C and continued                to try and control         the crowd,      which

9   seemed to be trapped into the area between Exit Gate B and a single blue

     barrier which runs away from the turnstiles.

     From my       position at        the side of this barrier I could see that the crowd

     pressure was becoming severe.                 People near the barrier were red in the face

        and straining to push back.            Some fans were panicking.                      Many were shouting

        and pleading at us to do something.                     There were punches thrown as some fans

        came around the barrier and tried to join the crush nearer the turnstiles.

        A small boy was passed over the head of the crowd to us.                                I pushed a small

        space to allowa young lad to escape the                           crush, but he wouldn’t come under

        the barrier shouting          at me that he wanted to see the match.

        Behind me       there were       a large   number of fans standing away from the main

        crush just outside Exit Gate C.                   Many fans were shouting and pleading for

        the    gates    to be opened       to ease        the       crush.       I could see that there were

         numerous      fans climbing on top of the outer wall and entering the ground.

         There was some talk amongst the Police Officers present and Inspector Purdy

         informed      the    officers     directly       outside         Gate    C   that    it was   going   to be

         opened.        The   Gate   was   opened a short time                   afterwards    from inside and a
                                                  -   3   -




large number of fans rushed inside, someone stumbled as they went through.

The gate was then closed again.                 It had been opened for approximately 30-60

seconds.        It had the effect of clearing the area directly outside the Gate

but did nothing to ease the general crush at the turnstiles.                                 The situation

continued to deteriorate,              people were            in distress, many fans continued to

shout for the gate to be reopened.                    That they all had tickets.                  It seemed

that    it      was    only a matter      of    time before              someone   was    injured,     if not

already.        Many fans were helpless in the crush and could hardly move as the

pressure           from the fans behind forced them towards the turnstiles. I could

see 3 or           4 Police horses up near the large iron gates bordering on Leppings

Lane,     the      crush   of   the    fans    seemed         to   stretch    well    into   Leppings        Lane

 itself.           Most    of the   Police Officers            I could see were between the blue

 barrier and the temporary barrier guarding the sterile area at the rear of

 the South Stand.

 With the situation getting worse the Exit Gate C was opened again from the

 inside.        This time there was a much larger influx of fans into the ground.

 The majority of             them weren't      running but           all were      anxious   to escape the

 crush and get into the ground.                 I positioned myself directly outside Gate C

 in the flow of fans who had to pass either side of me.                                  They were told not

  to rush, to take their time.                Hundreds of fans must have passed me.                      Only a

  few   running,       the    others   were    orderly.            The    influx died down to a small

  trickle after a few minutes and the Gate was narrowed to allow one fan at a

  time,      and    this    time    each showing      their         tickets   to a steward.            The    area

  outside       the turnstiles was now clear.                      I regrouped with officers from my

  serial.           Almost      immediately      someone           reported    that      there   was    a    pitch

  invasion.           In company with other officers,                    I went in through Gate C past
the tunnel to the Centre section of the terracing into the South Stand and

onto the pitch.          There were many people walking and standing on the pitch.

There was a lot of confusion as to what was happening.                                  I could see that

there    were     numerous Police           Officers near      the perimeter           fence behind       the

Leppings Lane end goal.                I couldn’t see the crowd beyond.                  Next the Police

Officers    began    to pass          injured people        from an open         gate    in the fencing.

Along    with     others       I took them        from these    officers       and placed them in a

safer     position       further       on   the   pitch.      Many   seemed      short    of     breath   and

distressed        but each person I helped was alive and conscious.                            I helped one

youth     who     said    to     me    that   people were      dying     in    there     pointing    at the

 terrace.       At this time, due to the number of people on or around the fence,

 I still couldn't          see through to the terracing.                   I moved closer and I saw

 that    there was       a mass       crush of bodies        just    inside     the     fence.     It was a

 confusion of heads,            arms and legs.             I saw one man who was obviously dead

 but he was held upright by the crush and his body moved with the crowd.                                   By

 this time I was directly outside the small open gate.

 Officers       inside    the terracing were passing the injured onto the pitch and

 giving     first    aid,       if    necessary.       I worked myway           across    to     between the

  ambulance which had pulled onto the track and the perimeter fence which had

  been    forced    apart.           I continued     to     assist   in carrying         injured onto the


  pitch.

  After a short time,            I climbed into the terracing through the hole in the

  fence     and    assisted       in    carrying     people     to   the      fence.      I   assisted    with

  approximately 10 people, all of whom were already dead.

  Eventually,       the    Centre       section    of the      terrace     cleared.       I remember that

  soon after this an announcement was broadcast that the match would not be




                                                                                   3)1:4'cL)i!r|f

    continued.       Whilst   I was    in the   terracing and on the pitch helping            the

    injured,      many   Liverpool    fans   were    directing   their   anger   at   the Police.

    Calling us murderers and that it was our fault.               Others thanked me.

    After   the    terracing hsd cleared,           X joined other officers      on the halfway

    line.   Eventually we made our way back to the North Stand via the Leppings

    Lane terracing.

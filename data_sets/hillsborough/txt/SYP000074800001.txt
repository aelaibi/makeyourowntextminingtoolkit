             Further to the answers I have given to  tie questionnaire I would like

             to add I did not place any adverts in the \ i verpool pres s, what

             actually happened was a reporter from the Liverpool "Echo rang me up

             and asked me if he could quote me as saying the fans hao\been in my

             pub, enjoyed themselves arid had been well behaved.                 This wa^ just

             before I opened at about            10.30am.    I said he couldn't,    I d i d n ’t want

             to pre-empt anything,         I told him l \ U d n ’t want to tempt fate^        I

             certainly didn't advertise or tell him\j had extra stock for the

             Liverpool      fans.

                     ^ Sv^ ^ r s a ^es~--9J ^   SaVi^rday lunchtime   is about £00 pints on the

4& U T1& )   Saturday of         d i s a s t e r w ^ s o l d about 96 gallons of beer.   I also

OZXjOQ£^f^^d         about ten ti       twelve    (10 x 12)   cases of Pilsner lager but I did

             sell a lot of shandy,        in fact I had to go over the road and borrow

             some    lemonade as I had sold out.

             As I stated the fans were all well behaved in my pub and when they

             left I didn't see one who was drunk or staggering,              they were in a

             happy mood.

             I would add I'm in possession of two (2) photographs taken of the

             outside of my pub at about 1.30pm on the day of the disaster taken by

             m y s e 1f .

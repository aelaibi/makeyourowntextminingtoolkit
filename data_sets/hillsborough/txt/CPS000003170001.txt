    Thanks for your e-mail. I have copied it to Garry Patten, since he will be taking back responsibility for the Code
    in due course - and probably for our policy on private prosecutions as well. Clearly, therefore, he will have an
    interest in how we handle this.

    Your approach seems sensible to me, but I have not been able to speak to Garry about it yet. W e (Garry and I)
    are due to meet on Tuesday morning anyway: we can discuss this then. In the meantime, could either you or
    George have a word with Sue Ross, to ask whether she feels that your approach is attack-proof? I cannot see
    why it should not be ... but who knows, these days?

1. Thank you for letting me have copy of Sue Ross's letter of 25 March 1999. George and I
   have spent some time on this and this minute represents our joint view.
2. If the Divisional Court does indeed quash the decision not to intervene as Sue suggests, this
   can only be on the basis that a charge by charge approach should have been adopted. This
   means one of two things:
       •   The policy was not explicit enough in that it should have made reference to a charge
           by charge approach being the proper approach; or

       •   We should have applied a charge by charge approach to the decision notwithstanding
           that the policy was silent on it.

3. My immediate reaction to Sue’s letter was that, once we have the judgement, we should
   simply step in and take over and discontinue the attempt pervert on the grounds that there is
   clearly no case to answer. On one view, this would be the correct approach as we have
   already stated that we consider there to be clearly insufficient evidence on this charge.
4. An alternative view, however, is that we should give the defendants the opportunity of
   making further representations about this charge, bearing in mind our view that the other
   charges should be left alone.
5. It is unlikely that their view will be any different from that expressed in previous
   correspondence about the case as a whole, ie. they would wish us to step in and take over to
   discontinue. However, it occurs to me that they may possibly wish to adopt a different
   approach in the knowledge that we will not intervene on the manslaughter charges.
6. It might just be preferable from the defendants’ point of view for a consistent approach to
   be taken to all charges. There might be a benefit to them in having the one court consider
   all charges at one and the same time, bearing mind that the court will have to consider some
   o f the charges in any event. For example, the court might decide that the appropriate course
   is to stay the proceedings in their entirety as being an abuse of the process of the court. The
   defence may think that they have a better chance of arguing this with all charges before the
   court, as they could possibly demonstrate bad faith on the part of the prosecutor, for
   example. In the final analysis, the defence may wish to consider whether there is a tactical
   advantage to them in leaving the case intact rather than having it slimmed down piecemeal.
7. In the circumstances, my view is that we should give the defence the opportunity of making
   further representations about the attempt pervert course of justice charge, against the
   background that we will not intervene on the other charges.
w




    8. I will have a draft letter prepared in advance of next Wednesday, in readiness for the
       decision.
    9. I have considered whether it would be appropriate to ask the Hillsborough Family Support
       Group for their views on whether we should take over par of the case to discontinue. I do
       not think that anything they might say could possibly influence our decision when we have
       publicly stated our view that there is clearly insufficient evidence on this charge. We cannot
       rule out, of course, an attempt by the HFSG to seek a judicial review o f that decision!

Thanks. For what it's worth, I agree.
The arguments which will be raised on these issues, so far as I understand it, are not connected and so should
not be linked. I can, however, see good sense in having the police funding case heard first.

Some recipients will know that the defendants in the Hillsborough case (retired Superintendents Duckenfield and
Murray) have applied for leave for Judicial Review of the CPS decision not to intervene and take over and
discontinue the private prosecution launched on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.
The application for leave is listed on 8 March 1999.
Treasury Solicitors have been instructed (Sue Ross is dealing with it). She is instructing counsel - Philip Havers,
all being well.
HFSG, whilst not strictly a>party to this application, may seek to make representations.
It has been suggested that this application and the JR application of the South Yorkshire Chief Constable
against his own police authority on the funding issue be linked. I do not think this is appropriate as the issues are
entirely separate as far as we are concerned. Sue is of the same view.

Telephone conversation with Ann Adlington. Confirmed to her that we are being

Ross will be instructing Philip Havers.

HFSG are likely to want to make representations at the hearing.

FILE NOTE - HILLSBOROUGH


Telephone call from Chris Newell. He was contacted yesterday by Simon Slidders of
the Crown Office. Duckenfield has sought judicial review of the CPS decision not to
intervene and take over the private prosecution. The matter has not yet been heard by
the single judge.

Slidders also mentioned that the single judge has granted leave for the Chief
Constable to seek a judicial review of the Police Authority decision to cut funding.

Slidders wanted to know initially whether we would wish to make oral representations
at the hearing for leave. Chris Newell said that we would normally seek to do so
where one of our decisions is being challenged but he would want to take advice on
that before giving a final view.

Actions:

CE to call Mr. Slidders to make contact.
CE to contact Sue Ross to warn her of the position and to instruct her on our behalf

Slidders had suggested that we consider whether the two judicial reviews should be
linked together. CN’s view was that they should not. I agree.

CE contacted Sue Ross. She will contact Slidders and ask him for a copy o f the
papers and will indicate it is likely we will wish to make oral representations. She
intends to instruct Philip Havers to appear on our behalf. She will also write to the
applicant’s solicitors. Not necessary to put affidavits in at this stage, according to
Sue.

CE to contact Mr. Slidders just so he knows who to deal with on a day to day basis.

Telephone conversation with Duncan McGill o f Winkworth Sherwood -


He has been in touch with the Crown Office who have asked him to serve a bundle on
the CPS. I asked him to serve direct on Sue Ross with a copy to me, which he said he
would do.

He has been told by the Royal Courts that the application will be heard on Monday
morning, that is the 8th March 1999 at 10.30 am.

He told me that Murray’s solicitors intend to make an application and the idea is that
that will be joined with his own to be heard at the same time.

FILE NOTE - HILLSBOROUGH -1 MARCH 1999


Telephone call from Ann Adlington. The Chief Constable has succeeded in obtaining
leave for Judicial Review of the Police Authority decision to suspend funding.

She also told me that she understood that Duckenfield had applied for leave to seek
Judicial Review of the CPS decision and also had sought leave to apply for a stay to
prevent the Magistrates Court proceedings going any further (presumably for an order
of prohibition).

I explained that I was not aware of Duckenfield’s application.

This appeared to take Murray’s solicitors a little by surprise and Murray has indicated
that he too will seek Judicial Review of the CPS decision.

I said we had not received notification of any of this but would contact her when
anything came through.

8 April 1999

Sue Ross has obtained Treasury Counsel's comments and amendments to CN's draft
letters re the CPS taking over and discontinuing the PCOJ. They were faxed to Ann
Longman in CN's absence, and then faxed to me.

CN had given me authority to have the letters pp'd if changes were no more than
cosmetic. My consideration is that some of counsel's proposals go the structure of the
decision rather than just grammar or comprehension. In particular re the link between
Ann Adlington and the HFSG, the more detailed and specific content of the letters,
and that we do not need to inform Walker Morris.

Ann Longman will draw up amended letters for CN to see first thing on Monday
(12.4) before he goes off to Watford.

           Dear Sir

            RE:       ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD an d MURRAY
                      LEEDS MAGISTRATES’ COURT Adjourned Hearing

            On 18 December, 1998, you were informed of the Crown Prosecution Service’s
            decision in. M s case, that we would not interv ene to take over any o f the charges
            before the court.

            On. 31 March, 1999, the Divisional Couit considered an application by Mr
            Duckenfield and Mr Murray for judicial revieJv o f the CPS’ decision not to take over
            the private prosecution, in order to disconi :inue, as was requested by the two
            defendants. Whilst the Director's policy was found to be lawful, the Court quashed
            the decision not to intervene insofar as it related to the charge of attempting to pervert
            the course o f justice laid against Mr Duckenfield,

            Accordingly, on. behalf o f the Director o f P ublic Prosecutions, J am exercising the
            power under section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985, to talce over the
            pri vate prosecution by Ann Adlington, on beb alf o f the Hillsborough Family Support
            Group, o f the charge against Mr Duckenfield of attempting to pervert the course of
            justice on 15 April 1989. The prosecution of the remaining charges against both Mr
            Duckenfield and Mr Murray is not affected by this decision.

            I have reviewed this charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice and have
            applied the tests set out in the Code for Crov. v. Prosecutors. I have decided that the
            charge should be discontinued under section 2p (3) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act
            1985.

                                     NOTICE OF DISCONTINUANCE


     Dear Sir

     RE:      DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD
              LEEDS MAGISTRATES COURT - ADJOURNED HEARING

     I am, writing to give you notice under Section 23(3) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1985,
     that I do not want proceedings against the above named to be continued on the following
     charge, namely that:

           David Godfrey Dixckenfield, on the 15th day >f April 1989 at Hillsborough Football
           Stadium, Sheffield, with, intent to pervert the c Durse o f j ustice, did an act whi ch bad. a
           tendency to pervert the course of justice in £lat he lied about the circumstances in
           which gate C at the Football Stadium became cpen; contrary to Common Law.

     The reason for my decision is that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of
     conviction.

     I have noti fied the accused o f this decision and of his right to have the proceedings revived.

     Yours faithfully

         Dear Sirs

         RE:      ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY
                  LEEDS MAGISTRATES' COURT: Adjourned hearing

         On 31 March, 1999, Lord Justice Laws handed down the judgement o f the Divisional
         Court in the case o f R v DPP ex parte Ducken field and Murray. The court ruled that,
         whilst die overall Crown Prosecution. Service jiolicy on private prosecutions is lawful,
         and in particular that the present public interek policy is perfectly consistent with the
         Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985, that pcjlicy was only partly followed in the
         consideration of the allegation against your client concerning an attempt to pervert the
         course o f justice. The Divisional Court then quashed the decision insofar as it related
         to that charge.

         In the light of this judgment, I have now revilewed my decision and I have decided
         that the CPS should take over that single eh;targe in order to discontinue it under
         section 23(3) o f the Prosecution of Offenccs Act 1985. The reasons behind this
         decision have already been provided to you.

        Accordingly, on behalf of the Director o f Pu blic Prosecutions, I am exercising the
        power under section <5(2) o f the Prosecution of Offences Act 1,985 to take over the
        pri vate prosecution by Ann Adlington, who adts for the Hillsborough Family Support
        Group, of the charge against Mr Duckenfield of attempting to pervert the course o f
        justice on 15 April, 1989. The prosecution of tlthe remaining charges against both Mr
        Duckenfield and Mr Murray is not affected by this decision.

         A formal letter o f discontinuance is encJosed.

     The effect o f this notice is that'your client no lor ger needs to attend court in respect of this

     court in respect of these charges and any bail conditions imposed in relation to them continue to
     apply.

             Dear Madam.

              RE:         ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD arid MURRAY
                          LEEDS MAGISTRATES’ COURT: lAdjourned Hearing

              On 18 December, 1998, you were informed! o f the Crown, Prosecutions Service’s
              decision in this case, that we would not intervene to take over any o f the charges
              before the court.

              On 31 March, 1999, the Divisional CouJr considered an application by Mr
              Duckenfield and Mr Murray for judicial revie v o f the CPS’ decision, not to take over
              the private prosecution in order to discontitinue, as was requested by the two
              defendants. Whilst the Director's policy was found to be lawful, the Court quashed
              the decision, not to intervene insofar as it relat:id to the charge o f attempting to pervert
              the course of justice laid against Mr Duckenit^l'd.

              Accordingly, on. behalf o f the Director of Public Prosecutions, I am exercising the
              power under section 6(2) of the Prosecution <t)f Offences Act, 1985, to take over the
              private prosecution by yourself, on behalf of ti le Hillsborough Family Support Group,
              of the charge against Mr Duckenfield of atteir pting to pervert the course of justice on
              15 April 1989. The prosecution o f the remain! ag charges against both Mr Duckenfield
              and Mr Murray is not affected by this decision

              I have reviewed this charge o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice and have
              applied the tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. I have decided that the
              charge should be discontinued under section 23(3) o f the Prosecution of Offences Act
              1985.

         Court in the case o f R v DPP ex parte Duckenlfield and Murray. The court ruled, that,
         whilst the overall Crown Prosecution Service policy on private prosecutions is lawful,
         and in particular that the present public interest policy is perfectly consistent with the
         Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985, that policy was only partly followed in the
         consideration of the allegation against Mr buckenfield concerning an attempt to
         pervert the course of justice. The Divisional tourt then quashed the decision insofar
         as it related to that charge.

         In the light o f this judgment, I have now reviewed my decision and I have decided
         that the CPS should, take over that single c large in order to discontinue it under
         section 23(3) of the Prosecution o f Offencek Act 1985. The reasons behind this
         decision have already been provided.

          Accordingly, on behalf o f the Director of Pikblic Prosecutions, I am exercising the
         power under section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the
         private prosecution by Ann Adlington, who acts for the Hillsborough Family Support
         Group, o f the charge against Mr Duckenfieldl o f attempting to pervert the course of
         justice on 15 April, 1.989- The prosecution off the remaining charges against both Mr
         Duckenfield and Mr Murray is not affected by this decision.

Dear Sir

RE:    ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY
       LEEDS MAGISTRATES’ COURT: Adjourned Hearing

On 18 December 1998 you were informed of the CPS decision in this case that we
would not intervene to take over any o f the charges before the court.

On 31 March 1999 the Divisional Court considered an application by Mr Duckenfield
and Mr Murray for judicial review of the CPS decision not to take over the private
prosecution in order to discontinue as was requested by the two defendants. While
the Director's policy was found to be lawful, the Court quashed the decision not to
intervene in so far as it related to the charge o f attempting to pervert the course of
justice laid against Mr Duckenfield.

Accordingly, on behalf of the DPP, I am exercising the power under section 6(2) of
the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the private prosecution by Ann
Adlington, on behalf o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group, of the charge against
Mr Duckenfield o f attempting to pervert the course of justice on 15 April 1989. The
prosecution of the remaining charges against both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray is
not affected by this decision.

I have reviewed this charge o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice, and have
applied the tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. I have decided that the
charge should be discontinued under section 23(3) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act
1985.
A formal letter of discontinuance is enclosed.

    Dear Sir


    RE:    DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD
           LEEDS MAGISTRATES COURT - ADJOURNED HEARING

    I am writing to give you notice under Section 23(3) Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 that I
    do not want proceedings against the above named to be continued on the charge set out below:

    On the 15th day of April 1989 at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield, with intent to
    pervert the course of justice, did an act which had a tendency to pervert the course of justice
    in that you lied about the circumstances in which gate C at the Football Stadium became open.
    Contrary to Common Law

    The reasons for my decision is that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic
    prospect of a conviction.

    I have notified the accused of this decision and of his right to have the proceedings revived.

    Yours faithfully

                                NOTICE OF DISCONTINUANCE


    Dear Sirs

    RE:    DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD
           LEEDS MAGISTRATES COURT - ADJOURNED HEARING

    I am writing to inform you that, following the taking over of one of the charges subject to
    within the private prosecution by Ann Adlington, I have today sent a notice to the Clerk to the
    Justices under Section 23 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 discontinuing the following
    charge against your client:

    On the 15th day of April 1989 at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield with intent to
    pervert the course of justice, did an act which had a tendency to pervert the course of justice
    in that you lied about the circumstances in which gate C at the Football Stadium became open.
    Contrary to Common Law

    The effect of this notice is that your client no longer needs to attend court in respect of this
    charge and any bail conditions imposed in relation to them cease to apply.

    The decision to discontinue this charge has been taken because there is not enough evidence to
    provide a realistic prospect of conviction.

    This notice does not apply to the charges listed below. Your client must still attend court in
    respect of these charges and any bail conditions imposed in relation to them continue to apply:


    On the 15th day of April 1989 at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield:

           1.      Unlawfully killed John Alfred Anderson
               Contrary to Common Law

       2.     Unlawfully killed James Gary Aspinall
              Contrary to Common Law

       3.     Wilfully neglected to perform a public duty
              Contrary to Common Law

Your client has the right to require the discontinued proceedings to be revived. If you wish to
exercise this right, you must give written notice to the Clerk to the Justices at the above
magistrates' court as soon as possible (and in any event within 35 days).

Should your client wish to apply for any costs incurred in respect of our taking over of this
charge, you may make a written request to the Clerk to the Justices. It is not necessary to
apply for the proceedings to be continued in order to apply for your costs.

CAUTION: this notice only applies to the charge specified in it, and does not have any effect
in relation to any others that may be pending or other proceedings against you.

                 LEED'S MAGISTRATES' COURT: Adjourned Hearing

          On 31 March 1999 Lord Justice Laws handed down the judgement of the Divisional
          Court in the case of R v DPP ex parte Duckenfield and Murray. It was ruled that
          while the overall CPS policy on private prosecutions is lawful, and in particular that
          the present public interest policy is perfectly consistent with the objects of the
          Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, that policy was only partly followed in the
          consideration of the allegation against Mr Duckenfield concerning an attempt to
          pervert the course of justice. The Divisional Court then quashed the IJPJ^s decision
          so far as it related to that charge.

          For your information, the CPS review of the request for the DPP to intervene has been
          reconsidered in the light of the above decision and I have decided that the CPS should
          take over that single charge in order to discontinue it under section 23(2)j>f the

                             NOTICE OF DISCONTINUANCE


Dear Sirs

RE:     DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD
        LEEDS MAGISTRATES COURT - ADJOURNED HEARING

I am writing to inform you that, following the taking over of one of the charges subject to
witfeift the private prosecution by Ann Adlington, I have today sent a notice to the Clerk to
the Justices under Section 23 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 discontinuing the
following charge against your client:

On the 15th day of April 1989 at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield with intent to
pervert the course of justice, did an act which had a tendency to pervert the course of justice
in that you lied about the circumstances in which gate C at the Football Stadium became
open.
Contrary to Common Law

The effect of this notice is that your client no longer needs to attend court in respect of this
charge and any bail conditions imposed in relation to tfepm cease to apply.

The decision to discontinue this charge has been taken because there is not enough evidence
to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.                   Hj-ai         ctuwUi ^ v&aa. k cw^ '

This notice does not apply to the charges listed below. Your client must still attend court in
respect of these charges and any bail conditions imposed in relation to them continue to
apply:
On the 15th day of April 1989 at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield:

        1.    Unlawfully killed John Alfred Anderson
              Contrary to Common Law

       2.     Unlawfully killed James Gary Aspinall
              Contrary to Common Law

       3.     Wilfully neglected to perform a public duty
              Contrary to Common Law

Your client has the right to require the discontinued proceedings to be revived. If you wish
to exercise this right, you must give written notice to the Clerk to the Justices at the above
magistrates’ court as soon as possible (and in any event within 35 days).

Should your client wish to apply for any costs incurred in respect of our taking over of this
charge, you may make a written request to the Clerk to the Justices. It is not necessary to
apply for the proceedings to be continued in order to apply for your costs.

CAUTION: this notice only applies to the charge specified in it, and does not have any
effect in relation to any others that may be pending or other proceedings against you.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sir


RE:    DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD
       LEEDS MAGISTRATES COURT - ADJOURNED HEARING

I am writing to give you notice under Section 23(3) Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 that
I do not want proceedings against the above named to be continued on the charge set out
below:

On the 15th day of April 1989 at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield, with intent to
pervert the course of justice, did an act which had a tendency to pervert the course of justice
in that you lied about the circumstances in which gate C at the Football Stadium became
open.
Contrary to Common Law

The reasons for my decision is that there is insufficient evidence to provide a realistic
prospect of a conviction.

I have notified the accused of this decision and of his right to have the proceedings revived.

intervention or would wish the charges before the court to remain as they are at

I have copied this letter to both Messrs Walker Morris and the Hillsborough Family

consider that a request to take over this part of the case is one that properly can only

I shall formally consider the matter on receipt of your response, and will reply as soon

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Mr Justice Steele, in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, today
ruled that while the present CPS policy on private prosecutions is both lawful and
reasonable that policy was only partly followed in the consideration of the allegation
against your client concerning 'Perverting the Course of Justice'.

This part of the CPS review has been reconsidered in the light of the above decision

               FA Cup semi-final between U vopool Football Chib and Nottm ghm Forest Football
                                                                                   people lost their lives. The Divisional

               Commander in charge o f police operations at ihe match was D, then holding the rank
                of Chief Superintendent in die South Yorkshire Police Force. The second applicant,

     18         the« Superintendent Murray, held the position of Sub-Divisional Commander and was

                also on duty at the match.


                                      On 17 April 1919 Taylof U , as he then was, was appointed by the
     21
                government to conduct a publte inquiry into) the disaster. He heard the oral testimony
                 o f 174 witnesses between 15 May and 29 june 1989, and presented an interim report
                 on 4 August 1989. He found that the irajnediate cause o f the gross overcrowding
     24
                 which bad taken place, and thus o f the disaster, had been the failure to cut o ff access
                 to the central pens behind the goal (which were already overfull) when Gate C was

      27         opened. He found also a number of contributing factors including the condition of the
                 ground, police planning, police operations on the day, and the interaction o f parties
                 responsible for safety issues. Lord Taylor’ 5 final report was delivered on 18 January
         30
                 1990 and included a number o f recommendation* relating to erowd control end safety

                  at sporting events.

    15
            on 10 November 1991 on medical grounds, and so the proceedings against him fell

            On 27 August 1992 he too retired on medical grounds. Then on 5 November 1993 the

    18      Divisional Court dismissed an application for judicial review brought by family
            members of those who had died, refusing orders o f certiorari to quash the inquest

                           On 5 December 1996 a documentary programme called “Hillsborough"
             was broadcast on 1TV. The programme suggested that fresh evidence about the

     24      disaster had tom e to light The allegations made in the broadcast were investigated by
             the Crown Prosecution Service between March and May 1997, At length on 30 June
             1997 the Home Secretary announced in Parliament that an independent scrutiny would

     27      be undertaken by Stuait-Smith LJ in order jo ascertain inter alia whether there was
             evidence relating to the disaster which had not been available to Lord Taylor, or to die

                   officers (sc D and M] were concernedl» the prosecution would have to prove
                   to the high standard required for ,fl criminal conviction that the failure to
    18             give the order to close off the tunne when Gate C was opened amounted to
                   the serious degree of recklessness necessary to constitute manslaughter.**

                         1 have come to the clear condition that there is no basis upon which
                    there should be a further judicial inquiry or a re-opening of Lord Taylor’s
    24              in q u ir y ... I do not consider that there is any material which should be
                    placed before the Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints
                    Authority which might cause them to re»consider the decisions they have
    27              already taken*”

           On the same day, 18 February 1998, the Hojsje Secretary announced in the House that
    30     he. the Attorney General and the DPP had vtry carefully considered Stuart-Smith LJ’s
           report, and said: “W e have no reason to doubt his conclusions”.


    33                     The HFSG was dearly not satisfied with this result. There was first an
           abortive attempt on 26 June 1998 by AA to institute criminal proceedings against D
           and M iin the South Sefton Petty Sessional Division. That was given its quietus on
    36     technics! or jurisdictional grounds into whic! i it is unnecessary to go. Then on 13 July
           1998           Miss Adlington laid infonnatians against them before the Leeds Petty Sessional

           of the DPP as to the approach to be taken to a request to take over and discontinue a
           private prosecution were set out in a letter to the HFSO on 27 July 1998. The letter did
   33      not contain s decision, but it explained the DPP’s policy:

                 • The public interest factors tending against prosecution deary
                      outweigh thosefactors tendinginfavour.
                 .    Theprosecution is clearty Ukely to damage the mter&ts ofjusdee.
        The CPS would then regard Itielf as having to act In accordance with our

        l/n o n e of the above apply there Would be no need for the CPS to become
        involved and w e would not Interfere with the private prosecution.
        Clearly there is a distinction between the 'realistic prospect of conviction
        test in the Code [the Code for Crown Prosecutors issued by me DPP under
        5>l 0 Of the 1985 Act] and the clearly no case to answer’ test mentioned
        above. Accordingly we recognise that there will be some cases which do not
        meet the CPS Code tests where nevertheless we will not Intervene. It has
         been considered that to apply the Code tests to private prosecutions would
         unfairly limit the right of individuals to bring their own cases.
         Before this decision can properly be wade the CPS flim t be assured that all
         relevant material has been considered...
         Until there has been a detailed review of the many papers in the case the
         Crown*s position cannot be determ ined..,”



                     There followed vexy substantia] representations from D and M and from
the HFSG, At length the DPP communicated his decision not to intervene, as I have
said by letter o f 18 December 1998. The letter merely stated:
         “W e have considered the evidence) the representations made by the parties
         and all the relevant circumstance! of the ease. We have concluded that we
         should not intervene to take over any of the charges.”

The respective solicitors for D and M askel for reasons to be given, There followed a
letter o f 1 February 1999 (the ‘‘reasons letter”) from the CPS’ Casework Director to
M’s solicitor from which it is necessary to cite at some lejigth:
         “As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general
         principles applied by the Service when (Inter alia) deciding whether to
         continue a prosecution it has taken over; or whether to institute
         proceedings, or whether to advise the police to do so, It is correct that die
         CPS decided in 1997 that the evidence available at that tim e was not

                   either your client or Mr Duckenfield for any offence. However* it does not
                   follow that, When considering th* evidence and the representations
                   submitted by the private prosecu tor, and by yourselves on behalf of your
                   client, the CPS should seek merely to identify whether there is now any new
                    evidence sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. The
       6            decision whether to intervene in a private prosecution with a view to
                    terminating it calls for different considerations to be applied* It is quite
                    possible for a private prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the CPS
       9            is not satisfied, on the basis o f i s own assessment of the strength of the
                    evidence, that the evidence would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the
                    Code (that there should be a 'reali stic prospect of a conviction’)*
   12              In broad terms, the reason for this is that s.6 (l)... specifically preserved the
                    right of private indfviduals and prosecuting authorities and bodies other
                   than the CPS to bring criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among
   IS              other limitations) to the limitation in s.6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless
                   take over the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to
                   terminating those proceedings.
   18              Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors
                   when deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the
                   evidential sufficiency test in the O de when deciding whether there is a case
  21               to answer. The Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate to
                   intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
                   general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its
  24
                   Consultation Paper Wo. 149 'Consents to Prosecution’ (see paragraphs 6.3
                   and 6.4).

                     did I consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests

                               The private prosecution o f I) and M presently stands adjourned in the
   15      magistrates’ court. Committal proceedings were due to commence on 19 Apiii 1999.
           But we understand that date has been vacated. There is a directions heating fixed for
           hearing later in April. The matter .was earlier before tine magistrates* court on 21
   18      December 1998, an occasion to which I should refer because Mr Jones QC for AA
           contends that the applications in the first c ise have not been made promptly, as Order
           53 and the Supreme Court Act 1981 require (Mr Havers QC for the DPP likewise so
  21       contends but only in relation to the assault which is directed to the legality o f the
           DPP's policy; he Says, as is plainly the fee that D and M had notice o f the policy by
           the letter o f 27 July 1998). On 21 December it is said by AA that Mr Harrison QC for
  24       D and M indicated his clients’ intention to seek leave to bring an application for
           judicial review against the DPP’s decision, whatever the reasons for it (the reasons
           had not o f course, by then been supplied). Mr Jones contends that the application for
  27       judicial, review could and should have been, lodged then or vciy shortly thereafter.
           There is an issue as to the context in which Mr Harrison                   said what he         said to tike
           magistrate. It is dear from an affidavit sw»m by M’s solicitor Mr Manning that Mr
  30       Harrison took the view (as. if I may say so, one would expect) that he would have to
           consider the DPP’S written reasons before finally advising as to a judicial review. As
           at 21 December 1998 a reasons letter was expected before Christmas, and Mr Harrison
  33       so informed the magistrate, in the event the reasons were not delivered until 1

                              In my judgment there is not ling in the delay point. It would have been
            irresponsible to seek judicial review leavu before the DPP’s reasons were available,
       6    And the letter o f 27 July 1998 could not have been a proper nigger to seek leave; it
            contained no decision. It is true that a chal enge only to the legality of the policy need
            not sniclly have awaited the DPP's reasons for applying it as he decided to do; but
       9    since D and M, very obviously, were at east as interested j& the application o f the
            policy as in its legality, overall it was perfectly proper and reasonable to wait for the
            reasons letter before lodging any application for leave.

                  n the course o f his oral submissions Mr Hanison expanded this argument. He
                  submitted that in deciding whether to takl over and discontinue a private prosecution
                  vhfcte the case is one of “importance or c ifficulty”, the DPP should bear is mind that
                  .t is ordinarily his duty to institute and conduct such proceedings. Accordingly, as I
                  mderstand it the suggestion is that tie DPP should in some way entertain a
         6        heightened concern where such a private prosecution is launched, and his policy in
                 relation to the potential discontinuance o f such cases under s.23(3) should reflect this;
                              presumably (for otherwise 1 cannot
                                                              w the

                                                                     ho      can assist Mr Harrison) by
         9       leaning more favourably towards discontinuance than in other classes o f case.


                                  In my judgment this is a bid argument. S.3(2)(b) speaks only o f the
        12       institution o f proceedings by the DPP; co ntrast $.3(2X*), <c), and (d), which require
                 him to take over proceedings. Plainly the DPP would not institute proceedings with a
                 view to discontinuance. Moreover; as Mr Havers submitted, had it been the
        15       legislature's intention to require the DPP to treat “important or difficult” cases in a
                 different way from others for the purposes o f ss.6(2) and 23(3), it could have readily
                 so provided and it is to be supposed would have done so. In my judgment the right o f
        18       private prosecution preserved by $.6(1) is in no way qualified by s.3(2)(b), which has
                 nothing to do with the discretion to take o^rer such a prosecution under s.6(2) with a
                 view to discontinuance under s.23(3). I consider that this conclusion is lent support by
        21       the decision o f the Divisional Court in R v Bow Street Stipendiary, exp. South Coast
                 Ltd [1993] 2 WLK 621, in which Lloyd L), is he then was, said at 624:
                          “It wilt be noticed that section 3(2j(a).„ provide!*) for the Director to take
    24
                                     co**^uct ®f ««rtain kinds o f proceedings. By contrast, section
                         3(2Kb) provides tor the Director to institute certain other kinds of

                         in my view, accidental. It becomes i f crucial importance when one turns to
                         section «, which deals with private prosecutions... The effect of section 6(1)
    30                   is to preclude a person from bringing a private proseeution in cases covered

                       The DPP's policy fails to have regard to the fundamental purpose fo r which private
                       prosecution ts preserved by statute

                                           Mr Harrison's second submission was that the right to maintain a private
              6        prosecution essentially operates as a constitutional safeguard in cases where there is
                       some suggestion o f “inertia, partiality or improper action” by the public prosecutor;
                       and the implication is that where nothing of that kind is present, the DPP should lean
              9        towards intervention to stop the prosecution. Mr Harrison relies on statements of their
                       Lordships in Gouriei v Union o f Pos’ Office Workers [1978] AC 435. Lord
                       Wilberforce said at 477B-C;
           12                   “This historical right which goes ight back to the earliest days o f our legal
                                system, though rarely exercised In relation to indictable offences* and
                                though ultimately liable to be controlled by the Attorney-General (by
           15                   taking over the prosecution- and, if he thinks fit, entering a nolle prosequi)
                                remains a valuable constitutional safeguard against inertia or partiality on
                                the part o f authority.”
           18
                    Lord Diplock said this at 498B;

          21                    In English public law every citizen still has the right, as he once had a

           to The effect that private prosecutions might be made subject to a statutory provision
           requiring the consent o f the CPS.


                               In xny judgment this argument is also misconceived. The obiter dicta in
           Gourict are not reflected in the 1985 statute, which was o f course enacted some seven
           years after Gouriet was decided. More particularly, it is simply quixotic to suggest that
           the DPP should allow a private prosecution to go ahead if there has been “inertia,
           partiality or improper action” by the public prosecutor - namely him self * but not
      9    otherw ise. Is he to be judge and ju ry on the question w hether he has let the public
           down? Their Lordships' dicta in Gounet do not with respect provide anything
           approaching a compulsory template o f a lawful policy to be adopted by the DPP for
  12       the execution o f his duty under ss.6(2) and 23(3).

                               T he argum ent here, at least as originally put forw ard in M ’s skeleton
           argument, was that because o f his view (r<feired to in the reasons letter) that private
  18       prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code when deciding whether to institute
           proceedings, the DPP has erroneously proceeded on the basis that the principles in die
           Code arc irrelevant to his discretion under s 5.6(2) and 23(3), B ut the DPP has                     nowhere
 21       stated that he regards the Code as systematically or generally iirelevant to his power to
          discontinue. Indeed, as 1 shall show, there are some aspects o f the Code which are
          reflected in his approach to the question, how his polioy should be applied in this case.
 24
          In truth, how ever, it could n o t be right for ft e DPP to apply across the board the same
          tests, m particular the “reasonable prospect o f conviction” test referred to in the
          correspondence, in considering whether t> take over and discontinue a private
 27       prosecution as the Code enjoins Crown Prosecutors to follow in deciding w hether to
          institute o r proceed w ith a prosecution them ielves; the conscqucnce w ould be th at the

            (#7 of M’s skeleton) made it clear that he did not submit so much, The very premise of
            s.6 (l) must be that some eases will go to trial which the DPP himself chooses not to
            prosecute.


                               As it seems to me the only points remaining in relation to the Code
    6       concern the application of the DPP’s policy to the facts o f This case, and I will deal
            with that shortly.


     9      The “clearly no case to answer” test


                               The argument here (#7 a f the skeleton) is that such a test is
   12       impermissibly rigid. It is said that the policy excludes “any assessment of evidential
            deficiencies” and so amounts to an unlawful fetter o f die DPP’s discretion; and that it
            “also leads to a distorted evaluation of tLe public interest factors**, In my judgment
   15       the test involves no unlawful fetter o f disci
                                                      iscretion, It is plain from the formulation "there
            is clearly no case to answer” (a y emphasis) that the DPP only intends to stop private
            prosecutions on this ground where no reasonable decision-maker could conclude that
   18       there was sufficient evidence for the case to go forward. That seems to me to be a
            perfectly proper approach. Such a prosecution could offer no legitimate benefit to
            anyone and would, potentially at least, be an abuse o f the process o f the court. The
   21       test rightly identifies a class o f ease which should always be stopped; if the case is not
            within the elass, then the decision whether to stop it will, o f course, depend on the
            other two tests which, in my judgment amply contemplate an exercise o f discretion in
   24      which all material factors will be consiiered and whose application accordingly
           negates any unlawful fetter o f discretion.


  27
                              As regards any "distorted evaluation” o f the public interest test, it is
           clear that the three aspects of the policy are individually self-standing. Their
           respective application in this case is a anojher matter, to which as I have said I will
  30
           come. But the applicants have a separate argument about the public interest test.

                The "public interestfosters”test

                                   Here it is submitted (#8 o f the skeleton) that the public interest
                necessarily involves consideration of he likelihood o f conviction* so that the
      6         evidential test should not be hived off from that relating to the public interest. Mr
                Harrison also argues that the public interest test as formulated -                   "the public Interest
               factors tending against prosecution dearly outweigh th o se                          fa c to r s te n d in g in
               favour" - gets it the wrong way round; the test should be whether the puMic interest
               factors in favour o f the private prosecution, outweigh those against


     12                            I see no reason why quite «sid« from the evident!*! test o f no case to
               answer the DPP should not; within his policy as presently femmlated, have in mind
               the likelihood or otherwise o f conviction
 15
               lies. And I see no basis for the suggestioh that the law should compel the DPP to
               reverse the effect o f the public interest fe e * >rs s o u to favour discontinuance unless in
              his judgment & ey eleariy point in the other direction. The test as presently formulated
 18
              seems to nxe designed to allow proper scope tor the operation o f the right o f private
              prosecution. The private prosecutor is v o y likely to take * different view as to where
              * e public interest lies than does the DPP, and s.6(l), I thin), h n p ii* f t * h* * e a tim
 21
              to do so. The approach urged by Mr Harjison would in eflfeet require the private
              prosecutor to persuade the DPP that his w ew o f the public interest is plainly right I

                                      For all these reasons, the: DPP’s policy overall is in my judgpicnt &
                  lawful one. The real question in the case is whether it has been lawfully applied, It is
                  dear that (a) the DPP maintains his view that the “reasonable prospect o f conviction'’
          6       test in the Code would not be met in this ease, but that (b) the “no evidence” test is not
                  met either (save as regards the charge against D o f attempting to pervert the course o f
                  justice, with which I deal separately below). In those circumstances, the application o f
                  the public interest test was erueial. In thij context it is convenient to deal first with Mr
                  Hamson’s submission that the reasons litter shows that the DPP has given improper

                  ^ p' rhaps                   to <he-BO evidence" test. He relies on the sentence which

                                   One o f Mr Harrison's complaint, advanced before this afiidavit was
                   sworn, was that the policy should hive taken account o f para 10.1 o f the Code which

         18        includes Hus;
                                                                   Service tells a suspect or defendant
                          “Normally, if the Crown Prosecution
                                                                   that Is the end of the matter... But
                          that there w ill not be a prosecution*.>
                                                                   why the Crown Prosecution Service
         21               occasionally there are special reasons
                          will re-start the prosecution, particularly if the case is serious.

         24         This is one of the points relating to the Cod* ■which, as it seems to ire. bear on the
                    application of the policy rafter than the polity itself; and para 2(2) of Mr Newell »
                    affidavit shows that regard was had to assuran ces or statements made to D and M that
         27         for his part the DPP would not prosecute. C early it was right to do so, within the
                    public interest balance. But I think there i; a   q u a lita tiv e   difference between the
                    situation where the DPP himself goes back up >n a previous assurance not to prosecute

         30         and one where the DPP does not change his mind but a private prosecutor chooses to
                    instigate proceedings.


             33                     In reply, having by then seen N i Newell*s affidavit, Mr Harrison made
                    further submissions. While accepting That it ere could be a case m which a single
                    factor favouring prosecution might not be ^ittweighed by a multiplicity o f factors

             36      going the other way, he submitted that if tic raft o f public interest considerations
                     favouring discontinuance in this case was helc; not to be enough to outweigh the single

                                Mr Harrison submitted next that !v£r Newell's affidavit showed that die

    12    DPP had transposed ftom flic Code the “seriousness o f the charge” factor as a
          consideration favouring the prosecution without also taking account o f his own view
          that the Code test o f “realistic prospect of conviction” was not met. I agree that the

    IS    DPP’s view o f the prospects o f conviction is a proper matter for him to consider,
          within the public interest test contained in tie policy, when deciding whether to
          discontinue; hut, as it seems to me, para 2(1) <(f Mr Newell’s affidavit shows that in
    18    this case he has done so.


                                 Then Mr Harrison suggested that para 3 o f the affidavit demonstrated

    2V     thflt the DPP’s view of the gravity o f the allegition was informed simply by the fact
           that there was a manslaughter chazge. He had not properly considered the real degree
                                                                                                                                i

              of culpability inherent in the facts alleged; and the gravity o f the offcnce of
    24        manslaughter can vary very widely. There is nothing in this. Mr Newell made it
              perfectly clear that he had regard to the species , o f manslaughter in question
              (“ crim in al negligence” ) and it cannot sensibly be doubted that he was well aware and
    27        took account o f the circumstances in which the alleged offences are said to have been
              committed.

           Thefir# applicant: attempting to pervert the course ofJustice


18                       Mr Hamson discretely submits hat die decision to let the charge of
           attempting to pervert the course o f justice go ahead was unlawful, becausc it runs flat
           counter to the “no case to answer” test in his Awn poliey. It will be recalled that the

21         reasons letter said:
                                                               L
                  “I concluded further that it would not be right to intervene in respect of the
                  one remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield, of attempting to pervert the
    24            course of justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case
                  to answer on that charge alone... in the context of the case as a whole that
                  charge is not the gravamen of the criminality alleged against Mr
    27            Puckenfield and I concluded that my approach to that charge should be led
                  by my conclusions on the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to
                  perform a public duty.”

                       was reached that there was clearly a case to answer in relation to some of
                       the charges but not in relation to others. (I can say that with some
                       confidence, since I had overall responsibility for formulating the policy.) ...
                       I concluded that it was In fact inappropriate to intervene only to take over
                       (with a view to discontinuing) thiit additional charge.

                      6, First, partial Intervention was not, in my view, either appropriate or
                      desirable. It seemed to me that the DPP should either intervene so as to
                      take over the proceedings in their entirety pr not at all. To have intervened
                      partially would still have left the criminal proceedings in place in relation to
                      the other charges which included the even more serious charge of
     12               manslaughter. Secondly, I took into account the fact that M r Duckenfield
                      would not be left without any remedy in relation to this additional charge.
                      On the contrary, he would be entitled to invite the M agistrates’ Court to
     15               dism iss'it on the basis that there Was no case to answer. Thirdly, the charge
                      arose out of essentially the same i vents as the events which gave rise to the
                      other charges and thus those events would be scrutinised in any event.”

                                 1 o f course accept that Mr Newell did not subjectively believe - or intend
 21           that the policy covered this situation. But the policy has to be read objectively; there

                   be no doubt that it gave rise to a legitimate «xp«cation on the p o t o f D and M

           ftu ft would b« applied according to its temu. H e first question, ftea, is as to Sk u se
 24
           meaning o f the policy on a fiur reading o f ihe letter o f 27 July 199* and the teasons

                                  The DPP concluded that tSiere was clearly no such ease in relation to this
              charge against D, and yet decided to all ow it to proceed. It follows, in my judgment,
              that there is a breach o f D’s legitimate expectation that the policy would be applied.
              The pragmatic factors spoken to by Mr Newell is para 6 can make no difference. Nor,
              of course* can the vigorous assertion by the HFSO that there is in feet a case to
      6       answer. What matters for present purposes is 4 c DPP’s conclusion cm that issue.


                                  For these reasons I would quash die DPP's decision only so far as it
     $       relates to this charge against P . 1 make it clear that I say nothing as to what might

           and Treasurer). The latter decision was said to be taken “in accordance with the
   3       principles set out in Home Office Circular No 71/87 Financial Assistance to police
           Officers in Legal Proceedings”, to which 1 will have to refer.


   ©                        On 27 February 1998, following publication o f the Scrutiny, and
           considering that “there were indications that private prosecutions could be brought
           against 3 officers”, the SYPA resolved in principle to authorise consideration being
   9       given to applications by officers for financial assistance. On 5 March 1998 D ’s
           application for such assistance was approved by the SYPA, and M’s was approved on
           29 June 1998. It w ill be recalled that three days earlier* on 26 June, AA had first
  12       sought to institute criminal proceedings against D and M in the South Sefton Petty
           Sessional Division. On 20 November 1998 M applied for ftohcr financial assistance
        in relation to the judicial review which was then seen to be in prospect should the DPP
  15    decide to allow the private prosecutions to continue; and the HFSO                                                  made it clear
        that were the DPP to take over the prosecutions and discontinue, they would seek a
       judicial review. On 21 December 1998 counsel for D and M indicated to the
  18    Stipendiary Magistrate their intention to seek a judicial review o f the DPP’s decision; I
       have already referred to this in dealing with Mr Jones’ misconceived argument that the
       first case should be dismissed on grounds c f delay. The following day, 22 December
 21     1998, in a letter p f over six pages AA made written representations ob
       counsel’s advice to urge the SYPA that the decision to fond the defences o f D and M

          the police authority to do such things as fund the legal representation o f police officers
          in proceedings if the authority reasonably concludes that to do so is conducive to that

             function's discharge. That lias been the settled view o f the Association o f Chief Police
             Officers, die Police Superintendents Association, and (until 1998) the Home Office.
             The decision to provide such finance, in common with any decision taken under
             s. 111(1), would o f course be subject to well known public law constraints enshrined in
             the Wednesbury and Padfielcf principles . There is before the court an affidavit o f Mr
             Dames, Assistant Chief Constable o f So nth Yorkshire, in which he describes what he
             regards as the “absolutely vital” requirement “that officers should know that if they
             act in good faith in performing their duties their Police Authority will support
      8      them In. the event that they face litigation”. If as a matter o f vires s. 111(1) allows a
            police authority to incur expenditure in foriherance o f the general function seemingly
            conferred by s.6(l), then in my judgment die use o f s. 111(1) to finance police officers*
  12        legal expenses m litigation, including private prosecutions brought »ea™gt them aad
            the bringing o f judicial review proceeding, cannot in principle be ruled unlawful on
            Wednesbury or Padfield grounds. The circumstances in which such funding might be
 15         provided in any particular case is another;natter. The policy has in the past been to the
            effect that the authority must be satisfied that the officer has acted in good faith in the
            discharge o f his duty; and I can see tfant, at least where a private prosecution is
 18        involved, there may be issues for the authority to consider which would involve their
           taking a view o f the merits in advance o f ally trial. But in these proceeding* we are not
           concerned with any question whether, 4 e n . or to what extent the SYPA might
 21        provide financial assistance to D or M. We are only to decide whether the power
           exists to do so at all.


24
                                   In fact the argument o f the CCSY was put two ways by Mr finfrrr q q it
          was first said that s.6 (l) o f itself; without the aid of s.. l l l ( i ) , enabled the funding

           decision. Alternatively, it was enabled by s. 111(1) read with s.6(l).

                                  Upon this issue Miss Baxsndale QC for the SYPA submits that tie
                 ippareatiy obvious relation, between $.6(1) and s. 111(1) is in fact no relation at all.
                 fhe essence of her argument may be expressed very Shortly, as follows.


                                  (a)                     S.6(1) confers no powers of any kind. All the powers posses
          6      police authorities are conferred elsewhere in the Police Act and by the local
                 government legislation. S.6(1) does no mere than to provide the purpose for which die
                 authority’s powers arc to be exercised; it states the Act's “policy aad objects*, in (he
         9       language o f the Padfield case, as they aj>ply to police authorities. If this is right it
                 would contradict Mr Baker's first argument, that $.6(1) alone is enough to empower
                the SYPA to fund D and M.
      12

                                  (b) S. 111(1) cannot be react as enabling the authority to do anything
                which is not ancillary to a power which is           e ls e w h e re c o n f e n e d u p o n it. I f th is i s fig h t,
     15         then taken with (a) it contradicts Mr Baker’s second argument which relies on
                5.111(1).


     18                          There is no doubt that express powers are conferred on police authorities
               by a raft o f statutory provisions. Miss Baxendale says that such provisions support
               proposition (a) which I have set out, by application o f the canon o f statutory
     21        construction expressed by die Latin maxim sxprestio vnius est exclusio alterius. Thus,
               she submits, where Parliament has seen ft: to confer a range o f specific powers on
               police authorities, the intention must have been thereby to set the limits on what such
    24         an authority may do and it cannot be suppcsed that s.6 (l) provides as undefined and
               open-ended power to do anything else w hici the authority may choose, merely on the
              ground that in some way it may be sa d to support the general aim o f “the
    21        maintenance of an efficient and effective police force” The high water-mark o f this
              submission is found in s. 88(4) o f the Act o f 1996 which confers an express power to
              fund police     O ffic e rs ’   costs in eertain circuro nances which do not include the defence

                           I shall have to look in a Uitle more detail at     S .88(4).   I have concluded,
           lowever, that the correctness or otherwise of proposition (a) is not in the end at the
           sentre o f the ease. The reason is that in tile particular statutory context proposition (b)
           is in my judgment wrong; so that die SYPA is enabled by s. 111(1) (subject to
           Wedn*$bvry and Padfield) to finance D and M in the criminal and judicial review
       proceedings even if $.6(1) confers no powers as such


                           The scheme o f die Act o f 1996 involves the distribution of
       responsibilities between three bodies: die Chief Constable, the Secretary o f State, and
       the police authority. The Chief Constable’s role is principally given by s. 10;
 12               “(2) A police force maintained utnder section 2 shall be under the direction
                  and control of the chief constable appointed under *,11,”

 15              (2) In discharging his functions, «very chief constable shall have regard to
                 the local policing plan issued by the police authority for his area under
                 section 8.*’
 18
       (S. 11 provides for the appointment and rcnoval of die Chief Constable, by die police
       authority with the approval of the Secretary o f State.) I should notice also ss.22(l) and
 21   44(4):
                 **22(1) Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end of each
                 financial year, submit to the pol ice authority a general report on the
 24              policing during that year o f the a rea for which his force is maintained.”

                 **44(4)
                 -      . Every
                           ,    chief constable shall, *a 5aoD m possible after the end of each
27               financial year, submit to the Secretary of State the like report as is rew ired
                 by section 22(1) to be submitted to the police authority.”

30    The role o f die Secretary o f State is principally given by ss.36 and 37(1):


                             S*frctttp r State shall exercise his powers under the provisions
33              of this A ct referred to in subsection (2) in such manner and to such extent
                as appears to him to be best calculated to promote the efficiency and
                effectiveness                  of                 the                pJuce.”

           As regards the Secretary o f Stale’s position I should notice also these provisions o f the
           Act of 1996:
                  “38(1) W here an objective has been determined under section 37* the
                  Secretary of State may direc t police authorities to establish levels of
    6             performance (performance targ ets to be aimed at in seeking to achieve the
                  objective.

                    39(1) The Secretary o f State may issue codes of practice relating to the
                    discharge by police authorities established under section 3 o f any of their
                    functions.**
   12
           The role o f the police authority is given first by the subsections o f s.6 which follow
           subsection (1):
   15               “6(2) In discharging its functions, every police authority established under
                    section 3 shall have regard to - j
                    (a) any objectives determined by the Secretary of State under section 37,
  18                (b) any objectives determined by the Authority under section 7,
                    (c) any performance targets established by the authority, whether in
                    compJiance with a direction under section 38 or otherwise, and
  21                (d) any local policing plan Issued !by the authority under section 8.

                    (3) In discharging any function to which a code of practice issued under
  24                section 39 relates, a police authority established under section 3 shall have
                    regard                      to                    the                   code.

  27                (4) A police authority shall comply with any direction given to it by the
                    Secretary of State under section 3fe or 40.”

  30       These provisions, o f course, confer dutiesi lather than powers. In relation to the police
           authority I should next notice ss.7 - 9:
                   **7(1) Every police authority established under section 3 shall, before the
  33               beginning of each financial year, ditermine objectives for the policing of the

  36               (2) Objectives determined under this section may relate to matters to which
                   objectives determined under section 37 also relate, or to other matters, but
                   in any event shall be so framed as to be consistent with the objectives

            piu visions, taken with s.6((2) • (4)), The police authority holds die purse (s, 14), Those
           provisions specifically concerned with Che police authority's role confer duties rather
           than powers, though in some cases then! is clearly a discretion as to how the duty is to
           be performed (as for example under s.37). Other powers (including those contained in
            s .l l l ( l ) ) are conferred on flic police authority by the local government fcgishtioB, to
     6     the exteat that measures there contained were applied to police authorities by
           s l4 6 A (l) o f the Act o f 1972. The powers so conferred are listed in a helpfiil note
           provided by Miss Baxendale. I do not propose to set them out. They include (apart
           from      s. 1M{1))         such matters as the disposition and treatment o f staff and the
           acquisition and disposal o f land.


 12                              The critical point which m ray judgment emerges from a consideration
           o f the interlocking roles o f Chief Constable* Secretaxy o f State and police authority is
           that it cannot have been within the contemplation o f Parliament in enacting the
 15       scheme, and in embracing within it s .ll 1(1), that the police authority should only be
          empowered to incur expenditure in support o f those duties, and ancillary powers,
          which are specifically conferred upon it The police authority holds the funds from
 18       which expenses for its local police force will be supplied: s.14. It is inherent h die
          system (as Mr Baker submitted in reply) that the Chief Constable will apply to the
          authority for authorisation to incur expenditure; it may be &r die use ofresources such
27
          as helicopters, or the installation o f video surveillance systems in city streets, or a host
          o f O ther   th in g ,.   No doubt the Chief C oaJb fc presents a general budget. We were not
         referred to any provision in statute which shows or suggests that (he police authority's
24       power to accede to             su ch    requests rests in anything other than the combination o f s.S (l)
         and s. 111(1). Given this, it seems to me plain that, in the particular context before us
         m this case, the legitimate scope o f the aneffiaty power provided by s .l 11(1) c*™** be
27
         restricted so as to support only those powers and duties which are expressly conferred

                                 This result is supported, if only ex silentio, by the decision o f this court
          in R v Derbyshire Police Authority ex p. Wilson (8 August 1989, unreported save in
     9    The Times). The court had to consider a decision o f the police authority not to
          contribute to the legal expenses o f two police officers in relation to an auditor’s
          enquiry. The court assumed that s .4 o f the Police Act 1964 (the predecessor o f s.6(l))
  12     provided the power to grant financial assistance. However the point o f principle was
         not argued. The applicants also point to other materials. In 1962 the report o f the
         Royal Commission on A c Police was published. It indicated the then current practice
 15      in relation to the provision o f financial suj port to policc officers in civil proceedings,
         which included a requirement that “a constable must have acted in good faith in the

           On 17 February 1998 Home Office Circular 4/1998 was published. Unlike its
       ’ ircdcccssor it sits on the fence as regards the power o f a police authority to fiind
           lefences to private prosecutions. It has no jiensuasive effect one way or A s other upon
           be issues in these proceedings. The earlier Circular, though obviously not a source of
           awt may possibly possess some force a; regards the purposes to be fulfilled by

   6       i,6 (l)‘s predecessor in s,4 (l) o f the Poliee Act 1964: sec per Scannan U as he then
           was in Bristol DC v Clark [1975] 3 AER 976, referred to is fWIson, But there are
           great dangers in treating government pronouncements, howevar helpful, as an aid to
           statutory construction. I would prefer to bai* my conclusion, that s. 111(1) in principle
           empowers the SYPA to support D and M’s defence (and their participation is the
       judicial review against the DPP), upon those considerations touching the correct
 12        construction o f the material statutory provisions which I have already set out


                         If my Lords agree with this conclusion, it is enough to dispose o f the
 15        case in the applicants* favour. However vre heard much argument on the question
       whether s.6(1) conferred on the police authority any power, in any circumstances, to
       take action not otherwise expressly authorised, Hus engages Miss Baxendalc's
 18    proposition (a) as I have described i t and her reliance on the expressio unius esi
           exclusio alterius doctrine. It only has relevance if I am wrong to hold, as I have done,
       that s. 111(1) in principle enables the SYPA to fund D and M even if 9.6(1) does not
 21    itself empower the authority to do anything. In this context I will deal only (and that
           shortly) with s. 88(4) o f the Act o f 1996, whi ch as I have said is the high water-mark o f
       this part o f Miss Baxendale’s argument
 24

                         S.88 contains a comprehensive scheme as to liability on the part o f the
       police for torts. By ss.(l) the chief ofSccr o f police for a police area is liable in
 27    respect of tons committed by constables under his direction and control in the
       performance or purported performance o f thrir functions. Without this provision there
       would be no such liability because police officers arc not servants but office-holders.

   IS

             In a y judgment this provision      offers no support for Miss Baxendale’s reliance on the
              exclusio alterius rule. S.88 is self-standing, i has no implications for the general reach
   16
              of the police authority's functions. And oncj s.88(4) was to allow the police authority
              to cover damages awarded against tn officir in a tort action, it is no surprise that it

    21
              covers costs as well- If it did not, there night well be an argument - based on the
              exclusio alterius role - feat costs were deliberately excluded.

    24
                             In all these circumstances I io not think it necessaty to go into the
              legislative histoiy o f s 6 (l), or to canvass this arguments which were addressed to us as

       27     to the construction or effect o f its predecessor, s.4 (l) o f the Police Act 1964. In the
               end there are two possibilities; s.6<l) empowers the police authority to do things, or it
               does not. I have so far proceeded on the assumption asserted by Miss Baxendale that it
               does not; but given that assumption, nevertheless for reasons I have sought to explain
       30
               the SYPA possesses in principle the legal pcwer to fund D and M-


        33                    In fact 1 think the better view is that s.6(l) enables the police authority to
               do      which reasonably support the fane(tion which s.6(1) confers. Such a power is
               by no means open»ended. It would not alioiw die authority to invade the provinces o f

                           In the course o f argument some time was spent, in fairness at the
       a    couragement o f the court, in seeing whisthnr the specific provisions in the Act o f
       j >96 or the local government legislation, conferring specific powers on the police
       a ithority, left gaps which only 5.6(1) could fill. Points were made about lower ranks*
       ri gfats o f representation in legal proceeding^ -which are covered as appropriate by the
       Felice Federation; and about the representation o f higher ranks in various forms o f
       j,       proceedings-But the answer to the question we nwst decide, whether the power
       t >fund D and M is principle lies in the hinds o f the SY^A, cannot in my judgment

15     depend on a trawl through all the things a police authority is expressly empowered to
        c o. The provisions which expressly confej and unpose powers and duties on police
        ; utborities do not constitute an independent code. The police authority’s functions are,

 15     1)   use a questionable modernism, symbiotic with those o f the Chief Constable and the
        I ecretary o f State. So judged, and for the reasons I have given, they allow die use of
           : .111(1) to fund officers in the defence o f        ivate prosecutions and injudicial review

 18         iroceedings.


                           1 would allow this application. It will be appropriate to hear counsel as

R -v- DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS EX PARTE DUCKENFIELD
AND MURRAY

As I mentioned to you after the hearing on Tuesday, our reading of the way the Court may be
thinking is that they might be inclined to quash your decision not to intervene, not on the basis
of perversity - they made it clear that the decision was well within the bounds of reasonableness
- but on the basis that the decision whether to intervene on one charge only should have been
resolved by applying the terms of the existing policy, or alternatively by way of inviting
representations on that point from those affected by your decision. The fact that they have
reserved judgment may indicate that the Court wishes to think through the implications of such
a judgment before making a final finding, but you will wish to prepare for a judgment along these
lines.

Your alternatives, should the judgment follow this line, are:

        to apply the strict terms of the policy to the single charge of attempt pervert;

        to amend the policy, inviting representations from Duckenfield and Murray;                              ;

        to apply the strict terms of the policy to this case, and then amend the policy in the CPS's
        own time.

I thought you might be interested in other feedback about the arguments put before the Court,
primarily by the Applicants, pending the Court’s judgment. These go to perversity, but they may
be of interest to you in any event.

There was lengthy argument about the appropriateness of treating the single factor of the
seriousness of the offence as overriding the several other factors pointing away from prosecution.
At one point it was argued that the Director had fettered his discretion because, the Applicants
argued, in their view it was difficult to think of a situation in which the seriousness of the offence
would not override all other factors if it were thought to do so in this unusual case.
It was also argued that the seriousness of the offence has a different importance in the context
of taking over a private prosecution than it does under the Code for Crown Prosecutors. Under
the Code, the CPS only considers the public interest where there is sufficient evidence to provide
a realistic prospect of a conviction. In this case, the CPS had repeatedly taken the view that there
was no realistic prospect of a conviction. In those circumstances, it was argued, the Director
ought to give less weight to the seriousness of the offence on the basis that the Director would
not have proceeded with the charge applying his own test. In other words, the fact that the case
failed the evidential test should, in itself, be regarded as a public interest factor.

The Applicants also argued that the Director should have looked at the objective seriousness of
the conduct on which the manslaughter charge was based in deciding what weight to give to the
seriousness of the offence.

It seemed clear from your affidavit that you had considered this point, probably both points, and
you had also taken into account the fact that the DPP had decided not to proceed himself.

The Applicants made much of the fact that, if one of the functions of a trial is to bring the facts
into the open, the position in this case should be viewed against the background of public
Inquiries and Inquests.

An overall point was made that the DPP had rightly taken a delicate approach to intervening in
private prosecutions, to respect this constitutional right. But that in this case that consideration
should have been counterbalanced by the background of repeated inquiries and scrutinies that had
all concluded that there was no basis for a prosecution. They argued that this background had
been sidelined because of the seriousness of the offence.

I should say that the Applicants did not make these comments in a critical way; they recognised
the very difficult decision you had to take. They merely asked whether it was right that a private
prosecutor should be able, in effect, to ignore the combined pronouncements of inquests, public
inquiries and reviews and the stated views of the Home Secretary and the Attorney.

It appears that the committal proceedings have been adjourned from 19 April and are not likely
to be re-listed for another 2 to 3 months.

The Court will be writing its judgment on Monday and possibly Tuesday of next week, so we
can expect the judgment before the end of term (Wednesday).

 R -v- DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS EX PARTE DUCKENFIELD
 AND MURRAY

  As I mentioned to you after the hearing on Tuesday, our reading o f the way the Court may be
 thinking is that they might be inclined to quash your decision not to intervene, not on the basis
 of perversity - they made it clear that the decision was well within the bounds of reasonableness
 - but on the basis that the decision whether to intervene on one charge only should have been
 resolved by applying the terms o f the existing policy, or alternatively by way o f inviting
 representations on that point from those affected by your decision. The fact that they have
 reserved judgment may indicate that the Court wishes to think through the implications of such
 a judgment before making a final finding, but you will wish to prepare for a judgment along these
 lines.

Your alternatives, should the judgment follow this line, are:

        to apply the strict terms o f the policy to the single charge o f attempt pervert;

        to amend the policy, inviting representations from Duckenfield and Murray;

        to apply the strict terms of the policy to this case, and then amend the policy in the CPS's
        own time.

I thought you might be interested in other feedback about the arguments put before the Court,
primarily by the Applicants, pending the Court’s judgment. These go to perversity, but they may
be of interest to you in any event.

There was lengthy argument about the appropriateness o f treating the single factor of the
seriousness of the offence as overriding the several other factors pointing away from prosecution.
At one point it was argued that the Director had fettered his discretion because, the Applicants
aigued, in their view it was difficult to think of a situation in which the seriousness of the offence
would not override all other factors if it were thought to do so in this unusual case.
It was also argued that the seriousness o f the offence has a different importance in the context
of taking over a private prosecution than it does under the Code for Crown Prosecutors. Under
the Code, the CPS only considers the public interest where there is sufficient evidence to provide
a realistic prospect of a conviction. In this case, the CPS had repeatedly taken the view that there
was no realistic prospect o f a conviction. In those circumstances, it was argued, the Director
ought to give less weight to the seriousness o f the offence on the basis that the Director would
not have proceeded with the charge applying his own test. In other words, the fact that the case
failed the evidential test should, in itself, be regarded as a public interest factor.

The Applicants also argued that the Director should have looked at the objective seriousness of
the conduct on which the manslaughter charge was based in deciding what weight to give to the
seriousness o f the offence.

It seemed clear from your affidavit that you had considered this point, probably both points, and
you had also taken into account the fact that the DPP had decided not to proceed himself.

The Applicants made much o f the fact that, if one o f the functions of a trial is to bring the facts
into the open, the position in this case should be viewed against the background of public _
Inquiries and Inquests.

An overall point was made that the DPP had rightly taken a delicate approach to intervening in
private prosecutions, to respect this constitutional right. But that in this case that consideration
should have been counterbalanced by the background o f repeated inquiries and scrutinies that had
all concluded that there was no basis for a prosecution. They argued that this background had
been sidelined because o f the seriousness o f the offence.

I should say that the Applicants did not make these comments in a critical way; they recognised
the very difficult decision you had to take. They merely asked whether it was right that a private
prosecutor should be able, in effect, to ignore the combined pronouncements of inquests, public
inquiries and reviews and the stated views o f the Home Secretary and the Attorney.

It appears that the committal proceedings have been adjourned from 19 April and are not likely
to be re-listed for another 2 to 3 months.

The Court will be writing its judgment on Monday and possibly Tuesday o f next week, so we
can expect the judgment before the end o f term (Wednesday).

TRIAL DATE

SUMMARY                As a result of a Granada TV programme
                       in December 1996, the Hillsborough
                       Family Support Group (HFSG) pressed for
                       the Home Office to institute a new
                       inquest/public inquiry, and for the CPS
                       to re-open consideration of alleged
                       police misconduct.     After a careful
                       review of the evidential position the
                       CPS concluded that there was no new
                       material which justified asking the
                       p olice     to    conduct      further
                       investigations. The Home Secretary set
                       up an independent scrutiny under Lord
                       Justice Stuart-Smith. 18.12.98: The
                       Home Secretary announced that there was
                       no   justification    for   a   further
                       inquiry/inquest & no new evidence to
                       put before the DPP or police. Details
                       of the report appear to have been
                       leaked to the media through "government
                       sources".

PRESENT P O SIT IO N   HFSG    has    commenced   a    private
                       prosecution.      Both defendants are
                       charged with 2 x manslaughter (specimen
                       offences) and misconduct in public
                       office.   Duckenfield is also charged
                       with perverting the course of justice.
                       The South Yorkshire Police Authority
                       has   suspended    funding for the 2
                       defendants.     An application by the
                       defendants for leave to apply for
                       judicial review of the CPS decision, is
                       to be heard on 22.03.99.      The Chief
                       Constable has obtained leave to apply
                       for a judicial review of the South
                       Yorkshire Police Authority decision to
                       suspend funding.
                      SENSITIVE CASE LIST
                           HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY



UPDATE:

 On 22.3.99 the Divisional Court handed down judgement on an application by the two
defendants for judicial review of the CPS decision not to take over the private
prosecution in order to discontinue as they had requested. Whilst the DPP's policy
 and his decision not to take over and discontinue the charges of manslaughter and
wilful neglect to perform a public duty were found to be lawful, the Court quashed the
decision not to intervene insofar as it related to the charge of attempting to pervert the
course of justice laid against Mr Duckenfield.. Accordingly the Director of Casework^
^,on behalf o f the DPP, has exercised the power under section 6(2) of the Prosecution
of Offences Act 1985to take over the private prosecution of the pervert course of
justice charge and has discontinued it. The prosecution of the remaining charges
against the two defendants is not affected by this decision.

Judgement was also handed down on the application by the Chief Constable of the
South Yorkshire Police for the judicial review of his Police Authority's decision that
they did not have the power to fund the two defendants' legal expenses. The Court
said that they did have the power. The Authority is now considering its position
afresh.

The committal date of 19 April 1999 has been vacated so that all parties can consider
the next step. A new date for a hearing has not yet been set.

There has been intense media reporting of the tragedy around the recent 10th
Anniversary.

    I, CHRISTOPHER WILLIAM PAUL NEWELL, of 50 Ludgate Hill, London EC4M 7EX,
    MAKE OATH and say as follows:


    1.     I am Director of Casework of the Crown Prosecution Service at the above address and

           it was I who took the decision in this case on behalf of the CPS and the DPP not to

           intervene in the private prosecution against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray. I refer

           to my letters of 1 February 1999 to the solicitors for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray,

           in which I sought to set out the reasons which led me to that decision. I am now asked

           to elaborate on my conclusion that any public interest factors tending against
     prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour and on my conclusion in relation

     to the specific charge against Mr Duckenfield alone of attempting to pervert the course

     of justice.




PUBLIC INTEREST FACTORS

2.   As I now recall, the public interest factors tending against prosecution which I

     considered were as follows.

     (1)   Previous reviews of the case, in particular those carried out by the DPP when

            considering the question whether criminal proceedings should be taken against

            Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray and the more recent report of Lord Justice

            Stuart-Smith.

     (2)     The fact that the Applicants had been told on previous occasions that the DPP

            did not intend to prosecute.

     (3)     The delay which had occurred between the commission of the alleged offences

            and the commencement of this prosecution and its likely effect on the

            Applicants, although I took the view that delay may be offset by the seriousness

            of the alleged offences (as is reflected in paragraph 6.5(d) of the Code for

            Crown Prosecutors) (“the Code”).

     (4)     The effect of the delay on the evidence, for example in terms of the potential

            impairment of the recollections of witnesses.

     (5)     The assertion made on behalf of Mr Murray of ill-health, although I noted that

            no medical evidence had been put forward in support of this assertion and that,

            as again reflected in the Code (at paragraph 6.5(e)), ill-health may be offset by



                                           2
%
                  the seriousness of the offence.



    3.   As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was in my view one

         extremely important factor in favour of prosecution, namely the very serious nature of

         the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged offences of manslaughter.         In my

         opinion, the allegation that two senior police officers were responsible for the deaths

         of a number of people as a result of criminal negligence was a very grave allegation.




4.       Paragraph 6.2 of the Code reflects the considerable weight attached by the CPS to the

         seriousness of the alleged offence when seeking to strike the right balance as to the

         factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to the opening words of paragraph

         6.4).   Having carefully considered the factors tending against prosecution and this

         extremely important factor in favour of it, I came to the firm conclusion that the factors

         tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh what I considered to be the very

         strong public interest factor in favour of prosecution.




THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE AS AGAINST MR DUCKENFIELD ALONE

5.       I was fully aware of the seriousness of this additional charge.        I also tentatively

         concluded that partial intervention (i.e. intervening in order to take over one charge but

         not intervening in relation to the other charges) was in law open to the CPS and I

         proceeded on that assumption. However, the existing policy did not cover the situation

         which arose in this case, namely where the conclusion was reached that there was

         clearly a case to answer in relation to some of the charges but not in relation to others.



                                                    3
V




           (I can say that with some confidence, since I had overall responsibility for formulating

           the policy). I had therefore to consider the question which arose in relation to this

           additional charge without the benefit of any specific or settled policy. Having carefully

           considered the question, I concluded that it was in fact inappropriate to intervene only

           to take over (with a view to discontinuing) this additional charge.




    6.     First, partial intervention was not, in my view, either appropriate or desirable. It

           seemed to me that the DPP should either intervene so as to take over the proceedings

           in their entirety or not at all. To have intervened partially would still have left criminal

           proceedings in place in relation to the other charges which included the even more

           serious charge of manslaughter.       Secondly, I took into account the fact that Mr

           Duckenfield would not be left without any remedy in relation to this additional charge.

           On the contrary, he would be entitled to invite the Magistrates’ Court to dismiss it on

          the basis that there was no case to answer. Thirdly, the charge arose out of essentially

          the same events as the events which gave rise to the other charges and thus those events

          would be scrutinised in any event.

         opinion, the allegation that two senior police officers were responsible for the deaths

         of a number of people as a result of criminal negligence was a very grave allegation.




    4.   Paragraph 6.2 of the Code reflects the considerable weight attached by the CPS to the

         seriousness of the alleged offence when seeking to strike the right balance as to the

         factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to the opening words of paragraph

         6.4).   Having carefully considered the factors tending against prosecution and this

         extremely important factor in favour of it, I came to the firm conclusion that the factors

         tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh what I considered to be the very

         strong public interest factor in favour of prosecution.




    THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE AS AGAINST MR DUCKENFIELD ALONE

    5.   I was fully aware of the seriousness of this additional charge.        I also tentatively

         concluded that partial intervention (i.e. intervening in order to take over one charge but

         not intervening in relation to the other charges) was in law open to the CPS and I

         proceeded on that assumption. However, the existing policy did not cover the situation

         which arose in this case, namely where the conclusion was reached that there was

         clearly a case to answer in relation to some of the charges but not in relation to others.



                                                   3
       (I can say that with some confidence, since I had overall responsibility for formulating

       the policy). I had therefore to consider the question which arose in relation to this

       additional charge without the benefit of any specific or settled policy. Having carefully

      considered the question, I concluded that it was in fact inappropriate to intervene only

       to take over (with a view to discontinuing) this additional charge.




6.    First, partial intervention was not, in my view, either appropriate or desirable. It

      seemed to me that the DPP should either intervene so as to take over the proceedings

      in their entirety or not at all. To have intervened partially would still have left criminal

      proceedings in place in relation to the other charges which included the even more

      serious charge of manslaughter.       Secondly, I took into account the fact that Mr

      Duckenfield would not be left without any remedy in relation to this additional charge.

      On the contrary, he would be entitled to invite the Magistrates’ Court to dismiss it on

      the basis that there was no case to answer. Thirdly, the charge arose out of essentially

      the same events as the events which gave rise to the other charges and thus those events

      would be scrutinised in any event.

             the seriousness of the offence.



3.   As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was in my view one

     extremely important factor in favour of prosecution, namely the very serious nature of

     the alleged offences, in particular, the a leged offences of manslaughter.         In my

     opinion, the allegation that two senior poli e officers were responsible for the deaths

     of a number of people as a result of crimin al negligence was a very grave allegation.



4.   Paragraph <5.2 of the Code reflects the cons derable weight attached by the CPS to the

     seriousness of the alleged offence when seeking to strike the right balance as to the

     factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to the opening words of paragraph

     6.4).   Having carefully considered die factors tending against prosecution and this

     extremely important factor in. favour of it, I came to the firm conclusion that the factors

     tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh what I considered to be the very

     strong public interest factor in. fa vour of prosecution.



THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE AS AGAINST MR DUCKENFIELD ALONE

5,   1 was fully aware of the seriousness of this additional charge.         I also tentatively

     concluded that partial intervention (i.e. intervening in order to take over one charge but

     not intervening in relation to the other charges) was in law open to the CPS and I

     prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour and on my conclusion in relation

     to the specific charge against Mr Duckenfield alone of attempting to pervert the course

     of justice.



PUBLIC INTEREST FACTORS

2.   As I now recall, the public interest factors tending against prosecution which I

     considered were as follows.

     (1)     Previous reviews of the case, in pa rticular those carried out by the DPP when

             considering the question whether criminal proceedings should be taken against

             Mr DuckenfieJd and Mr Murray and the more recent report of Lord Justice

             Stuart-Smith.

     (2)     The fact that the Applicants had bekn told on previous occasions that die DPP

             did not intend to prosecute.

     (3)     The delay which had occurred betwben the commission of the alleged offences

             and the commencement of this prosecution and its likely effect on the

             Applicants, although I took the view that delay may be offset by the seriousness

             of the alleged offences (as is reflected in paragraph 6,5(d) of the Code for

             Crown Prosecutors) ("the Code”).

     (4)     The effect of the delay on the evj.dbn.ee, for example in terms of the potential

             impairment o f the recollections of witnesses.

     (5)     The assertion made on. behalf of Mr Murray of ill-health, although I noted that

             no medical evidence had been put forward in support of this assertion and that,

             as again reflected in the Code (at paragraph 6.5(e)), ill-health may be offset by

Dear Miss Ross

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Further to our telephone conversation today, I have looked at my correspondence file
in detail.

In his second affidavit Mr Maiming states that prior to 18 December 1998, when he
received the letter communicating the Director's decision, I had led him to believe that
the decision would be given with reasons.

Although I was aware that Winckworth Sherwood, in their letter to us of 9 October
1998, were of the view that the Director was bound to give full and detailed reasons
for the decision taken addressing the issues raised by all the parties, I have not seen
any similar point raised by Mr Maiming of Walker Morris. I have neither a record nor
memory of any communication with Mr Manning (or any other party to the
prosecution) on that point until after 18 December. I am fully aware o f the general
policy that the Director does not give detailed reasons for decisions to prosecute or
not prosecute and would not presume to enter into discussions that are contrary to the
stated policy without authorisation. My draft letter of 22 December 1998 gives
support to this.

I can only suppose that Mr Maiming is confusing our general correspondence prior to
18 December with the misconceptions he holds about our communications after that
date. In any event I have never said to either of the defence solicitors that any
decision made and promulgated by the reviewing lawyer in London would be
supported by detailed reasons.
Please let me know if you require any further information.

Yours sincerely

          Dear Miss Ross

          RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

          Further to our telephone conversation today, I have looked at my correspondence file
          in detail.

          In his second affidavit Mr Manning states that prior to 18 December 1998, when he
          received the letter communicating the Director's decision, I had led him to believe that
          the decision would be given with reasons.

          Although I was aware that Winckworth Sherwood, in their letter to us of 9 October
          1998, were of the view that the Director was bound to give full and detailed reasons
          for the decision taken addressing the issues raised by all the parties, I have not seen
          any similar point raised by Mr Manning of Walker Morris. I have neither a record nor
          memory o f any communication with Mr Manning (or any other party to the
          prosecution) on that point until after 18 December. I am fully aware o f the general
          policy that the Director does not give detailed reasons for decisions to prosecute or
          not prosecute and would not presume to enter into discussions that are contrary to the
          stated policy without authorisation. My draft letter of 22 December 1998 gives
          support to this.

          I can only suppose that Mr Manning is confusing our general correspondence prior to
          18 December with the misconceptions he holds about our communications after that
          date. In any event I have never said to either o f the defence solicitors that any
          decision made and promulgated by the reviewing lawyer in London would be
          supported by detailed reasons.

1.     I am a Prosecution Tearn Leader at the York Branch of CPS Central
Casework. I have been involved with the Hillsborough Disaster case since January
1997 following a drama documentary that had been shown on national television the
previous month. Initially the CPS role was to ascertain from the police the impact of
any new material facts on the matter.

2.       In March 1997 the Hillsborough Family Support Group sent a large volume
of papers to the Director o f Public Prosecutions concerning what they said to be new
evidence that proved there had been suppression of evidence, perjury and a
conspiracy to pervert the course o f justice which had allegedly featured in the legal
process that followed the disaster. I was appointed to review this material and
provide a report to the Director My report was submitted in early May 1997. It
concluded that there was no sufficient evidence on the allegations of either the
suppression of video evidence from the disaster or o f medical evidence. Accordingly
there were no grounds for the CPS to recommend to the Home Secretary that there
should be further investigation of the criminal allegations against the police or other
persons.

3.      Following the independent scrutiny by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which I
understood to conclude that none of the evidence considered added anything
significant to the evidence which was available to Lord Taylor's Inquiry or to the
Inquests, The Hillsborough Family Support Group began a private prosecution against
David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray. The solicitor acting for the group requested
from the CPS disclosure of all material in our possession including police reports and
the advice of counsel. I was then appointed to review the evidence in order to make
appropriate recommendations to the Chief Crown Prosecutor o f Central Casework and
to the Director as to what action, if any, should be taken by the CPS.

4.      In early July 1998 the solicitors for both defendants requested that the CPS
took over the conduct o f the proceedings under section 6(2) o f the Prosecution of
Offenders Act 1985 and then to discontinue them under section 23(3) of the Act. We
were also requested to provide details of our policy in the taking over o f private
prosecutions and this was done by letter of 27 July 1998. Because of my previous
involvement and knowledge of the case I was appointed to review the case and
prepare a report for my Chief Crown Prosecutor. Representations from the various
parties to the private prosecution were received by the CPS between late July and 12
October 1998. My report on these representations was completed on 27 October 1998
and forwarded to my Chief Crown Prosecutor in London. I understood that any
decision on the case would be taken by Mr Chris Newell, the then Chief Inspector at
the Directorate of Casework Evaluation. I was involved in the promulgation o f his
decision to all interested parties on 18 December 1998.

5.      I am aware of the second affidavit of Richard Bruce Manning affirmed on 15
March 1999 where he says that I had led him to believe that the decision would be
given together with reasons. He further says that I led him to believe that a letter of
reasons already existed and would be sent to him before Christmas or possibly early
in the New Year.
6.     Now produced and shown to me is a bundle of documents marked GRC 1
being notes and correspondence of my involvement on the matters alleged in
paragraph 5 o f this affidavit.

7.       On 18 December 1999 I received a fax from Mr Manning requesting more
detailed reasons for our decision not to intervene in the private prosecution. I then
immediately prepared a minute, dated 21 December 19998, for Mr Newell together
with a draft response for amendment as required, which could then be sent to Mr
Manning. This response was drafted in anticipation that our normal policy o f not
giving detailed reasons would be followed. During a telephone conversation with Mr
Manning earlier that day, I told him that I had drafted a response to his request o f the
18th and it would be sent to Mr Newell in London for his approval. I do not believe
that I gave a precise date for the delivery of the response as any timing depended upon
Mr Newell. I accept that I told Mr Manning that I would write to him formally before
Christmas Eve, and did so by way of faxing a holding letter, dated 22 December, to
him. At no time did I intimate that the response which I had drafted for Mr Newell to
approve contained the detailed reasons that were requested. As is obvious from the
draft exhibited in GRC 1 ,1 considered that no detailed reasons should be given.

8.      Mr Manning's letter to us of 22 December 1998, appears to accept that I told
him I had a response in draft form. His statement in that letter, that I promised that
particular response by close o f business on 24 December, is at variance with his belief
noted in paragraph 3 of his second affidavit that it would possibly be sent early in the
New Year.

9.     On 22 December 1998 I wrote to Ms Sue Ross of the Treasury Solicitor's
department requesting advice and enclosing a bundle of documents including the draft
response mentioned above. This was at the request o f Mr Newell.

10.      Mr Manning's faxed letter to us o f 23 December 1998 accepts that I told him
that a draft reply existed. In that letter he does not allege that I told him the reply
would include reasons for our decision. That is because I gave no hint o f what the
content might be. It would have been wrong o f me to pre-empt how Mr Newell might
wish to reply.

11.     My file note o f 5 January 1999 concerning my telephone conversation with an
Assistant Chief Crown Prosecutor in Central Casework, Mr Robin Booth, shows that
a decision had been made to await the advice of the Treasury Solicitor before formally
replying to the request for detailed reasons. A letter dated 6 January was then sent to
Mr Mannings' firm o f solicitors explaining that a response would be sent as soon as it
was known.

12.      Mr Manning replied by faxed letter of 8 December 1999. He states that until
this moment there has never been a suggestion that a reply with reasons was not going
to be provided. My reply to that statement would be that I have never indicated one
way or the other as to what a substantive reply to his request would contain. My
impression is that Mr Manning has leapt to an unjustified conclusion. On 12 January
I replied to his letter with my regret over any misconceptions that may have resulted
from our conversations and letters.
13.     I was aware that the Treasury Solicitor had taken advice from leading counsel
on the point and that a formal response to Mr Manning's request of 18 December 1998
was sent to him (and to the solicitors acting for Mr Duckenfield) on 1 February 1999.

 Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON -V-M DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY
LEEDS MAGISTRATES COURT 21 DECEMBER 1998

We refer to your letter by fax this morning. We require to know:

1.            What factual matters have persuaded you to come to this decision, identifying
              the factual elements upon which you have relied, in saying that you would not
              intervene, and further identifying which of that evidence is “new” since the last
              time that the D.P.P. considered this case.

2.            The way in which you applied your discretion under the Code for Crown
               Prosecutors and Statutes.

Unless we hear by Monday at 10.00.a.m. with full details as requested, we will assume
that you have applied the discretion in the way set out in correspondence, and that you
have not regarded any evidence that you have considered relevant as “new” evidence,
and we will proceed and advise our Client on that basis.


Yours faithfully



R.B. Manning

    I am getting increasingly concerned that we have still not sent a substantive response to W alker Morris about
    our reasons for not intervening. It must look as if we have something to hide - or even as if we are only now, at
    this late stage, trying to think of some reasons. This, of course, is far from being the case; but the longer we
    leave it, the more suspicious it must look and the less likely will W alker Morris be to accept what we say at face
    value (assuming that they ever were, which might be an heroic assumption). Is Sue Ross still considering the
    matter? Would you please let me know as a matter of urgency what the present position is? When are we likely
    to get Sue’s advice and by when do we expect to reply to Walker Morris? I should like to have some firm dates,
    please. If Sue wants to discuss the matter, I am ready to do so at the earliest opportunity.

Sue Ross of the Treasury Solicitors Dept expects to send me a draft letter today as the reply to the defence
solicitors’ requests for our detailed reasons for not intervening in the private prosecution.

She informed me in our telephone conversation late yesterday that her advice will be to run it past Philip Havers
QC before sending it out.
On receipt of this draft I shall fax it to addressees of this e mail for your consideration.

I   understand that her position will be that we should give more detailed reasons than we would normally do so.

The latest information from the HFSG is that their representations to the Souith Yorkshire Police Authority re the
legality of the funding for the two defendants are to heard at a meeting with the Chief Constable present. In the
meantime I'm informed that the Authority has stopped funding for any judicial review application pending a final
decision. A newspaper report of 20.1 shows that the Authority members are concerned about the seemingly
open ended funding. The district auditor has also been asked to look at the legality of the Authority s decision.

     Dear Mr Enzor

     Adlington -v- Duckenfield and Murray

     We refer to recent correspondence, specifically in regard to the decision advised on 18
     November 1998 not to intervene to take over the public prosecution, and note with concern
     that we have not heard further from you since our letter o f 23 December 1998 in regard to
     the provision o f reasons.

     As you w ill appreciate we need to act expeditiously in considering the implications o f this
     matter, and would be grateful for your advice by return as to when the reasons can be
     expected.

     Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your letter o f 13 January 1999.

Your request for full and detailed reasons as to the CPS decision not to intervene in
this private prosecution is actively being considered in London. A similar request has
been made by Walker Moms.

I regret that I am not able to give you an exact date when a substantive reply may be
available, however I have been informed that a response should be made this month.

I shall contact you again when I know more.

Yours faithfully

TO:   Chris Newell

RE: HILLSBOROUGH

1.    All the parties to the private prosecution are at Leeds Magistrates’ Court this
      morning for an application by the defendants re disclosure of documents in the
      possession of the South Yorkshire police.

2.    Attached is a copy faxed letter from the solicitors for Mr. Murray requesting
       details of our decision making process. I have spoken to them this morning
      and they now know that any decision about disclosure will be taken in London .       ,
       and^will.be promulgated to ^he^^as s o ^ a s possible. D fZ lQ ^ ( t£~ $ \          IS

3.    I have also spoken to Ann Adlington o f the HFSG and to Mr. Shepherd of
       Hammond Suddards who are both keenly interested in what we now intend to
       do re disclosure o f documents in our possession.

4.    I understand that the court are waiting on our decision before setting a new
       date for the present application. A further complication is that Mr. Murray
       intends to make an application for judicial review of our decision not to
       intervene and his solicitor considers that the disclosure point should be
       considered after that application is heard. That is, if their application is
       successful and we intervene in order to discontinue then disclosure will not be
       relevant, while if they are unsuccessful then voluntary disclosure can be given
       as required before committal proceedings.

5.    All parties have a schedule of the documents in CPS possession. Except for
      internal CPS material, advice from Counsel and correspondence with the
      police and other judicial authorities,it is comprised o f papers provided to us by
      the police. These are in the form o f transcripts o f evidence from the Taylor
      Inquiry and the Inquest, copy statements and exhibits obtained by the police
      and police reports.

6.    It may be considered that we can give voluntary disclosure o f documents in
       our possession that are already in the public domain (statements and other
       material that are now in the House o f Commons Library as a result of the
       scrutiny). Advice from counsel is legally privileged and there is no reason
       why that privilege should be waived for the purposes o f the private
       prosecution. Internal correspondence and notes o f the decision making
       process are subject to public interest immunity on the basis o f the candour test
       and in any event are unlikely to be relevant (except for judicial review
       proceedings when evidence can be provided by way o f affidavits).
7.     We have not been asked by the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire police for
       further advice re voluntary disclosure and from taking to the police solicitors
       this morning it appears that they will advise as required. Any PII documents
       generated by the police (eg police reports) will require waiver from the Chief
       Constable before disclosure can be given.

8.     Do you need any more information from me to enable the disclosure decision
       to be made at this time? All the parties are pressing for either the decision to
       be made as soon as possible today or for a deadline date to be given them.

DRAFT LETTER TO DEFENCE SOLICITORS 1 0 . F o £                 K



Dear Sirs

RE: ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

The Crown Prosecution Service decision not to intervene in this private prosecution
by Ann Adlington , representing the Hillsborough Family Support Group, has already
been promulgated to you.

Mr. Croston’s letter of 27 July 1998 to the solicitor acting for the Hillsborough
Family Support Group, and which was copied to you, explains our policy where a
private prosecution is involved. In particular he covered the application o f that policy
where, as here, we are asked by a defendant to take over the case in order to
discontinue it. In essence we should only take over a private prosecution when there
is a particular need for us to do so on behalf o f the public and in accordance with the
principles set out in the stated policy.

As was disclosed in earlier correspondence the policy is different to that of the Code
for Crown Prosecutors which states that we can only bring cases where there is
sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect o f conviction and that the public interest
requires a prosecution.

The policy in considering private prosecutions enshrines the individual’s right to
bring a private prosecution, which is contained within Section 6(1) o f the prosecution
o f Offences Act 1985. It recognises that there will always be some circumstances
where although the Crown Prosecution Service will not take over and run a
prosecution, it is right that the private prosecutor be allowed to continue with their
prosecution.

The review conducted by the Crown Prosecution Service considered all the
documents made public by the various inquiries and judicial hearings from that o f the
late Lord Taylor through to the recent scrutiny. In addition documents subject to legal
privilege and public interest immunity that had been seen by Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith were also considered. All the parties to this prosecution were asked if they
could provide further material that had not been previously examined. Evidence and
representations were received from both you and the other parties and these were
incorporated into the review bundle.

We then used our stated test and considered whether one or more of the following
circumstances applied:

•   There is clearly no case to answer.
•   The public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those
    factors tending in favour.
•   The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.
In coming to our decision not to intervene in the case as a whole, we judged that it
was not possible for us to say that any one or more o f those circumstances clearly
could not apply. We fully considered all the evidence and representations, the overall
circumstances o f the case and the interests o f the public and justice. It was thought
not appropriate to exercise the Director’s power under the Prosecution of Offences
Act 1985 to accede to your request to take over and discontinue the case.

I appreciate that our decision will not be welcomed by your client and that you might
wish a more detailed explanation of the application o f our stated policy, but we
consider that it would be wrong to go further and publicly discuss the strength of the
evidence in a particular case and a decision not to prosecute.

If I can be o f any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Sirs

We refer to the writer’s telephone call to Mr Croston on 21 December. You advised
that you had in draft form a response to our request in our letter o f 18 December and
that you expected to provide this to us no later than close o f business on 24 December.
You had earlier spoken to HFSG and also Mr Shepherd o f Hammond Suddards and you
in H t r a t e d that you were inclined to the view that it was inappropriate to give disclosure

until such time as the conclusion of the Judicial Review proceedings, the application for
which will include (at the suggestion o f the Stipendiary Magistrate) that the Magistrates’
Court proceedings be stayed pending determination of the application for Judicial
Review.

Dear Mrs Ross

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for indicating this morning that you are dealing with this matter on our behalf.

As you may know Ann Adlington, a solicitor acting for the Hillsborough Family Support
Group, is conducting a private prosecution against Ex Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
Ex Superintendent Murray on allegations of manslaughter, misconduct in a public office and
perverting the course o f justice.

The attached papers show details of the CPS review as to whether or not we should intervene
in this private prosecution in order to discontinue any charges. Defence solicitors had
requested that intervention. We did not consider taking over the private prosecution in order
to discontinue it as we had not seen any new and material evidence that might affect our
previous decision that there was insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect o f a conviction
on any charges against any person.

The attached documents are:-

1.      1998 CPS Review
2.      CPS police on private prosecution
3.      Letter 3.12.98: CPS to S.J. Wooler
4.      CPS minute 14.12.98
5.      Briefing note for DPP 16.12.98
6.      Letter 18.12.98: CPS to Walker Morris
7.      Press Release 18.12.98 & Qs and As
8.      Letter 18.12.98 Walker Morris to CPS
9.      Draft Letter in response to 8 above. Not Sent
10.     Minute 21.12.98
11.     Fax Letter 21.12.98: HFSG to CPS
The above documents give a general feel of the case and the reason for the intimated judicial
review which I now understand will be applied for by both defendants.

There are o f course many more relevant papers in my possession in York.

You may consider that a conference in London would be desirable once proceedings for
judicial review have been issued, if not before. I understand that you will be unavailable until
5 January 1999. Perhaps we should discuss the matter by telephone on your return.


Yours sincerely

   Dear Mr Enzor

   Adlington -v- Duckenfield and Murray
   LeedsMagistrates.'Court -2 1 December 1998

   We refer to your letter o f 18 November and note the advice con tain ed therein.

   In regard to the CPS conclusion that “we should not intervene to take over any o f the
   charges” we are bound to say, as per our detailed letter o f submissions dated 9 October
   1998, that full and detailed reasons for the decision taken are required to be ma<fc» known in
   this situation and we reiterate the request for those reasons.

   We ask for confirmation that the evidentiary test applied by the CPS in coming to its
   conclusion was that set out in your letter o f 27 July 1998 to HFSG, specifically “there is
   clearly no case to a n s w e r It may well be implicit that this is the case, but you will
   appreciate the desire for us to clarify the basis for the CPS decision before talcing matters
   farther.

   Insofar as the letter o f 27 July 1998 maintains that the CPS policy in this case builds on that
   contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, please advise which aspects o f the Code have
   been considered in coming to the conclusion reached, and the weight given to any such
   factors.

   You will appreciate that as the criminal prosecution is proceeding, we are bound to fate any
   appropriate steps following receipt o f your letter with all due expedition, and accordingly
   would be grateful if you could let us have the advice requested by return. We are aware o f a
   letter sent by the solicitors to Mr Murray, Walker Morris, on 18 December 1998 and
   notwithstanding any response you may care to give to that correspondence, we would ask
   you to deal specifically with the issues raised in this correspondence.

               ^faithfully

Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON-V-DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

We acknowledge your fax of 22 December. The answer contained therein is wholly
unsatisfactory. It is against what Mr Croston told the writer on the telephone when we
called you from Court on 21 December when it was intimated that a draft reply already
existed and would be with us no later than close of business on 24 December. We have
already noted that we believe that it was quite wrong for full and cogent reasons not to
have been set out at the same time as your decision was notified,

We reserve the right to bring the content of this correspondence to the attention o f the
Court that considers an application for Judicial Review of your decision.

Yours faithfully

     Dear Mr Croston

     You told us that we would not receive a response to our request for the reasons not
     to intervene until January. Can you please now respond immediately to that request.

                       FILENOTE: HILLSBOROUGH

5.1.99

T/C from Ann Adlington re the disclosure process. I confirmed CE’s letter of
31.12.98 that we would give voluntary disclosure subject to police representations as
to the material that can be properly given. That letter was under the misapprehension
that the police were against giving vol. disclosure until the result o f any judicial
review proceedings was known. It now transpires that the police are agreeable to
giving vol. disclosure subject to the usual rules concerning PII and legal privilege. I
said that I was awaiting the police response and would send the HFSG a formal reply
by fax tomorrow.

T/C to Eric Parsons re any charges to be made for the photocopying required for vol.
disclosure to the parties. He later answered by discussion with PJ. Subject to a policy
decision we could use Alfagraphics to do the required work and to bill the various
parties at the standard rate o f 1.9p per page. The bill could be sent directly to the
party.

T/C to Peter Metcalfe o f Hammond Suddards re CE’s letter o f 31.12 and my letter of
23.12. We agreed that he would formally reply to the later letter as the circumstances
had changed since 23.12 in that they were going to give vol. disclosure as necessary.
He was quite satisfied that the CPS could disclose statements and exhibits to all
parties. We accepted that I would not disclose CPS/police correspondence, our
internal correspondence, counsels’ advice or CPS reports, and that I would refer the
parties to the police where there was police generated material that might attract PII.
His letter would be faxed to me am 6.1.

T/C to Robin Booth re above.

1.   He agreed that York could send a letter to the HFSG along the above lines.
     Similar letters to be sent to the other parties.
2.   The draft reply to the Walker Morris letter of 18.12 was with Sue Ross in the
     Treasury Solicitors department. We should await her advice before formally
     replying. If such advice could not be obtained this week then a holding letter was
     to be sent.
3.   Agreed that any voluntary disclosure given to the HFSG should be offered to
     both defendants as per our policy guidelines. Any photocopying would be
     charged at the rate o f 1.9p per page. Photocopying would be done by
     Alfagraphics. However we would absorb the firsj^50 for each party, and they
     would only be billed for amounts above that sum.

T/C to Sue Ross at 1730 asking her to call me b ack .

NB. RB’s home tel is                   is he is not in the office on 6.12.

ACTION: GC to draft letters for all parties re the giving of vol. disclosure, contact
SR re response to Walker Morris and draft letter as req. Copies o f correspondence to
be sent to Hammond Suddards.

        Dear Sirs

        RE: ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

        Thank you for your two letters of 5 January 1999 addressed to this office.

        Your request to be given the reasons why the CPS is not intervening in this private
        prosecution is still being considered. I regret that I am unable to give you a date when
        a decision will be made however I shall contact you as soon as it is known.

        Attached is a copy o f our latest letter to the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

        The Crown Prosecution Service is now ready to give you voluntary disclosure o f the
        documents in our possession on the same basis as for the other parties to this
        prosecution. It is a matter for you whether you wish to accept this offer or not.

        In order to assist you I have enclosed a copy o f the Schedules of the material in our
        possession at this office.

        Please contact me to arrange a date and time for any required inspection o f these
        documents.

 We. acknowledge your letter o f 6 January by fax., We note that' you have effectively
 copied the letters written on a Round Robin basis. On that basis would you please let
 us have a copy o f the tenet o f 5 Jam ay referred t0 m the penultimate paragraph o f your
 letter to Ann Adlington o f 6 January.

   We also refer to our telephone conversation with Mr Croston in the late afternoon o f 7
  January. You told us that the first sentence of your letter of 6 January meant that you
  were considering whether the Crown Prosecution would actually give reasons not to
  intervene m this private Rrosecution. There is no dispute that M r Croston told the writer
  on the telephone on 21 December that a draft reply already existed and that it would be
       ™ no later than dose of business' on 24 December. That was recorded m our letter
■ of 23 December. There has never been until this moment, a suggestion that a reply with
  reasons was not going to be provided. -

We are therefore^ bewildered by this first intimation that you are now considerkg
w h rte r you ^ gije reasons t a s t e s . We gave certain indications to the Court and
to HFSG as to fee time mUm which we expected to be able to lodge 'an application for
Judicial Review which was against the assurance that we would have been provided with
Ac reasons by 24 December. The matters set out above both impact on our ability to
proceed with the application for Judicial Review and the proposed timetable o f the
             t     f             1116 ^    t0      1116 * ‘*a*nce of ^ correspondence

Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your letter o f 8 January 1999.

I look forward to meeting with you at 0930 on 14 January for consideration o f our voluntary
disclosure.

The letter o f 5 January sent to me by Ann Adlington asked me to give ‘guidance’ to the
police on the costs of disclosure. As you can see from my reply I was not able to do so.

I note your concern on the matter of our response to your request of 18 December 1998 that
we provide you with full details of, what is in effect, our decision making process. My file
note o f our telephone conversation on 21 December confirms that I stated that I had drafted a
letter in reply but that any decision on your request was to be taken in London. I have no
record that I gave any assurance that you would receive a substantive answer by 24
December only that we would respond by that date.

My letter to you o f 22 December 1998 explained that whilst the CPS was considering your
request a substantive response could not be made before January 1999. Your letter o f 5
January 1999 in reply, appears to accept that we would not give a response to your request for
the reasons in not intervening in this private prosecution until January. My further letter o f 6
January explained that your request was still being considered and would be given to you
when it was known.

I do not believe that I have stated or intimated anything more than that your request was
being considered. That I had prepared a draft reply does not lead to any inference about the
content of that letter, only that your correspondence was under active consideration.

In our telephone conversation of 7 January I did no more than attempt to correct your
misconception that you were to receive detailed reasons o f our decision not to intervene. I
explained that the decision on your request was being made in London. I also explained that
in my opinion it would not be usual for such detailed reasons to be given. That opinion must
surely coincide with your own experience o f the CPS decision making process. Where an
application for leave to move for judicial review of a CPS decision has been made, I
understand that the Divisional Court will always adjourn proceedings for oral argument and
will invite the CPS to respond.

I regret that my attempts to assist you in the course o f our telephone conversations have
resulted in any misconceptions. In future it may be better if I confine my remarks to formal
correspondence.

Please let me know if I can be o f any further assistance.


Yours faithfully




George R Croston

    1, RICHARD BRUCE MANNING, MAKE OATH AND SAY AS FOLLOWS:

    1.    This affidavit is in Teply to the claim that the application has not been made promptly;
    paragraph 3(£) of the affidavit of Anne Marie Addlington, sworn on 9 March 1999, and
    paragraph 12 o f the Respondent's undated skeleton argument, (received 12 March 1999).


    2.    There has been no undue delay. Such delay as is now complained o f has been wholly
    caused by the Respondent and Intervenor.


    The Respondent
    3.     The Director’s decisions were communicated to me by letter dated 18 December 1998. y
    Mr Croston had led me to believe that the decision would be given together w ith reasons. When
    no reasons were given. I immediately wrote asking for them as a matter o f urgency. Counsel
    advised me in writing that it would be necessary to consider written reasons before finally advising
    on judicial review o f the decision. Mr Croston led roe to believe that a letter o f reasons already


                                                     1
I                                                                                                         121003




    existed and would be sent to us before Christmas or possibly early in the New Year, Counsel so
    informed the Magistrate on 21 December 1998.


    4      The Director delayed until early February before despatching the reasons letter, dated 1
   February 1999. In the meantime, I pressed the Director to expedite the disclosure o f reasons. ^


   ^       But for this delay o f the Director, the present application would have been before the
   Court in early January 1999, in accordance with indications given to the Magistrate by my
   counsel, (see Addlington's affidavit, paragraph 13).


   The Intervenor
   6.      In paragraph 13 o f her affidavit, Miss Addlington misrepresents the tenor o f what leading
   counsel for Mr Murray said. In a private discussion on 2 1 December 1998 between counsel and
   solicitors, held to tiy and reach broad agreement as to timetable, Mr Harrison Q.C. indicated that
   it was highly likely that an application forjudicial review would be made. When pressed by leading
   counsel for the Intervenor to say whether or not there would be an application, Mr Harrison said
   that it could be taken that one would be made, This was said in the context o f setting out a
   Magistrate's Court timetable. It was believed that the decision would be susceptible o f review but,
   as I have indicated, counsel had advised that it would be necessary to see the reasons.


  7.     To support her complaint o f delay in these proceedings, Miss Addlington asserts that
  Counsel had made a settled decision to apply for judicial review and should have made the
  application before seeing the reasons. In her affidavits in proceedings involving the Chief
  Constable -v- the Police Authority, she asserts that Counsel were profligate and irresponsible
  towards their use o f public funds because they are said to have made a settled decision to launch
  an application before seeing the reasons.


  8.     The intervenor caused further delay by actively campaigning to have the Applicant’s funds
  withdrawn, thus embarrassing the Applicant with regard to his funding.

    IN THE MATTER OF APPLICATIONS FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW BY DAVID
    DUCKENFIELD AND BERNARD MURRAY OF A DECISION OF THE CROWN
    PROSECUTION SERVICE ANNOUNCED ON 18th DECEMBER 1998



                                 Affidavit of Ann Marie Adlington



    I, Ann Marie Adlington, Solicitor of the Supreme Court, of 1st Floor, Central Buildings, 41
    North John Street, Liverpool L2 6RR, MAKE OATH and SAY;


    1      I am a Solicitor of the Supreme Court and the legal adviser to the Hillsborough Family
           Support Group (“HFSG”), a non-political organisation whose members are relatives of
           the ninety-six victims of the Hillsborough football stadium disaster in Sheffield on 15th
           April 1989.

                                       The criminal proceedings

    2      In July 1998 I laid information in writing before the Leeds District Magistrate Court
            alleging that Bernard Murray and David Duckenfield (“the Applicants”) were guilty of
           manslaughter of two victims of the disaster, representative of the ninety-six, and of
            misfeasance in public office; and in the case of Duckenfield alone, of attempting to
            pervert the course of justice. Summonses were issued in Leeds on 10th July 1998.
            Committal proceedings were fixed on 7th December 1998 to start in Leeds on 19th
            April.

    3      I make this affidavit in reply to the applications by the defendants for leave to move for
           judicial review of the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service of 18th December
             1998. I wish this affidavit to be considered at the oral hearing of the application for
            leave in order to present the following arguments;


                                                    1
           (A) leave should be refused because no substantial argument is presented that
           the CPS acted unlawfully or irrationally;

           (B) the discretion given to the Crown Prosecution Service under the
           Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 is so wide that the Divisional Court should
           only intervene in the plainest case ;

            (C) the material presented by the prosecution shows that the decision of the
            Crown Prosecution Service was obviously reasonable;

            (D) the Applicants have other, more convenient, remedies;

            (E) the application has not been made promptly as required by O 53, r 4, and
            the delay prejudices the rights of the prosecution and is prejudicial to good
            administration under section 31 (6) of the Supreme Court Act 1981.

                                        Evidence

4   Exhibit SBE 1, Divider 4 of the Applicant David Duckenfield’s file, has no index, but
    appears to be a collection of some of the papers relevant to the CPS decision. Written
    submissions were made to the Crown Prosecution Service on behalf of the prosecution
    as follows;

    20th July 1998 (SBE 1 p 119-125,
    31"'July 1998 (SBE 1, p 96-113),
    4th August 1998 (SBE 1, p 89-90),
    17"’ August 1998 (SBE 1, p 81-4),
    24th August 1998 (letter and substantial file not copied)
    24"' September 1998 (SBE 1, p 42) (substantial files of material not copied)
    2ntl October 1998 (SBE 1, p 32)
    9"’ October 1998 (SBE 1, p 29)

5   These submissions were made piecemeal because the Secretary of State for the Home
    Department caused to be made available substantial material in 1997, and in the Spring
    and summer of 1998, which the bereaved families had not seen before. The substance
    of the arguments presented to the CPS may most easily be seen in the representations
    of leading counsel of 24th September and 2nd October. I shall not produce the other,
    omitted, material for the leave hearing unless requested by other parties beforehand.

6   It is alleged by the prosecution that there is strong evidence of the crimes alleged
     against the Applicants, that previous enquiries into the Hillsborough disaster, including
     the CPS in 1990 and the Coroner’s jury in 1990-1, have been misled by polices officers
     from the West Midlands and South Yorkshire police; and that that fact is demonstrated
     by the material provided by the Home Secretary in 1998.




                                             2

    7     The Grounds on which Relief is Sought submitted on behalf of Bernard Dean Murray
           suggest at paragraph 6.2 and 6.3 that

                  “The respondent’s policy should lean towards intervention in a section 3 (2) (b)
                  case where the prosecutor is unable to show a defensible justification for
                  proceeding after a decision not to prosecute has been taken.”

    8     The material analysed by and submitted to the CPS last year contains very powerful
           evidence to show that the previous inquiries were misled. All that material was
           submitted to Murray’s solicitors as well as Duckenfield’s in 1998. Both applications
          for judicial review ignore altogether the importance of the evidence that has been made
           public through the good offices of the Home Secretary after the “Scrutiny” of Lord
           Justice Smith.

    9     That material, together with the previous inquiries, was given the most careful
           consideration by the CPS between July and December 1998. The solicitors for the
           Applicant Duckenfield wrote to the CPS in October 1998 making the following
           assertion;

                  “The Director is well placed to assess where the public interest lies having had
                  involvement in the case over a period of nine years and having seen the Taylor
                  Report, the Stuart-Smith Scrutiny, the coroner’s verdict, the judgment of the
                  Divisional Court and the review evidence and the advice of leading counsel
                  obtained when the Director made the decision not to prosecute.” (SBE 1, p 15-
                  6)

    10    The chronology is more complicated than appears at pages 3 ff in the Grounds of the
          Applicant Duckenfield. The most serious omission is the failure to refer to the
          investigation of the Police Complaints Authority, and the formal charges of neglect of
          duty and other matters laid against both defendants. The defendants escaped these
          charges because Duckenfield retired from the police force four months after the
          decision to prefer charges, claiming to be unwell, and the charge was then dropped
          against Murray, who then also retired, he too claiming to be unwell. (The Grounds of
          Murray do refer to the matter. However, no evidence is presented to justify the
          assertion that “continuation of the present prosecution would be injurious to his
          health” (Murray’s grounds, paragraph 7.3) and I believe that no medical evidence was
          presented to the CPS on this point.)

    The delay in making this application

    11     The Director of Public Prosecutions made his decision on 18th December 1998. In
           August the stipendiary magistrate had tentatively fixed two weeks from 7th December
           for committal proceedings. The 7th December was retained as a remand date even
           though the CPS decision had been delayed. On that date, the prosecution expressed a
           desire for the committal hearing to start in February, assuming the case had not been
           discontinued. It was common ground that, since there had been a police investigation
           into the case in 1990, the new regime for committal proceedings introduced by the

                                                  3
      Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 did not apply. The defence could
      therefore insist that the prosecution call its witnesses to establish a prima facie case.

12    The defence however made representations that leading and junior counsel had been
      instructed by each defendant, and neither leader could be available before 19th April
       1999. It was said by the defence that at least four weeks would be needed for the
      hearing. The magistrate agreed to fix 19th April.

The hearing o f 2 T' December 1998

13    At a remand hearing on 21st December at Leeds District Magistrates Court, leading
      counsel for Murray, Mr Michael Harrison QC, told the magistrate in open court in my
      presence that an application for judicial review of the CPS decision would definitely be
      made, and would be lodged within the first two weeks of January. He also told the
      court, having announced a concluded intention to apply for judicial review, that the
      CPS had indicated that it would provide some reasons, or the criteria it had applied,
      possibly on 24th December, or early in the New Year.

14    At the specific request of counsel for the prosecution for information, junior counsel
      for Duckenfield, Mr Isaacs, also told the magistrate that he would be applying for
      judicial review of the decision at the same time.

15    It was made absolutely clear that the decision would be the subject of an application
       for judicial review whatever the reasons, or the statement of criteria that the CPS
       would produce. Mr Harrison also asserted positively to the magistrate in my hearing
       that he was making no application to vacate the date of 19th April, because the date
       might act as a “lever” to ensure that the judicial review proceedings were heard
       promptly.

16    Out of concern that there might indeed be delay and prejudice to the date of committal
      proceedings, I had already written to the solicitors for the Applicants on 18th
      December inviting them to apply promptly for judicial review if they decided to apply
      at all. On 22nd December 1998 I invited them to apply by 8th January, since their
      application did not turn on the statements of reasons of criteria expected from the
      CPS. I produce true copies of these letters and replies to them, and correspondence of
      March 1999 cn the subject, as Exhibit AMA/1. The letter I referred to in my letter of
      22nd December was a letter to the South Yorkshire Police Authority arguing that the
      Authority’s decision to fund the defence was unlawful and an abuse of public funds.
      The last sentence of the letter asked that the letter itself be brought to the attention of
      the single judge if application were made for leave.

17    AMA/1 includes a copy of a letter written by Winckworth Sherwood to SYPA on 23r
      December indicating that the application should be ready “within the first two weeksof
      January”, and adding:

              “It is likely that the Court will order that the judicial review proceed
              expeditiously and there is some possibility that the full substantive hearing,

                                                 4
             which will take several days, could be heard before the present committal date
             of 191'1April.”

18   The funding issue is dealt with in the Grounds of the Applicant Duckenfield at pages
      12-3. On 5th February 1999 the Police Authority accepted the prosecution’s argument
     that the funding was unlawful. The hearing of the Chief Constable’s full motion to
      quash that decision of his own Police Authority is to be heard by the Divisional Court
      on 22nd-24th March 1998 (CO 582/99).

20   The applications for leave in the instant case were lodged on 1st March and 5‘ March.
      They were not made promptly. Neither Applicant has funding even now from the
      Police Authority, and that issue cannot therefore be used as an excuse for not having
      applied for relief sooner. There is no indication that either Applicant has applied for
      legal aid.

The hearing o f T' March 1999

21   Neither Applicant refers in his Grounds or evidence to this hearing. A remand hearing
      took place at Leeds court on 1st March. Both defendants applied to the stipendiary
      magistrate to adjourn the hearing of the committal on 19th April because each
      defendant had been deprived of his funding. I was present with counsel. This hearing
      took place on the day on which the papers of the Applicant Duckenfield, dated 26
      February, were lodged with the Crown Office.

22   The magistrate declined to vacate the date. He was told of the applications for judicial
      review of the CPS decision. I had not been told beforehand that they were being
      lodged, in spite of my letters of December. Counsel for the prosecution argued that if
      such applications were made, the application for a postponement of the committal
      proceedings should be made as an application for interim relief to the judge. The
      magistrate agreed. It is clear from paragraph 55 of the Grounds that the Applicant
      Duckenfield had already prepared such an argument himself, but his grounds do not
      refer to the Leeds application of 1st March.

23    Paragraph 55 of the Grounds settled by Duckenfield asserts that the magistrate at
      Leeds “has asked informally that the question of a stay of the criminal proceedings be
      raised for the consideration of the Court.” I do not understand this. On 21st December
      the defence declined to ask the magistrate to vacate the date. On 1st March they did
      ask him to vacate the date. The magistrate expressed his agreement with the
      proposition that the judge considering leave should consider the matter, but he has in
      no way suggested that he considers that a stay ought to be granted.

24    It will be submitted that it is obviously prejudicial to good administration and to the
       rights of the prosecution to grant a stay now, when no application has been made since
       December, whether or not the Court grants leave to move. I have spoken to the Clerk
       to the Leeds court by telephone, and have been told that they do not know when a
       further four weeks could be set aside for the committal. If the court were minded to



                                               5
       grant leave, the hearing of the motion could take place after the committal, because
       section 6 (2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 allows the CPS to take over the
       conduct of a prosecution at any time.

25     If the committal proceedings take place, the Applicants can argue that there is no case
       to answer, and that the proceedings are an abuse of process. Live evidence can be
       heard and tested on both these issues, including evidence from the defendants. It is the
       defence, not the prosecution, who asked for a committal of four weeks at least. The
       Applicants have remedies much more convenient than an application for judicial
       review, and the prosecution will willingly present evidence on the abuse of process as
       well as the substantive issues in the committal proceedings .If the matter is committed
       for trial, the Applicants will be able to argue the same issues before the judge and, if
       necessary, the facts of the case before the jury.

26     Although no answers have yet been provided to the allegations of the prosecution by
       either the Applicants or the South Yorkshire Police, it is reasonable to believe that they
       will be controversial, and that different views of the facts will be presented. It is
        submitted that these conflicting facts should not be judged by the Divisional Court on
        affidavit evidence. Reliance is placed on the practice referred to in R v. Croydon
       .Justices, ex parte Dean [1993] Q.B. 769 and the first holding, summarised in the
       headnote at 770C-D;

               “(1) that although an application to quash a committal ought normally to be
               made to the Crown Court, particularly if the indictment had already been
               signed, the High Court would, in exceptional cases, entertain such an
               application brought by way of judicial review if the point could be decided on
               the undisputed facts, together with any other facts which the court felt bound
               to accept as true, without hearing oral evidence; and that in the circumstances,
               the court would determine the application.”

27    Neither I nor counsel was provided with a copy of the grounds of either Applicant
      until Friday 5th March, in spite of my letters of December 1998 and of March 1999. On
      5"' March Winckworth and Pemberton supplied leading counsel with a file. On the
      same day I requested Walker Morris to send a copy of Mr Murray’s application by
      courier. I had to undertake to pay the costs of this service. My letters of December
      were not provided to the judge with the application. Neither Applicant explains the
      reasons for the delay in his application, as required by Form 86A.

28    I regret that it is almost certain that neither leading or junior counsei instructed for the
       prosecution can attend the hearing on I Ith March. The Crown Office has already been
       informed of this, but has fixed the 11th March because of the urgency of providing the
       Leeds court with an answer. In that event I shall not seek to incur the expense of
       instructing fresh counsel to master the complicated facts and to appear, but will rely
       instead on the contents of this affidavit and the arguments of the Crown Prosecution
       Service. I propose to attend the hearing, in case any factuai questions arise. Leading

                                                6
        counsel instructed for the prosecution will be in the Royal Courts in the Court of
        Appeal (Criminal Division) and therefore available for consultation in adjournments.

 Dear Mr Eastwood

Adlington v Duckenfield; Adlington v. Murray

I was surprised to hear yesterday that you had applied for leave to move for judicial review
and for a stay o f the committal proceedings. I do not know whether you told the Crown
Prosecution Service, but you did not inform us, contrary to my request in my letter to vou of
18thDecember.

You will appreciate that the prosecution has an obvious interest in the application for a stay,
and that we have expressed a wish to be involved. I invite you to send me a copy o f your
material without delay. We suggest that the onus is upon you, co-operating with Walker
Morris, to apply orally for leave and a stay before 22ndMarch, the next date at Leeds. I
assume that, in view o f the date o f the committal proceedings on 19thApril, you have asked
for your application to be expedited. Our leading counsel has some days free before 22nd
March and we shall seek to assist by making representations ourselves to the Crown Office
about the importance o f determining the matter before then.

Please confirm that you have informed the Crown Office that we wish to object to the grant o f
a stay, and about our approach to the question o f delay set out in our letter to you o f 22nd
December. The prosecution will obviously object to leave, and to the grant o f a stay, given
the serious delay.

Because your leading counsel told the court yesterday that you were to appear in the Chief
Constable s judicial review proceedings, I am today sending you a copy o f the affidavit and
supporting material that I have submitted. I do not understand why you had not told me
before that you intended to appear, in reply to my letter o f 23rd February.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Manning

Adlington v Murray; Adlington v Duckenfield

Yesterday you announced in court that an application for leave to move for judicial review of
the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service of 18* December 1998 would be lodged in the
Crown Office within the next few days. If; as in the case of Duckenfield, an application for a
stay is to be made, we suggest that the onus is upon you to apply orally for leave and a stay
before 22ndMarch, the next date at Leeds. Our leading counsel has some days free before
then, and we shall seek to assist by making representations ourselves to the Crown Office
 about the importance of determining the matter before that date.

 Please serve copies of your application on us when you serve them on the Crown Offic* No
 doubt you will co-ordinate matters with W inckw orth Sherwood. The prosecution will
 to leave, and to the grant of a stay, given the serious delay in making this application. On 22
 December 1998 we indicated that we would object if you had not lodged your applica            y
 8* January.
 I have sworn a substantial affidavit in the Chief Constable’s Judidal Review proceedings. If
 you confirm that you are to appear in those proceedings, please let n « know, and I     save
 a copy of our material upon you. If you propose to lodge evdenca, I          ^
 the question of what the “many tens of thousands of defence costs refeiTed to m the Form
 86A of the Chief Constable, have been spent on so far- This arises because you to
 magistrate yesterday you had not worked on the committal bundle I sent you last Augjist
 because of fears that you might not recover the sums on taxation. I am making a
 request of the Chief Constable and the South Yorkshire Police Authority.

I was glad to hear yesterday that the magistrate has been able to ease your problems m
applying for legal aid. It sometimes helps if the prosecution supports the defence in these
matters. If I can in any way assist you in emphasising the urgency and importance of your
application by writing a letter to the legal aid authorities, I shall be pleased to o so.

Yours sincerely

          Dear Miss Oades

          A d l ia g t o a *v- D u c k e a fie ld and M urray

         I re 1er :o my letter of 10 December last in regard to judicial review proceeding -rd
         confirm CnM we now have the advice from the Crown Prosecution Senice regardba our
         request to r intervention and enclose herewith a copy of Their Uttar of 1S December 1991.

         I have d:*cu55sd this matter with Leading Counsel and -n pleased to enclose herewith *
         snort mcmoraaaum cf advice regarding tie desirability of making an application for iud^^T
         review or this decision.                                            *

        On the S ais o f ibat advice, which I strongly echo., may I formally request that the Police
                            underwrite Mr Duckenfield's costa of tn application for judicial review
        0 . the C. PS/DPP decision not to intervene in this matter.

       ft may a s s is r you to know that we anticipate the framework for this will involve initially
       preparatory or an Application with a supporting Affidavit which Counsel hopes can be
       prepared within the first 2 weeks of January. The documentation would then be submitted
       to the Cro\mi Omcc o f the High Court here in London, and it is likely that an oral
       apphciitinn will have to be made before a Judge, requiring the attendance of Counsel, for
>      Leave to move for judicial review. The prosecution may or mav not be heard oa'ihar
       application, depending upon the Court’s approach, and we are confident that leave will be
       wanted. It is likely that the Court will order that the judicial review proceed expeditiously,
       and there is some possibility that the full substantive hearing, which will take several davs.
       could be heard before the present committal date of 19 April 1999. A verv roueh and readv
       cost estimate for this exercise I would put in the region of £lO.OOO-£ 15,000.

Further to the attendance before Mr Cadbury SM in Leeds on Monday we have been asked
by Counsel to raise the following matters:

Firstly, in regard to an application for leave to move for judicial review, we have noted the
request made in your letter of 18 December, to be given notice in Tegard to an application,
which was echoed again by Mr Jones QC in Court. We are content to give an undertaking
to tell the Divisional Court upon making that application that you have asked to be heard on
the issue. We are bound to say, however, that we do not accept that you have any right to
be heard and are content to leave the matter for the Court. It is our understanding that it is
likely such an application will not be determined on the papers but will require an oral
application.

Secondly, we have noted that on several occasions Mr Jones has indicated the possibility
that should a committal hearing take place, it is possible that witnesses may be called
without written statements having been served in advance. Accordingly we give notice that
if any such witnesses are to be called, we be given the names and addresses of those
witnesses in advance, otherwise it may be necessary to seek an adjournment from the Court
in regard to the evidence so given, to allow for proper consideration of that evidence and
any appropriate cross-examination to take place.

Thirdly, in regard to voluntary disclosure either from the CPS or the DPP, we would be
grateful if you could make available copies of all correspondence in regard to this matter.
As you will appreciate we are not directly involved in resolving this question.

Dear Mr Eastwood,


I enclose as a matter o f courtesy for your information, copy o f a letter I have today sent to the
South Yorkshire Police Authority. It affects your position.

Yesterday, counsel instructed by you told the magistrate that you had decided to apply for judicial
review of the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to take over the prosecution o f your
client and Mr Murray. It was apparent that you, and Mr Murray’s lawyers, had taken this decision
even though you had not received what Mr Harrison described as “reasons” in the counsel and
solicitor meeting, and “policy” before the magistrate.

The effect o f announcing this concluded decision was to cause a deferment o f any question of
voluntary disclosure of documents by the Crown Prosecution Service and South Yorkshire Police.
Under Order 53 Rule 4 o f the Rules o f the Supreme Court, it is necessary that any application for
judicial review should be filed “promptly and in any event within three months”. The decision you
have made to apply for judicial review causes delay in the matter o f disclosure. Since all the
factors that have impelled you to announce a concluded decision have been known to you for
several months, there can, I suggest, be no reason why you should not be able to lodge your
application for leave and supporting evidence by Friday 8th January 1999, however long a
Christmas holiday you take. You will have all evidence you need, and the grounds for your
application are obviously capable o f being expressed now.

We have suggested in court that you are using delay as a weapon in the case, rather than as a
genuine grievance. If you do not lodge your application for judicial review by 8thJanuary 1999,
we give you notice that we shall object, in the absence o f a compelling explanation, to the grant
o f leave and/or substantive relief on the ground that you did not apply “promptly”.

             Phone 0151 236 1919. Fax 0151 236 1936. E Mail info@hfsg.org
           1st Floor C entral Buildings 41 North John Street Liverpool L2 6RR
vVe also confirm that we wish to be heard in opposition to the grant o f leave even though the
application be strictly ex parte, and that, if you ask for the question o f leave to be determined on
the papers, you bring this letter to the attention of the single judge. We ask you to provide us with
a full copy o f your application when you lodge it with the Crown Office.


Yours Sincerely,



Ann Adlington

            Hillsborough: Adlington -v- David Duckenfield & M urray ti

            We refer to previous correspondence in this matter, in the light o f the requests made on
            behalf o f the Defendants for the Director of Public Prosecutions to take ° ver ^ con^u
            o f proceedings, pursuant to Section 6 o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 and to
            discontinue those proceedings pursuant to Section. 23. You have
            of the exchange o f correspondence between your office and the
            Support Group (HFSG), and we refer specifically to your policy letter of 27th July 1998
            outl ining the policy to be adopted in cases o f this type, i.e., private prosecutions. We have
            been provided with copies o f the representations made on behalf o f MURRAY by Messrs
            Walker Morris and would adopt those submissions on behalf o f Mr Duckenfield insofar
            as they relate to matters o f relevance to both defendants.

             Introduction

             The power o f the Director to intervene under Section (>o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act
             1985 is unfettered. It is not limited to a consideration o f the strength or weight o f the
             evi dence but embraces a consideration o f the wider public interest in whether a trial ought
             to take place.

             All the submissions of the HFSG have concentrated on a perceived evidential basis for the
             summons currently issued. J.f the existence of a prima facie case were the only basis upon
             which the Director could exercise the power under Section 6 then the effect of the section
             would be largely redundant. If no evidence existed an information could not be properly
             laid and if no prima facie case was made out then the magistrates could not commit for
             trial. Were these the only circumstances in which die power under Section 6 would be
             exercised then there would never be any need to exercise the power. It is submitted on
             behalf o f Mr Duckenfield that the power of the Director is far wider than a mere
             assessment o f the evidence and embraces a consideration o f the wider public interest.

              The Director is well placed to assess where the public interest lies having had involvement
              in the case over a period o f nine years and having seen the Taylor Report, the Stuart-Smith
              Scrutiny, the coroner’s verdict, the judgment o f the Divisional Court and the review of

P
'w     evidence and the advice o f leading counsel obtained when the Director made the decision not
       to prosecute.

      We understand and sympathise with the sentiments o f the bereaved and injured who feel
      understandably that someone must be made to pay for the disaster. We also understand the
      disappointment they feel when at every stage the decisions made have been against any
      recommendation for prosecution. It must be recorded that the lives o f everyone involved in
      the disaster have altered as a consequence o f these terrible events, including that o f Mr
      Duckenfield.

      On the date o f the disaster he had only been in his post o f chief superintendent for 21 days
      and this was the first operation o f this type where he had been in command. While the
      impact o f the events on him cannot be compared to the impact on those on the terraces they
      were nonetheless personally catastrophic.

       Until the disaster he had been a highly successful career policeman with 21 years o f service
      to the community and 3 commendations for good police work. He has never worked since
      and has had his actions subjected to analysis and examination for a period o f nine years. His
      health has been destroyed and the trauma o f the disaster and the consequential need to assist
      the authorities in the various investigations and inquests has meant that any attempt to start
      a new life has been thwarted.

     Many factors combined to contribute to the disaster as Hillsborough and these have been the
     subject o f the most exhaustive investigation by Lord Justice Taylor. One o f them, not
     mentioned hitherto in the correspondence to the Director, is the construction o f pens on the
     terraces with inadequate gates to enable fans to escape in the event o f an emergency. No-one
     appreciated at the time the danger these structures presented although as a direct consequence
     of this disaster they have been removed from every football stadium in the country.

      We do not intend in this letter to repeat all the points made forcibly by Lord Justice Taylor
     in his report nor analyse in detail the scrutiny o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. The Director is
     well able to assess each and decide where the public interest lies in this case. Nonetheless
     in view o f the assertion by the HFSG that a clear prima facie case exists, a view we find
     ourselves compelled to disagree with, and in, the light o f a number o f important factual
     inaccuracies in their submissions o f 24 September we feel it necessary to set the record
     straight at this stage.

     The Stuart-Smith Scrutiny

     One of the terms o f reference o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was to ascertain whether any
     evidence exists relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium which was not available
     to the Director or the Attorney General for the purposes o f discharging their respective
     statutory responsibilities and to advise whether any evidence not previously available is o f
     such significance as to justify their attention to be drawn to it. There was none. As part o f
     the Scrutiny, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith read the joint opinion o f counsel dated <5 August 1990
     he considered the resume o f evidence and the statement o f law set out therein             The
     conclusion reached was;


                                                   2
CPS 4th Floor                                               09/03 '99 12:52 NO.628           04/12




                "I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before the
                Director o f Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which
                might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taJcen",
                                                                              (Chapter 7 p 103(5))

        It would seem that the submission made by HFSG that leading counsel, providing the joint
        opinion, would have misapplied the law relating to manslaughter to the facts o f the case
        is wrong. (HFSG submission 17/8/98 para J.4). No such, view was formed by Lord Justice
        Stuart-Smith and the Director has available the opinion to assess for herself the merits of
        this submission advanced by HFSG.

       All Hie evidence alleged to be "new" was available to the Scrutiny, it is inaccurate to
       suggest to the contrary.

               "South Yorkshire Police have an extensive archive o f material about the
               Hillsborough disaster. There is a substantial storeroom full o f investigation
               files, statements, photographs, videotapes and computer records. They have
               given me and my team unrestricted access to their archive for work on this
               scrutiny".
                                                                                (Chapter 5 p89(27))

      Further Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered the editing o f statements by Messrs Hammond
      Suddards, the fact that the statements had been, edited was known by counsel to the Taylor
      Inquiry (Andrew Collins QC) and the Treasury Solicitor (Mr Whitehurst). Having
      considered the editing exercise Lord Justice Stuart-smith concluded that "for the most part
      the suggestions for amendments by the solicitors are not open to criticism". (Chapter 4
      p93(101)) and "I am quite satisfied that the exclusion o f these comments could not possiblv
      have affected the Director". (Chapter 4 p84(l05))

      It is wrong to allege that "the statements and documents sent to the DPP in 1990 were the
      result o f a calculated selection, from which many statements o f central importance were
      excluded and which, included edited statements o f police officers". (HFSG submission
      24/9/98 para 11(d))

      The conclusion o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith was to the opposite effect, furthermore he
      investigated allegations o f improper interference with witnesses made by the HFSG
      (Chapter 4 p63) and concluded that the allegations were "not substantiated''. (p84)

      It is also wrong to allege that any evidence exists disclosing "prima facie such a thorough
      manipulation o f the evidence to the past benefit o f the defendants and South Yorkshire
        oJice . Lord Justice Stuart-Smith again arrived at the opposite conclusion,.

      Much, o f the submission made by the HFSG involves an. attack on the Stuart-Smith
      Scrutiny and the conclusions it reached. It is alleged to be "economical with information",
      it is suggested that "caution has to be employed in accepting facts set out in the report" and
     24f9/98en p r r fu T nSHa M ^          statements are seriously wrong” (HFSG submission
                          ^       }'  S XeCt0r WiU be able t0 form 811 ^dependent view about
     the criticism o f the Scrutiny. What JS clearly exercising the minds o f the HFSG is that if

                                                    3
CPS 4th Floor                                               09/03 '99 12:52 NO.628          05/12




        the conclusions o f the Scrutiny survive then no new material exists to justify the current
        charges.

       We do not intend to correct each and every factual, inaccuracy in, the submission of the
       HFSG as it is known that that task is being undertaken by those representing Mr Murray,
       We would like to draw the attention o f the Director to one false statement relied upon by
       the HFSG, namely that Mr Duckenfield met Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, notwithstanding that
       the latter did not see fit to refer to it. This allegation is untrue as the two men have never
       met. It follows that the criticism o f the Scrutiny for not recording the details o f the
       meeting are unfounded. It is also an example of the willingness on the part o f the HFSG
       to rely upon conjecture as if it were uncontroverted fact.

       Analysis o f new evidence

       The HFSG concedes that the findings o f the Taylor Inquiry fall short o f those needed to
       establish a "prima facie" case.

                "The Taylor findings themselves amount almost to a prima facie case".
                                                          (HFSG submission 24/9/98 para 12)

       The further evidence relied upon to support the prosecution, is analysed in paragraph 17 and
       all was before the Taylor Inquiry including the action o f the police in 1988 (Taylor
       Chapter 11 para 230), What is o f critical importance is that there is no evidence
       whatsoever that Mr Duckenfield was ever told about the police action the previous year,
       or should have been aware o f it.

       Reliance is placed upon the editing o f statements for which it is asserted "there can be no
       honest reason" (HFSG letter 24/8/98). This allegation is wholly inconsistent with the
       conclusions o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and cannot survive even a simple exercise of
       analysis.

       The editing complained about to the statement o f PC Woodcock excludes material that is
       clearly hearsay and relates to a conversation he had with Inspector White at the debrief.
       Inspector White makes no mention o f being given, the instruction spoken about and no
       other officer at the debrief apparently heard this conversation. In any event, Woodcock’s
       reference is not to the diversion o f fans moving from the concourse to the tunnel, but to
       the general dispersal o f fans on the terrace from one pen to another. We note that not one
       o f the deletions identified relates to any admissible evidence probative o f guilt against
       either defendant but consist mainly o f the type o f deletions described by Lord Justice
       Stuart-Smith as "quite trivial, and o f no consequence whatsoever" (p82 para 99) and were
       of a type which he concluded "were properly excluded".

       By reference to HFSG submissions (their letter 24 August 1998, submissions of counsel
       24 September 1998) it is self-evident that the question o f the 1988 events are central to the
       submissions made by HFSG as they say that these events "prove foreseeability, which is
       of course critical to civil, and criminal allegations o f negligence. They are o f the most
       obvious relevance to the manslaughter issue in the prosecution".


                                                     4
CPS 4th Floor                                                 09/03 '99 12:53 NO.628            06/12




     It is suggested by HFSG that the evidence o f police officers concerning 1988 indicates that
     senior officers monitored the pens, a diversion from the central pens took place in 1988 and
     mat there was a failure to take this "known and obvious precaution" in 1989 resulting in the
     96 deaths. The HFSG suggest that "the South Yorkshire Police claim that the diversion o f
     the oncoming supporters from the central pens in 1988 was unknown to senior officers".
     They fai l to refer to the findings of Lord Justice TayJor and the Coroner (see HFSG annexure
     H - Summary of variances between findings o f Lord Justice Taylor and summing up of
     coroner Dr Popper - page 5) that the South Yorkshire Police "claim" was correct.

     The evidence which HFSG says is so important to the present reconsideration adds nothing
     o the foreseeability case against the defendant. When viewed against the findings o f both
    Lord Justice Taylor and the inquest the evidence referred to by HFSG (the new "unrevised
    evidence") cannot assist in any way in establishing that any failure to divert fans from the
    central pens simply involved a "known and obvious precaution". In the circumstances we are
    bound to submit therefore that much o f the submissions made by HFSG, in relation to the
    events of 1988, adds no strength to the case against the defendants and if HFSG believe that
    this issue is at the "heart o f the case", we say that it must patently fail even on the
    prosecution’s own assessment.

    Evidential Matters

    In your policy letter you advise that the Code for Crown Prosecutors (Code), which contains
    the principles applicable to CPS review o f criminal proceedings instigated by the Police,
    provides the basis for the policy applicable to private prosecutions and as to whether the
    Director will intervene.

    More specifically, you advise that in regard to the evidential requirement o f the Code a less
    stringent standard is to be applied to private prosecutions, to the effect that the case will be
    taken over and discontinued where there is clearly no case to answer.

    By comparison, when applying the Code to criminal proceedings generally, the evidential test
    of "a realistic prospect o f conviction" is a clearly more onerous standard. The implication is
    therefore that in the terms o f the evidential requirements o f a. private prosecution, the Director
    may allow those proceedings to continue in circumstances where the evidence would not reach
    the Code’s standard for a. realistic prospect o f conviction,

    We note from the policy letter that "it has been considered that to apply the Code test to
    private prosecutions would unfairly limit the right o f individuals to bring their own cases".
    We take issue with this statement o f policy, and its applicability in the present circumstances.

   We accept o f course that the Director is bound to consider, as part o f the review, whether the
   evidence is sufficient when considering intervention pursuant to the Prosecution o f Offences
   Act. We are also aware that in the past the Director has adopted a less stringent test than the
   CPS apply when, considering whether to intervene under Section 6. Having considered the
   observations made by the RoyaJ. Commission on Criminal Procedure ("Phillips Commission")
   (CMND 8092) (1981) Para 8:8 and 8:9, and the Law Commission, Criminal Law: Consent
   to Prosecution C.P. 149 (Para <5:5-6-17) we are uncertain as to the justification for the policy
   as applied in the past and request clarification accordingly.

CPS 4th Floor




        Criminal Law: Consent to Prosecution C.P. 149 (Para 6:5-6-17) we are uncertain as to the
        justification for the policy as applied in the past and request clarification accordingly.

                "The test applied to the Director’s cases (ie, whether or not there is a
                reasonable prospect o f conviction) should be extended to all cases and
                applied, by all who make the decisions that bring a case to Court".
                                                                  (Phillips Commission para 8.9)

        In any event applying either test to the relevant material, such, as that referred to on page
        3 of the policy letter, together with any further material provided by the HFSG, and
        additional material made available by die Home Office and any other source, will lead,
        inescapably to the conclusion that has been previously reached by the Director, to the effect
        that there is insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect o f conviction. If that be the case,
        pursuant to the Code, the Director will be bound to take over the conduct o f proceedings
        and discontinue "no matter how important or serious" the case may be.

        On the basis that the Director proceeds as indicated.'in the policy letter and therefore
        applies a lesser standard, we ask the Director to consider the two specific questions posed
        in the Code as follows:-

        1.      Can the evidence be used inCourt?

        2.      Is the evidence reliable?

        We invite the Director to consider those questions in the specific context o f the 4 charges
        against our client as follows: -

        1,      Unlawful Killing

                In. the broadest sense it is right to say that the question o f unlawful killing, in the
                context o f involuntary manslaughter, requires proof o f the following:-

               -   duty o f care
               -   breach o f duty o f care
               -   breach causing injury or damage
               -   breach o f sufficient gravity, that is grossly negligent, to amount to a criminal
        offence.

                At the time o f making these submissions, we have been served with 3 folders of
                copy statements and transcripts o f evidence served in support o f the prosecution.


                A bundle o f 35 statements, largely comprising the recollections o f spectators at the
                game on 15th April 1989 relate in general to the build up o f the crowd outside the
                ground, access to the ground, and the crush at the Leppings Lane end terrace. 3
                Statements included by Police Officers do not involve the direct operational
                management within the control box on the day.

CPS 4th Floor                                              09/03 '99 12:53 NO.628            08/12




 '         We are bound to emphasise that no evidence has been served by the prosecution of
           any person other than the Defendants, that will assist a criminal court in considering
           the issue o f the particular duty o f care to be alleged against the Defendants, and as to
           whether their conduct amounted to a breach thereof. To be specific, there is no other
           evidence, apart from the transcript material, relating to the circumstances and activities
           within the control box on 15th April and Mr DuckenfjeJd’s role on that day. HFSG
           correspondence has pointed to Lord Justice Taylor’s conclusions in regard to the
           involvement and actions o f certain individuals on that day. His conclusions were
           based upon a mountain o f evidence which it would seem is not to be put before the
           Court in the context o f the present prosecution. The bearings by their very nature will
           be completely different and the evidence that can be adduced in support o f a private
           prosecution for manslaughter will be considerably narrower than, that beard by Lord
           Justice Taylor.

          The HFSG, m their most recent submissions dated 2 October 1998, comment on the
          "Evidence against Duckenfleld on Manslaughter and Misfeasance" purely by reference
          to the 1989 Taylor transcript material, which o f course the Director will have
          considered previously in the context o f the consideration o f which charges, if any,
          should have been brought.

          On the available evidence submitted in support o f the prosecution, we therefore urge
          the Director to consider that there is a clear paucity o f evidence relating to vital issues
          that would need to be proved. As L.J. Stuart-Smjtb pointed out in his Scrutiny report
          at para. 56:-

                  "Any prosecution o f an individual police officer would have to
                  establish bis individual responsibility. It would not be enough to prove
                  the composite failure o f the police operation."

          Notwithstanding the comments made by HFSG (eg see para 15 Submissions 24.9.98)
          any admissions o f liability by South Yorkshire police in negligence proceedings can
          only relate to those proceedings and South Yorkshire police. They can have no force
          in relation to the specific actions o f individual officers and charges brought in separate
          criminal proceedings.

          In terms o f reliability we must take issue with the observation o f the HFSG (their
          letter 27th July 1998) that all the facts are clear and that no-one will have forgotten.
          The events in question were obviously traumatic for all concerned, and the passage of
          9 years since those events is a considerable period o f time. By definition, the
          recollection of any relevant witnesses must be expected to have lessened either because
          o f the passage o f time, or indeed the natural mechanism o f avoidance o f the memory
          of the horrific events that occurred. In those circumstances, we suggest the Director
          treat with great caution the reliability o f the evidence that i$ or may be served in
          support o f the prosecutions.

          No evidence exists o f the current ability of witnesses to recall the events and those that
          were beard by Lord. Justice Stuart-Smith were described by him variously as "vague
          and confused" (per Miss Martin), "version changes in various ways over the years"

                                                  7
CPS 4th Floor                                               09/03 '99 12:54 NO.628           09/12




           (per Paul Taylor) and unable to accept Mr Holdsworth’s recollection o f events as now
           being accurate". There is no reason to suspect that the memory o f other witnesses is
           any more reliable than those seen by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,

     2.    Misfeasance in Public Office.

           As indicated by the submissions as to issue o f summonses, from the HFSG, the same
           facts are to be put forward in. support o f the allegations for this offence as for
           unlawful killing. The prosecution, have referred to the case o f R -v- D ytham (19791
           69 Cr.App.R. 382 as indicating the relevant standard. Our only observation in regard
           to this case in the present context is that it clearly indicates that for culpability to be
           established concerning the misconduct o f an officer o f justice, mere misfeasance will
           not suffice, but a deliberate failure and wilful neglect will be required. We raise again
           the issues as to what reliable evidence the prosecution intends to adduce to satisfy this
           onerous test as indicated by the reliance o f HFSG (submissions 2/10/98) on alleged
           admissions made by the Defendant in 1989 transcripts which the Director will have
          considered previously. From the material we have been served with so far, we believe
          the evidential test is not satisfied either on the basis o f "a realistic prospect of
          conviction" or in the alternative that there would be "clearly no case to answer",
          justifying the Director’s intervention and discontinuance.

    3.    Acting with Intent to Pervert the Course o f Justice

          According to the HSFG submissions as to issue o f Summonses, this relates to the
          alleged false and deceitful allegation by Mr Duckenficld that the gates had been
          broken by the supporters. It has never been suggested that the words complained of
          were ever uttered by Mr Duckenfield to anyone charged with investigating the disaster.

          In terms o f the evidence so far served, we point out once again that there is no
          evidence apart from the transcript o f the Defendants’ own evidence, regarding any
          such discussion. The HFSG (submissions 2/10/98) have referred to the Taylor
          evidence o f the Defendant which the Director is aware of. We note that further
          evidence will be called but emphasise the prosecution have not served statements from
          other witnesses in relation to this charge.

          The thrust o f the recent (2/10/98) submissions appears to concern the "transmission"
          o f the all eged comment o f the Defendant to parties who were not present at the time
          the alleged words were spoken. We are bound to point out that no evidence has been
          served to support the conten tions made to the effect that the Defendant played any role
          in the "transmissions" referred to, or in the alleged "limitation" activity (paras 5-22).
          The HFSG’s critical reference to the Sharpies statements when subject to realistic
          appraisal can. not be justified. In the context o f this charge, we submit the true import
          o f his recollection is that between. 3 and 5 pm on the day o f the event, the question
          o f "how" and "why" was not at the forefront o f the minds o f those in the control
          room, who were "all deeply shaken" officers endeavouring to carry out their duties.

          We think the argument is overwhelming that proper analysis o f this charge cannot
          satisfy either o f the evidential tests that might be applied in this case and accordingly,

                                                  8

           the DPP ought to intervene and discontinue without need to refer to public interest
           issues.

     4.    Public Interest

           We have noted the exchanges in correspondence between your office and the HFSG
           and for the purpose o f your review would like to point out by reference to the
           individual components set out in 6.4 and 6.5 o f the Code our views as to the relevance
           or otherwise o f the public interest factors set out therein. We are o f course mindful
           o f the fact that this exercise is "not simply a matter o f adding up the number o f factors
           on each side".

     6.4

     (a)   Conviction is likely to result in a significant sentence.

           Cases o f manslaughter vary enormously and in many cases a non-custodial sentence
           will be passed- We believe in all the circumstances o f this case, the prospect o f a
           sentence o f immediate imprisonment is remote. Hie Director will be aware that
           prosecutions for involuntary manslaughter, such as in the House o f Lords’ leading case
           o f R -v- Adomako, notwithstanding a conviction, the Court imposed a suspended
           custodial sentence, as did the Court in the associated Court o f Appeal decision R v
           Prentice & Sullman.

     (b)   A weapon was used or violence was threatened.

           This is clearly not applicable here.

     (c)   The offence was committed against a person serving thepublic.

           Once again this is not applicable. It is relevant that the alleged offences occurred
           whilst the Defendants were engaged in the conduct of their public duties,

     (d)   The Defendant was in a position o f authority or trust.

           This strictly speaking is true, but the import o f this factor is, we submit, that authority
           or trust has been abused. There is no evidence that we have seen that suggests that
           the Defendant in any way consciously acted so as to abuse the authority or trust placed
           in him, and rather to the contrary, acted to the best o f his ability to discharge his
           public duty, in. the most difficult of circumstances,

     (e)   Ihg, evidence shows that Defendants was a ringleader or an organiser o f the offence.
           This clearly cannot apply.

     (f)   There is evidence the offence was premeditated.

           The allegations in this case relate to the actions taken by Hie Defendant, in a. life or
           death context, without lengthy time for consideration. Judgment was exercised and

                                                    9
                                                           09/03 '99 12:55 NO.628           11/12
CPS 4th Floor




             decisions were taken. There can be no element of pre-meditation in the normal sense
             relevant to a guilty mind.

     (g)     There is evidence that the offence was carried out bv a group.

             Whilst the Defendants were working together as part of an overall police operation,
             we have not seen any evidence to suggest a conspiracy or joint enterprise to carry out
             a criminal activity.

     (h)     The v ic tim o f the offence was vulnerable, had been put in considerable fear, or had
              suffered personal attack, damage or disturbance.

             There can be no doubt that the loss and suffering o f the deceased and others involved
             in the Hillsborough disaster is a terrible tragedy. We would not wish to diminish that
             in any sense but emphasise that there is no evidence that the Defendant intended to
             place the victims in this situation. Rather quite the contrary all the actions that were
             taken by the Defendant were taken with a view to minimising personal injury and
             suffering.

     (i)     The offence was motivated bv any form of discrimination against the victims ethnic
             or national origin, sex, religious beliefs, political views or sexual preference.

             This cannot apply.

     0)      There is a marked difference between the actual or mental ages o f the Defendants and
             the victim or if there is anv element o f corruption.

             Whilst strictly speaking true, we cannot see that this can have any relevance in the
             present circumstances.

     (k)     The Defendants previous convictions/cautions are relevant to the present offence.

             Once again, not applicable.

     (0      The_Defendant is alleged to have committed the offence whilst tinder an order o f the
             Court.

             Not applicable.

     (1Tt)   There are grounds for believing that the offence is likely to be continued or repeated,
             for example, by a history o f recurring conduct.

             The allegations o f criminal offences arising out o f Hillsborough are o f course in the
             most unusual o f circumstances. The Defendant has long since retired, from,
             employment as a Police Officer, and there is n.o real possibility o f a recurrence. The
             circumstances, as all the subsequent inquiries have revealed, were unique.

#
w        (r>)   The offence, although not serious in itself was widespread in the area, where jt_was
                committed.

                The alleged offences o f unlawful killing, in particular, are serious, but occurred in. a
                limited context in unique circumstances,. This factor is therefore not applicable.

                It will be seen by reference to the foregoing comment, that the only factor tending to
                support a prosecution pursuant to 6.4 o f the Code is the seriousness o f the charges.
                It is in that light that we believe the previous enquiries, reviews and the like that have
                been conducted into the events o f Hillsborough are particularly relevant. Previous
                correspondence with you from ourselves and the Solicitors for Mr Murray highlighted
                the outcome of those reviews and the consistent conclusion, notwithstanding the real
                concerns as to the events o f 15th April 1989, that no good will be served by pursuing
                criminal proceedings at this time. We emphasise that point in. the present context.

                Further we offer the following observations with regard to the common, public interest
                factors that may tend against a prosecution, set out in the Code.

         6.5

         (a)    The Court is likely to impose a very small or nominal penalty.

                We reiterate the comments made above in regard to 6.4(a). We think the likelihood
                is, even in. the event o f a conviction for unlawful killing that the appropriate sentence
                in this case would, effectively, be non-custodial.

         (b)    The offence was committed as a result o f a general mistake or misunderstanding (these
                factors must be balanced against the seriousness o f the offence').

                Once again we emphasise that the allegations in this case concern decisions made
                under the pressure o f the moment in the course o f employment, at times when serious
                injury and death was threatened. To prove gross negligence manslaughter, the
                prosecution has an onerous burden to prove to a high standard that any negligence
                ought to be considered criminally culpable. The relevant authorities (see R v
                Adomalco (H/Lords), R v Holloway & Others (Court o f Appeal) make it clear that
                mitigating circumstances are particularly relevant in. this context. Furthermore the
                contribution to the disaster o f the unexpected late arrival o f so many fans, the refusal
                by them to heed requests to queue for entrance in an orderly manner and the physical
                construction o f pens on the terraces without sufficient gates to permit escape in the
                event o f an emergency all contributed in some way to the disaster.

         (c)    The, loss or harm, can be described as minor and was a result o f a single incident
                particularly _if it was caused bv misiudgment.

                Once again we would not wish to diminish the suffering caused by the victims, or
                others involved in the Hillsborough tragedy. We would point out, however, that the
                case against the Defendant is in essence one o f gross misjudgment on a singular
                occasion.

      (d)      ThereJjas been a Ions delay between the events taking nlace and the Hate o f trial

               The offences are serious.

               The offence has only recently come to light
              .The complexity.,of the offence has meant that there has been a long investigation.

              It is clearly o f great concern that a private prosecution is being commenced more than
              J years after 15th April 1989. The material we have been served with in support of
              the prosecution in relation to the transcripts has been available since 1991 at tire latest.
              The 38 statements served by HFSG in our submission, firstly, do not raise any
              substantial new matters that could not have been dealt with by evidence available
              many years before and secondly, do not go to the heart o f the cases, in respect of
              unlawful killing, neglect o f public duty, and perverting the course o f justice as raised
              before in the context o f evidential issues.

             Once again the seriousness o f the offence is relevant, but on balance we submit this
             factor should not outweigh the significance o f the very considerable delay.

             As we have noted the HSFG are of the view that the recollections o f witnesses will
             be accurate notwithstanding the passage o f time. It is interesting to note that in the
             context o f the Judicial Review o f the inquest (which o f course was a hearing on oath
             before a Jury considering issues o f unlawful killing) the Divisional Court, commenting
             on whether an exercise o f discretion to order a fresh inquest was appropriate,
             observed:

                     ''I have to take an objective view and I have to consider the
                    interests o f all concerned, including those o f all the witnesses
                    who would have to come along 5 years later and try to cast
                    their minds back to events that they must have been try ing to
                    forget. Taking that objective view and considering the interests
                    o f all concerned, I would in my discretion conclude that this
                    was not a case in which it would be right to order a. fresh
                    inquest."

Dear Madam

OUR CLIENT : MR BERNARD MURRAY

We refer to our letter o f 2 July 1998, which for ease is copied herewith.

We attach to this letter a copy of the summons dated 26 June 1998, issued against our
Client Bernard Dean Murray. It alleges three offences all of which are said to arise
from events at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield on 15 April 1989.

We are aware o f a letter of 1 July 1998 delivered by hand to you by Winckworth and
Pemberton Solicitors acting on behalf o f David Duckenfield. As indicated in our
letter o f 2 July, Mr Owston o f Winckworth and Pemberton has been good enough to
provide us with a copy o f his letter to you. We too have sent by fax, a letter to the
Clerk o f the South Sefiton Magistrates’ Court. We attach a copy o f that letter.

In our submission, the matters that we have set out in our letter to the Clerk to the
Justices at South Sefton provide a clear statement o f law and we believe that the
summonses should be quashed.

We also believe that even if the present summonses are quashed, the Solicitor acting
on behalf o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group will simply seek to issue
proceedings in the appropriate petty sessional division in Sheffield. The purpose of
this letter is therefore to ask you to invoke the provisions o f Section 6 o f the
Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. You will be fully familiar with your ability under
Section 6 (2) o f that Act to take over conduct o f proceedings instituted by a private
prosecutor which you may have instituted yourself. Our request to you is then to
consider the issues in this case so that you can properly arrive at a decision under
Section 23 (3) o f the same Act that the proceedings should be discontinued. The
discontinuation under Section 23 may be because the evidence is insufficient or if the
proceedings would be contrary to the public interest. As you will undoubtedly be
aware, the report or the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure (1981) (Command
8092) Page 161 Para 7.50 says “it provides a useful and effective safeguard against
“improper action” by the prosecuting authority.

                                                                      3 July 1998
                                                                           Page 2



May we respectfully draw your attention to the following facts:

1.      Following the tragedy on 17 April 1989 by 15 May 1989 Lord Taylor had
        begun his public enquiry. 174 witnesses gave evidence. There were 72
        hours o f video film and much other material in written form. The interim
        report o f Lord Taylor was published on 4 August 1989.

2.      West Midlands Police investigated as an independent investigating force.
        They took 3,776 statements from witnesses.

3.      The Director o f Public Prosecutions considered all o f the evidence that had
        then been gathered. Advice was taken from two very experienced Queen’s
        Counsel who advised that there was not sufficient evidence to justify criminal
        proceedings against any person.

4.      On 19 November 1990 the adjourned Coroner’s Inquest resumed and at the
        Inquest some 200 witnesses gave evidence and the Inquest also received
        documents, the Jury saw videos and inspected the ground including the
        control room.

5.      In 1992 the Attorney General was invited to order new Inquests on the basis
         o f new evidence. The Attorney General refused.

6.      In April 1993 application was made by families for Judicial Review to quash
         the Inquest verdict and seek a fresh Inquest which application the Divisional
         Court dismissed.

7.      Civil claims were made and the litigation concluded. These included claims
        by Police Officers as well as by families.

8.      Lord Justice Stuart Smith was appointed to scrutinise the evidence including
        to consider “new evidence”.

We invite attention to the summary to the scrutiny o f evidence by Lord Justice Stuart
Smith and in particular the following paragraphs.

Paragraph 4.     Cannot allow compassion to cloud judgement.

Paragraph 5.     I do not consider that there is any material which should be put
                 before the Director o f Public Prosecutions which may cause her to
                 reconsider the decision already taken.

Paragraph 6.     None o f the evidence that I was asked to consider added anything
                 significant to the evidence before Taylor or the Inquest.
                                                              Dame Barbara Mills QC
                                                                        3 July 1998
                                                                             Page 3


Paragraph 7.      There is no new video evidence.

Paragraph 8.      The suggestion that the Police failed to spot overcrowding was due
                  to faulty CCTV is wrong.

Paragraph 9.      The Police did not give false evidence about CCTV. The evidence
                  o f Holdsworth is not accepted.

Paragraph 11.    Not considered that the inquest was flawed.

Paragraph 12.    No improper attempt to interfere with witnesses.

Paragraph 16.     Miss Martin “vague and confused”.

Paragraph 18.     Paul Taylor changed versions in various ways over the years.

Paragraph 22.    No South Yorkshire Police statement rendered misleading. Taylor
                 not inhibited or impeded.

Paragraph 24.    Exclusion o f comments in witness statements, did not affect the
                 outcome o f the inquest or the decision o f the DPP.

Paragraph 25.    No further enquiry involving the examination o f witnesses could
                 help after this lapse o f time.

Paragraph 32.    Neither of the new points about the height o f the crush barriers and
                 capacity o f Leppings Lane Terrace would give grounds for re­
                 opening o f Judicial Enquiry or any other proceedings.

At Page 9 Paragraph 52 o f the scrutiny o f Lord Justice Stuart Smith, he confirmed
that he had read the joint opinion o f Leading Counsel dated 6 August 1990 which
gave the advice to the Director of Public Prosecution on possible criminal proceedings
against Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield. At Paragraph 53 Lord Justice Stuart Smith
said that he had not found any error or omission in the resume set out by Counsel nor
in his view was any particular aspect understated or exaggerated. The Lord Justice
also considered the statement of law as contained in the opinions o f Queen’s Counsel
and said they were plainly correct.

In our respectful submission having regard to all o f these actions and particularly the
scrutiny o f evidence by Lord Justice Stuart Smith and his conclusion that “I do not
consider that there is any material which should be put before the Director o f Public
Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider
the decisions that they have already taken”, we would submit that under Section 23
o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 you must conclude that the evidence is
insufficient.
                                                             Dame Barbara Mills QC
                                                                       3 July 1998
                                                                            Page 4


As to the limb which allows you to discontinue if the proceedings would be contrary
to public interest or for any other good reason, may we refer you to the possible
single most important cause for Lord Justice Stuart Smith to be asked to scrutinise the
evidence. This relates to the program on Granada Television “Hillsborough”,
broadcast on 5 December 1996, which incidentally was repeated without any
amendment. It was described as “highly emotive”. Lord Justice Stuart Smith said
that it was “not accurate as to the suppression o f Police video tapes”. “It was not
always easy for the viewer to tell what is reconstruction and what is original” and
finally that the program “also relies on Mr Holdsworth’s assertions.... I do not accept
this evidence”. This was only one o f a number o f television programs. There has
been a huge amount o f other media interest.

In addition to the finding by Lord Justice Stuart Smith at Page 37 Paragraph 99 that
he was “unable to accept Mr Holdsworth’s recollection o f events as now being
accurate”, Lord Justice Stuart Smith also comments on two witnesses who he saw,
namely Miss Martin who he described as “vague and confused” and Paul Taylor
whose “ version changed in various ways over the years”. It is inconceivable that
witnesses nine years after the unhappy event could now be relied upon as to their
memory. This has been made particularly difficult having regard to the highly
charged and emotional state o f so many people and the media involvement with the
points above being some o f the worrying factors.

The Taylor report made a large number o f recommendations, the vast majority of
which have been implemented so as to both address the causes o f the disaster itself
and prevent repetition and for the safety o f the public at large in attending sporting
occasions.

Our Client, Bernard Murray, behaved with great fortitude during the whole o f the
enquiries until a time came when his body could take no more pressure. He was a
career Police Officer who intended not to retire until at least he had 30 years Police
service. The consequence was a complete breakdown in his health such that he was
obliged to retire from the Police Force on medical grounds some two and a half years
before his earliest intended date of retirement. He has not worked since his retirement
from the Police Force.

In assessing whether the continuation o f these proceedings would be contrary to the
public interest we would also respectfully refer to two final points.

a.       Paragraph 5 Chapter 7 of the Lord Justice Stuart Smith scrutiny at page 103.
         Here he says that he has come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis
         upon which there should be:

         1.       A further Judicial Enquiry;

         2.       A reopening o f Lord Taylor’s enquiry;
                                                  Dame Barbara Mills QC
                                                            3 July 1998
                                                                 Page 5


3.     A renewed application to the Divisional Court;

4.     The exercise by the Attorney General o f his powers under the
       Coroner’s Act;

5.     Any material to put before the Director of Public Prosecutions which
       might cause her to reconsider the decisions she has already taken;

6.     Any material that should be put before the Police Complaints
       Authority which might cause them to reconsider the decision that
       they have already taken.

When the Home Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, addressed the House o f Commons
on 18 February 1998 he made the following comments.

        1.      I, the Attorney General and the Director o f Public
                Prosecutions have considered Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s
                report very carefully. We have no reason to doubt his
                conclusions.

        2.      The entire country is united in sympathy with those who
                lost loved ones at Hillsborough. We cannot take the pain
                from them but I hope that the families will recognise that
                the report represents, as I promised, an independent
                thorough and detailed scrutiny o f all the evidence that was
                given to the committee.

In his statement to the House o f Commons on 8 May 1998, the Home
Secretary made the following remarks.

        1.     Lord Taylor’s enquiry and report were as thorough and
               impartial as one would expect o f the work o f such a great
               judicial figure.

        2.     The Granada documentary “Hillsborough” presented a
               powerful picture o f the tragedy. It suggested that fresh
               evidence that had not previously been considered called
               into question the verdict so the inquest and other decisions.

        3.     Lord Justice Stuart Smith, a senior Lord Justice o f the
               Court o f Appeal was eminently qualified to conduct and
                independent and thorough scrutiny of the evidence. I gave
                him very wide terms o f reference that enabled his to
                establish conclusively whether any material evidence had
               been overlooked and to recommend appropriate action.
                                                             Dame Barbara Mills QC
                                                                       3 July 1998
                                                                            Page 6


                   4.    Anyone who has read the report thoroughly will, I believe,
                         be bound to reach the same conclusion as he did that
                         reopening the enquiries would serve no useful purpose
                         whatsoever.

                   5.    The causes of the disaster were clearly identified by Lord
                         Taylor in his 1989 report. It was right to consider as I
                         have done whether there was any subsequent information
                         that cast doubt on earlier decisions. It was for that reason
                         that I established Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s thorough
                         scrutiny and I am satisfied that he has, after that rigorous
                         examination reached the correct conclusions.

                   6.    I do not believe that a further enquiry could or would
                          uncover significant new evidence or provide any relief for
                         the distress of those who have been bereaved. Although I
                         know that it is difficult for the families to accept that, such
                          a conclusion must be in their best interests. To hold out
                         the possibility o f a further enquiry, only and inevitably to
                         have that hope dashed when the enquiry reported would
                          lead simply to further anxiety and a deepening of the
                         wounds of grief. That would be no kindness to the families
                          or to their communities o f Merseyside and elsewhere.

We would ask you to agree to take over the conduct o f these proceedings under
Section 6 (2)of the Prosecution of Offenders Act 1985 and then to discontinue these
proceedings under Section 23 (3) o f that same act.

Yours faithfully

R -V- DPP EX PARTE DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for the draft Skeleton, which I have faxed to Chris Newell and Stephen Wooler for
their comments. I only have two points to make as follows;

(i)        3(1): there is no mechanism in the Magistrates’ Court for challenging the issue o f a
           Summons other than by summary trial/committal proceedings. Judicial review is not
           available because the prosecutor is not a public authority.

(ii)       Paragraph 4: should we make it clear that in developing the policy the Law
           Commission’s report was irrelevant (indeed I do not think it even existed at the time). It
           was not mentioned in the decision letter because the DPP necessarily agrees with
           everything in the Law Commission’s report, but simply to draw attention to the
           fundamental principle.

I hope this is helpful.

                      SKELETON ARGUMENT OF THE DPP



       1    The Applicants seek leave to apply for Judicial Review of the decision of the DPP
                                                V.'




            and/or CPS not to take over the conduct of criminal proceedings commenced against

            them by Ann Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group in July

            1998 with a view to discontinuing those proceedings. The application for leave is

            opposed on the grounds summarised in this Skeleton Argument.



       2.   The proper apprqagfr

            For the purposes o f this leave application it is accepted that the Court haft jurisdiction




zoo®                                     Hooasvas xaaaoa               OSSl l e t T ilo XVd i s : i l 88. C0/80
       judicially to review a decision of the DPP not to take over a private prosecution. The

       Divisional Court has already held that it should exercise the power to review a decision

       of flic DPP not to prosecute sparingly (see, for example, R v DPP, Ex parte C (7/22)).

       It is submitted that the power of review should be exercised even more sparingly

       where, a$ here:

       (a)    criminal proceedings have already begun: the civil courts should, in principle,

               be very slow to interfere with the criminal process;

       (b)    the decision sought to be challenged is USB the decision of the DPP n ot to

              prosecute but the decision not to take over a private prosecution (which has

              been lawftilly commenced) with a view to terminating it;

       (c)    taking over a private prosecution with a view to terminating it would involve

              interfering with the well-recognised fundamental right of every citizen to bring

              a private prosecution and with criminal proceedings which have been lawfully

              commenced;

       (d)    the Applicants have alternative remedies available to them (see below);

       (e)    the consequences of granting leave (i.e. interfering with the criminal process)

              will be seriously to delay the criminal proceedings.

                                         v:



       The alternative remedies available to the Applicants arc as follows:

       (1)    challenge the issue o f the Summons (this has not been done since it has,

              presumably, been accepted that the proceedings have been lawfully

              commenced);

       (2)    resist committal upon the grounds that the evidence to support the charges is

                      insufficient (if that be the ease) and/or that flic proceedings are an abuse o f

                      process.

                      It is to be noted that committal proceedings have already been fixed for 19 April

                      1999.

              (3)    make similar submissions to the Crown Court if committed.

             It cannot be said that these alternative remedies are inadequate; on the contrary, they

             provide the same protection as is provided to any accused person.



       4-    Thg Giounds relied ttDon-bv the First Applicant (Duckenfieid^

             Three grounds are relied upon. It is submitted that none is arguable.



             The decision was based on an unlawfulpolicy.

             This ground is misconceived. The Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 (the Act) does not

             stipulate what should be the DPP’s policy as to taking over private prosecutions with

            a view to discontinuing them. Indeed, the Act does noi stipulate what should be his

            policy as to the taking over of police prosecutions already instituted (as he is obliged

            to do by Section 3(2)(a)) or as to the institution of proceedings himself.          On the

            contrary, die formulation and content of such a policy has been expressly left by

            Parliament to the DPP. He has formulated a policy in relation to the taking over of

            private prosecutions with a view to terminating them in the terms set out in Mr

            Newell's letter of 1 February 1999 (4/4). That policy is neither unlawful under the

            provisions of the Act nor is it inconsistent with them. It is different from his policy in

            relation to the talcing over o f all police prosecutions and the institution of proceedings

,*


                     him self but that feet cannot make die policy unlawful. Nor can the feet that (if it be

                     correct which is not accepted) the policy differs in any respect from the views

              i-     expressed by cither the P h^ p s Report or the Consultation Paper and Report o f the Law

                     Commission, make his policy unlawful.



               5.    The second ground

                     The DPP has failed to act in accordance with his published Code.

                     This ground is also misconceived. The Director’s published Code (5/14) sets out the

                    DPP’s policy with regard to taking over police prosecutions (as the Director’is obliged

                    to do under the Act). It does not set out the Director’s policy with regard to the fairing

                    over of private prosecutions with a view to terminating them. That policy is set out in

                    Mr Newell's letter o f 1 February 1999 (4/4) and is a different policy (as is

                    acknowledged by the Applicant). The Director’s duty is to act in accordance withjftljtf

                    policy. He has done so.



              6.    The Applicant also contends that Section 10 of the Act obliges die Director to issue a

                    Code which gives guidance on general principles to be applied not only in relation to

                    the institution o f proceedings by the Director and his review of proceedings already

                    instituted by the police but also with regard to the discontinuance o f private

                    prosecutions. Such a construction o f Section 10 is erroneous. Properly construed,

                    together with Sections 3 and 6, Section 10 (only) obliges the Director to issue a Code

                    giving guidance on general principles to be applied in relation to proceedings instituted
        K
                    by him and proceedings i^stfed by the police which, under the Act, he is obliged to take

       over. But even if the construction contended for by the Applicant were sound, it is

       nothing to the point: the consequence would be that the Director has failed to comply

       with his obligation under Section 10 to issue a Code giving guidance in relation to the

       taking over of private prosecutions with a view to terminating them; the consequence

       could not be that the Director had failed to act in accordance with his policy.



       The third ground

       The decision is perverse.

      It is submitted that this contention is bound to fail. True it is that the Director has

      concluded on previous occasions that, applying the principles which apply to the

      institution o f proceedings by the police or by him (as set out in his Code), the Applicant

      should not be prosecuted. However, as acknowledged by the Applicant, the Director

      does not apply the same policy to the question whether he should take over a private

      prosecution with a view to terminating it. Nor is a private prosecutor obliged to apply

      the Code before instituting a private prosecution nor is the Magistrates’ Court obliged

      to follow it when deciding whether to issue a Summons. This reflects the importance

      o f the right of every citizen to bring a private prosecution (explained by the Law

      Commission as follows: " ... For some members of our society - those, for example,

      tvho have doubts about the impartiality of the prosecuting authorities, or who believe

      that an official prosecutor has misjudged the evidence in a case - the right of private

      prosecution provides an important safeguard against abuse.           and what the Law

      Commission described as the fundamental principle* that che right o f private

      prosecution should be unrestricted unless some very good reason to the contrary exists

(6/10). For the Director to intervene in this private prosecution because it failed to

meet bis two stage test for Police and his own prosecutions would be to usurp or

seriously restrict the scope o f the right to private prosecution. The Director’s policy

with regard to taking over private prosecutions with a view to terminating them is

lawful and rational and his application of that policy to the tacts of this case cannot be

said to have been perverse.




H ie Grounds relied upon bv the Second Applicant (Murravl
                                                                              »   •

Three grounds are relied upon. It is submitted that none is arguable.

The first ground

The Respondent's policy as to when he will take over and discontinue a private

prosecution is “wrong and unlawful”.

This ground is misconceived for the reasons set out at paragraph 4 above. As to the

specific contentions relied upon:

(1)    The thrust of the Second Applicant’s case seems to be (see paras. 3,4 and 3.6

       of his application) that in all cases of undoubted importance and difficulty where

       the Director has decided not to prosecute, he is under a duty to take over and

       discontinue a private prosecution since to do otherwise would amount to "an

       abdication of responsibility   This contention is unsustainable. Had Parliament

       intended that the Director should be under such a duty, it would have so

       provided in the 1985 Act. In any event, it is precisely when the Director has

       decided not to prosecute that a private prosecution is likely to be brought- The

       right to private prosecution would be emasculated were the duty contended for

                       to arise.

                (2)    The Applicant contends that the “clearly no case to answer" test imposes an

                       unwarranted fetter on the Director's power to take over and continue a private

                       prosecution. It does not such thing. The Director is entitled to have a policy

                       as to the circumstances in which he will take over and discontinue a private

                       prosecution, True It is that the test under the policy is different from the test

                       under his Code but this does not make it unlawful, let alone “wrong "(whatever

                       that is supposed to mean in public law terms).
                                                                                               » -




          9.   The second ground

               The Director’s policy is wrong and unlawful because it does not take proper account

               of the material public interest considerations.

               On analysis, this is a complaint not about the Director’s policy but about the application

               o f that policy to the circumstances of this case (see paragraphs 6.1 - 6,5 of the

               application). True it is that Mr Newell did not identify the public interest factors either

               in favour o f or against a prosecution in this case but:

               (a)    the Director is under no obligation to give reasons, let alone detailed reasons,

                      for his decisions;

               (b)    in fact, as he explained in his letter of 1 February 1999, Mr Newell considered

                      it ^appropriate to explain thefactors taken into account in more detail than was

                      contained in the Service's tetter dated 18 December 1998“ ;

               (c)    he stopped short of identifying any of the public interest factors in play but self-

                      evidently a very important public interest factor in favour o f prosecution will

The third ground

The decision waj perverse.

For the reasons set out in paragraph 7 above, it is submitted that this contention is

bound to fail.

Even if any of the grounds relied Upon are arguable it is submitted that as a matter of

discretion leave should be refused for die reasons set out in paragraphs 2 and 3 above.

                         conduct the present application.




     GROUNDS ON WHICH RELIEF IS SOUGHT

     Background

      1.1     The Applicant is jointly charged with manslaughter and misfeasance in public office

     arising out of the 96 deaths following the disaster on 15 April 1989 at the Hillsborough Football

      Ground where he was a senior Police Officer, second in command. The prosecution is brought

      privately on behalf o f the Hillsborough Families Support Group [HFSG].

      1.2      In August 1990, after considering the Report of Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry into the

      disaster, and following the advice of two leading counsel, the Director of Public Prosecutions

      announced his decision that no criminal prosecutions would be instituted arising out of the

      disaster. In March 1991, verdicts of accidental death were returned by a juiy at the Coroner s

       Inquest; verdicts of unlawful killing were not returned. In 1993, the Divisional Court rejected

       applications by HFSG to quash the verdicts and order a fresh Inquest.



       1.3      In 1997, following pressure from HFSG to reconsider the decision not to prosecute, the

       Director affirmed the original decision.



       1.4      In 1997, after further pressure from HFSG, the Home Secretary appointed Stuart-Smith

       L.J., to carry out an independent scrutiny of the previous Inquiries, investigations and decisions,

       with particular emphasis on whether the Director should reconsider the decisions not to

       prosecute. Claims by HFSG that new evidence existed to justify such a recommendation were

       firmly xejectcd by the Lord Justice who concluded that there was no basis for re-opening the

       Hillsborough Inquiry, the Inquests or for changing the decisions not to prosecute the Applicant.



        1.5     On 18 February 1998, in presenting the Scrutiny Report to the House of Commons, the

        Home Secretary announced his conclusion that there was no basis for inviting the Director to

        reconsider decisions not to prosecute. He expressed his acceptance of the conclusions and

        recommendations of Stuart-Smith L.J., and disclosed that both the Attorney-General and the

        Director o f Public Prosecutions concurred.



        1.6      The private prosecutions were first commenced in June 1998.

ft
      1.7        Between 27 July 1998 and 9 October 1998, the Applicant made submissions to the

     Director that this was a proper case for his intervention to take over the private prosecution and

      withdraw the summonses, pursuant to the provisions of the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985

      [the 1985 Act]. His refusal to do so was announced on 18 December 1998.




      Issues o f Law

      2.1        Whether the Respondent’s policy on the circumstances in which he will intervene to take

      over and discontinue a private prosecution is wrong and unlawful. The Applicant submits that

      it is because:
             A
             : I fa] ^ does not give proper effect to his duties and powers under the 1985 Act, and

             | [b] it does not take proper account of material public interest considerations.



      2.2        Whether the Respondent’s decision was, in any event, Wednesbury unreasonable. The

                 Applicant, submits that it was perverse.




       Statutory provisions

       3.1        The Director’s powers and duties. Section 3 of the 1985 Act (so far as material):

                  (1) The D ire c to r sh all discharge his functions under this o r a n y oth er en actm ent un der

                  the superintendence o f the Attorney-G eneral.

                  (2) It sh a ll be the duty o f the D irector, su b ject to any p ro visio n s con tain ed in the

#
                appears to him that -

                             (i)    the importance or difficulty o f the case makes it appropriate that

                            proceedings should be instituted by him; or

                            (ii)   it is otherwise appropriate fo r proceedings to be instituted by him,




         3.2    Preservation of the right to bring a private prosecution, and the Director’s powers in

                relation to that right. Section 6 of the 1985 Act:

                (1) Subject to subsection (2) below, nothing in this Part shall preclude any person from

                instituting any criminal proceedings or conducting any c rim in a l proceedings to which

                the D irector's duty to take over the conduct o f proceedings does not apply.

                (2) Where criminal proceedings are instituted in circumstances in which the D irector

                is not under a duty to take over their conduct, he may nevertheless do so a t any stage.




         3.3    The Director’s power to discontinue proceedings. Section 23 of the 1985 Act.

                 (1 ) Where the Director o f Public Prosecutions       has the conduct o f p r o c e e d in g s fo r an

                offence, this section applies in relation to the preliminary stages o f those proceedings.

                 (2) In this section, "prelim inary stage" in relation to proceedings fo r an offence does

                 not include -

                 (b)   in the case o f an indictable offence, any stage o f the proceedings after -

                             ( i ) the accused has been com m ittedfor trial;

                 (3) Where, a t any time during the preliminary stages o f the proceedings, the Director

                 gives notice under this section to the clerk o f the court that he does not want the

                 proceedings to continue, they shall be discontinued with effect from the giving o f that

                 n o tic e ... "




     |   3 .4    By section 3 (2 )(b) Parliament has imposed a duty upon the Director to institute and


                                                                  5
conduct cases of importance or difficulty. This case would be both. It was plainly not

Parliament’s intention that the conduct of such cases should be left to a private prosecutor,

although the right to do so is not precluded. Section 6(1) has effect that the right of an a d hoc

private prosecutor to institute proceedings extends to cases to which section 3(2)(b) applies: R

-v- B(nv Street Stipendiary Magistrate and another, ex parte South Coast Shipping Co Ltd and

others [1993] 1 All E.R. 219 [Divisional Court]. But section 6(2) m akes plain that the private

prosecutor’s right is subject to an overriding power of the respondent to take over such

proceedings. By necessary implication, where a private prosecutor institutes proceedings in a

case to which section 3(2)(b) applies, the Director has a duty to consider whether to take over

such proceedings. He may thereafter exercise all his powers including the power to discontinue

the proceedings under section 23. Thus, the right to institute and conduct a private prosecution

is not unfettered, and the statutory provisions expressly empower the Director (actmg under the

superintendence o f the Attorney-General) to intervene.



 3.5     The scope for private prosecution. In R -v- Bow Street Stipendiary Magistrate and

 another, exparte South Coast Shipping Co Ltd and others, Lloyd LJ cited a quotation from the

 Report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure 1981, as to the justification for ad hoc

 private prosecution: (see p.2 2 2 e):

          "It p ro vid es a useful and effective safeguard against ‘improper inaction' by the

         prosecuting authority . "

 In Couriet -v- Union o f Post Office Workers [1978] A.C. 435 at 477b Lord Wilberforce said:

          "This historical r ig h t... though rarely exercised in relation to indictable offences, and

         though idtim ately liable to be controlled by the Attorney-General (by taking Over the

         prosecu tion and, if he thinks fit, entering a nolle prosequi) remains a valuable

          constitutional safeguard against inertia or partiality on the p a rt o f authority. "
4. MAR. 1999 1 2 : 2 4                                                                               NO. 84 1 8   P. 1 0 / 3 3




    3.6      It is recognised that the Respondent’s policy on intervention would be unlawful if                   it


    operated to deny the right of private prosecution in cases where as a matter of constitutional

    principle that right might be an essential safeguard against impropriety by the established

    prosecuting authority of the State. But the Respondent’s policy is equally unlawful if, in a case

    of undoubted importance and difficulty, its operation amounts to an abdication of responsibility

    to stand by and give effect to a dutiful decision not to prosecute. A fortiori where there can be

    no suggestion of inertia, partiality or improper action, and the decision not to prosecute has been

    vindicated by the conclusion of an independent scrutiny accepted by the Home Secretary, the

     Director and the Attorney-General.



     The Respondent's Policy

     4.1      Letter 27 July 1998 (see paragraph 28 o f the affidavit o f the Applicant’s solicitor: page

     (x in the bundle]:

              “The C P S w ill take over a private prosecution where there is a particular need fo r it

              to d o so on beh alf o f the public . ... In the instant case where w e have been asked b y the

              Defendants to take over the prosecution in order to discontinue it, we w ould do so i f one

              (or more) o f the follow ing circumstances applies:

                         There is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution commenced in these

                         circumstances w ould be unfounded, and would, therefore be an abuse o f the right to

                         bring a prosecution.




                         tending in fa vo u r .

                         The prosecution is clearly likely to dam age the interests o f justice, ”

     4.2 Application o f the policy to the present case. Letter 1 February 1999, (see paragraph 34

     of the accompanying affidavit, [bundle page: ]:

                "In this case I took the decision not to intervene. After careful consideration I

               co n clu d ed in respect o f the charges o f manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a

               p u b lic du ty ... that I could not say there is clearly no case to answer. It was not right,

                therefore, fo r the service to take over the proceedings with a view to terminating (hem.




                I a lso considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors

                that should lead to the service intervening with a view to discontinuance , but I came to

                the conclusion that any public interest factors tending against a Prosecution d id not

                c le a rly outweigh those in favour. N or did 1 consider that the Prosecution is- clearly

                likely to dam age the interests o f justice. ”




      The ‘c le a r ly no c a se to a n s w e r ' te s t

      5.1      This test is wrong and unlawful. It imposes an unwarranted fetter upon the Director s

      statutoty power to take over the conduct of proceedings (section 6 (2 )), and to discontinue them

      (section 23(3)). It effectively reduces the scope for intervention to cases where there is no

      evidence at all to afford a basis for conviction. As against a private prosecutor, the Director will

      only intervene anH discontinue where he concludes that the magistrate would be bound to

      Hiamisg the charges at committal, or the Crown Court would be bound to dismiss the case at the

      close o f the prosecution’s case.



      5.2      Where the Respondent or the Crown Prosecution Service have the conduct of a

      prosecution they “m u st b e s a tisfie d th a t there is enough evid en ce to p r o v id e a " rea listic

      p r o s p e c t o f c o n v ic tio n '’ a g a in st each defen dant on each charge, ”   (para, 5.1 Code for Crown

       Prosecutors [’the Code’]). This involves not only that there should be a prima facie case in law,

       but also that the evidence should be good enough to found a basis for conviction. From 1990

       up to the challenged decision in December 1998, the Respondent’s view has consistently been

       that there is no realistic prospect of conviction. See the letter of 1st February 1999:

                 "... the CPS is not satisfiedon the basis o f its own assessment o f the strength

                 o f the evidence, that the evidence would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the

                 Code (that there should be a ‘realistic prospect o f a conviction )




       The Public Interest Factors test

       6.1       The Respondent has wholly failed to identify any public interest factor in favour of

       prosecution upon which reliance has been placed and which is said not to be clearly outweighed

       by the public interest factors tending against a prosecution.



       6.2       The policy as formulated is wrong. The Respondent’s policy should lean towards

        intervention in a section 3(2)(b) case where the private prosecutor is unable to show a

        defensible justification for proceeding after a decision not to prosecute has been taken.



        6.3      In this case, the pretext for private prosecution following the Scrutiny of Stuart-Smith

        L.J., was the claim that new or fresh evidence had emerged since the Scrutiny. The Director has

        correctly accepted the Applicant’s submissions that such claims were spurious. No other public

        interest reason for private prosecution can be substantiated.



        6   .4   Public interest factors against the prosecution include:

                  •          there is no realistic prospect of conviction;


                                                              9
for over nine years, the Applicant has been assured by various public

pronouncements of the Director, the Home Secretary and the Attorney General

that his prosecution is unjustifiable; this has created a legitimate expectation that

he will not be prosecuted;

committal proceedings and any subsequent trial would be a protracted and

expensive use of court time;

defence of the proceedings would impose a substantial costs burden upon either

the South Yorkshire Police Authority, or the legal aid fund and the Applicant

personally, which may be irrecoverable against HFSG which is (so far as the

Applicant is able to determine) an unincorporated body which has made no

disclosure as to its funding;

the private prosecutor claims not to be bound to adhere to the principles of the

Code for Crown Prosecutors, (and the Respondent appears to accept that this is

a correct view);

both Stuart-Smith L.X (in his Scrutiny Report) and McCowan L.J. (in the

Divisional Court) accepted that recollections of witnesses are likely to be, or

already have been, adversely affected by passage of time;

Since 1990, the South Yorkshire Police Force has publicly accepted substantial

 liability for the disaster and has to date paid over £13 million in compensation

 to the bereaved and injured;

 in August 1992, the Applicant was forced to retire from the police service on

 grounds o f ill health occasioned as a consequence o f his involvem ent in the

 tragedy;

 continuation of the present prosecution would be injurious to his health.
‘ 4. MAE. 1999 1 2 : 2 5                                                                   NO. 84 1 0   P. 1 4 / 3




       6.5      The Respondent’s policy should have reflected the fact that public interest in the tragedy

       w as   addressed by the Taylor Inquiry and Report and the decisions flowing therefrom. Moreover,

       in response to subsequent pressure from HFSG based on claims of new evidence, Stuai t-Smith

       LJ was appointed to carry out his Scrutiny. His conclusions were that the, “new evidence” had

       been before the Taylor Inquiry and/or was unreliable and/or did not provide grounds for

       deciding to prosecute the Applicant. Genuine public concern has thus been satisfied by enquiry

       and scrutiny, rather than by prosecution.



       The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice test

       7 .1      Thus expressed, the policy is wrong. It misplaces the emphasis. In any case to which

       section 3(2)(b) applies, where there is reason for the Respondent to believe that a private

       prosecution might damage the interests of justice, he should intervene.



       7.2       There is overlap between this and the public interest aspect of the policy.



        7.3      Regrettably, it is necessary to assert that HFSG has become a relentless campaigning

       pressure group dnven by an obsessive belief that the South Yorkshire Police Force and the West

        Midlands Police Force (appointed by the Police Complaints Authority to investigate the conduct

        o f the South Yorkshire Force) have been involved in a conspiracy to suppress the truth about

        the disaster. Their highly publicised campaign to have the Taylor Inquiry and the Inquests re­

        opened, or an entirely new enquiry, continues. The prosecution of Mr Duckenfield and the

        Applicant appears to be collateral to the main purpose of HFSG which is to attack the two

        police forces. It is not in the broader interests of justice for such a serious and high pro file

     criminal prosecution to be mounted and conducted by a highly partisan body lacking a proper

     capacity for objectivity',



     7.4      The private prosecutor has actively and publicly campaigned to attack a decision of the

     South Yorkshire Police Authority to provide funding for the Applicant’s defence. (See below.)

     The effect has been to undermine the Applicant’s funding.



     Interim R elief- committal proceedings

     8   .    The stipendiary magistrate has been invited to adjourn proceedings pending the outcome

     of the Judicial Review. He has stated that, for the time being, the issue is best determined by the

     High Court on the present application.



     Interim R elief - associated proceedings fo r Judicial Review by the Chief Constable o f South

      Yorkshire - [CO 582 - 99]

     9.1      On 22 December 1998, (the day after a hearing before the stipendiary magistrate for the

     purposes o f fixing a timetable for proceedings), HFSG wrote to the Clerk and Treasurer

      attacking a decision of the Police Authority to provide funding both for the Applicant’s defence

      of the criminal charges and for the present application.



      9.2      The eventual outcome was a decision by the Police Authority to withdraw that funding,

      followed by an application for judicial review by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire of his

      Police Authority’s decision. Leave was granted by Latham J. on the 12 th February 1999. The

      date fixed for the substantive hearing is 13th- 16thApril 1999. Both the Applicant and HFSG

      are to attend.

       9.3       It is the Applicant’s case that the interests of justice are best served by ensuring that the

       issue o f funding is determined prior to the substantive hearing of this application. To do

       otherwise would expose the Applicant to substantial financial pressure and involve the

       reorganisation of his finances which have been so arranged as to provide for he and his family

       in his retirement.

    I, RICHARD BRUCE MANNING, solicitor and partner in the firm o f Walker Moms of Kings

    Court, 12 Kings Street, Leeds LSI 2HL, a Solicitor of the Supreme Court MAKE OATH AND

    SAY AS FOLLOWS:

    1.        I have been at all material times a Partner of Walker Morris Solicitors, Leeds. In 1989

             I was instructed by Mr Bernard Murray to act on his behalf during the Inquest

             proceedings relating to the Hillsborough football disaster which occurred at the

             Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield on the 15th April 1989.

         2.   In 1998, when the Hillsborough Families Support Group (HFSG) commenced private

               prosecution proceedings against Mr Murray, I was further instructed by him in relation

               to defending him against these proceedings.



         3.   I make this affidavit from my own knowledge through the extensive work that I have

               carried out on this matter since 1989.



     4.       There is now produced and shown to me marked “RBM 1 " a bundle o f documents

               relevant to this application.



     5.       Bernard Murray worked as a police officer for 26 years. He attained the position of

              Police Superintendent with the South Yorkshire Police and was stationed at Hammerton

              Road Police Station, Sheffield. On Saturday 15 April 1989, Bernard Murray held the

              position o f Sub-Divisional Commander of the FI Sub-Division which includes Sheffield

              Wednesday Football Ground at Hillsborough. Bernard Murray had been posted to this

              Sub-Division on the 14 March 1988. He had been regularly carrying out duties in

              connection with football matches at Hillsborough, including the 1988 FA Semi-Cup

              Final    Match. On the day of the Hillsborough disaster, the Divisional Commander in

              charge of Police operations at the match was Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield.

              The match was the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham

              Forest Football club. The events of the day led to 96 people losing their lives.



     6   .    Lord Justice Taylor was appointed by the Government on the 17th April 1989 to carry

              out a public enquiry into the events of the disaster. Oral evidence was heard from 174

                witnesses between 15th May and 29th June 1989. On the 4th August 1989, Lord Justice

                Taylor presented an interim report in which he found as follows:



                6 .1     The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the

                             failure, when Gate C was opened, to cut off access to the tunnel leading to the

                             central pens behind the goal which were already overfull;

                6.2      They were overfull because no safe maximum capacities had been laid down, no

                         attempt was made to control entry to individual pens numerically and there was

                         no effective visual monitoring of crowd density.

               6.3      The layout of the barriers afforded less protection than they should and this led

                         to the collapse of the barrier.

               6.4      The Operational Order and police tactics on the day failed to provide for

                         controlling a concentrated arrival of large numbers should that occur in a short

                         period.

               6.5      Hie presence o f a minority who had drunk too much aggravated the problem, as

                        did the Club’s confused and inadequate signs and ticketing.



     7.       Lord Justice Taylor’s final report was dated the 18th January 1990 and he made several

               recommendations in relation to crowd control and safety at sporting events.



     8   .    The West Midlands Police had been appointed immediately after the disaster to conduct

              a review of the policing operation of the South Yorkshire Police. In March 1990, their

              report was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for his consideration

              as to whether there was sufficient evidence for prosecutions for manslaughter to be


                                                           3

                brought against seven officers who were in command during the Hillsborough Football

                disaster (including Bernard Murray).



      9.       The Director of Public Prosecutions referred this report to two experienced Queens

               Counsel for their opinions. Counsel considered whether there was sufficient evidence

               for charges of manslaughter and offences of culpable misfeasance in public office to be

               made out against the officers. Counsel delivered a joint opinion on the 6 th August 1990.

               Based upon the benefit of these advices, the then Director o f Public Prosecutions Alan

               Green QC announced on the 30th August 1990 that there was insufficient evidence to

              justify any prosecution for a criminal offence against any member of the South Yorkshire

               Police Force, or any other party.



      10.    On the 18th April 1990, the HM Coroner for South Yorkshire, Dr Stefan Popper

              commenced the first o f a series o f “mini inquests”.The purpose of these was to decide

              statutory questions as to when and where a particular victim died. These were necessary

              because during this period the DPP was still considering possible prosecutions against

              the parties involved. The Coroner did not examine how each victim died.



     11.     Following the announcement by the Director of Public Prosecutions on the 3 0th August

              1990 that there would be no prosecutions, the Coroner’s Inquest resumed on the 19th

              November 1990 and continued until March 1991. This was the “main” inquest into the

              disaster and examined how each of the victims died. Some 230 witnesses gave evidence

              to the resumed Inquest. On the 28th March 1991 the jury returned a verdict o f accidental

              death.


                                                       4
  In April 1993, an application was made by the families of the Hillsborough victims for

  a judicial review to quash the inquest verdict and seek a fresh inquest. On the 5th

  November 1993 the Divisional Court declined to grant an Order of a Certiorari to quash

  the verdict o f Accidental Death and to Order a fresh inquest.



 Disciplinary proceedings were brought by the Police Complaints Authority alleging

 neglect of duty against Bernard Murray and also Chief Superintendent David

 Duckenfield. However before the planned hearing, it was announced by the South

 Yorkshire Police on the 29th October 1991 that Mr Duckenfield would be retiring from

 the force on the grounds of ill health. As a result of his early retirement, he did not have

 to face the disciplinary tribunal.



Following Mr Duckenfield’s decision to retire, the Police Complaints Authority decided

on the 13 th January 1992 not to proceed with the remaining charges against Bernard

Murray. The reasons for this decision was that it would be :

         "An injustice to the Superintendent who had conducted him self with dignity at
        the Inquest and throughout the investigations fo r him to stand alone and thus
        appear to be a scapegoatforfaults that may well be attributable to others "




On the 27 day of August 1992 Bernard Murray retired from the South Yorkshire Police

on the grounds of ill health, having been certified by the Police Surgeon, Dr Everson,

as medically unfit for performing the ordinary duties o f a member o f the force.



The apparent catalyst that led to a further review of the evidence in relation to the

disaster was a television drama documentary called “Hillsborough”. It was written by
  Mr Jimmy McGovern a native of Liverpool. The programme was broadcast on                       5



 December 1996.



 Various allegations were made within this programme, in particular that there was fresh

 evidence in relation to the Hillsborough disaster.




 Between March and May 1997, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) conducted a

 further review of the allegations that had been broadcasted within the Hillsborough

drama-documentary and generally. Hie conclusion reached and confirmed (inter alia)

in a letter dated February 1999 from Mr C W P Newell, Director Casework of the CPS

said “it is correct that the Crown Prosecution Service decided in 1997 that the evidence

at that time was not sufficient in its view to provide a realistic prospect of the conviction

by either your Client or Mr Duckenfield for any offence”.



On the 30th June 1997, the Rt Hon Jack Straw, the Home Secretary announced in

Parliament that there would be an independent scrutiny to examine whether there was

any fresh evidence in relation to the Hillsborough disaster. In particular, the Scrutiny was

to examine whether this “new” evidence might have a bearing on the various legal

procedures and decisions that have been taken in relation to the disaster. Lord Justice

Stuart-Smith was appointed to carry out this task- The terms of reference of the Scrutiny

were as follows :

       “To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the

       Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available;

       (a).    To the enquiry conducted by Lord Taylor; or
         (b).    To the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney General for the

                purpose of discharging their respective statutory responsibilities; or

        (c).    To the Chief Officer of South Yorkshire Police in relation to Police

                disciplinary matters; and

        (d).    In relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously available

                is of such significance as to justify establishment by the Secretary of State

                for the Home Department of a further public enquiry; and

        (e).    In relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their attention any evidence not

                previously considered by them which may be relevant to their respective

                duties and to advise whether there is any other action which should be

                taken in the public interest”.



Whilst undertaking the Scrutiny, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith received various submissions

both in writing and in oral form from the HFSG, he met family members in Liverpool

and other people that he thought could aid him in his scrutiny including “new” witnesses

or witnesses who could, it was submitted, supply “additional” evidence.



His report was presented to the House of Commons on 18 February 1998. Lord Justice

Stuart-Smith concluded within Chapter Seven of his report that :

        "I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which there
       should be a further judicial inquiry or a re-opening o f Lord Taylor's inquiry.
       There is no basis fo r a renewed application to the Divisional Court or fo r the
       Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988.1do not
       consider that there is any material which should be placed before the Director
       o f Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause
       them to re-consider the decisions they have already taken


On the 18th February 1998, the Rt Hon Jack Straw, the Home Secretary said in the
4. MAR. 1999 1 2 : 2 3                                                                     NO. 8 4 1 8   P. 2 5 / 3 3



              House o f Commons in regard to the Scrutiny inter alia :

                          "I, the Attorney General and the Director o f Public Prosecutions have considered
                         Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's report very carefully. We have no reason to doubt his
                         conclusions


    23.      On the 26th June 1998, informations were laid before a Justice of the Peace in the Petty

             Sessional Division of South Sefton by Ann Adlington, Solicitor, acting on behalf o f the

             HFSG. These informations alleged that Bernard Dean Murray on the 15th day o f April

             1989 at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield :



                         23.1   Unlawfully killed John Alfred Anderson, contrary to common law.

                         23.2   Unlawfully killed James Gary Aspinall, contrary to common law.

                         23.3   Willfully neglected to perform a public duty, contrary to common law.



   24.     Mr Murray was summoned to appear subsequently at the Court.



   25.     As a result o f objections made on behalf of Mr Murray to the HFSG and to the South

            Sefton Magistrates Court, the informations were not proceeded with. On the 10th July

            1998, the South Sefton Magistrates’ Court allowed the Prosecution to withdraw the

            charges and made a consequential order for Defendant’s costs, pursuant to Section 16 of

            the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.



   26.      On the 13th July 1998, informations identical as to those that had been laid at South

            Sefton were laid by the HFSG before the Leeds Petty Sessional Division. Summonses

           were issued by the Stipendiary Magistrate, Mr Nigel Cadbury. These proceedings

           continue and Committal proceedings have been listed for the 19th April 1999, with an

               estimated duration o f four weeks.




               Upon the receipt of the original summonses, I wrote on 3 July 1998 to the Director of

               Public Prosecutions to request that the Director take over the conduct o f the proceedings,

               pursuant to Section 6 (2 ) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 and discontinue them,

               pursuant to Section 23(3) of the same Act.




     28.      On the 27th July 1998, the CPS wrote Mr Keva Coombes, the then legal advisor to the

              HFSG. Within this letter, Mr George Croston. the Prosecution Team Leader stated :

              “It may help you if you are acquainted with our policy in cases o f this type. The Code fo r
              Crown Prosecutors contains principles that apply to the Crown Prosecution Service
             review o f criminal proceedings started by the police. There are two stages in the decision
             to prosecute. Thefirst being the evidential test. I f the case does not pass that test, it must
             not go ahead, no matter how important or serious it may be. I f the case does pass the
             evidential test then a Crown Prosecutor must decide if a prosecution is needed in the
             P ublic Interest. This second stage is the Public Interest test which I shall come to
             later.

             The Evidential test is an objective one and a Crown Prosecutor must be satisfied that
             there is enough evidence to provide a ‘realistic prospect o f conviction ’ against each
             defendant on each charge. In other words, a ju ry or bench o f magistrates, properly
             directed in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant o f
             the offence charged.

            Where there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect o f conviction the public
            interest must be considered. Crown Prosecutors must balance the factors fo r and against
            prosecution carefully and fairly.

            The policy where proceedings have been commencedby a private prosecutor builds on
            that contained in the Code fo r Crown Prosecutors. The right to bring a private
            prosecution is preserved by Section 6(1) o f the Prosecution o f Offences A ct 1985 subject
            to the pow er under Section 6(2). The Crown Prosecution Service w ill take over a private
            prosecution where there is a particular needfor it to do so on behalf o f the public




            In the instant case where we have been asked by the Defendants to take over the
            prosecution in order to discontinue it, we would do so i f one (or more) o f the following
            circumstances applies:

                                                      9
4. MAR. 1 999 1 2 : 2 9                                                                      NO. 841 8   P. 2 7 / 3 3




               •          There is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution commenced, in these
                           circumstances would be unfounded, and would, therefore be an abuse o f the right
                           to bring a prosecution.

               •          The public interestfactors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those
                          factors tending in favour.

              •           The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice.

              The Crown Prosecution Servicewould then regard itself as having to act in
              accordance with our policy.

             C learly there is a distinction between the “realistic prospect o f conviction” test in the
             Code and the "clearly no case to answer ” test mentioned above. Accordingly we
             recognise that there will be some cases which do not meet the Crown Prosecution Service
             code tests where nevertheless we will not intervene. It has been considered that to apply
             the Code tests to private prosecutions would unfairly limit the right, o f individuals to
             bring their own cases ".




    29.      On the 24th August 1998, the HFSG served upon us the 38 witness statements upon

             which they are seeking to rely for the purposes of the private prosecution proceedings,

             and to secure a committal to the Crown Court under Section 6(2) or section 6(1) of the

             Magistrates’ Court Ac: 1980.



             On the 24th September 1998, the HFSG served upon us their submissions that they were

            making to the DPP in relation to our application for the DPP to take over and discontinue

            the proceedings. The HFSG served further representations upon us on the 2nd October

             1998.




            In the light of the submissions made by the HFSG and also the policy letter of the Crown

            Prosection Service of the 27th July 1998, a detailed set of submissions was prepared and

            sent to the Crown Prosecution Service on behalf of Mr Murray on 8 October 1998. This

4. MAE. 1 999 1 2 : 2 9                                                                    NO. 841 8   P. 2 8 /



               is now produced to me and marked “exhibit RBM6 ". Within these submissions, it was

               argued that the statements and material alleged by the HFSG to be “n ew fresh evidence”

               was in fact information and material which had been available to the 1989 public enquiry

              of Lord Justice Taylor.




     32.      After lengthy period of consideration, The DPP through a letter from Christopher Enzor

              dated the 18th December 1998 and stated that:

                          "We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and
                          all the surrounding circumstances o f the case. We have concluded that we should
                          not intervene to take over any o f the charges ”


    33.      I was extremely concerned that this important correspondence from the Crown

             Prosecution Service contained no reference as to the factual matters upon which the

             Crown Prosecution Service arrived at their decision and secondly, that no information

             was given as to the way the Crown Prosecution Service applied their discretion under the

             Code for Crown Prosecutors and statutes. I therefore wrote to the Crown Prosecution

             Service on the 18th December 1998 requesting that they supply this information by

             10:00am on the 2 1 st December 1998.



    4.      The response from the Crown Prosecution Service was eventually provided by a letter

            dated 1 February 1999 from M r C W P Newell, Director Casework of the Crown

            Prosecution Service which said inter alia”

                     “As you know, the Code fo r Crown Prosecutors sets out the general principles
                     applied by the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a
                     Prosecution it has taken over; or whether to institute proceedings, or to advise
                     the Police whether to do so. It is correct that the Crown Prosecution Service
                     decided in 1997 that the evidence at that time was not sufficient, in its view, to
                     provide a realistic prospect o f the conviction o f either you r Client or M r
                     Duckenfield fo r any offence. However, the decision whether to intervene in a

•4. MAR. 1 999 1 2 : 3 0                                                                        NO. 8 4 1 8   P. 2 9 / 3 3



                            private Prosecution with a view to terminating it calls fo r different
                            considerations to apply. It is quite possible fo r a private Prosecution to continue,
                            notwithstanding that the Crown Prosecution Service is not satisfied\ on the basis
                            o f its own assessment o f the strength o f the evidence, that the evidence would
                            p a ss the evidential sufficiency test in the code (that there could be a "realistic
                            prospect o f conviction ").

                            In broad terms the reason fo r this is that Section 6(1) o f the Prosecution o f
                            Offences Act 1985, the Act which established the services, pow ers and duties,
                           specifically preserved the right o f private individuals and prosecuting authorities
                           or bodies other than the Crown Prosecution Service to bring criminal
                           proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) tot he limitation in
                           Section 6(2) that the Crown Prosecution Service may nevertheless take over the
                           proceedings with a view either to conducting or terminating those proceedings ”.

                           Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code fo r Crown Prosecutors
                           when deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the Court supply the
                           evidentiary sufficiency test in the Code when deciding whether there is a case to
                           answer. The Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate to intervene
                           to terminate a private Prosecution without good reason. That general principal
                           has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its consultation paper
                           number 149 “Consents to Prosecution” (seeparagraph 6.3 a n d 6.4).

                           The Services’policy is that it will not take over a private Prosecution with a view
                           to terminating it unless one or more o f the following apply.

                           1.     There is clearly no case to answer. A private Prosecution started in these
                                  circumstances would be unfounded and ought not to be perm itted to
                                  continue; or

                       2.         The public interest factors tending against Prosecution clearly outweigh
                                  those in favour (examples might be where the Prosecution is malicious,
                                  or vexatious o f the offence is one fo r which the Defendant should clearly
                                  have been cautioned, or where although the offence may be serious, the
                                  Defendant is terminally ill); or

                       3.         The Prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice.

                      In this case I took the decision not to intervene. After careful consideration I
                      concluded in respect o f the charges o f tnanslaughter and wilful neglect to
                      perform a public duty (which, for the avoidance o f doubt, were com idered
                      against each individual separately) that I could not say there is clearly no case
                      to answer. It was not right, therefore, for the service to take over the proceedings
                      with a view to terminating them.

                      Against that background, and after specifically considering the appropriate
                      course to take in these circumstances, I concluded further that it would not be
                      right to intervene in respect o f the one remaining charge against M r Duckenfield,

                                                          12

                          or attem pting to pervert the course o f justice, albeit that I hadform ed the view
                          that there w as clearly no case to answer on that charge alone. The charge o f
                          attempting to pen>ert the course o f justice is a serious one, particularly when
                          levelled against someone who was, at the relevant time, a serving Senior Police
                          officer. Nevertheless, in the context o f the case as a whole, that charge is not the
                          gravamen ofthe criminality alleged against Mr Duckenfield and I concluded that
                          my approach to that charge should be led by my conclusions on the charges o f
                          manslaughter and willful neglect to perform a public duty

                           I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest
                          factors that should lead to the service intervening with a view to discontinuance,
                           but I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors tending against a
                          Prosecution did not clearly outweigh those infavour. Nor did I consider that the
                          Prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice




              Upon the issue o f the summonses the South Yorkshire Police Authority had agreed to

              provide financial assistance to Bernard Murray by indemnifying him in relation to the

              legal fees that he would incur.          The South Yorkshire Police Authority received

              representations from the Hillsborough Family Support Group by their letter of 13 January

              1999 and which effectively asked the authority to review and rescind its decision in

             relation to payment o f legal costs and not to provide any further financial assistance to

             Bernard Murray.




             Throughout the whole course of time since the disaster but in particular unabated since

             the issues o f the summonses, HFSG have continued to make press statements, give

             interviews to newspaper, television and radio including the repetition o f allegations

             already judicially discounted. They run a website updated with publicity as to the action

             they are taking and seeking to enlist others to support their activities e.g. the draft letter

             for South Yorkshire council tax payers to object to the continuation o f funding,



            At a meeting o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority on 5 February 1999, written and

                oral submissions were considered. The Authority resolved that on balance it did not have

                the legal power to provide financial assistance to Bernard Murray either in regard to the

                Defence of the private Prosecution brought by HFSG or in regard to the costs of Judicial

                Review proceedings against the Crown Prosecution Service. The Authority therefore

               rejected the application of Bernard Murray for financial assistance and further declared

               that its previous decision to make assistance available to him in the criminal Prosecution

               was rendered null and void.




               As a result of recognition by the Authority that the legal advice they had received was

               that the point remains arguable” the Authority agreed to find an appropriate means bv

               which the decision could be reviewed by the High Court with expedition.

Subject      Hillsborough

Some recipients will know that the defendants in the Hillsborough case
(retired Superintendents Duckenfield and Murray) have applied for leave for
Judicial Review of the CPS decision not to intervene and take over and
discontinue the private prosecution launched on behalf of the Hillsborough
Family Support Group.
The application for leave is listed on 8 March 1999.
Treasury Solicitors have been instructed (Sue Ross is dealing with it). She
is instructing counsel - Philip Havers, all being well.
HFSG, whilst not strictly a party to this application, may seek to make
representations.
It has been suggested that this application and the JR application of the
South Yorkshire Chief Constable against his own police authority on the
funding issue be linked. I do not think this is appropriate as the issues
are entirely separate as far as we are concerned. Sue is of the same view.

Thank you. Is the H F S G going to JR the decision of the CC South Yorks to JR the decision of his Police
Authority to frustrate the intention of the defendants to JR our decision not to intervene?

W hen, or where, is this increasingly ridiculous saga going to end?! (Please do not try to answer.)

M ESSAG E

Attached is a poor photocopy o f a report in a local Sheffield edition o f the Yorkshire
Post.

It w ould appear that the intimated judicial review o f the CPS decision not to intervene
in the private prosecution m ay be on hold, at least for the moment. A n interesting
development is the C h ief Constable's stated challenge, by w a y o f judicial review, to
his ow n Police Authority's decision to suspend financial support.

A nn Adlington o f the H FSG w ill be keeping m e up to date on any further
developments.

     Dear Sirs

     ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

     Y ou wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service on 18 Decem ber 1998, follow ing the receipt o f a
     letter from the CPS, also dated 18 Decem ber 1998, informing you o f the S ervice’s decision
     not to exercise its pow er under Section 6(2) o f the Prosecution o f O ffences Act 1985 to take
     over the criminal proceedings against your client with a view to discontinuing them.

     Y ou ask for further information: first, as to the factual matters on w hich the CPS relied,
     identifying w hich parts o f the evidence is “new ” since the Crown last considered the case; and
     secondly, as to the w ay in w hich the Service applied the Code for Crown Prosecutors in
     deciding whether to intervene.

     These questions indicate that you misunderstand the factors that the CPS considers when
     deciding whether to take over a private prosecution at the request o f a defendant, w ith a view
     to discontinuance. It may help if I indicate again in broad terms the approach that the Service
     adopts to these decisions.

     A s you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general principles applied by the
     Sendee when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a prosecution it has taken over; or
     whether to institute proceedings, or to advise the police whether to do so. It is correct that the
     CPS decided in 1997 that the evidence available at that time was not sufficient, in its view , to
     provide a realistic prospect o f the conviction o f either your client or Mr Duckenfield for any
     offence.    H owever, it does not follow that, when considering the evidence and the
     representations submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves on b eh alf o f your
     client, the CPS should seek m erely to identify whether there is now any new evidence
     sufficient to provide a realistic prospect o f a conviction. The decision whether to intervene in




                           C row n P rosecution Service   •   W orking in the interests of ju stic e
 a private prosecution w ith a view to terminating it calls for different considerations to be
 applied. It is quite possible for a private prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the
 CPS is not satisfied, on the basis o f its ow n assessment o f the strength o f the evidence, that
 the evidence w ould pass the evidential sufficiency test in the Code (that there should be a
 “realistic prospect o f a conviction”).

 In broad terms, the reason for this is that Section 6(1) o f the Prosecution o f O ffences Act
 1985, the Act which established the Service’s powers and duties, specifically preserved the
 right o f private individuals and prosecuting authorities or bodies other than the CPS to bring
 criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) to the limitation in
 Section 6(2) that the CPS m ay nevertheless take over the proceedings with a view either to
 conducting or to terminating those proceedings.

 Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors w h en deciding
 whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the evidential sufficiency test in the
 Code w hen deciding whether there is a case to answer. The Service therefore recognises that
 it is not appropriate to intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
 general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Com m ission in its Consultation
 Paper No. 149 “Consents to Prosecution” (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).

 The Service’s policy is that it w ill not take over a private prosecution with a v iew to
 terminating it unless one or more o f the follow ing applies:

 (i)    there is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution started in these circumstances
        w ould be unfounded and ought not to be permitted to continue; or

(ii)    the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those in favour
        (exam ples m ight be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious; or the offence is
        one for which the defendant should clearly have been cautioned; or where, although
        the offence may b e serious, the defendant is terminally ill); or

(iii)   the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice.

 In this case, I took the decision not to intervene. After careful consideration, I concluded in
 respect o f the charges o f manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty (which, for
 the avoidance o f doubt, were each considered against each individual separately) that I could
 not say that there is clearly no case to answer. It was not right, therefore, for the Service to
 take over the proceedings with a v iew to terminating them.

 I should add that, against that background and after specifically considering the appropriate
 course to take in these circumstances, I concluded further that it would not be right to
 intervene in respect o f the one remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield, o f attempting to
 pervert the course o f justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case to
 answer on that charge alone. The charge o f attempting to pervert the course o f justice is a
 serious one, particularly when levelled against som eone who was, at the relevant time, a
 serving, senior police officer. N evertheless, in the context o f the case as a w hole that charge
 is not the gravamen o f the criminality alleged against Mr Duckenfield and I concluded that
 my approach to that charge should be led by my conclusions on the charges o f manslaughter
 and wilful neglect to perform a public duty.
I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors that
should lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance, but I cam e to the
conclusion that any public interest factors tending against prosecution did not clearly
outw eigh those in favour; nor did I consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage
the interests o f justice.

The Crown Prosecution Service is not obliged in law to provide detailed reasons for its
decisions, let alone any analysis o f the evidence. H owever, in the circumstances o f this
particular case I consider it appropriate to explain the factors taken into account in more detail
than was contained in the Service’s letter dated 18 Decem ber 1998.

I have written in similar terms to those representing Mr Duckenfield and enclose a copy o f
that letter, for your information. I have sent copies o f both letters to M s Adlington.

Yours faithfully

     Dear Sirs

     ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

     You wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service on 23 December 1998, follow ing the receipt o f a
     letter from the CPS dated 18 D ecem ber 1998, informing you o f the Service's decision not to
     exercise its power under Section 6(2) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 to take over the
     criminal proceedings against your client w ith a v iew to discontinuing them.

     You ask for further information; first, for full and detailed reasons for the decision taken;
     secondly, for confirmation that the evidentiary test applied by the CPS in com ing to our
     conclusion was that set out in our letter to the H FSG o f 27 July 1998; and thirdly, as to the
     w ay in which the Service applied the Code for Crown Prosecutors in deciding whether to
     intervene.

     These questions indicate that you misunderstand the factors that the CPS considers when
     deciding whether to take over a private prosecution at the request o f a defendant, with a view

    Subject:             Hillsborough: Letters to defence solicitors

    R e the draft letter to W a lk e r Morris, i've checked their address with Ann.

    I'm faxing a copy of Winckworth Sherwood's letter of 2 3 .1 2 .9 8 re their request for our reasons. This letter was
    not seen by me until 5.1 99 and therefore w as not sent to the Treasury Solicitor before Christmas. As it's slightly
    different to the request from W a lk e r Morris, I've attached an am ended draft letter specifically for them.

    I agree with the rest of the draft letter except:

    (i) Page 1 last para, delete full stop afterw ord ' that'
    (ii) In the light of a separate letter going to W inckworth Sherwood, the final paragraph might be am ended to
    read: "I have sent a letter in similar terms to the solicitors for Mr. Duckenfield. In accordance with our previous
    agreem ent I have sent copies of both letters to Ms. Adlington."

    Ms. Adlington phoned me this morning to say that Trevor Hicks of the H F S G will be making oral representations
    before the South Yorkshire Police Authority on Friday 5.2.

    Robin Booth has asked for a sight of the letters to go to the defence solicitors. Perhaps Ann could oblige when
    they're ready for posting?

Draft letter for WINCKWORTH SHERWOOD



Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

You wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service on 23 December 1998 following the
receipt of a letter from the CPS dated 18 December 1998, informing you of the
Service's decision not to exercise its power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of
Offences Act 1985 to take over the criminal proceedings against your client with a
view to discontinuing them.

You ask for further information; first, for full and detailed reasons for the decision
taken; second, for confirmation that the evidentiary test applied by the CPS in coming
to our conclusion was that set out in our letter to the HFSG of 27 July 1998; and third,
as to the way the Service applied the Code for Crown Prosecutors in deciding whether
to intervene.

These questions indicate that you misunderstand the factors that the CPS considers
when deciding whether to take over a private prosecution at the request of a
defendant, with a view to discontinuance. It may help if I set out again in broad terms
the approach the Service adopts to these decisions.

As you know, the Code for Crown prosecutors sets out the general principles applied
by the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a prosecution it has
taken over; or whether to institute proceedings, or to advise the police whether to do
so. It is correct that the CPS decided in 1997 that the evidence at that time was not
sufficient, in its view, to provide a realistic prospect of conviction of either your client
or Mr. Murray for any offence. However, the decision whether to intervene in a
private prosecution with a view to terminating it calls for different considerations to
be applied. It is quite possible for a private prosecution to continue, notwithstanding
that the CPS is not satisfied, on the basis of its own assessment of the strength of the
evidence, that the evidence would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the Code (that
there should be a "realistic prospect of a conviction").

In broad terms, the reason for this is that Section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences
Act 1985, the Act which established the Service's powers and duties, specifically
preserved the right of private individuals and prosecuting authorities or bodies other
than the CPS to bring criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among other
limitations) to the limitation in Section 6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless take over
the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to terminating those proceedings.

Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors when
deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the evidential
sufficiency test in the Code when deciding whether there is a case to answer. The
Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate to intervene to terminate a
private prosecution without good reason. That general principle has recently been
endorsed by the Law Commission in its Consultation Paper No. 149 "Consents to
Prosecution" (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).

The Service policy is that it will not take over a private prosecution with a view to
terminating it unless one or more of the following applies:

(i)     there is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution started in these
         circumstances would be unfounded and ought not to be permitted to continue;
         or

(ii)    the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those
         in favour (examples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious,
         or the offence is one for which the defendant should clearly have been
         cautioned; or where, although the offence may be serious, the defendant is
         terminally ill); or

(iii)   the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.

In this case, I took the decision not to intervene. After careful consideration, I
concluded in respect of the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a
public duty (which, for the avoidance of doubt, were considered against each
individual separately) that I could not say that there is clearly no case to answer. It
was not right, therefore, for the Service to take over the proceedings with a view to
terminating them.

I should add that, against that background, and after specifically considering the
appropriate course to take in these circumstances, I concluded further that it would not
be right to intervene in respect of the one remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield,
of attempting to pervert the course of justice, albeit I had formed the view that there
was clearly no case to answer on that charge alone. The charge of attempting to
pervert the course of justice is a serious one particularly when levelled against one
who was at the relevant time, a serving, senior police officer. Nevertheless, in the
context of the case as a whole that charge is not the gravamen of the criminality
alleged against Mr. Duckenfield and I concluded that my approach to that charge
should be led by my conclusions on the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to
perform a public duty.

I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors
that should lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance, but I came
to the conclusion that any public interest factors tending against prosecution did not
clearly outweigh those in favour; nor did I consider that the prosecution is clearly
likely to damage the interests of justice.

The Crown Prosecution Service is not obliged in law to provide detailed reasons for
its decisions let alone an analysis of the evidence. However, in the circumstances of
this particular case I did consider it appropriate to explain the factors taken into
account in more detail than was contained in the Service's letter dated on 18
December 1998.
A letter in similar terms has been sent to the solicitors for Mr. Murray. In accordance
with our previous agreement I have sent copies of both letters to Ms. Adlington.

Dear Mr Enzor

Adlington -v- Duckenfleld and Murray
Leeds Magistrates’ Court - 21 December 1998

We refer to your letter o f 18 November and note the advice contained therein.

In regard to the CPS conclusion that “we should not intervene to lake over any o f the
charges” we are bound to say, as per our detailed letter of submissions dated 9 October
1998. that full and detailed reasons for the decision taken are required to be made known in
this situation and we reiterate the request for those reasons.

We ask for confirmation that the evidentiary test applied by the CPS in coming to its
conclusion was that set out in your letter o f 27 July 1998 to HFSG, specifically “there is
clearly no case to a n s w e r It may well be implicit that this is the case, but you will
appreciate the desire for us to clarify the basis for the CPS decision before taking matters
farther.

Insofar as the letter o f 27 July 1998 maintains that the CPS policy in this case builds on that
contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, please advise which aspects o f the Code have
been considered in coming to the conclusion reached, and the weight given to any such
factors.

You will appreciate that as the criminal prosecution is proceeding, we are bound to take any
appropriate steps following receipt of your letter with all due expedition, and accordingly
would be grateful if you could let us have the advice requested by return. We are aware of a
letter sent by the solicitors to Mr Murray, Walker Morris, on 18 December 1998 and
notwithstanding any response you may care to give to that correspondence, we would ask
you to deal specifically with the issues raised in this correspondence.

         ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

         You wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service on 18 December 1998^following the receipt of a
         letter from the CPS, also dated 18 December 1998, informing you o f the Service's decision not
         to exercise its power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985 to take over the
    X    criminal proceedings against your client^ with a view to discontinuing them.


X        You ^     f°r ftffther information* 4 ^ a s to the factual matters on which the CPS r e lie ^ ^ f
         identifying which parts o f tha evidence is "new" since the Crown Pseeeeutioa Swvt©» last
    P\   considered the case; and        as to the way the Service applied the Code for Crown Prosecutors
         in deciding whether to intervene.


         These questions indicate that you misunderstand the factor^the Ckjskzi Pneseetttioa S*j*4c»
         considers when deciding whether to take over a private prosecution at the request o f a defendant,
         with a view to discontinuance. It may help if I set out again in broad terms the approach the
         Service adopts to these decisions.


    A    As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors                 sets out the general principles applied by
         the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a prosecution it has taken over; or
    )C   whether to institute proceedings^ to advise the police whether to do so. It is correct that the
^ )C K Cjoam Pi&sesti&dR                  decided in 1997 that the evidence available at that tinjte^was^no^i
    X    sufficient, in its view, to provide a realistic prospect o f tfee convictioxi o f either^your client^T
    X    for anijoffence.    However, it does not follow (hat. wh^n considering the evidence and
                                                                      29/01 '99 11:37 NO.190            03




      R epresentations submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf o f your client#
         the CPS should sed^.mfefly to identify whether there is now any new evidence sufficient to
         provide a. realistic ■jHpspect'M' a conviction. The decision whether to intervene in a private
          prosecution w it^ ^ v iif'to terminating it calls for altogether different considerations to be
          applied. It ia^jmite ptossible for a private prosecution to continu^notwithstanding that the CPS
                        iejfibn the basis o f its own assessment o f the strength o f the evidence, that the
          evidcfl     |jj|rtnd pass the evidential sufficiency test in the Code (that there should be a "realistic

PC.       In broad terms, the reason for this is that Section 6(1) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985,"Hu A t-lf

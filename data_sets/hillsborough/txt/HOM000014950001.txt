          MUTUAL AID : MINERS' DISPUTE

          Thank you for your letter of 25 January about your authority's
          request for a determination against Nottinghamshire Police
          Authority.

          2.   In relation to travelling day payments the position is that
          the Home Secretary, having given careful consideration to all the
          points put forward on the travelling days issue, has reached the
          conclusion that only those amounts which are in accordance with PNB
          Circular 86/15 should normally be included in determination* by him.

          3.   It is appreciated that police authorities were not in an easy
          position when disputes arose with their officers over the
          interpretation of PNB Circular 83/10, which had subsequently to be
          clarified by PNB Circular PNB 86/15.   But we believe that it was
          generally known that there was disagreement about the possible
          interpretation of PNB Circular 83/10 insofar as it affected
          travelling days.  Therefore if an authority made payments without
          first ensuring that that interpretation was agreed by the aiding
          authority, there was no guarantee that it would be finally
          reimbursed.

          4.      The Chief Constable of Nottinghamshire circulated three
    *     letters to Chief Officers and Clerks to police authorities making
          it clear that the interpretation of PNB Circular 83/10 was in
          dispute. They were dated 28 March 1984, 6 April 1984 and 25 April
          1984.   It was open to aiding authorities to withhold the disputed
          payments or to make payments subject to furth'er adjustment until
          the matter was resolved, by arbitration if necessary.
 The only statutory power to charge for police services is provided
 in section 15 of the Police Act 1964, under which a Chief Officer of
 Police may provide on request special services at any place within his
 police area, subject to the payment to the police authority of such
 charges as they may determine. "Special police services" are services
 which would not normally be provided in pursuance of the general duty
 of the police to preserve law and order. If the organisers of, for
 example, major sporting events need police officers inside the ground
 to maintain order, agreement is usually reached with the organisers
 on the number of police needed and they are charged for as a special
 police service. The costs of officers deployed outside the ground, for
 crowd and traffic control, are borne in the normal way by the police
 authority. This is because the courts have ruled that "special
 services** are services provided by the police outside the scope of
 their normal obligations and that a police authority cannot properly
 charge for services which the police are normally expected to provide.
 These include preserving the peace, preventing and detecting crime,
^ and controlling traffic.
 We have in the past considered the possibility of changing the law,
 to require the organisers of sporting or other events which attract
 large crowds not only to meet the cost of providing police officers
 within the grounds but also to meet, or at least contribute, to the
 cost of those employed on crowd and traffic control in the area.
 There would be considerable difficulties. For example, one difficulty
 would be to distinguish between normal police duties and the extra
 duties caused by the event in question, or to apportion liability
 where a number of events were being held in the same area.
It has been the policy of successive Governments that charges for
special police services should cover the full economic cost of those
services. This remains our view. It is for the Chief Officer of
Police, in consultation with the organisers, to decide how many
officers should be deployed inside a sports ground or at an open air
event (such as a pop festival) and for each police authority to
determine what charge should be made to the organisers of an event to
recover the cost of those services.

 We all recognise the first class job our police do in the
 face of the increasing pressures and new demands we place
 upon them.         For its part the Government has ensured a
 massive increase in police manpower.                     On^l       the total
 strength of the police service in England and Wales was
      icflO .    This represents an increase of                         X 2. Sb~f
 since May 1979.




                                       ( X L s>o     Hllhe recruitment of
additional civilians has enabled police officers to be
released from posts which do not require the powers and
■training of a police officer, for redeployment on
operational duties in the light of current policing needs
and priorities. 0\r«x

  The day-to-day deployment of police officers is an operational matter and

  as such is the responsibility of the Chief Officer concerned rather than

   the Home Secretary,           but we know that Chief Officers of police recognise

   the importance of the deployment of police officers on patrol duties and

   many have been able to increase the numbers of police officers available

   for patrol duties and in contact with the community.

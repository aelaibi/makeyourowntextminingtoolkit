                     We    left    the     pub shortly after getting              in there we went            to a chip shop

                     There were at           least £^foot         officers     outside       the ground checking

                     tickets       and for driVk           etc.    I saw a couple        of stewards ar ou nd but                      they

                     entered. I did not see any of the                    larger gates       open or being        opened.

                     I cannot       recall any         Police Officers or Stewards                controlling the t u n n e i

■         f          a n ^ we     nac* ^ ree    passage along the           tunnel

                     When we       reached the end of the tunnel                 we went       right    xnto Pa^i 3.               I

                     have    indicated on the a tt ac h ed              plan where we         i\i i t ial ly ^s^ood up

                     against a barrier            this      being about E4»

                     As    the    terrace      filled up we decided to mov a^ fu rt he r                forward,       this

                     being       because    the   barriers were          quite    \jpn and we didn't want to get

                     crushed against            them   in any swaying .^and to get a better                    view.     We

                     mo ve d on to a point             that       I have yfdi catd on the a tt ached           plan this

                     being 87.           It was ^ a b o u t        2      pm (1445)      whe n we made        them move.               It

                     was    by now getting           quVte             but nothing       excessive.       It got mors
                                                                                                                        S32£jti

                 and more          crowded to such a stage that you                   c o u l d n ’t move.      I just

                 became aware             of people       getting     in trouble when         I saw a lad           in front       of

                 us,    h e ’d became all           red in the        face and was          screaming     out   for help.

                 3. w ould desribe           him as about          13~ 14 years      old?    dark hair,       and wearing

                 glasses.           1 c a n ’t remember his           clothing.       In all     the jostling and

                 m ov e m e n t    that started          I lost    track    of him    artddorr t know what happened

                 to him.          By now I ’d also          became    s e p a r a t e d ^ t ’om my friends w h o ’d

                 initially been standing w ith me.                         I cayfl d see them to my           left     but     I

                 c o u l d n ’t get       to them.

                 St anding         near    to the    lad w ith glasses         I remember       two girls           standing

                 together.           As the       crush    intensified one of the girls went                    pale and a

                 There       had been a slight             relaxat\iy6 n just     before      I saw that.            I did not

                 have     been      close    to    it.

                 I was able          to try and          climb fit    using    the side fence,          I was        grabbed by

                 a Police Officer and Stewajra and pulled up over                              the front        fence onto

                 Once     out      there    I saw                 and we sat together waiting                for-            ana

              As a result         of the     crush I received bruising Ho /\ y ribs and shoulders

              I have       not sought medical           treatment     for these in.nj ur i es

               I have      the following        views on the way the            incident was handled they

              are       that the Police       opened     the gate a ^ l h e       front    of the pen to let a

              few out        then shut      it a gain    a 1 1 h o u g \ \ / ' t here were still    people suffering

              inside.         They d i d n ’t lyrem t\p realise anyth in g was happening,                   they

              turned       round o c cas ififna.1 1 oy /to      ok at us but did nothing all                in all

              they were        too slow jtdyjlg^t         t/ the situation,

              1 cannot        unde rs ta nd why thip /:ick off w a s n ’t delayed                  if they knew there

              was       trouble   outside and why w e r e n ’t people            directed away from the

              centre sections             of the terracing.

              I would not be able             to describe any of the bodies                 I saw on the      pitch.

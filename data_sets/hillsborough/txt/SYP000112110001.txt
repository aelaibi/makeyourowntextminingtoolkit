T h e r e were a lot of            people    (maybe SO         in total)      asking     for    ’The

Sportsmart’ w h i c h         I did not know w h e r e          it was and there was a gradual

increase of          people       coming from the           g r o u n d side asking      if an y      pubs

taking     place w i t h supporters.               I thought            this was a public              order

that they had tickets and were                      demanding           entry.      These were kept back

and   it was      some m i n u t e ^ l ^ r l r M ^ h e n    people were          leaving        the ground,

                                 - 2 -



Our serials were responsible to Chief Insp Purdy.



From 11 15 am in position.



Noted Travellers Rest - closed

The Gate   Public House - OPEN (side door to locals only).

We were directing coaches down Claywheels Lane and during the

first few hours the crowds were steady.     They were making their

way to the ground and no trouble was seen.



There were a lot of people (maybe 20 in total) asking for 'The

Sportsman' which I did not know where it was and there was a

gradual increase of people coming from the ground side asking if

any pubs were open.   Some Liverpool fans did get into the Gate

Public House through the side doors (Door men on duty).



All who enquired were told most public houses were closed for the

day but those who enquired still made their way away from the

direction of the ground and up Penistone Road North.



The supporters train arrived at Wadsley Bridge at 1 50 pm (some

15-20 minutes earlier than expected).



About 800-1000 supporters who all made their way under separate

escort down Leppings Lane to the ground.     This crowd was orderly

and I saw no incidents at all.     Little singing - well behaved in
                                                                      £ f u o

general.



Traffic was now building up and it was noticed a lot of the

spectators were carrying drink.     The time now about 2 10 pm.

Some were drinking from ’4 packs' and others from large bottles.

Pedestrian traffic now was fairly heavy and a lot were sat on the

walls drinking before making their way to the ground.



At 2 15 pm approx. instructions received via radios to close

Leppings Lane to vehicular traffic - DONE



Coaches were still arriving but these were now parking on Halifax

Road as Claywheels Lane was full.     Very few cars.     Pedestrian

traffic now very heavy.



Obvious that some had no tickets as they were in a group asking

for tickets.



The general behaviour I would describe as good.        Some had

been/were drinking many were not.     By this time all making

towards the ground.



Could hear over the radio of problems at Leppings Lane end and at

a certain time, I believe after the match had started, an

instruction "all available officers to the ground".
                              - 4 -




My few serials were soon gathered together and we made our way to

Leppings Lane side of the ground.



On arrival could see a large group of police officers, and

argument taking place with supporters. I thought this was a

public order situation and I formed a cordon across the

turnstiles to keep the spectators away.   The turnstiles were

closed but people were arguing that they had tickets and were

demanding entry.   These were kept back and it was some minutes

later when people were leaving the ground, directing abuse to the

police, that I realised something else was drastically wrong.



By this time I had become detached from the serials under my

control.   I entered the ground itself behind the West Stand.     A

large number of people were injured, some were obviously dead.

Others were in a state of shock.    People were tending to the

injured.   After the initial shock I remember giving first aid to

a youth who had obvious internal injuries.



I cannot remember if the radio was working at this time - but I

do not recollect hearing any transmissions.



Together with another officer I moved the injured youth who was

conscious to the sterile area behind the West and South Stand.
I remember a doctor arriving and I said I wanted the injured

prioritising.    This he did.   I noticed another doctor certifying

the dead.



Initially the ambulances were slow.     They would find it difficult

getting through traffic and pedestrians.



One would arrive and the injured near the turnstiles would get on

- although they were not the more urgent cases.     This was

eventually overcome and with more ambulances now arriving all the

injured were removed.



The dead were then removed and the officer dealing with the dead

taken with it.

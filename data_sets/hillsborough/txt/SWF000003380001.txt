     Dear Mr Mackrell

     FA CHALLENGE CUP COMPETITION
     SEASON 1988 - 89
     SEMI-FINAL TIES
     SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989

     As is customary this time of the Season, I am writing to
     enquire whether your Club would be interested in staging
     an FA Challenge Cup Semi-Final Tie on Saturday 15 April
     1989 or a replay during the following mid-week.

    I would inform you that you may charge 10% of all gross
    gate receipts, less V.A.T., for the hire of the ground.
    I would also like to take this opportunity of clarifying
    the position with regard to Executive Boxes. For Boxes
    leased out for the season, we would require a payment equal
    to the number of seats at top ticket price, while in the
    case of Boxes hired out on the one-off basis for the match,
    your Club will be entitled to retain 50% with the rest
    being paid into match receipts. These amounts, however, should
    not be included in the gross gate receipts when calculating
    the fee for the hire of the ground.



    continued
                                   Registered Office: 16 Lancaster Gale, London W 23LW
                                   Incorporated in London Registration Number 77797
    In the event of your Club playing in a Semi-Final Tie, would
    you still be prepared to take the other Semi-Final Tie on
    your ground the same day, bearing in mind the administrative
    cost involved?

    Please indicate if your Club has the necessary insurance cover
    for matches of this nature. Clubs should also note the
    requirements of Challenge Cup Rule 26(b) whereby the two
    competing Clubs shall be entitled to 507o of the tickets for
    sale. The Association in its absolute discretion may vary these
    allocations.

    Details of spectator segregation should be provided together
    with details of the present ground capacity, number of seats
    and standing places also indicating if safety fencing is
    provided around the pitch.

    Clubs should also note that any special areas such as Executive
    Vice-President, family or any similar seated or standing area
    cannot be retained by the staging Club. All parts of the ground
    must be allocated entirely for the two competing Clubs with
    the exception of Directors Box, which will be controlled by thi
    Office.

    An early reply would be appreciated as the Challenge Cup
    Committee will be selecting the venues at their meeting to be
    held on Monday 20 March 1989 and it is essential for the
    above information to be prepared for the Committee prior to
    the meeting.

    Yours sincerely

 Further to our telephone conversation please find enclosed a copy of a letter
 and a drawing from the BBC Engineering Department regarding the location of a

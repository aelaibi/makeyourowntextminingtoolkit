BACKGROUND NOTE



Taken together, recommendations 1 and 4 of Lord Justice Taylor's

final report on the Hillsborough stadium disaster were that the

Secretary of State should ensure that spectators are admitted

only to seated accommodation at matches played at sports grounds

designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 by August

1999.     In paragraphs            85-90       of    his   report,     Taylor    considered

whether his recommendations on seating and standing should be

extended      to     sports    other          than    football at      sports       grounds

designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.                                  This

would extend the recommendations to rugby league, rugby union and

cricket       grounds       with        accommodation         for     more     than     10,000

spectators.          He    concluded          that     all    such    grounds       should    be

required      in due course to               be converted toall seating.



The Government's          interim            response      to the Taylor report on 29

January       1990    indicated           that       the     Government       accepted       the

recommendations in principle and expected to apply it in the case

of UEFA high risk matches, the 4 divisions of the Football league

and the national stadia as recommended.                        The response continued:



        The   application          of    a    recommendation          to    Scotland    and to

        other      sports     cannot          be     achieved       under     the     Football

        Spectators Act        1989 but the Government will                      in any case

        wish to discuss it with the sporting authorities concerned.

        Designated        sports        grounds       under     the    1975     Act    include

        cricket, rugby union and rugby league grounds which are not
*
           all enclosed grounds and which it may not be practicable to

           deal with in this way.



    Home Office officials have had discussions with representatives

    of both rugby union and rugby league.       Neither sport would wish

    to see all     seated accommodation,    which would require      primary

    legislation,    extended to them.     Most designated cricket ground

    are already all-seated.



    When Mr Pendry last enquired about this matter in May 1991 he was

    told   about   the   aforementioned   discussions   and   that   we   were

    awaiting the views of the Association of Chief Police Officers.



    We received a reply from ACPO in June agreeing that the all­

    seated requirements should not be extended to other sports.              A

    submission has since been made to Ministers who agreed that the

    requirement should be confined to football and could be announced

    by means of an arranged PQ.         Now that Mr Pendry has made hi§

    enquiry Parliamentary Section agree that this opportunity may be

    seized to make the announcement.

I am a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police.

On Saturday 15 April 1989 I was a member of the *F' Divisional

Support Group and was detailed for duty at the Sheffield

Wednesday Football Ground for the semi final match to be played

on that day.   My duties were with Serial number 20 which was a

reserve serial based at the ground.     My immediate supervisor was
Inspector Delaney.

At 11.15 am on that day I was on standby duty in the gymnasium
with my full unit.

At 2.00 pm I was with Inspector Delaney at the corner of the

Spion Kop and North Stand.   At this time I    could see that the

majority of Nottingham Forest fans     were in the ground but the

West Stand was virtually empty.     The West Stand terrace middle

section was half full of Liverpool fans, however there was still
plenty of room.   In the North Stand there were about four to

five hundred fans.   With Inspector Delaney I remained at this

location until about 2.40 pm.     By this time the Kop end was full

and the North Stand filling up.    The West Stand and terraces
were still half empty.

At 2.40 pm we received a message from match control to attend

Leppings Lane end where there was trouble at the turnstiles.        I

went over the air to see if my full unit was required.     The
reply was 'full unit.'

With Inspector Delaney, I gathered    the unit and wentvia the
rear of the North Stand to Gate A.

At this time the Liverpool fans were shouting and swearing and

some physically remonstrating with officers of my unit to get

more horses and officers outside the turnstiles.

I could see fans climbing over the gate walls to my left and

then helping others up.   These then jumped down into the open
area at the rear of the West Stand and terrace.

People were lifting children through the turnstile to the North
Stand and many were complaining of chest injuries.

Children, men and women were crying and shouting.    Nearly all

verbally attacked ourselves saying someone is going to get

killed outside if nothing is done.   A small woman dressed in

bright red, aged about 50 plus years started screaming and

shouting physically having a go at officers present inside and

myself.   She was pulled away by three men of similar ages.
A short time later she returned and started again.

I went over the air to request the assistance of Mounted

Officers to ease the crush outside. * (Was that actioned?)

We were trapped inside and could not get through to assist.

The gate had to be held by two stewards, they were having to

push up the top bolts as continuing pressure and shaking of it

loosened them.   It was similar for the bottom bolts.

This continued for some time and at one stage I thought the gate
was going to be forced again.

I went over the air and requested that Gate A be opened to save

life and limb, stating that if it was not opened someone would

 be killed.

A reply came back over the air to open the Gate A.       I am not

 sure but I think Superintendent Marshall gave me the authority
by radio.

Prior to opening the gate, I gathered my unit and made a single

file on the wall side, myself being nearest the gate.         I then

told another unit to do likewise on the turnstile side of the
gate.

I then ordered this gate to be opened, the steward at first

refused.      I explained my actions to him.   The steward then

shouted through the glass spy panels to the fans telling them he
was opening the gate.

I shouted to them to stop trying to force the gate as we were
going to open it.      The steward then showed them the key

demonstrating he was going to use it to open up.

The lock part was opened first then the top and bottom bolts.

Seconds before the opening I shouted to the two lines to steady
the fans down and try to stop any stampede.

On opening the gates there were shouts of relief and comments to

the effect that it should have been done earlier as they all had
tickets which they were waving in the air.

Together with one of my unit, I forced my way through this crowd
shouting at them to stop pushing and take their time.

After a few minutes I saw Inspector Sykes.      I informed him why I

had opened the gate.     By now there was only about 50-70 waiting
POLICE SERGEANT 1066 HIGGINS                               PAGE 4




to enter through this gate.

Inspector Sykes then shut this gate.   I remember talking to a

fan and he said its past three have they kicked off.   I did not
know.

A message was sent over the air to the effect all officers were

to go to the ground or pitch.   I cannot remember the actual
words.

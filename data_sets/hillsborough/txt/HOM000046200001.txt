       I write with reference to your letters of 30 July and 20 September 1996. I have also
spoken to your secretary about this matter.

        As I mentioned to your secretary, we have had considerable problems in discovering
where responsibility lies for taking forward the matters raised in your letters. I can confirm
that the Lord Chancellor’s Department has no responsibility for matters relating to the
security o f football stadia, and was not to my knowledge represented on the Hillsborough
Disaster Steering Group. Our difficulty in locating those responsible for the matter has been
exacerbated by the transfer of responsibility for the issue from the Home Office to the
Department of National Heritage in 1992. We are in touch with colleagues in each
department, however, and are attempting to track down the information for you.

        I am very sorry not to be able to be more helpful at this stage, and that it is taking such
a long time to provide the information. I am copying this letter to the correspondence sections
at the Home Office and the Department of National Heritage.

previously        regarding             the  provision of i nformation
fol l o w i n g their son's tragic death at Hillsborough.

Since         our last co r r e s p o n d e n c e  things                                                                                                        have changed

Aid.

Essential              to our case is to obt a i n a list of      the
names         of       the  people   who f ormed   the  Hillsborough

Therefore/ I hope you will not mind me writing to you

It is a b s o l u t e l y essential for me and my c o n s tituents

Dear Mr & Mrs Church,



Thank you for your letter o f 25 May to the Secretary o f State requesting a full list o f
the names and addresses o f the members o f the Hillsborough Steering Group. I have
been asked to reply.

T h e D epartm ent has no contact with, nor responsibility for, the Hillsborough
Steering C om m ittee, and consequently w e do not, unfortunately, hold the
information you require. Y ou will recall that w e have previously supplied Mr Joe
B en ton M P w ith a list o f the members o f the co-ordinating com m ittee, and this is
the only information w hich w e have. I can only suggest that you contact those
named on that list to request details o f all the other members o f the Steering Group.
Alternatively, since, as I understand it, your problem stems from difficulties you have
experienced w ith your legal representatives, you m ight wish to approach the Lord
Chancellor's Department, as the H om e Secretary suggested in his letter o f 3 O ctober
1994 to M r Benton.

I am sorry that I cannot send a more helpful reply.



                      Yours sincerely,

ba r    w h i c h wa s      in s o m e         hospital           ground,            which        wa s     about         a    twenty

minute        walk     from       the      stadium.               As    we      walked          to     this        bar,       and       back        from

it     I did    not       see     anyone         drinking              alcohol.              In the          bar        itself          were

about      fifty       of      us.        No    one       wa s    going         over        the      top.          We    were          in a g o o d

semi     final        m ood.         I had       three           or    f ou r     pint s        between            one       O'clock          (1300)

and     two    <1400).            As      we    made       our        way    to      the     ground          we     d id         not    receive

any     directions             from Police                officers,             we    did       in fact            know       the       way     to

th e    ground.           Police          were       about        on    street          corners            but      every          one       wa s    in

good     humour.            I saw         no    disorder              of a n y       sort,        no      f i gh t i i m / o r         anyone        I

would      s a y wa s       drunk.                                                                             /             c          ‘




We     arrived       at     the      en t ra nc e to             the    ground          a t about            £.30        pm       (1430)       and

started        queuing          in th e         street           outside          the       main       ga te s.          Police             officers

were     trying        to m a i n t a i n        these           queues.             T h e se     off i c e r s w e r e            an


ho r s e b a c k .     I heard            one    man ask              for    the      stands           and     he w a s          told        by a

mounted        officer          to     stand         in a        particular             queue.             I was         told          by a

mounted        officer          to     keep      in a       line.            It      seemed          as    though            there          were

three      separate            l i ne s    but       as    people           were      pushing             t h e y all         joined          into

the     crowd where             the       pushing          continued.                 I did          see     about           three          police

officers          near      th e    turnstiles                who    were       trying         to    push       people        back-,

trying       to      get    them        b ac k    into        lines,       at      t h is    time        1 d i d n ’t see          any

stewards.              I actually             knew       where       I had         to    get    into        the    ground          from,         so

1 had       no    difficulty             in      finding        my      entry       point,          the     difficulty             I did

have    was       getting          to    the      turnstiles.                  I was        queuing         for    about       20     to 2 3

minutes.             People        were       asking          other       fans      to      push     back,        g iv e     each     o t he r

room    but       I d i d n ’t see            anyone          distressed.



By    this       time      I fou        '           " " 'at the           s id e    of      this     queue        and      from where             1

stood       I could         see                          ate     slide         open.         I was         quite        a way      back

and    people          started                           ough       the     gate.           I followed            them.         At    that

t im e I                                                      and my       brother.             As       we w e n t     we    were

virtually            carried.            I did         just     want       to      get      into     the       ground        and

although          I could          have       gone       to a d i f f e r e n t          part       of    the     terracing           I made

my    way    towards          a nd down           t he    tunne1 .




Before       I actually             entered            the     ground          I remember            seeing        a     couple       of

young       f a ns     being       pulled         up     out    of      the     c r o w d at        the     turnstiles             o nt o      the

turnstile            roof,        they may          w el l     h av e     had      tickets          and were            pulled       up     to

the    roof       for      their        own      safety.




Having       got       through          the      gate     I                                         jns di r e c t i n g       anyone            to

any    other         part     of    the       terraces                                              » players           actually          on

the    p i t c h at        th e    end      of    the     tu                                        -yone      e ls e    I wanted           to

see    the       game.        I d i d n ’t see            any       police         or    stewards           in the         area      of     the

tunnel.           1 d i d n ’t see            any      disorder           or    unusual         incident           or      even anyone

drinking          at    t h is     time.




As    the    fans       went       down       the      tunnel        it w a s n ’t p a c k e d            at    that       time,      our

movement          was      quite        free.          I d o n ’t k n o w          if    I would          have     been able              to

      make       my way          out      it    I ’d h a v e          tri ed .         When      we    were       getting        towards           the

      end       of    the       tunnel         it    became           a bit       tighter          with      people        pushing          from

      behind.              I don't         js-rtow if          that     was       because          the      sloping        s e n s a t i o n at          the

      end       of    the       t > m n e 1 or       just        eager       fans.           I actually            made     my way          into         pen

      4 /and w e jf it          forward         about          six     f oo t     and     roughly           sideways        six       foot.          We,

                                       and      my     brother           started          to     get       pushed       sideways           more      and

      m or e ,       we    lost                      as    th e       crowd       became         more       dense.         Before          we     lost

      h i m we        were       by a      crush          barrier           and    because            he    suffers        from asthma,                  he

      w as      having          breathing            difficulties                 so    we      tried       to m o v e     him     but      because

      of       the    continual            build          up     of    the      c r o w d we       lost      him.




      After          we    1ost                      I found myself                    being       crushed         against         a barrier

       people         were       shouting            “push         back,        push      back."            Because        I was       having

      difficulty myself                        I wriggled              about       trying          get      away     from       the    barrier.

       I. f o u n d       myself       raised          off       the     ground,          my     knees       were       above      peoples

      heads.              I suppose            I wa s      panicking              as    we l l .       I could, h e a r          pe op l e

      screaming.                 People         continued              to    shout        "push        back"       as     they     did a ga p

      developed                and    I fell         to    the        ground.            i fell        on    something           soft.            I saw

      bodies          on the          g r o u n d all          I rec al l         is    the      s m el l    of    sweat.          I panicked

      and       called          my    brother.            He      must       have       heard         me,    saw m y       shirt       and        pulled

      r ii   e up,




      Before          1 fell          down     when        I ’d b e e n         pushed          sideways          and     was    against           the

      him      say        "I    ca n 't    take       anymore."                 After        t h at    I saw       him     slip       to    the

      ground,             he w a s     somewhere               by a g a p         between          barriers          on    the     same         step.

      I d i d n ’t see               him again.              He       was    on m y       right.            I wa s      facing        the       W e st

      stands.              When       I found         myself           raised          from     the        ground       I was      looking

      about.              I was       fearing         for       my     own and          other         peoples        safety.           T he      crowd

continued            to    push       forward.              I was       looking              about.           I s aw a m a n         not       far

from      me,    he       ha d    his     back       to a     barrier,              he was          b e nt     right       back      and       was

groaning,            he wa s        about       18 -        19 yrs       old.            I think          he wa s         wearing         a

denim         shirt       and     jeans.          It w a s        then       that        I fell          to    the    gr o u n d .




When my         brother           pulled        me     up    I found           myself            facing        the    pitch.             I told

my     brother        I was         going       forward,           he    said           no    because          cXthe         crushing.               I

w as    there        for     several        minutes           watching              p e o p l e j / T i rnb i n g o v e r         the     fences

to m y        front       and     left.         I could           see    police              officers          pushing         people

back.          I suppose            they     thought          it wa s          a    pitch          invasion.              In s e c o n d s

they      must       have        realised         something             wa s       far/more             seriously wrong                  and

started         to    lift        people        out.         Fan s,      Ponies              and    stewards          were        pulling

people         out.




Because         n o w we         know     it wa s       far       more       serious             and     so    did    other         fans       we

were      t r y i n g to         ral i e v e t h e p r e s s u r e f r o m t h e f r o n t                      f a n s w e r e rno v i n g

bac k .        I found           myself      at      the     wall       below           the      Wes^T s t a n d      where         there

were      a    couple        of     fans     with       their       hands           cupfyea         lifting          people         up    into

the     West     st a n d .         I was       pulled        into / h e            s js k n d     by    o t h e r f a ns.          I helped

fo r    about        10 m i n u t e s      to     pull       other/ p e o p l e              out    but       because        of     the

effort        and what            I'd     been       involved           in     I needed             s o me     rest.         1 went           with

my     brother        to    get       a   cup     of    t e a at        the        back       of    the       stands.         W h e n we        got

there         I saw       other       people         being        helped           by    police          and    stewards.                After

watching         for a           fe w m i n u t e s     we    went       back           into       the    stand and           watched and

waited.          We       eventually            left        the    ground           at       about       ten    past       f ou r    (1610)

to     contact        home.          We    were        allowed          by a        local          resident          to    use      their

       I would           consider            one     of       the      reasons       for    the       injuries       and     deaths

       occuring            was        the    opening           of      the    gate-



       After        the        match        wa s   stopped and                the j t f & y a r s c l e a r e d    the     pitch      it      just

             Hillsborough              football          ground.             As      we    approached              the       junction               of

             Leppings           Lane    and      Middlewood            Road          I noticed a                 lot    of      fans          stood

             outside           public     houses         drinking            alcohol            at    the        junction            a    couple          of

             men        came    down from          the     top      deck        of     the      bus     and asked               if       they       could

             get        off    because       they       had arranged                 to m e e t       so me       friends            on       the

             would        be a n      escort       at    the     ground           to      take       t he    supporters                  straight           to

Gutcher         again-refused,                  As we         arrived             opposite         the L e p p i n g s      Une

However,         Police           Sergeant          Gutcher            then       said,      ‘'Right      let       them    off."

The    supporters             alighted          from       the         bus    and       dispersed         into L e p p i n f s

lager     and Guinness.                   I made          comment            to m y      colleagues            regarding           the

situation.              We    then       proceeded            along          Vere Road           and     left       into    Penistone

assisting            someone          inside       a turnstile.                  I looked               through          the

turnstiles               and    saw    people          pushed       up    hard against                   them          obviously            in

         location?

4.        What did you see that      is in any way relevant tothe incident?

PC 1632 Smith - Attercliffe Police Station, Re Hillsborough 15.4.89




At    0800 Saturday 15 April           1989   I began my tour of duty at Attercliffe Police

Station,      Sheffield.      From there I proceeded to West Bar Police Station for a 9

o'clock briefing in relation to duties for the FA cup semi final.

At 10.00 a.m. as a member of serial 13 supervised by PS 840 Wright,                               I attended at

the Midland Railway Station and escorted Liverpool supporters from the platform

exit to waiting South Yorkshire Transport double deck buses.

At about 1.30 p.m. together with PC 2236 Brown and PS 2235 Gutcher                                   Iboarded a

PSV    full    of   Liverpool      supporters      and    proceeded       to   the    Hillsborough      football

ground.       As we approached the junction of Leppings Lane and Middlewood Road I

noticed       a lot    of   fans   stood    outside      public    houses      drinking      alcohol.    At   the

junction a couple of men came down from the top deck of the bus and asked if they

could get off because they had arranged to meet some friends on the corner.                                    PS

Gutcher refused and informed them they would have to wait until they got to the

ground.        I think believing there would be an escort at the ground to take the

supporters straight to the turnstiles.                     As we proceeded along Leppings Lane in

slow moving traffic,           the men again asked to get off the bus.                       PS Gutcher again

refused. As we arrived opposite the Leppings Lane gates of the ground I heard PS

Gutcher ask someone what we were doing with the supporters.                              I didn't see who he

was    talking too because I was making sure the supporters didn't get off of the

bus,    however,       PS   Gutcher    then    said,     "right     let    them      off."     The   supporters

alighted from the bus and dispersed into Leppings Lane, several went to the shop

next to the ground,           others walked away up Leppings Lane.                      I noticed that fans

were    everywhere      in Leppings        Lane,   sat on walls and generally milling about in

groups,    many were        drinking   lager and         beer.     I saw many of them carrying four

packs    of    lager    and   guiness.        I made      comment    to my      colleagues      regarding     the

situation.

We    then proceeded along Vere Road and left                     into North Penistone Road and back



                                                                                                                 6-5Z .
along to the police room.       Again I was aware of many supporters hanging about and

drinking beer and lager.        Many were leaning on cars in the car sales pitch on the

other side of the road.         I noticed many empty beer cans and bottles on people's

garden walls.

We    arrived at the police      room and awaited      further instructions,       we had a hot

drink and had been     there     quite some time when PS Wright directed us to go to

Leppings Lane.     There   didn't      appear   to be any urgency.        The   serial proceeded

along the back of the North Stand where there was a lot of smoke.                   We began to

investigate   the cause    of   the    smoke,   checking toilets   etc.     After a couple of

minutes I saw smoke coming from the open door of a small room on my left.                      I

looked inside and saw a civilian man stood next to a smoking area.                  On the floor

was a burnt cardboard pie tray and burnt pies.            I established that the situation

was    in hand and that    there      was   no danger and then proceeded towards Leppings

Lane.

On arrival we approached gate 'A'.            I was aware of screaming and shouting outside

and the gates were under considerable pressure.           PS Wright asked a man (I think a

steward) to open the gate, the man advised against it.               I also commented that if

he opened the gate we would all be crushed on an iron railing a short distance

behind us.    PS Wright started to walk along behind the first row of turnstiles No

1-16     where I saw PC John Friend assisting someone inside a turnstile.               I looked

through the turnstiles and saw people pushed up hard against them obviously in

great distress.     I saw Inspector John Bennett on the roof of the turnstiles with

two PC's helping people up the outside wall and over the roof into the ground.

I walked through the gate in the dividing wall and was approached by a man, woman

and child, a boy about 12 years.            The woman asked if there was any way they could

get to the front.     I directed her to look towards the tunnel behind her and said

something to the effect 'everyone wants to get to the front'.
The tunnel appeared to be three quarters full of supporters.                            I advised her to go

over to the far side of the right hand pen and go down the side fence under the

Police   Control    Box.          I    think   at   that    time   I   looked   at my    watch   and   it was

2.45 pm.   My attention was also drawn to several men stood to either side of the

tunnel entrance urinating against the wall.                        A stream of urine was running down

the concrete close to where we stood.                      I felt slightly embarrassed because I was

stood talking to a woman and it was a disgusting sight.                         At that point I remember

thinking where are          all       the police.     I saw three or four stewards stood at the

bottom of the stairwell but did not see any police.                        I then became aware that the

rest of the serial had gone apart from PC Brown.                         People seemed to be coming in

much faster than normal and from all directions.                         Many people had injuries, they

were   limping and hopping,' some had shoes missing and torn clothing,                             they were

very   abusive     towards    myself        and PC    Brown.       I   spoke    to some    of them,    it was

obvious that many of them had had quite a lot to drink.                         We went back through the

wall where it was much quieter, our serial was not there, many people were asking

directions and showing their tickets, asking how to get to various sections.                                I

kept   directing     them    to       see   a steward after a couple            of minutes we went       back

through the wall.

The gate directly in front of us (gate C) was open and people were coming through

it but it seemed to be a controlled flow.                     At that point we were approached by an

officer in a flat cap, possibly an Inspector or Chief Inspector, I think he had

come from outside.          He told me to go and open the other gate and suggested that

if I didn't someone was going to get killed.                           I ran around to the middle gate

(gate B) and saw two stewards and two older policemen.                            I told the stewards to

open the gate, one of the stewards replied "if you open this gate we'll all get

crushed in the stampede.                I can't take that responsibility."                I said "you don't

have to it's already been taken." I then proceeded to undo the large bolts on the
gates    and    try    to open    them.        I then became aware of PC Craighill pulling the

right hand gate.             At first the gate wouldn't open due to the pressure on them.

Eventually       they opened about            three feet,      people were    getting hurt as they got

forced through.          The gate then opened to about seven feet, there was an initial

burst    of about 70 or 80 people,                   perhaps    100 then they stopped altogether. The

crowd    appeared to have been held                  back.     I saw people still queuing         to go through

the    turnstiles.       Someone then shouted from behind us to shut the gate. We then

moved    back from the gate, as we did a youth spoke to PC Brown who looked at                             his

watch    and made a comment.                Then a group of policemen came running past from the

direction       of     the    North   Stand.     I    asked     one   what   was   happening,    he   replied

'fighting'.          We all made our way through the gate into the South Stand and onto

the pitch in front of the Leppings Lane terrace. The players were on the pitch, I

hear*«i an announcement over the PA system "Would all spectators please leave the

playing area."          I saw no fighting. I saw that some supporters were laying on the

grass,    some were shouting abuse at us.                     I then noticed a policeman just inside

the gate at the front right hand side of the left pen as viewed from the pitch.

He was knelt'over someone on the floor.                      I presumed someone had been arrested and

that whatever the incident was it was all over.

I then looked at the fence at the front of the middle pen.                           I saw a teenage girl

with her face pressed hard up against the fence, her hand close to her face.                                 I

said to PC Brown,             "she's dead,      she's dead Steve."           I looked at people next to

her, they were blue, some ashen and appeared unconscious or dead.                           I went to the

gate    to my    left     and    started      to help lifting people          out onto the pitch       .    In

between    carrying          people   out    I carried out mouth         to mouth whilst        other people

carried out cardiac massage. The only person I can remember being with me whilst

carrying       out    first aid was         PC 272 Foers       who did cardiac massage whilst I did

mouth    to mouth.           I can remember a civilian also assisting with cardiac massage
and   a police woman.     I think we tried this on about four people close to the

terrace.     I then assisted in pulling a teenage girl onto a make shift stretcher.

She was dead.     I carried her with supporters half way across the field and then

went back.     I helped carry a young man about 23 to the other side of the pitch

also on a make     shift stretcher.   When I got there it was apparent that he had

stopped breathing.      A young man with him was screaming for me to do something, I

started mouth    to mouth,   someone was doing cardiac massage, I noticed his chest

was very bruised

       He was obviously dead.

When I got back to the terrace all the victims appeared to have been removed from

the terrace.     I joined the cordon across the pitch until relieved.



                                                                           ^   /6 7 Z
along to the police room. Again I was aware of many supporters hanging about and

drinking beer and lager.                 Many were leaning bn cars in the car sales pitch on the

other side of the road.                  I noticed many empty beer cans and bottles on people's

garden walls.

We    arrived    at the       police room and awaited                further instructions,            we had a hot

Leppings Lane. There didn't appear to be any urgency.                            The serial proceeded along

the    back     of    the    North       Stand   where     there     was    a   lot    of    smoke.   We   began   to

investigate          the    cause   of    the    smoke,    checking        toilets    etc.    After    a couple     of

minutes I saw smoke coming from the                        open door        of a small room on my left.              I

looked inside and saw a                  civilian man stood next to a smoking area. On the floor

was a burnt cardboard pie tray and burnt pies.                             I established that the situation

was    in hand and that there was no danger                        and then proceeded towards Leppings

John    Friend        assisting      someone       inside     a    turnstile.          I     looked    through     the

turnstiles       and       saw   people     pushed       up   hard    against        them    obviously     in   great

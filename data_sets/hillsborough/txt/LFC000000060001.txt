                     X refer to your chat yesterday with Dave Chinn and enclose
                     herewith a copy of a statement given to the Inquiry by inspector
                     Gordon Sykes whom I understand it is intended to call on Monday
                     or Tuesday of next week. You will see that at Page 5 of the
                     statement it makes an allegation that he was told by Sheffield
                     Wednesday Football club gateroen that stewards from Liverpool
                     Football club were seeking admission to the ground by showing
                     their stewards' passes, and that the passes were subsequently
                     being taken outside for other people to use.

                      This is just the sort of allegation that may make the
                      newspaper, television and radio reports and X thought it only
                      fair that you should be given an opportunity to consider it in
                      advance. For the purposes of the Inquiry, the stewards come
                      under our remit as representatives of the fans and if you can
                      let me have any information with which to rebut the allegation,
                      or indeed an explanation for it, then 1 would   be happy to putit
                      to the Inquiry on the stewards' behalf.

                      If you feel there is any other information I can give you as to
                      the progress of the Inquiry generally, please   do not hesitate
                      to get in touch - my home number is-|

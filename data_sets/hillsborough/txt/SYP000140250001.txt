         I. Purpose of Meetin~

         The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th April
         and plan from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
         the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
         turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates in order to achieve
         segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the
         Hillsborough Stadium.

         2. Consideration of Proposals

              ~ed!in the
         o~hea~Fo!ice    i main , by comments
                       representatives  pointedthey

                                                    that made to the Club.~i~A~gne~0~,~i~
                                                         the proposals had been           ’

    ,~   times both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively ~
         for the use o£ visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
         at the Stadium made it necessary to allow for some element of use by
         home supporters as well.

         The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
         Police representatives, subject to:-

         (a)    additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
                and the wall of the inner access road;

          (b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral area or
                visiting supporters’ terrace) being divided in half by a new
                central radial fence running from the tunnel entrafice to the
                pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
                to be diverted to either half as appropriate (the proposed new
                secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing fence indicated
                on the plan to be abandoned);

          (c)   the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters’
                terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial fence
                running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
                fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral ared and
                home supporters - to have a second gate installed;

          (d)   the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
                installed - one in the neutral area and one in the home supporters
                area
/
    The County Fire Service saw no objeetion~in principle to the progosals,
    subject to more detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects,
    and the Building Authority similarly saw no objection, subject to
    submission of detailed plans and calculations under both the Safety of
    Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

    3. Action
    IT WAS AGREED:-
    (a) That R. Grimshaw should investigate as a matter of urgency the means
    of escape aspects of the proposals and let D. I. Vaughan know the
    outCOme,

    (b) That, subject to satisfactory clearance of these aspects by the
    County Fire Service, the outline proposals submitted by Messrs. gastwood
    & Partners be agreed as now amended by the suggestions of the South
    Yorkshire Police, also subject, of course, to the submission of the
    necessary detailed planb and calculations under both the Safety of Sports
    Grounds Act and Building Regulations.

    For the attention of Mr D Vaughan                                                                                       @
    Dear Mr Vaughan,
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
       SesTegatlon of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End                                                                  ¯
         The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team’s supporters
     as they enter the E~ound, and also to enable the police to control
     their exit at the end of a game.
         We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
     drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
     turnstiles (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
J
     and new gates.
         It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
     proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
     the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                           Yours sincerely,

                                  It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
                                  aid ~acilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim-
                                  basis on the understadding that the Club would provide pnrpose built
                                  replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

                               It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed require~ents are
                               still ontinuing, but it is £elt that the Club should be asked to glve
                               a fiEmindication when the new police and £irst aid facilities are’to

                 D.   I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

I.    Purpose of Meetin~

The purpdse of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 2nd September
and plans submitted by Messrs. Eastwood and Partners.on behalf of the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Clu~ Ltd. relating to the proposed erection
of Radial Barriers on the West Terrace for crowd control purposes and"
Security Gates at various locations around the North Stand now that the
Eymnasiumwas open to the general public.

2.   Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst there were drawbacks to the division of the terrace into
approximately three eqpal areas, each served by its own entrance, the
Working Party felt that increased control on the Terrace should result
                          J
from the proposals. For instance there could well be problems with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or the final exit
gates, but the police considered that ~ey could cope with any problems
of this nature.

The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed at the rear of
the radial barriers was also discussed, as well as the use of the
existing gates in the pitch perimeter security fence at the front of the
Terrace.
It was noted that the plans submitted did not indicate the amount of head-
room which would be available at the rear of the Terrace should the
radial barriers and gates be installed.
IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the proposals to instal
two 1680--, high radial barriers, with 1.15 metre wide gates at the rear,
on the West Terrace at the Hillsborough Stadium, subject to:-

         (i)"         the further calculations required by the Building
                      Authority being satisfactory;
         (ii)         confirmation that adequate headroom will be
                      available at the rear of the Terrace, and

         (iii)        the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being
                      under police control.
                               I




      Security Gates around North Stand
 .

Now that the gymnaslumwas open to the general public, the Club wished to
erec~ security gates a~ the top o~ ;the ramps at both ends of the North
Stand, with additional gates at ground floor level at the Peniscone Road
end of the Stand. A separate gate would also be placed behind the Wes~
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Leppin~ Lane.
These gates would.be fastened when the gymnasium only wes in use so as to
provide security for the rest of the ground. However, on match days they
would be secured in the fully open poslt£on to allow unrestricted access.
IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood and Partners
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection of security
gates around the North Stand, subject t@ the gates and/or their supports,"
hinges, etc not impinging on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being secured in the fully open position on match days.

4.    Police and First Aid Fac£1ities

It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first aid
facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim basls.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose bu£1t facilities in a similar
posfcion to the exlsc£ng timbered fac[llcies during the 1980 close
season. Whilst some progress had been made in discussing details of the
facilities, no firm indication had yet been given as to when they would
actually be provided.
IT WAS AGREED that Mr.. D. Vaughan should press the Club and/or its
Consultants for a firm indication as to when the new police andfirs~ ~ ~i~
aid facilities are to, be provided.

5.    Lottery Ticket Boxes
Attention was drawn to the blocked egress which could result if the
timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps were to
be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

 IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should draw the Club’s attention to the
 desirability of re-slting the lottery ticket boxes.

                          We have been instructed by the Club to organise the
              installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
              Leppings lane end of the ground.
                          It is intended that these fences are so positioned
               that they divide this section of the terrace into
               approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
               entrance.
                      By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
               should result. A visiting team with only a few followers
               will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
               retained by the home supporters.
                          Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
               accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers                                                                               ¯ "°

               dictate.
                      A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
               each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
               during a game. The gate could be left open, but fastened
               back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones

                                                                 Regis~tand - No, 1134531
          are accupied by supporters of the same team. When establishing
          the height we have considered that the views to the corner
          flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
          present by the perimeter fence. We therefore propose that the
          top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
          terrace.
                  This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
        _ but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
           Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James’s
J          Park, the home of Newcastle United.

               We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
          within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

            -- Also to be included in the same contract are some gates at
          various locations around the north stand. Now the gymnasium is
         ,open to the general public security
           must be maintained. It is proposed
           the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
           gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
           stand. A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
           prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
          Leppings Lane.

 For the attention of Mr. D. Vau~han

 Dear Mr, Vaughan,
                  Safety of Sports¯ Grounds Act,’ 1975
                  Sheffield Wednesda[ Football Club
     Thank you for your letter of 8 September. I am grateful
 to you for accepting our letter of 2 September as giving
 the formal 21 days notice under paragraph 5 (2) of the
 General Safety Certificate.
      Tenders have to be returned by 23 September and we shall
 be reporting to the club shortly thereafter. Normally the
 contractor would commence on site in not more than about two
 weeks from receipt of order.      Thus work is likely to begin
 in early October subject to there being no objection from the
 County Council.
      We may be wishing to place the formal order for the work
 on about 24 or 25 September so that if there is the likelihood
  of suggestions for major changes to our proposed scheme, I should
 be grateful if I could have notice by that time.

                                                                        Yours sincerely,

 For the’~ttention of Mr. D. Vaughan_

 DeW,Mr. Vaughan,

                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                 Radial Fences at LeppinKs Lane End
                       and Security Gates
       The work on the radial fences and security gates
 indicated on our drawings 3563/1-3 which we sent to you on
 2 September 1981, is now substantlally complete.
       Three first team home games have been played since the
 fences were erected. We have not heard any formal comments
 from the Working Party about the operatlon o~ the fences and
 their access gates but we understand that representatives ofthe
 South Yorkshire Police have inspected the work and they are
 satisfied with the new arrangements.
       To increase security it is proposed that pairs of gates
 are installed at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of
 the West Stand. Two copies of our drawing 3563/4 are enclosed
 showing details of the gates.


                                                                Yours sincerely.

            Purpose of Meetin~
 .

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on IOth February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive’s letter co the Club dated 1Oth January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on llth April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2.          Inspection of Stadium

 The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

 (a)       South Stand
 The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
 trusses referred to at the meeting on lOth February was queried but, in
 the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be g~ven.

 It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
 metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
 public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
 be provided.

     (b)     West Stand
  The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
  distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of the
  stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
  had been made good.
     As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
     the Club would round 0f£ the steel supports to the new emergency exit
     (nearest to the South Stand).

     Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
     considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand,
     An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
     when these had substance.

            Dear Sir,

                                                     Re: Hillsborough Disaster Inquests
            Thank you for your letter dated 21.11.90 and we confirm that we have no objection to the
            reproduction of 50 copies of page 86 from our A.Z Atlas of Sheffield, which were recently used in
            the Coroner’s Courl.

           Whilst wriling, we confirm that wc have no objection to the use of our mapping as and when
           required in conneclion with the above, as hmg as the correct acknowledgements as previously
           advlscd are shown on each reproduction.

           In view of the purpose for which the extracts are used, we have naturally decided to waive the
           ~ormal royalty payable to this C°ompany.

           Assuring you of our best attention at all times.

           Yours faithfully,

                 That this House calls upon Mr Jacques Georges, President of the Union of European
               Football Associations, either to withdraw forthwith his insensitive and inaccurate remarks
               regarding football supporters at Hillsborough, which are an affront to the people of the City
               of Liverpool at this tragic time, or to resign immediately.

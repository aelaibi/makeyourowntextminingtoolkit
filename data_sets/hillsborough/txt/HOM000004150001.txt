PART IV OF THE PUBLIC ORDER ACT 1986: EXCLUSION ORDERS



In your note of 10 July to .Miss Goose you asked for a paragraph on
attendance centre orders to go in the circular about exclusion
orders.  I attach a draft paragraph. The best place for it seems
to be after paragraph 5 of the draft circular attached to
Mr Goddard's note of 26 June to Mr Grant.

DRAFT   CIRCULAR     ON EXCLUSION     ORDERS




Add   new   paragraph    after   paragraph     5:

                                                      *


"Attendance Centre Orders


An exclusion order cannot be free-standing.         It must be coupled
with the sentence, probation order or order for absolute or
conditional discharge imposed for the offence.            An attendance
centre order may sometimes be the appropriate sentence to
accompany an exclusion order.       Attendance centre orders are
available for young people'aged 10 to 20 (inclusive) who have been
convicted of imprisonable offences.       They require the young people
to attend the      centre for 2 or 3 hours, normally on alternate
Saturdays, up      to a maximum of24 hours for those under 17 and 36
hours for those aged 17 to 20.       Programmes include physical
training and instruction in activities making constructive use of
leisure time.Junior centres, for those under 17,             are available
in most parts      of the country. Senior centres, for those aged 17
to 20, are available in the main centres of population."

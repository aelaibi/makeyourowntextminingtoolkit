Dear Colin,

Thank you for your recent letter and the minutes of your last meeting. I will of course be
more than happy to liaise with my Liverpool colleagues to see how I can best help with the
action that they are taking.

Please do not hesitate to contact me again in the future, and may I take this opportunity to
wish you an enjoyable Christmas break.




Yours sincerely,




Kate Hoey MP

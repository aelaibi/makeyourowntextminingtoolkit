Following a request made by the Chairman on 1st October, a joint report of
the Chief Executive and the County Treasurer was circulated to each Member
present showing the current position regarding accounts which had been
rendered to the five South Yorkshire Football Clubs in respect of charges
for police services.

Arrangements for payment had been agreed with three of the Clubs after
the service of writs but, as p r e v i o u s l y reported, the Sheffield United
Football Club were defending the Writ served on them. Requests for numerous
documents going back many years had now been met, and it was hoped that
the Hearing would take place December/January time. Notification had now
been received that the Rotherham United Football Club also intended to defend
the Writ served on them. The outstanding amounts related to both the
1982/83 and the 1983/84 seasons.

A& regards, the 1984/85 seas-on* none of the Clubs had paid the accounts
submitted to them to date and, in accordance with Minute 5.2 of 24th July,
1984, legal proceedings had been instituted.

At the request of Members, the Chief Executive reported on the types of cases
which had priority in High Court Hearings.  Ordinary claims for debt were well
down the priority list.

RESOLVED -

 1.     That the report regarding outstanding amounts from the 1982/83 and
 1983/84 seasons be noted.

 2.     That the officers be urged to act in accordance with Minute 5.2 of
 24th July, 1984, with all expediency as regards outstanding accounts for the
 1984/85 season.

                                       19 April 1989


Dear Sir


With three football pitches in our Borough,the one aspect of the
disaster which concerned some of us watching on TV,was what appeared
to be a total lack of 'Walkie Talkies' being used by the police at
the barriers on the pitch.

If this was in fact the position then they had no way of knowing that
thousands of fans were late in arriving and that the police had
opened the back gate.

We are raising this matter with our Police Consultative Committee to
make sure that Walkie Talkies are carried by the police,special police
and the stewards at all matches.


lours truly,
Lord Justice Taylor
Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry
Sheffield.

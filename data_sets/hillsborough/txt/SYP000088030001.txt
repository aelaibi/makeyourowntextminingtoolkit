                that there was a paediatric                   cardiac arrest          on     route to the hospital.

                their     radio       I became a ware that           something was happening at the

 I. t e l e p h o n e d the    canteen to get an y         casualty staff that were              there

back off their break                  in case their a s s i s t a n c e was    required.



 I returned to the                 resuscitation     room an d saw that a second            patient had

arrived.         There were a l r e a d y staff dealing wit h the first                   patient,       a

       resuscitation         room by the         porter                I d o n ’t know his surname,          and

       t   he   student   nurse to the         plaster         room.



       At this      point    I was a p p r o a c h e d fay charge N urse B ATTY who              inst r u c t e d me

       to go to the         'Dirty T h e a t r e ’ .     This     is a theatre used for the              less

       clean minor operations.



       Upo n arrival at the dirty theatre                       I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y half a dozen

       people who m       I w o u l d describe as walking wounded.                    I a c c o m p a n i e d them

       to an a rea known as the               returns      clinic and       left them there         because we

       required the         r e s u s c i t a t i o n points    in the D i r t y Theatre.



       I returned to dirty theatre an d saw that                         there were a l r e a d y two       (2)

       patients      on trolleys a l r e a d y there.

x'~»   trainers.




       I turned the         piatient onto his side and                 left him w i t h the student          nurse.

I then went          to the second         patient.      He was a white male,          approximately

2 0 years.          He had ginger         hair.   He was wear i n g a pair of jeans and

only had one training                 shoe on.    He w a s n ’t w e a r i n g a top.




Two other         patients         had been brought      into the    room but there was

n ursing      staff a l r e a d y w i t h them.       I a s s i s t e d wit h these    patients who

were     both conscious.



I was      joined by Dr Dof(ias HEAP

I had no further                 dealing w i t h these   patients    or any others.

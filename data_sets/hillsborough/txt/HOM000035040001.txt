MEMBER'S CONS CITtJENCY:                 KNOWSLEY NORTH                                (LAB)




ANSWER:    ATTORNEY GENERAL:             My jurisdiction concerning inquests

           is limited to the circumstances described in s.13 of

           the Coroners Act 1988*                    That provision enables me to

           appLy to», or give my authority for an application to,

           the High Court for an order that an inquest,                                or a

           fre^h inquest,           as the case may be,               is held into a

           perlson’s death.              The jurisdiction to make such an

           ordsr is expressly reserved to the High Court, and my

           rols         is    confined    to    deciding        whether     or       not   an

           application to the High Court should be made under

           that         section.         No    person      has    placed     before        me

           material which would justify an application being made

           to the High Court under s.13 of the Coroners Act 1988

           in irelation to the Hillsborough inquest.
                                                  BACKGROUND NOTE


     1   .     These tvro questions are likely to have been inspired by
               approached fco Mr Hammond^ on behalf of                                 the Hillsborough
               Family           Support          Group.             A    leading       figure     in     that
               organisation is Phillip Hammond whose 14 year old school
               boy son |was killed in the Hillsborough tragedy in April
                1989.               You wrote to him personally on 30 November 1990
               after           hs    had    petitioned          the      Home    Secretary       about    the
               decision              by    the     DPP       not    to     institute       any    criminal
               proceedings arising out of the Hillsborough disaster.


     2.        He     has       now       written       to    you       (dated    27   September       1991)
                inviting you to "overturn the verdict of the inquest held
                in relation to the Hillsborough tragedy” .                               That letter is
               at flag A.                  It has been acknowledged but a substantive
                reply avaits a contribution from the LCD as regards legal
                costs - please see the penultimate paragraph.                                    The letter
               was copied to, inter alios, Mr David Alton MP and Mr Peter
                Kilfoyle            Mp, who have both written asking for comments.
                Events have now been overtaken by the question tabled by Mr
                Howarth.;


      3.        The answer to the question by Mr Howarth is satisfactory
                provided            you are satisfied that nothing contained in Mr
                Hammond's             letter       of     the      27    September      1991      would     be
                sufficient to justify an application to the High Court to
                quash          tie verdict*               It seems         to me that       none of the
                matters raised by Mr Hammond go beyond decisions taken by
                the coroner in the ordinary course of the inquest with a
                view to Iensuring that the evidence was properly directed
                towards !relevant issues.                           Mr Hammond himself            seems     to
                acknowledge               that    the     verdict        was     legally     correct       and
                objects to it on moral grounds.                             As regards a suggestion

             of perjury by Mr Ollerenshaw,                    it does not follow that,
             because          there    were      different    recollections      as   to   the
             details of what occurred, one or other of the witnesses is
             guilty df perjury.


             The    terms       of    the   draft    answer do not        preclude    further
             consideration
                      I    if there is in due course presented to you a
             properljf reasoned case for an application to the High
                          i
                          i

             Court.            I have checked with the Home Office who have
             themselv es ifa^no o&urse to investigate the handling of the
             inquest by the coroner?      nothing has, however, come to
             their nctice to suggest that there were any irregularities
             which wduld justify an application for a fresh inquest.


             Draft replies in respect of Mr Hammond, Mr Alton MP and Mr
             Kilfoyle         MP     will   be    submitted   as   soon    as   we have    had
             comments from the LCD as regards costs.

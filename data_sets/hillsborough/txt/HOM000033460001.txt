NOTE FOR THE FILE

Tim King QC called in response to my letter about disclosure. He indicated his
general consent in principle to disclosure but he was concerned about the reference in
paragraph 18 that he did not believe another public inquiry would be a good idea. He
would not have expressed any opinion if he had known this would be disclosed and he
would prefer the reference to be deleted. He asked that we contact him again if we
were unable to agree to this.

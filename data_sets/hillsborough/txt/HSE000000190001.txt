      Notes fo llowing a one day seminar held bv th e I n s t i tu t i o n of Structural Engineers
      on the "Appraisal of Sports Groups" nn the 26th October iqfiQ

      The seminar was divided into 5 sessions -

     1.      Management of sports grounds
     2.     Crowd flow: Compartmentation and safety
     3.     Fire and f i r e safety
     4.     Appraisal in prac tic e
     5.     The Sports Council's view


     - and was mainly about the above d r a f t appraisal document which will                  be   revised
     in the l ig h t of comments raised during the seminar.


     The following notes are points which were raised during the seminar, dealing with
 issues t h a t are not c le a r ly d e a lt with in the present document. They could also
 have im plications for Health and Safety both at Sports grounds and at related
 le is u r e a c t i v i t y c entres.


 a)        The   in te r p r e t a ti o n of what is   acceptable is wildly in te rp rete d    by owners,
            regulatory a u th o r itie s (eg. police, f i r e service and local a u th o ritie s ) and
           appraising engineers across the country. An example was quoted th at in
           j u s t i c e Taylors interim report recommendation 8 says "where there are
           perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept f u lly open during
           the period when spectators are on the te r r a c e s " .           Yet     th is      clear
          recommendation         is being in te rp rete d d i f f e r e n t l y by d if f e r e n t clubs,
          sometimes gates are removed, others l e f t open and y et others shut but t h e i r
          locking bars l e f t o f f . I f such c le a r advice is so loosely in te rp rete d what
          chance is th ere fo r other advice th a t is le s s c le a r or allows some
          d is c r e tio n to be used?


          A plea was made fo r the various               a u th o r itie s to get   together and apply   a
          uniform standard.


b)        A view was expressed by            William Fox, President, Football           League, th at the
          problems of crows control stemmed from a                      lack of     supervision and th at
          another d i s a s t e r was j u s t around the corner.
w     i     xA
     c)     Jte wide range of a c t i v i t i e s & & could take place at a stadium,                  ranging
             from a t h l e t i c s (including a th l e t i c s for the disabled), f o o tb a ll, dog racing,
            pop concerns and re lig io u s f e s t i v a l s or gatherings.           The density of the
            crows being various fo r the d if f e r e n t kinds of event.


     d)     Experience at Wembley Stadium showed the need fo r a           number of medical
            centres to s t a f f major events, ie 7 doctors in attendance, one a surgeon, in
            5 small hospital u n i ts , when major events are staged.     At a pop c o n c e rt
            attended by 40,000 fans 2,500 needed medical a tte n tio n .


           In a d d it i o n ^ n example of the general in s tr u c tio n s , in d iv id ually formulated
           fo r each major event, was shown, with the comment th at a debriefing session
           was held within a week of the event.


    e)     Professor Cantor, a crowd psychologist from Surrey University commented th at
           i t was wrong to set safety standards, comfort standards should be the aim.
           By continually increasing the sa fety , or r e s t r i c t i v e element, then a s e l f
           d e stru ct cycle was set up. An example beingt a "destructive a c tiv ity " led to
           a "police a c tiv ity " which led         to a " f o r tr e s s mentality" and so back to a
            d estru ctiv e a c t i v it y " . Such   a locked-in Ss S e t y was very d i f f i c u l t to
           break.


          Where football fans were asked i f they wanted seating or te rra c e s in a new
          stand, they    voted for t e r r a c e s . This was put down to the s e l f selectio n of
          the type of person attending football matches created by the large drop in
          attendance of people with other a t t i t u d e s . A sim ilar vote taken        amongst
          ex-fans would show something very d i f f e r e n t.


          The "desirable"        conditions      should be put in place, not those to deal with
          d isasters.


f)        In assessing crowd capacity and movement, the appraisal should                    first    start
          with the ground positio n ie. the s itu a tio n and probable crowd movement
          outside the stadium.           Then the means of ingress and egress, try in g to
          understand the choices o f people make ra th e r than following the "ball
          bearing" approach, e sp e c ia lly downgrading fo r bottlenecks ( t h is piece of
          advice seems wrong, almost no matter            how low the crowd population when i t
          f i l l s an e x it route, a b o ttle neck will s t i l l cause a problem).
 Effective appraisal depends on             knowledge of how the ground works           and an
 understanding how people behave.


 (This requires experience of operating conditions, and e sp ec ially operating
 d i f f i c u l t i e s , to be logged and categorised, so th at there is a sound base on
 which the base preventative measures. Such logging must be done by the
 stewards and co llated by the ground owners in some form of systamised
 arrangement.)


 Safety is not what the spectators want, they are there for entertainment or,
 in the case of football fans, to see t h e i r team win.


 Reporting of f i r e , or the ringing of f i r e alarms, can r e s u lt in people
 wandering around. Fire i t s e l f while in i t s primary stage, could be regarded
 as e n te rta in in g and frien d ly . Much work needs to be done on how to motivate
 people to rapidly evacuate an area.


Small clubs or grounds shouldn't need the same provisions as a large ground.
Yet both require the same level of sa fety .


This comment also applies to the various a c t i v i t i e s th a t take place ie.
there is a difference between the problems associated with a football match
against those associated with a bowling match, yet spectators at each,
should be equally safe.


(This means th at a c la s s i f i c a t i o n system should apply, with d if f e r e n t
provisions required fo r d i f f e r e n t c l a s s i f i c a t i o n s . The numbers using an
event could vary depending on t h e i r lik e ly behaviour ie. th ere is a
d iffere n ce between a football match and a childrens a t h l e t i c match.)


Grounds in some overseas countries do not seem to generate the problems we
experience - th is could be re la te d to the s e l f d e stru ct cycle. Disneyworld
handles over 60,000 people d a ily , with no p o lice, or le a s t not in sig h t, and
with the appearance of minimum crowd presence.
 The following are my own general comments                  on the s itu a tio n   as I see     i t , in
 r e la tio n to sports grounds etc . . .


 1}    From the discussion and from my previous work, the whole s itu a tio n                 seems     a
       b it of a shambles.           I t is d i f f i c u l t to imagine why more people are          not
       k ille d or injured. An impression is given th a t we are constantly on                        the
       brink of f u rth e r d is a s te r s .


 m)   A c l a s s i f i c a t i o n system is required r e la tin g the safety level at one   type of
       ground to t h a t at a d if f e r e n t type.


 n)   Appraisal of a ground, i t s acceptable crowd density and                 population, should

      focused on the bottom lin e of the accident t r ia n g l e as a means of reducing

                          Comments on Crowd Behaviour from
                          Professor David Canter
                          University of Surrey




    LACK OF RESEARCH

    1. Despite the distressing regularity of major inquiries into aspects of crowd safety and
    control throughout this century there has been remarkably little systematic, scientific
    -tudy of crowds and how to control them effectively. What knowledge does exist tends
    to be ad hoc personal experience of police officers.

    2. The few studies that have been carried out tend to have focused on limited issues in
    haste for major inquiries, (e.g. the work of Scicon following the Ibrox Disaster Inquiry,
    the work of Canter et al for the Popplewell Inquiry).

    3. Clearly, then, a significant issue is to encourage the support of wide ranging studies
    of crowd behaviour by competent behavioural scientists.


    WHAT IS KNOWN

    4. Such studies can build upon the following areas in which there is some systematic
    knowledge.

           a)    Flow rates can be predicted in general terms.

           b)    Basic maximum capacities can be established as a consequence of
                 assumptions about flow rates, but the densities used as calculations are for
                 extreme circumstances not for the normal conditions.

          c)     Although often ignored, there is a general understanding of the difficulties
                 that disabled people experience in crowds and how to design for these
                 people.

          d)     There is some preliminary understanding of how to communicate with
                 large crowds and of the processes that are likely to make crowds difficult
                 to control.

^     MATTERS REQUIRING URGENT CONSIDERATION

      5. Differentia] Ingress and Egress

      Current calculations usually take the capacity divided by exit unit widths in order to
      calculate crowd flows. This assumes people divide themselves evenly between available
      exits or entrances. They do not.

      6. Differential Densities

      Variations in crowd density are likely to be a natural product of various sociol-
      psychological processes. This should be planned for in capacity calculations and crowd
      management procedures.

    / C. Crowd Characteristics
    m.
      The large differences between types of crowd needs to be systematised and allowed for,
       overtly, in management and planning. This will have direct implications for flow rates
      and densities.

      8. Waiting Times

      The Scicon study on crowd waiting in enclosed areas and possible turbulence, is by
      their own admission ambiguous and flawed. Yet it guides many regulations. The
      control of slow moving, static or waiting crowds needs urgent analysis.

      9. Communication with Crowds

      A set of Clear guidelines on the most effective way to communicate with crowds under
      various circumstances need to be established. This should not be left to "common
      sense" and the personal style of the person who happens to be near a microphone, for
      example. Who should communicate, when, where and how all needs to be set down
      for varying circumstances.

      10. Information Systems

      The maintenance of consistency across all forms of communication and signposting is
      already indicated in your interim recommendations (e.g. recommendation nos. 22, 23
      and 24). What is involved in establishing a comprehensive consistency now needs to
      be elaborated.

      11. Training for Crowd Management

      Procedures need to be established as to the best ways to train police, club management,
      stewards etc to recognise and act on appropriate crowd cues. I have already had police
      forces in touch with me asking for help for example, in relation to recommendation 6,
      in recognition of crowd densities and dynamics.



                                                 2
 12- Public Expectations a n d Attitudes

 As considered m our book "Football in its Place", which has been sent to you, a focal
 lwue is the expectations that members of a crowd have about a public event. The role
 of the police and club management in this are crucial. At present most actions support
 a fortress attitude with expectations of anti-social behaviour. If there is not to be a
 need for another inquiry in a few year's time this attitudinaVeducational issue must be
 addressed directly.

    HILLSBOROUGH

    Your minute of 2 6 September and your minute to Mr P G Jones
    dated 19 September.

    I suggest that Dr Nicholson (DD/SEL1) joins the working group
    that you propose and I would be grateful if you would contact
    him directly concerning arrangements for the pre-meeting in
    mid-October.

    A separate development that I discussed today with
    SPD D 3 , is that Dr Nicholson is to sit on a small technical
    working party on the Guide to Safety of Sports Grounds.    This
    working party has been convened by Lord Justice Taylor as part
    of the Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry Part II.     (The terms of
    reference of the Working Party are attached.)

    In addition to what you propose in your draft terms of
    reference, the HSE Working Group will usefully provide Dr
    Nicholson with information from other parts of HSE relevant to
    the Taylor Technical Working Party.  Unfortunately, however,
    Lord Justice Taylor's Working Party has arranged to meet on 18
    October and as an interim measure, and after consultation with
    TD, I have arranged for Dr Nicholson to be briefed for this
    first meeting by representatives of TD, the Entertainments NIG
    and, in your absence,             has also agreed to join the
    meeting.

    Subsequent meetings of the Taylor Working Party are arranged for
    the 2, 7 and 28 November.

HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY


1.   I have had a phone call from Mr Alan Jones in RLSD about HSE
giving further technical advice to the Hillsborough Enquiry.  Dr
Nicholson has accepted an invitation from Lord Justice Taylor to
join a small technical working party "To review technical aspects
of the Guide to Safety in Sports Grounds, identify areas needing
clarification and recommend accordingly".  The first meeting of
this group is on 18th October, followed by meetings on the 2na,
7th and 28th of November.
2.   You will remember from Dr Derrick's minute of 19 September to
Phil Jones which suggested setting up an Overcrowding Working
Party that one of its tasks would be to co-ordinate HSE s response
to any revision of the "Green Guide".    However, it will not meet
of a few weeks yet and Alan Jones was   anxious that initial
briefing for Dr Nicholson should include a "policy input . ±
explained that our policy was not yet   fully f o r m e d but agreed to
attended a meeting in Sheffield on Thursday or Friday this week (I
have to go there anyway for a YTS Health and Safety Working
Group).
3.   If you anything particular you wish me to put to Dr
Nicholson please could you let me know.

HILLSBOROUGH AND RESEARCH INTO CROWD SAFETY
1.    Thank you fo r your memo of 25 September 1989. I think what is proposed is a
sen sib le way forward. Accordingly APAU will pursue t h i s matter no f u rth e r until
we hear from you about the arrangements you are seeking to agree with the Home
Office.

2.   In the event of a j o i n t Home Office/HSE p ro jec t being mounted APAU will be
happy to co ntribute something about the management control aspects.

3.   APAU will also be pleased to f i e l d a rep resen tativ e on the proposed working
party on crowd safety outlined in Dr Derrick’s memo of 19 September.

4.   I have w ritten to Sheffield City Council to advise them t h a t we will be
taking no f u r th e r action with regard to t h e i r l e t t e r of 21 June fo r the time
being. They understand the reasons fo r t h i s (having had i t explained informally)
and accept them.

A copy of my l e t t e r is attached.

Dear Mr Rice

SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS CENTRAL APPROACH
Further to your l e t t e r of 21 June 1989 and subsequent discussions between

sa fety in sports grounds.

The s itu a tio n can be   reviewed again following the fin al report of the
Hillsborough inquiry       and reso lu tio n of any legal issues which may emerge. At
th a t stage i t may be    sensible to consider a ra th e r wider in v e s tig a tio n into the

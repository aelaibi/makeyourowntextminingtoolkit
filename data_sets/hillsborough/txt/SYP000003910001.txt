           I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police presently

           stationed at Attercliffe Police Station, Sheffield.

           On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489?    I was on duty at Attercliffe

           Police Station.    My tour of duty was from 6 am (0600) to 6 pm (1800?

           and my duties were that of Sub-Divi^ronal response car driver.           My

           observer on that day was               I^          '

           About 2.30 pm <1430) that day              and myself were within

           Attercliffe Police Station on a refreshment break and I was aware of

           crowd problems at Hillsborough football stadium where a football

           match was taking place between Liverpool football club and Nottingham

           Forest football club.

           At 3.40 pm (1540) that day we resumed patrol and were immediately              '

           directed by Force Operations room to Hillsborough Stadium.
                                                                 PAGE    2
                                                                 S 391

We arrived at Hillsborough at 3.45 pm <1545) where I saw Penistone Rd

was heavily congested with pedestrians, but mainly fmergency service

vehicles and various personnel from such vehicles.

We entered the access gate to the stadium towards the police room and

gymnasium past the entrance to the pitch.   A large number of police

officers were attending prostrate bodies, many of which were dead.

On one occasion I saw a Police Officer physically dragging a senior

ambulanceman away from his vehicle shouting, 'He’s still alive, he's

still alive, he's breathing, honest.'

       and myself continued to the gymnasium and were obliged to step

over a number of dead bodies.

Inside the gymnasium I spoke to Superintendent Bates who directed us

to gather as many Police Officers as possible who were not gainfully

employed at that time with a view to one Police Officer taking

custody of one dead body.

We returned outside on the soccer pitch.    Separately I informed

approximately 10 Police Officers to consult with Superintendent Bates

in the gymnasium.

At 3.55 pm <1555) I returned into the gymnasium where I took

possession of the following described corpse.

Male r white, 5*10 tall, 25 to 28 yrs of age, short dark hair, average

  lid, wearing a Flintstones Tee Shirt, blue jeans,        underpants

and white socks.    The deceased had 3 match programmes.   1 Liverpool

end ticket with the stubb missing, f£4.54 cash, broken black

wristwatch, 2 gold coloured chains and wedding ring.




The deceased body was positioned at the furthest part of the gym from
                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                         S391

            the entrance laying on its back with a white sheet over it.                This

            body was one of a number of others in a makeshift mortuary.                The body

            had no obviou|» signs of injury, however the clothing was dishevelled

             nd there y€re no shoes.      The Doay
                                              bo^dy was vervj*far

               3»5     &   (1558) Dr Redgrove examined the deceased and certified

               e*irxtinct.    I searched the body for any identification without

            gain.     The property was placed into a bag and the deceased was placed

            into a green body bag and numbered body number 10.             The body was

            placed into line with other bodies.

            A Polaroid photograph was obtained of the deceased and the bag was

            eventually sealed.     The total number of bodies laid out eventually

            numbered 94 and were laid out awaiting formal           identification.

            I was approached by Police Constable                         of 81 Sub-Division

            who identified the body to me as being a body ne naa remo ved from the

            Kop end of the ground and had attempted to revive.            He transported

            the deceased to the makeshift mortuary before returning to the pitch

            area.

            At 3.15 am (0315) Sunday 16th April 1989 <160489) the deceased was
                                       zr/tf'l (0 boikf fQ

                             then interviewed Mark Brown.      The property\^as handed to

              Further to my previous statement dated 30 April 1989 (300489)                                  in which

              I described my involvement with Body 10? David Steven BROWN.                                             ■>
                                                                                     ---------------


              In that statement I stated that the body was identified to me at

              3.15 am (0315) Sunday 16th April                       1989 (160489),     I have been informed

              that the time on the GEN 18 for that identification is 2.15 am (0215)

              and this is confirmed by the brother of the deceased who made that

              identification and must therefore be correct.



              I also stated that the body was identified to me as Andrew Steven

              BROWN of an address in Wrexham.                        Again the GEN 18 and other documents

              show this to be incorrect,                 the deceased name being David Steven BROWN

              and the man making the identification was Andrew BROWN.
                                                                             PAGE     2
                                                                             339 1B



         It is clear that in the confusion of that night I have mixed up times

         and name and my original statement was incorrect in those details.



         To clarify matters at 2.15 am (0215) on Sunday 16th April    1989

         (160489), Body 10 was ident if ied to me as David Steven BROWN

         (29.9.63.)    (29091963) and he was identified to me by his brother

         Andrew Mark BROWN.

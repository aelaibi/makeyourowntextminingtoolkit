            Dear Mr & Mrs Hicks

             CHIEF CONSTABLE MR PETER WRIGHT

             I have noted the contents of your letter of 7 February 1990 which you
             have sent to Mr Johnston in respect of your complaint against Mr Wright.

             The question of whether your allegation is construed as a complaint and
             by whom it will be investigated, is a matter for the South Yorkshire
             Police Authority.  I, therefore, await the outcome of their
             considerations and any directions or requests they make of the West
             Midlands Police.

             Thank you for letting me have sight of the correspondence.

             Yours sincerely

fao:- K.C.Johnston- Clerk & Financial Officer.            7th February 1990


Dear Mr. Johnston,

re: Chief Constable Mr. Peter Wright.

I wish to file a complaint against M r . Wright.
I would   ask  you to   cause  this    to be    recorded and, in view of his
forthcoming "retirement", request urgent attention to its resolution.

Despite "setting aside" the  national press  on the  basis that   they are
reporting second  hand, I consider his   actions and  comments during the
interview with the "Sheffield Star" of the 5th  instant to  be at   best a
breach of  his privileged position and   at worst a deliberate attempt to
divert the cause of justice.

As some comments can be considered as being actions designed to influence
the outcome   of  the  Coroners  Inquest,  I have   copied this letter to
Dr.Popper at the Medico-Legal Centre for his attention.

Similarily, a copy will be forwarded to the West Midlands Police
Investigation Team and because of Mr.Wrights rank, The Police Complaints
Authority.

My specific complaints are as follows

   1) Mr.  Wright is guilty of abuse of the privilege of his position in
   suggesting to the media he was  aware that  information would  come to
   light in the Inquest,that would present "a different picture".

   He infers this relates to drink and or its effects.
   Assuming Mr.Wright  has seen such "evidence" it is"confidential" until
   deemed otherwise by H.M.Coroner and should remain that  way. Clearly a
   breach of priviledge.

   2)By  suggesting  that  this   "puts    a different complexion on the end
   product" he prejudges the verdict    of   the  Coroner.  This  is clearly
   outside his authority and    insults the    juristiction of the coroner's
   office.

   3)1 believe  that his pronouncements could prejudice Inquest Jurors,
   who will  of course  be drawn from the  area covered by the newpaper
   cited.
  4)He goes on to infer that Lord Justice Taylor was not aware of all of
  the facts and "that there is  a lot   of information   that has  not yet
  come out."  He has  therefore, by   his own admission, failed to do his
  job. If he is aware of  information that   is material   to Lord Justice
  Taylor's conclusions he should have ensured it was placed before him.

  5) If, as Mr.Wright   claims,   this   material  relates  to  drink then
  presumably it is additional to that contained in the summary document
  produced by  Professor Usher   for Justice   Taylor ( the one withdrawn
  from circulation) and to the post    mortem reports,-  in which  case we
  shall be  asking our  lawyers to obtain details of it and to establish
  why this was with-held from us.

  6) If,       as  I suspect,   this   is merely   the   same   information, then
  Mr.Wright        is well   aware   that this   has   been   available  for many
  m o n t h s .Clearly it cannot be "new" or "additional"to that considered by
  Taylor.
  Under these circumstances        his actions constitute a deliberate attempt
  to mislead- an offence under the discipline code or worse.

  7)Mr.Wright claims to accept   the findings  of The  Taylor Report, and
  even calls it "a superb document".
  Yet he persists in claiming the primary conclusion is wrong. That is
  as clear an example of "double   standards" as  one could  ever see and
  serves to underline questions regarding what his motives are.


It  is my   complaint   that  in making these claims now and publicly Mr.
Wright has committed a disgraceful act.  That this  act is quite clearly
not what  should be   expected from a Chief Officer, that it could effect
the Inquest's impartiality and finally it appears to be a blatant attempt
to distort the course of justice.

As  stated  earlier,in    view  of  Mr.  Wrights  rank  and the time cycles
involved I have forwarded a copy of this       letter (and the article) -to
Captain  Taylor  at   The   Police Complaints Authority for their immediate
attention and action.

I appreciate that the normal  protocols  will  need  to be   observed but
suggest that the 1st May deadline leaves little time for delay.

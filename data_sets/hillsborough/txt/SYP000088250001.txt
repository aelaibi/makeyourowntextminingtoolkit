                                                   a work mate and

                                 I d o n ’t know     the street number,

                ve known Tommy Howard for            a couple of years.    On match day we          all

              iet up      at the coach park at Shopping City, Runcorn                at 9.15      am.     W

              off at      9.15 am we Stopped a few times to pick people up at             Widness and


v>            Speke.     It was a lovely sunny day, everyone was          in a   good mood, all

              of my party turned up in time for the coach at Shopping City, Runcorn.

              The coach drove direct to Sheffield,            via Snake Pass, we were not

              stopped and searched en route by the Police.              Myself and the other 6

              in my party got off the coach at the Bass Brewery ia^She f fi el d.                   r



              We arrived at the club about           12.30 pm to 1 pm a nd all seven of us


     &        went    inside.   At S.20 pm Tommy Howard and his son left LKe club for

              the football ground.           I knew/that they had tickets    !Z7t    the Leppings

              Lane end of the ground, a^nd Tommy wanted to get            in early to get a good

              viewing area for      his son.       It is about a 15 minute walk to

              Hillsborough from the club we           were in.   During the time wewere in the

              club,    our party was seated around a table having a general              talk.     It

              was all very light hearted and we were all             in a confids-rrt mood as

              regards the outcome of the game.

              As Tom and his son left,         I said ta ra, see you later and they left

              together,    we all   knew we would pick the coach up again,            orthe car

              park of the Bass      Club I never      saw Tom or his s.oj?r again.

              I got into the ground about 2.45 pm a nd took up my position it was

              very busy.

              I remember someone climbing over the fence at the l/eppings Lane

     VC       terrace,    onto the pitch, shortly a ft e^r kick off I thought

              pitch invasion.       When I saw people being
                                                                                        it was a

             thought they had fainted until          I saw a policeman put his coat over a

             lad, at that time I realised someone had died,          I never even thought

             about rny son          was    in that section of the terrace and only         later

             learned that he wasn't directly behind the goal but was in section

             number 2.

             I remained in the stand a mates          lad of 11 years old.    After they

             announced the game was abandoned, around 4 o ’clock we lefV^lhe ground

             and returned to our coach on the Bass Club car park .

            People were already at the coach by the time I got there,               including my

             son,             All of our party returned to the coach, with the

             exception of Tommy Howard and his son.          The coach left

             for Liverpoo 1 after a delay and I got home at 8.30 pm.

             On the following Sunday morning         I learned that Tommy btefward and his

             son had both died as a direct result of the football disaster at

            Hi 1Isborough.On the way home to Liverpool area,          even though both of

             their seats were empty,       1 never   even thought that Tommy and his son

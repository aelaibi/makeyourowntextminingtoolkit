became separated.               She was      hanging on to my         leather           jacket       but someone

came be tw ee n us         in the     crush and she e nded up hanging                        on to me       round

this    lad.     His      right arm was        resting on the top of                                head a nd         I

a s k e d him to move          it several     times as        it was a dd in g          to

d iscomfort.         He    couldn't m ove       it,    the    crush was         so     intense.         In fact,

he kept       saying      sorry he     couldn't move          it.    At this          point we were about

six or eight         people       from the front         fence and______ s t ar te d to cry.                          I

tried to       reassure        her a nd kept     telling        her to “iT^jg on,              hang o n . ”           Her

face was       pushed up tight a gainst               s o m e b o d y ’s back a na        I n ot ic ed her

obviously       impossible.           P eo pl e were hung        over a barrier               to my     left and

I remember       feeling        the   concrete      of this      barrier.            S o me o ne    said,

"Whatever you do,              don't get     near     the b ar ri er ."     By this            time ______ had

passed out and she s ta r t e d to go down and                      I was       just      pleading w i t h the

             The    crush of       people      in such a confined space                caused the deaths and

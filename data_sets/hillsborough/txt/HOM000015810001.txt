for the attention of Mr Metcalf


Dear Sirs

i^^LS BOROUGH ENQUIRY

Your letter of 18 July refers.

I am writing to confirm my telephone conversation this morning with Mr
Metcalf.   First, as regards the Hillsborough Stadium itself, I would
inform you that, as control of the ground (including the Leppings Lane
terracing) has reverted to the Club, the Inquiry no longer has any
locus and any question of access to the ground will be a matter
exclusively for the Club.

As regards the barrier, this is still in the custody of the Health and
Safety Executive in Sheffield (whilst of course remaining the property
of the Club).    I would confirm that, provided the Club's consent is
forthcoming, there is no objection on the part of the Inquiry to any
reasonable examination of the barrier being carried out by an engineer
nominated by yourselves.  This is of course subject to the proviso that
this is examination only (i.e. the state or condition of the barrier
must not in any way be altered) and that the examination of the barrier
takes place in the presence of Health and Safety personnel.

In order to arrange a mutually convenient date for inspection, I would
invite you to contact Dr C. Nicholson, Deputy Director of the Health
and Safety Executive, at Broad Lane, Sheffield S3 7HQ (Tel: 0742
768141 ) .

                                                  Yours faithfully




                                                        D BRUMMELL
                                     Assistant Treasury Solicitor

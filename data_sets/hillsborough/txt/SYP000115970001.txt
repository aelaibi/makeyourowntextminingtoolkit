                    P o l i c e S t a t i o n at Rotherham.

                    At the time          of the FA Cup Semi Final                    w h i c h was    played    in 1988 between

                    the above         two    teams      I was also s t a t i o n e d at R o t h e r h a m and was

                         tailed to work at              the m a t c h   in a serial             containing     other members           of

                    Prior     to the game start i n g             I was      engaged        in duties       outside     the ground

                    in company w i t h PC Beardsall,                    at   the L e p p i n g s Lane turnstile,               the end

                    in w h i c h L i v e r p o o l    fans were to be admitted.

                    Up until 2 . 3 0 p m        (1430)      the   crowd,      a l t h o u g h great      in numbers,       entered

                    the ground          in an o r d e r l y well        b e h a v e d manner. There were               one or two

           successfully entered                  the ground w i t h o u t       tickets,      by either       climbing

           turnstiles         or the        perimeter wall.

          By    pushing       our w a y       into the       pen we were able          to stand at         the   rear of

           the stand,        albeit         for only five m i n u t e s where            upon the sheer          number

           of s u p p o r t e r s   caused us to be pinned up a g a i n s t                  the    rear of the     pen.

          We then a g a i n f o r c e d our w a y out of the                     pen a n d   into the y ard on the

                           1988   F.A Cup SEMI FINAL

                          LIVERPOOL V NOTTINGHAM FOREST

                             / y V / ^
lam Police Constable; 2528 Hughes, presently stationed at Main Street Police Station
at Rotherham.
At the time of the F.A Cup semi final which was played in 1988 between the above two
teams I was also stationed at Rotherham and was detailed to work at the matchin a serial
containing other members of my shift and Sgt Cable as the sergeant in charge.

Prior to the game starting I was engaged in duties outside the ground in company with
PC Beardsall, at the Leppins Lane turnstile, the end in which Liverpool fans were to be
admitted.
Up untill 2 .30 pm the crowd, although great in numbers, entered the ground in an orderly
well behaved manner. There were one or two occasions when a Liverpool supporter tried
to jump the turnstile' and at least one when a supporter attempted to climb the wall of the
perimeter.

After 2 .30 pm however a large influx of supporters on foot and in coaches caused the area
around Leppins Lane to be severely congested with the follow on effect that the previous
good order of queuing went out of the window with the vast majority of supporters trying
to push there way into the turnstiles.
During the following *+5 minutes a number of Liverpool supporters successfully entered the
ground without tickets, by either climbing turnstiles or the perimeter wall.

When the majority of supporters had entered the ground PC Beardsall and myself were
directed to Police the pens 3 & ^ of Leppins Lane.
By pushing our way into the pen v;e were able to stand at the rear of the stand, alb&it
for only five minutes wfcere upon the sheer number of supporters caused us to be pinned
up against the rear of the pen.
We then again forced our way out of the pen and into the yard on the opposite side of
the tunnel which leads to pens 3 7 *+•

I have no knowledge of any gates being opened during the game but I am aware that during
the match the tunnel was extremely crowded with several supporters unable to even get
into the front past the gates.

tND OF R E P O R T
Alexander Hughes PC 2528 C1 Sub division.
Further to my report dated 5 th June 1989 I wish to add a few further comments
and to clarify certain previous ones*
In relation to the first question I do'nt believe that mounted officers assisted
in easing the element of crushing which occurred outside the turnstiles at the
Leppins lane end. It appeared that the horses when being surrounded only agitated
the crowd by pushing and jostling them.

The crushing prblem remained for a period of approximately 45 minutes, between
2.30pm and 3 *15p®» and although at the time it appeared a severe crash, it in no
way resembled this years scenes, in fact the 1988 semi finals crashing problem
I would say was an extremely minor one of which might have occured at many football
grounds during the season
I believe that to many officers not from Sheffield, who were not accustomed to working
large sporting events the problem appeared alot worse than it actually was.

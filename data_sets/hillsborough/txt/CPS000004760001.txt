                   Hillsborough: Interview of Suot Murray.

          Thank you for your letter of 19t!i: June.
       I have tried to reach you a couple of times so as to
  advise by telephone, but with no s u c c e s s , so I thought I would
  let you have my views by letter.
        If Supt Murray elects not to be interviewed in
  conjunction with the use of the 1988 video film, the
  investigating officers have two options, namelyi
               (1) they accept tha£ position and interview him
               without showing him the 1988 video, but questioning
               him nonetheless on the 1988 semi-final, as his role
               in that has been understood by them; or
               (2) they do not interview him at all.
       Obviously (1) is to be preferred, but it is a matter for
  the officers1 discretion.
          I hope this deals with the difficulty adequately.


     Yours sincerely,.

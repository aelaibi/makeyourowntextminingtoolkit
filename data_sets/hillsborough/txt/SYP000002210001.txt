          r e t u r n e d to the           ground at about           1.50pm.          On    route     I saw a number                    of

          other        s u p porters        consuming         alcohol      from     cans     but they were           causing no

          W h e n we a rr i v e d at           the     t u rnstiles     there was a            lot of        people around

          went      to thevLi-olet and                 then decided         to ta-ke up our               position       to watch

          the     game.         To    get to our m at c h viewing                 f^ant we went             through       the

          tunnel        h owever        this was         right    by the        toilets      and a p p e a r e d to be the

          we     deci d e d     to move                 two friends         started         to move        towards       the        front

          of Pen 3 to             climb over           into Pen 2.          I saw                   climb over       the           fence

and    into Pen 2.           At     this     time                  there was          no way                     I        could move forward

 r backwards          due to        the     sheer           volume        of    people. Some                           how          I managed           to

move    side wards and              reach the dividing                     fence.         I was unable                                at this

stage    to    climb over           the fence and                 infact a s s i s t e d a young                                    lad to get

the    railways and          I used his knee                      to    climb the fence                            into the                pen.

When    I looked back             into     the        pen X had just                left through and                                      I could

see    that    people were          being        crushed.                We    both    looked to see                                  if we

could see               and saw him              crushed agai n s t                 the     side                   fence we                could

We a t t e m p t e d to pull        him free              but tj^j^lheer weight                                 of the               crush

we    could only w at ch as all                  signs            of    life    disappeared.

We    then went       back    to help                       [and this          time we were                           sjfc\essful                in

pulling       him out.        We made        sure            that.              i,<a s a 1 r i g h t a rid t\i is

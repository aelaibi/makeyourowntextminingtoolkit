            On Saturday 15 April           1989 <150489)      I went to the S emi F inal between

            Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the Hillsborough Football G round at

            Sheffield,.       I arrived at the turnstiles at around H pm (1400) at the


 m          Leppings Lane end and went straight

            way to my seat in the North Stand-
                                                               in bought a programme and made my

                                                               I was about half way up in the

            stand around level with the penalty area



            I saw the players come out onto the pitch for the kick around before

            the match started,          I also looked at the Leppings Lane terraces and

            saw that the two outside pens were not full and you could see spaces

            but the two centre pens were really full                  I then saw people coming over

            the perimeter fences behind the goal.                   I then noticed a youth in a

            green jumper on the path behind the goal posts staggering about and
                                                                                        PAGE     S
                                                                                        S37E6

         appeared to    be drunk-      A Policeman wearing a helmet ran up to the

         youth swung    his arm around and 1 am not certain whether he punched              or

         pushed the youth     who then fell to the ground.



         I do not know what happened afterwaras to the youth or the Policeman

         who I cannot describe because of the large number of people who ware

         then coming onto the pitch*



         I do not wish to complain about the P o l i c e m a n r fcut just   wish to inform

         you of what   I witnessed at the t i m e 0

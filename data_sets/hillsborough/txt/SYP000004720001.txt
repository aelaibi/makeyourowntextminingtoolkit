Both men had           come      to view     the      p h otograph        gall e r y for a y o u t h who            had

his mates         had since        returned        home.      They had        viewed       the    p hotographs

and thought          the youth       in question was                the    body     I was a t t a c h e d     to

doing      so,    were    unable     to    identify          the    body,,    Initially          they were

adamant.         They had a p p a r e n t l y      before      coming        to    the ground,          con t a c t e d

then    checked they            body a gain but             found      no scar,, Wit h these men                    I went,

to another         area a d j a c e n t      to     the gym where           there was          access        to

discrepancy         in d e s c r i p t i o n was       colour        of hai r which Mr McBr ien

claimed was         fair arm          I was        certain      of dark       ginger,,

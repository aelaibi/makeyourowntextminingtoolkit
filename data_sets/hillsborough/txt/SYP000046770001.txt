            Dear Inspector Layton,

            re: Derrick Godwin deceased

            I understand from Mr and Mrs Godwin who spoke to you recently at the
            Inquest in'respect of their Son, that we will be able to obtain a Video
            Recording of the Inquest Proceedings in respect of our particular case. I
            should be glad if you could - when your duties permit - let me have details
            of how I can go about obtaining this and what the cost will be since my
            Clients would like to have a copy both for my own and their purposes.



            Yours sincerely,




            C A LEIGHTON DAVIS

                Hillsborough Svadium disaster were not entitled tc compensation,

                Fred Broughton, national Chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: “We
                are disappointed that the Law Lords have ignored the proven negligence o f South Yorkshire
                Police and the light o f emergency scrvicc members to pursue claims for psychological trauma
                against their employers.”

                Accepting the j jdgeraent, he added: “This was an important point o f principle which we were
                duty hound to pursue.”

                M r Broughton again sent his sympathies to the families o f those who lost loved ones in the
                tragedy and pointed out that nothing in this ruling affects the relatives’ Tights to claim
                compensation tcom South Yorkshire Police.

                NOTE TO EDITORS

                * The Police Federation will not be commenting further

                * Over 1,000 police officere were on duty at Hillsborough on 15 April, 1989- Only 37 claims
     Pr e s s




                have been acti\ ely pursued. Officers have not climbed on the ‘bandwagon’ as has been
                suggested.

                 * Many o f the officers have lost their livelihoods as a result o f suffering psychological trauma
                 including flasboacks, which resulted in an officer being placed sick this year - nine years after
                 he witnessed th e tragedy.

                 * This year the Law Commission recognised the rights of police officers and other members
                 of the emergen jy services to receive compensation in cases involving psychiatric illness.

                 * Police officers have only been entitled to protection under health and safety legislation
                 from 1 July thi.5 year. Their only previous redress was from legal action.

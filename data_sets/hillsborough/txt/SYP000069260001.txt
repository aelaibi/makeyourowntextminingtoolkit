 hey were        carrying and did so myself.

At about        1420 hours        on that day         I was    i nf ormed that a f h a d                    broken

d ep lo y ed near     to Vere Road.

On arrival        all was       quiet and       I saw some        of my serj^rf'^had made                         ts

and were        taking    their     prisoners         to tj>er Pol ic e Room.       S er ge an t Proctor

then depioyed^frie to one                gf, the    gates.     To get     to this    gate       1 had to

force myself        through        the    crowd of supporters.             I saw that          eleme nt s        of

were    to ajtlow the          gates     to be open on inst ru ct io ns            from the m o un t ed

sect io n and then         close       them.    This was       to a ll e vi a te   pressure       on the

turnstiles.

S oo n after      I a r ri ve d    outside      the    gate    it was     opened    to a l l o w me         to get

to my    position on the other                 side.      I then saw a young         girl was         being

forced against           the    gates     because      of the     pressure       of the    crowd.       I

managed    to get her           passed along          the gate     unj>3r"l      could    reach her and

pull    her to safety.            She was      in the      rej^fon of 11-14 years old. Soon

Supporters        rushed       in thrp-ugh the         gate and were           causing    pie    people          near

did not appear able               to move.      I was aware        of    pushing a g ai ns t      the       crowd

 saw     people      climbing       overt on e       turnstile wall           in to the ground.               The

I pressure w h i c h was        very severe,              inside    this      s e ct i c m was    s ud de nly

 alleviated.          I then saw that              the    c on ce rt in a    gajtff-s were o p e n . These

 gates       lead beh^r^K the West S t a n d .

 The a r e a outside          these     gates        became     clear       of supporters.           A short        time
                                          S'

 where       I turned       right and entered the                ground.        We had been          informed that

 fans    had    invaded the          pitch.        When     I got into        the gr ou nd       I saw a great

 then    saw another          officer        run towards         enc lo su re      "I where      the    small       gate

 it was       not    possible       to enter         this    enc lo su re without ma ki ng              some    space.

X then helped to             pass    unconcious          bodies across            this fence,       at one       time

I a t t e m p t e d to give a rtificial              re sp ir at io n      to one male       perspon but

because       of the      crowd of people            stepping       on myself        anil the body         it was

not    really       possible,       so    I passed him across               the    side   fence also.        1

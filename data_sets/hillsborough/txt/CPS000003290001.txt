 HOME AFFAIRS SELECT COMMITTEE ENQUIRY INTO POLICING FOOTBALL
 HOOLIGANISM

 We spoke today about this Home Affairs Select Committee
 enquiry.  I now enclose a copy of the letter from the Clerk in
 which he asked the Home Office for a memorandum, and a copy of
 the Committee's press release.

 As I explained, we currently envisage the Home Office
 memorandum comprising a number of sections along the following
 lines:

        Introduction

        Practicalities (no of games a season, no of police
        officers, costs etc)

        Relevant Legislation

        Taylor report

        Policing domestic games

        Policing games involving foreign teams

        World Cup 1990

        Press coverage
  We stall try as far as we can to confine our memorandum to the
  subject of the enquiry, policing of football hooliganism. But
  because safety and order are inter-dependent it is difficult
  to draw clear lines.
   We are in touch with the Department of Environment (among
   others) over the content of our Memorandum.  They have general
   responsibility of sport and have played a part in making plans
   for the World Cup and for English teams' re-admission to
   Europe next year. We would therefore expect them to want to


S 363
contribute something on their role and their contacts with the
national football authorities (the League and the FA) which
they use to help secure arrangements which reduce football
hooliganism.

My purpose in writing to you is to see if the Crown
Prosecution Service would also like to contribute to the
Memorandum.  It seems to me that the Service may have views
which should be incorporated.   I would envisage these being
free-standing and possibly included as a subsection in the
section on relevant legislation. You will wish to decide what
you want to include but you may care to point to any general
problems which the Service sees in the prosecution of football
hooligans and highlight good and bad practice by the Service
(and perhaps the police too?). You may also have something to
say about the effectiveness, quality, and ways to improve
video (or other) evidence.   It would also be interesting to
know if there is any anecdotal (or other) evidence of the
use/effectiveness of Home Office circular no 62/1988 which
encouraged arrangements to be made to allow the swift
prosecution of people who were involved in sudden outbreaks of
hooliganism.   (This was aimed generally at the perpetrators of
"rural disorder" but could also apply to football hooligans).

I have spoken with one of the clerks to the select committee
who was perfectly content for any CPS contribution to be
included in the Home Office's memorandum.  Timing, I am afraid
is tight. We must be in a position to put a final draft to
the Home Secretary on 17 September and intend to circulate a
nearly final version on 5 September.  If you were able to
supply something by 31 August that would be very much
appreciated.

I am on leave from 16 August to 2 September.  I would be very
happy to discuss any of this with you before the 16th.
Thereafter Sue Jago is ready to help.

The Home Affairs Committee has decided to inquire into Policing
Football Hooliganism.   I attach a press notice which has been
issued~to^ay'v—

We should be grateful if you could submit a Memorandum of written
evidence. This may contain any material you think appropriate,
but among the issues the Committee will be addressing are:-


        current police powers and methods of policing football

        co-operation    between   the   police             and     the      football
        authorities

        the consequencesfor policing of the      re-admission                          of
        English clubs into European competitions

        co-operation between British and foreign police forces,
        particularly the Italian police before and during the World
        Cup

        the    adequacy of existing offences under the Public                     Order
        Act    1986 and the Football Spectators Act 1989

        the relationship between football hooliganism and                          other
        forms of hooliganism
      the effectiveness of current sentencing practice and the
      adequacy of penalties

      procedures for the storage and exchange of information-
      relating to offenders

  ~   press coverage of football violence

  -   the implementation of the Taylor Report's recommendations
      in so far as they affect policing.

It will be helpful if your Memorandum includes a summary of
your evidence.

To keep to our schedule, it is vital that we receive your
evidence no later than Friday, 28 September. We would
envisage printing most of the evidence which we receive, and
then commencing oral evidence sessions in November.   The
Committee would hope to report by Christmas.

It is likely that the Committee will wish to take oral
evidence from your representatives. This will probably take
place on Wednesday , 28 November at 4.15 pm in the House of
Commons.  Please let me know as soon as possible if this is
not convenient.

         POLICING FOOTBALL HOOLIGANISM
The Home Affairs Committee announced today that it is to
undertake an inquiry into the policing of football hooliganism
during the Autumn.   It will examine the extent of co-operation
between British and European police forces in the light of the
World Cup and the re-admission of English clubs into the European
club competitions.

Among the other issues that the Committee will be considering
are:

     *   the adequacy of offences and penalties under existing
         legislation

     *   the impact of the Taylor report on policing

     *   press coverage of football hooliganism

Written evidence will be invited from the Home Office, the
police, magistrates, the football authorities, the press, clubs
and supporters as well as from other interested organisations.

Oral evidence is likely to be heard from witnesses representing
the Home Office, the police, the footbaM. authorities and
football supporters.

A Report will be published before the end of the year.

          Thank you for copying to me your letter of 4 April to Goddard of F8 Division.
          We also had an opportunity to speak concerning Recommendation 71(2) before you
          wrote your letter.

          I think that the views expressed in your letter are extrem ely helpful. Like you I
          suspect that a single o ffen ce of the kind recommended by Mr. Justice Popplewell
          w ill o v e r c o m e many o f t h e p r a c t i c a l d i f f i c u l t i e s th a t you h a v e i d e n t if i e d .
          Doubtless the Home Secretary will be writing to members o f H C om m ittee, and
          the Attorney, formally at some stagehand I have no doubt that the Attorney will
          be interested to see the contribution which is being made by the CPS to the
          evolution of the proposals.

HILLSBOROUGH : LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S REPORT

I refer to your minute of 9th March 1990.

I attach a note which I have prepared for Graham Duff regarding
the proposed new offences. I have discussed it with him and he
is generally in agreement with the views expressed.




John Legg
Head of Field Operations
28th March 1990
Mr. Duff,


THE HILLSBOROUGH     STADIUM   DISASTER   : LORD    JUSTICE
TAYLOR'S REPORT

In formulating this response I have had the benefit of
considering views expressed by the following

     E. C. Woodcock (CCP) and C. Davies (SCP Central
     Branch) - Merseyside Area

     T. M. McGowran (CCP) - West Midlands Area

     D. W. Adams (BCP) - Leeds Branch, West Yorkshire
     Area


A.   Touting   Offences        (Recommendation     70   and
     paragraphs 273-2791

1.   The Problem
     I agree with Taylor L J's recommendation that a
     specific offence of touting should be created for
     the following reasons:

     (i)    The presence of touts acts as an incentive
             for supporters who do not have tickets to
             travel to grounds in the hope of being able
             to purchase tickets from touts near the
             stadia.

     (ii) As a result of the unauthorised sale of
           tickets it is not possible to ensure proper
           segregation of supporters, which in itself
           can lead to crowd disorder particularly if
           away supporters find themselves amongst
           rival supporters.


2.   Existing Law
     There is no satisfactory means at present for
     dealing with what is a quite lawful activity.
     Arresting for obstruction, assuming the tout is
     stationary, is only relevant if the activity is
     taking place on a highway and would not therefore
     be appropriate if it occurred in a public house
     or on waste ground near the stadium. There is no
     doubt that obstruction of the highway can
     successfully be used, as was illustrated in
     Cooper v Metropolitan Police Comr (1985) 82 Cr
     App Rep 238 (where a tout approached groups of
     pedestrians on four occasions and on each of
     those occasions the free passage of people using
     the highway was obstructed to an extent that
     members of the public passing were forced to step
     into the roadway) it being held that it was such
     an unreasonable use of the highway as to amount
to an obstruction. The use of this provision,
however, is somewhat technical, is not understood
by the public in general, does not reflect the
seriousness of the activity itself and is liable
to give rise to contested hearings and arguments
as to the extent of the unreasonable user.    The
tactic of arresting on suspicion of possessing
false tickets is speculative and dangerous. The
Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act
1982 Schedule 4, when adopted by the District
Council, creates offences of street trading
without  a   licence.     Enforcement   of  these
provisions would depend on the use of the power
of arrest to prevent an unlawful obstruction of
the highway under Section 25(d)(v) PACE 1984 and
is subject to the same objection referred to
above. I consider that if this problem is to be
tackled in a concerted way, then a specific
offence should be introduced which is clearly
understood by all concerned.


Offence of Selling Tickets for and on the Day of
a Football Match Without Authority from the Home
Club
Of the options the first is the best although it
does have its drawbacks.   As with the other two
options, it could cause problems of policing
because what is now an overt activity will
probably    become  one   conducted   much   more
discreetly.     It would, however, be, easily
understood and relatively easy to prove.      The
offence should, in my view, be drawn in terms of
"to sell or offer or expose for sale" as there
may be difficulty in proving an actual sale
without the co-operation of the purchaser.      I
would also suggest that there be a provision
similar to that in Section 196 Licensing Act 1964
that "evidence that a transaction in the nature
of a sale took place shall be evidence of the
sale without proof that money passed". I would
also suggest that the offence be committed unless
there is written authority from an officer of the
home club.    A power of arrest for the offence
coupled with the power to seize tickets will be
needed.

The most serious drawback is that the offence is
widely drawn and would have the effect of making
criminal any private sale on the match day
between friends or relatives.     It is unlikely
that these would be detected and, even if they
were a prosecution would       not normally be
justified in such cases.    However, there is a
danger of bringing the       criminal  law  into
disrepute. There is no obvious way of limiting
                          3   .
     its scope. A requirement of "with a view to
     profit" would cause considerable difficulty of
     proof, as there would be no evidence of the
     amount spent by the tout in acquiring the
     tickets. Limiting the offence to a public place
     could     fairly  readily   be    circumvented.
     Legislation would have to be advanced in the
     House on the basis that we would not prosecute
     everyone;   this would be a significant and
     dangerous innovation.


4.   Prohibition of Sales Within a Specified Radius of
     the Ground on Match Davs
     The main object of a touting offence is to
     discourage the attendance of supporters at stadia
     unless they are already in possession of tickets.
     The creation of 'an exclusion area' would not
     avoid this. One could well imagine touts simply
     moving from close to the stadia to outside the
     exclusion area, but still selling tickets and
     creating problems at railway stations or other
     locations. This would still lead to problems of
     segregation of supporters and from a police point
     of view would be difficult to enforce.


5.   Sales of Tickets at More Than Face Value
     Initially,   this  proposal has    a number    of
     attractive features, but I agree with Taylor L
     J's suggestion that it would be the most
     difficult to prove.     A successful prosecution
     would probably require a witness willing to state
     that he was offered a ticket at above the face
     value.   Realistically it must be open to doubt
     that many supporters who have travelled to
     matches in the hope of getting tickets from touts
     would give evidence against the offenders. Also,
     it is likely to be the away supporters who are
     seeking to purchase tickets and, if they are to
     be expected to give evidence for the prosecution,
     they may have to travel considerable distances to
     attend court. Again, the proposal would not deal
     with the problem of segregation.


6    Resource Implications
     It   is difficult to     estimate the    resource
     implications for CPS of the introduction of this
     new offence. There have been very few all ticket
     matches in the West Midlands and, it is believed,
     few if any prosecutions of touts for obstruction
     or other offences.      There is apparently no
     problem at Leeds, but this could change if Leeds
     United reach the First Division.     Likewise, in
     Merseyside there does not appear to be any
widespread use of the offence of obstruction to
deal with ticket touts at Anfield or Goodison
Park. It is likely that touting would be driven
underground and reduced as a result with a
consequent    reduction   in   the    number   of
troublemakers and other offences. A likely
consequence is that touts may transfer their
activities to selling tickets in the area of the
visiting club prior to the day of the match,
which would reduce the numbers travelling but not
assist with segregation. Alternatively visiting
supporters may travel on the day before the match
and seek to acquire their tickets then.      This
may, however, only be feasible for a limited
number of supporters and may well reduce the
profit margins of the touts.     I doubt whether
there would be a very significant number of
prosecutions and these may well be balanced by
reductions in other offences.


Offences In The Ground   (Recommendation 71 and
paras 289-301)

Throwing Missiles
As Taylor L J states, there can be no possible
reason to throw a missile of any sort at a
football ground.   The potential for injury or
serious disorder is clear for all to see.      I
agree that this should be made a separate
offence. Again it would be capable of easy proof
and would not face the potential difficulties
associated with Section 4 or Section 5 Public
Order Act 1986 offences, with their additional
requirements.

I foresee few difficulties in proof apart from
that of identification of individuals in a large
crowd,   which   may  be   assisted   by   modern
technology.    It would merely be necessary to
prove that the individual defendant had thrown
the object.   There is already a precedent for a
separate such offence within Section 28 Town
Police Clauses Act 1847 in which is an offence
wantonly to discharge any firearm, or throw or
discharge any stone or other missile, or make any
bonfire, or throw or set fire to any firework in
a street, which is extended to include, by virtue
of Section 81 Public Health Acts Amendment Acts
1907, any place of public resort or recreation
ground belonging to or under the control of a
local authority.   Consideration should be given
to including some of the other acts referred to
above, particularly relating to fireworks, in the
new offence. Consideration should also be given
to providing a specific power of arrest.
The offence under Section 5 Public Order Act 1986
is used successfully in appropriate cases for
dealing with the throwing of missiles. However,
it does not deal with the throwing of a missile
in all circumstances, having regard to the
additional   elements  of that    offence;     in
particular the proximity or otherwise of players
or other spectators will be relevant. Similarly,
Section 5 can be used, but again there can be
difficulties in establishing that it was within
the hearing or sight of a person likely thereby
to be caused harassment, alarm or distress.    It
is far more satisfactory to have an easily
provable offence which everyone understands.


Chanting Obscene or Racialist Abuse
I do not believe that the existing offences under
the Public Order Act adequately cover the
situation. From a practical point of view, with
segregation of fans, it is difficult to argue
realistically that the chants are used towards
another person with intent to cause him to
believe that immediate unlawful violence will be
used against him etc in terms of the Section 4
offence; the chanter and the person chanted at
may   be  at   opposite   ends  of  the   ground.
Similarly, for a Section 5 offence, as Taylor L
J states, the words used or gestures made may
simply cause disgust. Further the offence under
Section 18 of the 1986 Act for stirring up racial
hatred is not a practical proposition - there
have been very few prosecutions overall for this
offence.

If it is felt that obscene and racialist remarks
are to be prohibited, then a separate offence
would be the best way forward. It would need to
be drawn sufficiently widely to include conduct
and mere "sounds".     I have in mind here the
highly offensive and racist ape-like noises that
are made by surprisingly large numbers of
supporters   when  a   coloured  player   is  in
possession of the ball. Obviously there will be
difficulties   in identifying wrongdoers,    but
provided the evidence is available, convictions
could be expected.


Pitch Invasions
Now that a number of grounds have removed the
fencing which surrounds pitches and others have
lowered the height of fences, it is important to
prevent invasions of the pitch which can lead to
a sustained invasion by rival supporters and the
potential for public disorder.
                          6   .
     At present, if one or two supporters run on to
     the pitch with no intent to cause trouble, it is
     difficult to bring the conduct within the Public
     Order Act or within a common law breach of the
     peace.   I would favour a separate offence of
     going on to a pitch without a reasonable excuse
     which would act as a deterrent to such invasions.
     Obviously if a defendant had a good reason for
     going on to the pitch, this could be used as a
     defence.   I foresee few difficulties in proof,
     other than the need to rebut on occasions the
     defence that it was necessary because of pressure
     or hostility from the crowd behind.


4.   Overall Offence/Separate Offences
     Donald Adams favoured the suggestion made by Mr.
     Justice Popplewell in his earlier report that
     consideration should be given to creating an
     offence of disorderly conduct at a sports ground.
     He points out that prior to the reorganisation of
     the Metropolitan Councils, there was a bye-law
     against "disorderly conduct" which was often
     used, proved most useful and its loss has been
     regretted. I do consider, however, that it would
     be desirable to have as much certainty as
     possible,  both from the point of view of
     deterrence and ease of proof, and I would favour
     separate offences as suggested by Taylor L J.


5.   The Scope of Offences
     It will, of course, be a significant departure if
     conduct is to be made criminal at one sport and
     not others. Perhaps for this reason the offences
     should be made applicable to all sporting
     occasions designated by the Minister, with only
     Association Football matches in which one of the
     teams is that of a club having membership of the
     Football League being so designated in the first
     instance.    The Sporting Events     (Control of
     Alcohol etc) Act 1985 provides an appropriate
     precedent.      This   would  assist   to   avoid
     suggestions of discrimination and provide an
     expeditious means of extending the provisions to
     other sporting events if required.


6.   How Might Spectators React to Enforcement
     Inevitably more arrests are going to be made and
     it may well be that the police would institute
     proceedings for the simplified offences rather
     than merely eject troublemakers from the ground
     as they tend to do nowadays in quite significant
     numbers. More police action, which these
                          7   .
     measures would surely generate, will probably
     result, at least in the early days, in greater
     adverse reaction by the crowd. Eventually, it is
     to be hoped, the certainty of knowledge of the
     unlawfulness of the specific actions should bring
     about an improvement in behaviour.


7.   Resource Implications
     Again,   it is very difficult to assess the
     resource implications.    There ought to be some
     saving to the Service by prosecuting offences
     which are more easily proved and more likely to
     be the subject of guilty pleas. However, overall
     there is bound to be an increase in the number of
     persons prosecuted, as opposed to being ejected
     from the ground.    The police forces which are
     regularly dealing with football hooliganism would
     be in a much better position to assess the likely
     increase in the overall numbers of prosecutions.



C.    Attendance Centre Orders and Electronic Tagging
      (Recommendations 72 and 73 -Paragraphs 323-337)

     Attendance centres exist for a sentencing and
     training purpose. There are few of them and they
     would be likely to be overwhelmed by large
     numbers of persons reporting.   It is a sensible
     suggestion but would not serve its purpose for
     offenders sentenced at the end of the season,
     unless it was carried forward to the next, nor
     would it be easy to bring within its scope the
     ever increasing number of evening and Sunday
     matches, those with an early kick-off time and
     bank holiday matches. An alternative would be to
     report at a police station at a specific time,
     but again, it would be difficult to apply this to
     anything other than Saturday afternoons. Similar
     comments apply to electronic tagging in respect
     of which much more experimentation and evaluation
     needs to be undertaken.



D.   Exclusion Orders

     The Public Order Act 1986 created the welcome
     power to exclude persons convicted of offences
     connected with football     from attending any
     prescribed football matches.   I do not believe,
     however,  that the power has been used as
     frequently as it, perhaps, should have been. The
     "practice" in Liverpool appears to be that if a
     defendant has no previous convictions for Public
                           8   .
     Order Act offences, an exclusion order will not
     be made. It is appreciated, however, that there
     may be difficulty in enforcing them.    I am told
     that at Leeds United there are currently 44
     exclusion   orders   in   effect.     The   local
     superintendent indicated that whilst they are
     used sparingly by magistrates, it does mean that
     the comparatively few subjects of the order are
     all known to the police; it seems they catch
     about one person per week breaking such an order.
     It is almost impossible to enforce such orders at
     away matches.   Consideration could, perhaps, be
     given to increasing the penalty for breach which
     currently stands at imprisonment of one month or
     a fine not exceeding level 3.

    I refer to your minute of 9th March and have the following comments.


    Recommendation 70; A touting offence

    (i)         It is, I think correct, that the Police can deal with touts only by
                stretching the existing laws.

    (ii)         Selling tickets on and for day of match without authority

                                 of the proposed offences this is likely to be the most capable
                                 of easy proof but always subject to the events being witnessed
                                 by those who are prepared to give evidence.

                                 relatively few resource implications for CPS but I would
                                 imagine the Police are likely to identify touts only by use of
                                 plain clothes officers and perhaps by mounting special
                                 campaigns.

    (iii)        Prohibiting sales within a specified radius of the ground on the day
                 of the match

                                 subject to the usual caveat as to the available witnesses, the
                                 offence should be not too difficult to prove.

                                 again resource consequences for CPS relatively slight - I
                                 cannot imagine many prosecutions taking place.

    (iv)         Prohibiting sales of tickets at more than face value

                                 proof subject to the disadvantages indicated in paragraph 279
                                 and likely reluctance of those purchasing to complain.

                                 resource consequences as before.
(v)    G enerally

       I am not over impressed with the proposals. Proof of the offences
       themselves ought not to be difficult given available evidence.
       However, I doubt that the Police would be able to devote sufficient
       resources to the problem to catch more than a proportion of ticket
       touts and probably a small proportion. Touts will rearrange their
       selling methods (as evidenced in the report) to take account of
       restrictions imposed. If touts are to be discouraged by operation
       of the criminal law and given that only a proportion are likely to
       be arrested, it seems to me that a basic requirement of any
       legislation introducing these offences should specify minimum and
       substantial penalties - otherwise, enforcement of the law will be
       seen as no more than an inconvenient business overhead.

       Any provisions introduced should enable purchasers who cannot
       attend to obtain refunds. Whilst however tickets are freely traded
       in relation to other big sporting events, and indeed form the basis
       of substantial businesses, sanctions against football ticket touts are
       not likely to gain much public support and hence the only witnesses
       available are likely to be Police Officers who observe transactions.


       Of course, my concerns about enforcement are rather impressionistic
       - obviously the Police will know best whether or not offences along
       the lines of those indicated would be of capable of enforcement.


Recommendation 71

(i)    Throwing a missile

       Whilst sections 4 and 5 of the Public Order Act could apply, they
       are not ideal.

             obtaining the evidence, ie, identifying the person who actually
             threw the missile, will not be easy. Arguments at Court will
             turn on identification in the crowded and difficult atmosphere
             of a football ground.

             overall resource implications for CPS would not be great (but
             see below)

             I imagine that spectators would respond favourably to attempts
             at enforcement.

(ii)   Chanting obscene or racialist abuse

             existing offences do not really deal with this mischief

             again the problems of proof derive from difficulties of
             identification. All will turn upon the credibility of the Police
             Officer when set against the difficulty of being sure that a
        spectator who was admittedly shouting was in fact shouting the
        words of the chant and not something else. One can imagine plenty
        of not guilty pleas on this basis.

             resource implications I imagine are not great although if there
             were many arrests for this offence there would likely be an
             increase in the number of not guilty pleas.

             how spectators would respond would depend upon which
             sections of the crowd they came from and whether or not they
             were the sort of people who indulged in similar conduct. My
             own personal experience of football matches indicate that
             bodies of Police Officers entering crowds in order to arrest
             apparent trouble makers often exacerbate the problem and
             certainly provoke violent responses from spectators especially
             those who might themselves be tempted to indulge in similar
             conduct on occasions.    Thus enforcement might cause more
             problems than the mischief under attack.

        The question does have to be asked whether it is appropriate for
        the criminal law to be invoked to cater for this unseemly behaviour.
        If the Police are to enforce the offence so as to eradicate chanting,
        they will have to devote tremendous resources to ensure that
        sufficient numbers of people are locked up to make the necessary
        impact. Penalties also would have to be sufficiently substantial to
        make the financial consequences of arrest and conviction not worth
        the pleasure to be derived from the activity.      Of course, if the
        Police were to take enforcement seriously and thus arrest many
        offenders, there would be quite considerable resource implications
        for the Service until the problem was eradicated. It might then be
        necessary to bid for additional funds.

        This would be particularly so in relation to all the offences
        suggested if the Police were to provide video taped corroboration
        of their cases.   Given that identification is always a problem I
        would imagine that the Police ought to endeavour to support their
        prosecutions by the use of such evidence.     One would hope that
        confronting a defendant with clear visual evidence of his offence
        would produce or almost eliminate not guilty pleas so taken in the
        round, extra demands on our Service might be acceptable without
        more resources.

(iii)   Pitch invasions

              existing offences do not deal adequately with this mischief.

              as to proof there would doubtless be numerous reasonable
              excuses put forward for the invasion - otherwise the same
              considerations as before apply

              as to resources the position is much as mentioned earlier

              in general, spectators would probably support attempts at
              enforcement
Recommendation 72 - attendance centre orders

Clearly keeping trouble makers away from football grounds during matches
provides limited relief. The extent of that relief depends upon how many
people at any one time are kept away.      Thus the proposal might go a
small way to alleviating the problems     confronting the Police but the
extent would be governed by the numbers arrested and convicted and of
them, how many were not       precluded bythe restrictions from being sent
to an attendance centre. There is also the problem that if large numbers
of football hooligans were sent there, the overall purpose of the
attendance centre might be defeated.        Perhaps some other form of
attendance centre ought to be considered, rather than utilising present
facilities.  Whilst the latter can adequately cater for a sprinkling of
football hooligans - to be inundated with them would affect their ability
to fulfil their proper function.

Conclusion
I hope these few comments are of some assistance. It would be wrong not
to seek ways of reducing violence at football matches and provocative
conduct which might lead to violence. The difficulties with the proposals
discussed above is that they are likely to require the substantial
deployment of Police resources in order to contain the behaviour and
gather reliable evidence which would bring about conviction. The use of
video to support Police evidence is to be encouraged - resource
consequences are not easy to predict but one would hope that clear
filmed evidence of offensive behaviour would bring in its train guilty
pleas.

If it is decided to introduce provisions along the lines of those
discussed, both the Police and ourselves should undertake a proper study
of the resource implications - how far our resources will be committed
will depend very much upon the extent to which the Police themselves
respond to the existence of additional offences/powers and their use of
technical equipment.

                        Hillsborough Stadium disaster:          Lord Justice Taylor's
                        report

                         1•          Touting offences (paragraph 273-279)

                                     Existing law

                                     At present the police have no adequate tools to cope
                                     with ticket touts.  As Taylor says touts are often
                                     arrested for obstruction but, I would suggest on
                                     flimsy evidence and by liberal use of the ways and
                                     means act.  This is clearly the wrong tool for the
                                     job and if the touts are to be fought successfully
                                     then specific legislation could be introduced to be
                                     directed at the problem.

                                     An offence to sell tickets on match days without
                                     authority

                                     I favour this offence.   It should be relatively easy
                                     to prove with co-operation from members of the
                                     public and use of plain clothes officers.   I think
                                     consideration should also be given to creating
                                     offences of offering tickets for sale without
                                     authority and also for possession of larger
                                     quantities of tickets without authority.   This will
                                     discourage the tout who has a runner to use as a
                                     "banker" as mentioned in the report.   Such offences
                                     should be easy to prove.   Careful thought should be
                                     given to creating powers of arrest and seizure of
                                     tickets when police apprehend touts and their
                                     associates.  Exceptions to the general arrest
                                     provisions in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
                                     1984 may have to be considered.

                                     Prohibition of sales within a radius of the ground
                                     on match days

                                     This offence would have attractions.  However it
                                     would be difficult to set^^e^radius by statute.
                                     Clearly the measure is designed to discourage
                                     ticketless spectators travelling from their own home
                                     to the vicinity of the match.  For example a radius
                                     of one mile from the ground might easily create
                                     problems at railway stations in city centres a mile
                                     or more from the football ground.

                                     Sale of a ticket only at face value

                                     There are advantages in this recommendation but I
                                     agree with Taylor's suggestion that there would be
                                     difficulties in proving the price at which a tout
                                     had sold the ticket.  An additional disadvantage is
                                     that this provision would still encourage ticketless
                                     fans to travel to matches in the hope of obtaining a
                                     ticket at the ground.

                         In summary, subject to my suggestion that the scope
                         of the offence be widened slightly I agree with
                         Taylor's suggestion that it should be an offence to
                         sell tickets for a particular match on the day of
                         the game without authority.  The existence of such
                         an offence will prove a considerable deterrent and
                         the deterrent effect will be enhanced by the
                         simplicity of the offence itself and the ease with
                         which the essential elements can be established in
                         court.

            2.           Offences in the ground

                         Throwing missiles

                         Throwing missiles at football grounds is clearly
                         extremely dangerous.  If injury is not caused it
                         almost certainly provokes a violent response.

                         The existing legislation can deal with such acts.
                         Either Section 4 or Section 5 would be appropriate*
                         The second limb of Section 4 and particularly
                         Section 5 %s referred to by Lord Justice Taylor as
                         evidence which might be very difficult to adduce.   I
                         do not totally agree with that suggestion.
                         Certainly a simple offence of throwing a missile
                         inside a football ground would be much easier to
                         prove than an offence under the existing
                         legislation.  The only evidence would be to prove
                         that a particular defendant had thrown an object.
                         The additional elements required by Section 4 and
                         Section 5 of the 1986 Public Order Act would not
                         need to be established.  There will always be
                         problems identifying those responsible for such acts
                         but with the increased use of video cameras and
                         picture enlarging technology coupled with police
                         evidence there should be little difficulty in
                         establishing such offences.  Again thought must be
                         given to providing the police with adequate powers
                         of arrest.

                         Chanting obscene or racialist abuse

                         It is possible that such abuse could be prosecuted
                         under Section 5 of the 1986 Public Order Act.
                         However as Taylor mentions at paragraph 296 there
                         are difficulties in applying this to football
                         matches where perhaps supporters expect to hear such
                         chanting and are not caused "harassment, alarm or
                         distress thereby".

                         Additionally the possibility of racist remarks
                         coming under Section 18 of the Public Order Act for
                         stirring up racial hatred is a non-starter.  In fact
                         I do not think there has been more than one or two

                                      prosecutions under this Section of the Act since it
                                      came into force.

                                      If obscene and racialist remarks are to be
                                      prohibited from ceuntit»g then Taylor's suggestion is
                                      clear, concise and simple to understand, even for
                                      football hooligans.

                                      It must be^case that by simplifying the nature of
                                      the misdemeanour prosecution will be far easier than
                                      under          si the 1986 Public Order Act.  Once
                                      again,obviously there will be difficulties in
                                      actually identifying wrong-doers, provided adequate
                                      steps are taken by the police to obtain good
                                      evidence there should be little difficulty in
                                      establishing such before the court.

                                      Pitch invasions without reasonable excuse

                                      As such action often provokes violence and allows
                                      opposing supporters to mix without restraint it is
                                      sensible to restrict the behaviour and I agree with
                                      Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations.  Again, tt-*.
                                      suggestion is clear and simple, easy to understand.
                                      Once more#powers of arrest need to be considered.    I
                                      anticipate little difficulty in proving such a
                                      misdemeanour.

                                      How might spectators react to enforcement

                                      I would anticipate that the vast majority of
                                      supporters would agree with police enforcement of
                                      such offences.   The agreement might be somewhat
                                      reduced among .the younger elements of supporters so
                                      far as the mx&ml&Sg chanting is concerned.  This
                                      appears to have become almost a condition at
                                      football grounds.    Of the three separate offences I
                                      feel it will be the most difficult for the police to
                                      enforce whilst realistically expecting the support
                                      of football fans.

                         3.           Attendance centre orders

                                      A sensible and logical suggestion but perhaps
                                      reporting to a designated police station to sign on
                                      say one half hour after kick off on Saturday
                                      afternoons would have a less drastic resource
                                      implication.   Clearly penalties for non-reporting
                                      should follow.

                         4.           Electronic tagging

                                      If this is to be effective I would have thought that
                                      it could be used in place of attendance centre
                                      orders^again with suitable penalties for non-
                                      compliance .

                                Resource implications for CPS

                                So far as the suggested offences are concerned I
                                cannot see that there would be any great resource
                                implications so far as prosecuting ticket touts is
                                concerned.  I would anticipate that the legislation
                                will prove to be a considerable deterrent and that
                                prosecutions will be few and resource implications
                                minimal.

                                The suggested new offences inside football grounds
                                could actually reduce resources directed at
                                prosecuting football hooliganism.     Clearly the
                                observations will have to be taken from Chief Crown
                                Prosecutors whose officers have considerable
                                experience in prosecuting crime in and around
                                football stadia.    Although we anticipate the new
                                offences will be easy to prove this may result in
                                more arrests and prosecutions than had been the case
                                under the 1986 Public Order Act legislation.      In
                                this case there QjSe, also implications that may be
                                significant.  However it could be argued equally
                                that the ease with which the new offences can be
                                prosecuted will release resources already allocated
                                to prosecution of the offences under the old Act
                                which were more difficult to prove.

                                I hope these observations are of some help to you
                                although I must confess that I have had to put them
                                together rather quickly.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER: LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S REPORT
With reference to your memorandum of 9 March 1990 and the letter from the
Home Office of 26 February 1990, I would make the following comments:

Recommendation 70

3 (i)   I do not have first-hand experience of this problem in this Branch
         but I would be inclined to agree with conclusions in paragraph 278.

 (ii)   Sale of ticket without authority:

        It depends very much on what arrangements exist for sales at
        outlets which are not contained within the home club grounds.   One
        of the problems with touts is that of forged tickets and
        immediately one can envisage problems with forged authorities; a
        belief that an offender had an authority; the fact that the seller
        used to have an authority and thought that it was still valid etc.

        A possible remedy could be the fact that you could not sell on the
        day of the match except from an outlet at your home club ground.
        This would require a date stamp to be put on all tickets but could
        be got around with a false date stamp being put on tickets sold on
        the actual day.

        One way to make this clause fairly effective would be to introduce
        a requirement whereby when clubs supplied tickets to an outlet they
        must at the same stage supply to that outlet an 'authenticated
        certificate of sale' which would cover the particular match in
        question.  In other words there would not be a general authority
        which might or might not be revoked but the seller of the tickets
        would have to have in his possession an authentication certificate
        covering the very match for which the tickets were being sold.
        There could still be problems that such an authentication
        certificate could be forged but if each certificate was numbered
        and a roll was kept at the football club of the various outlets and
        their roll number this should minimise the position.

        The prosecution of a tout for selling a ticket without authority in
        such circumstances should be fairly easy to prove. The only
        difficulty which would affect this provision and also the third
        suggested touting offence occurs where, for instance, X buys a
                                       Reference


ticket for his friend Y who is unable to buy it for some reason, eg
because he is working.  X then passes that ticket (for its purchase
price) to Y later on.  It would be said that this was not a sale by
X to Y but the defence could be used in transactions which were
in reality a sale.  It would be Draconian to rule such a practice
out (of X getting a ticket for Y) but it would enable such defences
being raised, particularly as the person purchasing the ticket may
not be willing to give evidence stating that what was happening was
basically 'a friend's transaction'.

Prohibition of sales within a specified radius:

This is probably the most attractive of the proposals and would
certainly stop casual sales at the grounds.  It would be necessary
to ensure that there was a reasonable distance stipulated -
probably a couple of miles. Within a limited distance from the
grounds it would be easy to enforce although there would always be
inevitable problems with sales which were on or close to the
boundaries.  One can also envisage a situation whereby it would
become known that tickets could be obtained from a specific park
which was 2 or 3 miles away from the football ground so that those
interested would go there. To counter this it would also be
necessary to bring in the previous offence whereby tickets could
not be sold at all without the authority from the home club because
otherwise touts might feel that provided they were a certain
distance from the football grounds they were fully entitled to sell
tickets.

Prohibition of sales of tickets at more than face value:

This would be the most difficult provision to enforce because it
would require evidence from the purchaser. There would also be the
potential defence that a ticket had been bought at the purchaser's
request by 'a friend'. Enforcement of a 'one-off' sale by a tout
might well be very difficult.

General Observations

One matter that needs to be considered with the provisions for the
sale by touts is whether the law should penalise a purchaser of
ticket(s).  The reason why touts are so successful is because
purchasers exist who will buy tickets from them but if they were to
face prosecution themselves for purchasing or attempting to
purchase tickets otherwise than ... from an authorised
outlet/within a specified radius of the ground/at an excessive
price ... then this would be a considerable discouragement to the
practice.

I note the comments in paragraph 278 concerning the procedures
whereby a runner brings up tickets from a 'banker' but wonder
whether there would be some value in having an offence of being in
possession of more than one ticket without lawful authority or
reasonable excuse. Clearly this would excuse a parent carrying a
ticket for his son etc but not other persons who had several
tickets. The problem is that excuses could so easily be made that
could not be rebutted that it might well become unenforceable.
                                                  Reference


           I also agree with the comments in paragraph 279 about the need for
           clubs to provide a full refund.  Arrangements would have to be made
           though which did not require the purchaser to turn up in person at
           the club because this would be almost impossible on some occasions
           for the person concerned and therefore unfair.  However if one had
           a system whereby tickets could be returned in the post there would
           be the possibility of a purchaser posting them after a game had
           finished possibly having decided not to watch it having found that
           it was being televised or because the weather was particularly
           inclement etc.

           Overall my view is that the first 2 suggested offences would be the
           most effective at dealing with this problem and both would be
           enforceable provided there were effective methods of establishing
           which outlets were authorised.

           I would not envisage that such offences would mean significant
           resource implications for CPS.

Recommendation 71

General:

Paragraph 299 indicates that the value of the 3 suggested provisions will
be that 'hooligans know exactly what is prohibited and that they do those
things at their peril'. Whilst that is important there is also the danger
that by being too prescriptive one finds that the law is unable to adapt
quickly when some new 'anti-social' activity is though of which does not
fall into one of the 3 particular categories.

The report refers to the views of Mr Justice Popplewell with his
recommendation of an offence of 'disorderly conduct at a sports ground'.
The Taylor Report points out the problems found with S.5 Public Order Act so
far as the 'harrassment, alarm or distress' element is concerned and this is
a problem which one is regularly encountering, not just in football
stadiums. My own personal view for a number of years has been that what was
missing under the old Public Order Act 1936 was a provision penalising a
person guilty of disorderly behaviour (as distinct from being drunk and
disorderly).  The current S.5 offence could readily be adapted by removing
the harrassment, alarm or distress requirement.  Much argument takes
place in courts at the moment as to whether the behaviour in question caused
distress as opposed to disgust, annoyance, offence etc. Paragraph 299
referred in particular to the need for full publicity to be given to the
legislation and I would have thought that such publicity could state that
the activities such as the 3 in question could be punished as being
'disorderly' conduct which was caught by a 'disorderly conduct' offence.

Chanting and going on the pitch specifically relate to matches etc but the
throwing of a missile can take place in all localities and, given the views
in the report that the present legislation does not cover such activities,
there is much to be said for the widening of the Public Order Act to include
all disorderly behaviour and thus catch this activity wherever it happens.
It may still be felt that specific offences as suggested for sporting events
should also be introduced so that one would have the 3 offences for sports
events together with a far wider disorderly offence for use in all
circumstances.
                                                Reference


Throwing a missile

Clearly there should be legislation of one sort of another which will cover
this activity.  One difficulty may be where a large group of people appear
to be throwing missies but in fact only one or two missiles are actually
thrown and it is almost impossible to know which one of the group threw the
missile.  This again may be better covered by the disorderly conduct
approach rather than by the specific offence approach.  A specific offence
could be one of throwing or pretending to throw a missile but there could
then arise questions of whether the person was pretending to throw a missile
as opposed to just shaking his fist in a gesticulative manner.

Given the numbers of people at such sporting events these offences will not
be capable of easy proof.  In the majority of cases the evidence will only
come from video recordings of the ground and in looking at this legislation
it might be appropriate to clarify the position with identification from
these video films.  In practice police officers sit down looking at films
afterwards with a view to identifying offenders and often by looking through
books of suspects.  Offenders who are selected in this way cannot normally
be put on an identification parade and there is often confusion in the court
as to exactly what can or cannot be said in suggesting how the offender came
to be 'chosen' by the police and whether there should be dock identification
or whether the jury should be invited to see whether they agree with the
police officer's identification.

The resource implications would be relatively minor unless such cases were
always met by trials and that is why the identification issues need to be
considered carefully.

Given the current segregation policies referred to in the report the
enforcement of any of these provisions whilst the match is in progress are
likely to meet with considerable difficulties.  Unfortunately though waiting
for the spectators to disperse will create even greater problems probably
because the difficulty in keeping track of suspected offenders.  The report
does suggest group penning of spectators and the ability to close the pens
in order to prevent overcrowding.  It occurs to me that such pens could be
kept closed at the end of a match while each pen was dealt with and alleged
offenders were removed but one could imagine considerable difficulty if
people were kept waiting for a lengthy period of time at the end of a match.

Chanting obscene or racialist abuse

I completely agree with the comments in paragraph 295-298 setting out the
limitations of the present legislation and agree that what is needed is a
separate specific offence purely related to the chanting of obscene or
racialist abuse.  Even if this was covered under my earlier suggestions
concerning 'disorderly conduct' I think that such actions which are
extremely sensitive and distressing warrant a specific separate offence.

Difficulties of proof however arise from the fact that normally large groups
join in the chanting and it is almost impossible to actually say whether an
individual in question was saying the words as opposed to mouthing them or
was merely in the group where they were taking place.  This has arisen in
cases I have been involved in and it is not easy to prove.  I was fortunate
in one particular case where the officer giving evidence had a deaf son and
he was a trained lip reader but such prosecution witnesses are relatively
                                                                  Reference


             rare! Difficulties of making it an offence to be within a group or segment
             from which obscene or racialist chants are coming are obvious and would
             inevitably catch up some 'innocent' members of the public who would rightly
             say that it was no fault of theirs that they happened to end up in that part
             of the ground.

             Enforcement of these provisions during a match would be extremely difficult
             because of the reactions of the crowd.

             The proposed offence on an individual basis may well not be capable of easy
             proof and successful prosecutions would depend on whether it was possible to
             phrase the legislation to catch persons within a group which was acting in
             the prohibited manner.

             Resource implications would again be dependent on the above matters and the
             question of proof.  I envisage that the suggested provisions will require
             proof of individual involvement (rather than collective presence) and
             consequentially there may be considerable resource difficulties.

             Going on the pitch without reasonable excuse

             As previously suggested this could be caught by the 'disorderly conduct'
             suggestions.  In paragraph 301 comment is made about the tradition of
             running onto a pitch when a game is over and the need to have an exemption
             in an offence of 'without good reason or reasonable excuse'. S.5 Public
             Order Act 1986 already has a similar sort of defence built into it in S.5
             (3) (c).

             A specific offence should be capable of easy proof. The spectator response
             to enforcement would depend to a large extent on whether there were one or
             two offenders who were dealt with when they were on the ground or whether
             there was a mass pitch invasion.

             The resource implications of prosecuting such offences should be relatively
             minimal provided adequate measures are taken in the grounds to make such
             invasions difficult.

             Recommendation 72

             These provisions seem very sensible. The requirement for a person to attend
             at some specific location enables there to be effective enforcement of the
             ban.   It may well be said that in some cases the requirements to undertake
             the physical regime etc of an 'attendance centre' is too onerous and as
             paragraph 326 states such orders can only be made when a person has been
             convicted of an imprisonable offence, which does not apply to a conviction
             for a S.5 Public Order offence.   One wonders whether a lesser sanction but
             an effective one would be to have a provision whereby an exclusion order
             could be matched by a requirement to sign in or report somewhere else
             during, the course of a match.   This would be similar to bail conditions and
             one could envisage the need to report at a police station half an hour into
             a match and also an hour into a match or to report at some other centre such
             as an attendance centre without having to carry out the physical work etc.
             The mere making of an exclusion order is in many cases not particularly
             effective because of the difficulties of enforcement.

             Recommendation 73

             I have no personal knowledge of the effectiveness of electronic tagging and
             am only aware of some of the press comments.  Certainly the principles of it
             as set out in paragraphs 355-357 sound very sensible and tie in with the
             comments made in the previous paragraph concerning methods of ensuring that
             a person excluded from attending a sporting event complies with that
             requirement.

             Other Matters

             (a)   Gangways (paragraphs 175-177)

                   The report refers to the need for gangways to be kept clear and
                   the requirement of the safety certificate to require that no
                   standing be allowed in gangways.  Presumably the breach for
                   failing to ensure that no standing is allowed in a gangway is the
                   revocation of the safety certificate.  I do not know how quickly
                   arrangements can be made for revocation but, thinking of licensing
                   provisions, this can take a considerable period of time. Given the
                   importance of keeping the gangways clear should consideration be given
                   to a specific criminal offence by a club which fails to keep a gangway
                   clear.

             (b)   Gates unlocked and authorised access to the pitch (paragraphs 201
                   203)

                   My only concern in reading this is a practical one of ensuring that
                   a gate which is to be kept closed but not locked will not be
                   opened by those inside the pen swarming out onto      the ground.Para
                   203 refers to the need for individual manning at each of the gagers
                   by a person who can authorise the gate to be opened but my concern
                   is the practical one where you have a group of people determined to go
                   onto the pitch, an unlocked gate and one person on the other side who
                   does not give authorisation.




             Finally can I say that I found the report remarkably easy and interesting to
             read and I hope that the above points may be of some value although I must
             confess that I have not been able to spend as long looking at the particular
             provisions as I would have liked.

D/^FE:         28th March 1990

RE:      HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER: LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S REPORT
I am sorry not to have written to you earlier about you memo of 9th
March, which awaited me on my return from holiday at the beginning of
last week.  I have only just I am afraid, found time to read the
report.

I confine my observations to paragraph 70 - 73, since, as one with no
great interest in or experience of association football matches, I
doubt if my views would be of any value.

I set out below my comments on the individual proposals

70.    Selling tickets     on the day of any sporting activity without
authority of the organisers should be an offence.  It is unreasonable
to distinguish between football matches, boxing matches, rugby or
cricket.  In principle the tout is surely an undesirable person who
performs no useful social function.  There may be more of a danger in
his activities if he does them at a football match, but that is not
consequent upon anything he does, but upon the behaviour of his
customers. The opportunity should be taken to put him out of business
for ever.

71.    I favour Mr Justice Popplewell's solution of creating one
offence.   I think the advantages perceived by Lord Justice Taylor of
having separate offences which will deter people from committing those
separate acts, will be more than outweighed by the fact that the new
offences will have to be narrowly defined and construed and therefore
there will be some almost equally antisocial behaviour that will not
be punished or not be sufficiently punished.

72.    Exclusion orders are, so far as I can tell, a total waste of
time, because they are virtually unenforceable and eor®©qwntly the
courts do not seek to impose them. The making of an attendance centre
order would, however, ensure that the offender was de facto excluded
form the ground and I think this would be a useful advantage, provided
the present attendance centre provisions were expanded as the report
suggests.

73.   I think we would have to be extremely careful before doing
anything more about electronic tagging.  Let us first of all see
whether we have got any sort of a workable system before trying to
extend it.
I apologise again for the delay and hope these views will be of some
assistance to you.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW
       OFFENCES AND PENALTIES


       I am writing to ask you, on behalf of The Crown Prosecution
       Service, to let me have your views on each of the
       recommendations 70-73 in the final Taylor report.


      2.   I set out below some particular points I should like to
      make on each of Taylor's suggestions for new offences and
      penalties.


       Recommendation 70: A touting offence

      3.   The report discusses touting in paragraphs 273-279.      In
      paragraph 279 three possible touting offences are proposed.
      It would be helpful if your response to us could c o v e r :-


               (i)  any comment you may have on the claim in paragraph
               278 that police can deal with touts only by stretching
               somewhat the existing laws; and


               (ii)  separately for each of the three variations of a
               touting offence:


                      is the proposed offence capable of easy proof?
            what resource implications would implementation have
            for the CPS?


Recommendation 71:
      (i) Throwing a Missile
      (ii) Chanting obscene or racialist abuse
     ..(iii.) Going on the pitch without reasonable e x c u s e .


4.   These three suggestions are discussed in paragraphs 289-
301.  Again, it would be helpful if your response could cover,
separately for each of the three offences:-


     (i)   to what extent do existing offences deal with the
     mischief at which Taylor is aiming?


     (ii)   is the proposed offence capable of easy proof?


     (iii)  what resource implications would implementation
     have for the CPS?


     (iv) how might spectators respond to attempts at
     enforcement?



Recommendation 72 (making attendance centre orders available
for football related offences)


5.   The discussion here is in paragraphs 323-334.   The
implications here, are, of course, mainly for the Home Office
and the police.  But your comments generally on this
recommendation would be welcome.


Recommendation 73 (electronic tagging)


6.   Discussion is in paragraphs 335-7.  Again, your general
comments, in the light of the limited experience of electronic
tagging, would be welcome.


Other consultees


7.   I am consulting similarly ACPO but at present there are
no plans to consult more widely outside the Office.
Timing


9.   As the Home Secretary is likely to be under some pressure
to reach decisions on the Taylor proposals for new offences
and penalties it would be most helpful if you could let me
have the CPS's substantive response to this letter before
Easter.

                         A


       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW
       OFFENCES AND PENALTIES


       I am writing to ask you, on behalf of The Crown Prosecution
       Service, to let me have your views on each of the
       recommendations 70-73 in the final Taylor report.


       2.   I set out below some particular points I should like to
       make on each of Taylor's suggestions for new offences and
       penalties.


       Recommendation 70: A touting offence

       3.   The report discusses touting in paragraphs 273-279.      In
       paragraph 279 three possible touting offences are proposed.
       It would be helpful if your response to us could c o v e r :-


               (i)   any comment you may have on the claim in paragraph
               278 that police can deal with touts only by stretching
               somewhat the existing laws; and


               (ii) separately for each of the three variations of a
               touting offence:


                      is the proposed offence capable of easy proof?
            what resource implications would implementation have
            for the CPS?


Recommendation 71:
     (i) Throwing a Missile
     (ii) Chanting obscene or racialist abuse
     (iii) Going on the pitch without reasonable e x c u s e .


4.   These three suggestions are discussed in paragraphs 289-
301.  Again, it would be helpful if your response could cover,
separately for each of the three offences:-


     (i)   to what extent do existing offences deal with the
     mischief at which Taylor is aiming?


     (ii)   is the proposed offence capable of easy proof?


     (iii)  what resource implications would implementation
     have for the CPS?


     (iv) how might spectators respond to attempts at
     enforcement?



Recommendation 72 (making attendance centre orders available
for football related offences)


5.   The discussion here is in paragraphs 323-334.   The
implications here, are, of course, mainly for the Home Office
and the police.  But your comments generally on this
recommendation would be welcome.


Recommendation 7 3 (electronic tagging)


6.   Discussion is in paragraphs 335-7.  Again, your general
comments, in the light of the limited experience of electronic
tagging, would be welcome.


Other consultees


7.   I am consulting similarly ACPO but at present there are
no plans to consult more widely outside the Office.
Timing


9.   As the Home Secretary is likely to be under some pressure
to reach decisions on the Taylor proposals for new offences
and penalties it would be most helpful if you could let me
have the CPS's substantive response to this letter before
Easter.

       FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME

       1 have seen your letter of 26 January to David Waddington
       suggesting that a reference to continued work on the type of
       Membership Scheme envisaged in the invitation to tender should be
       included in his statement on the Taylor Report.

       2    The intention was that the Football Membership Scheme would
       be run by the football industry itself and be self financing.  The
       costs to the clubs would have been met by the members themselves
       through a membership fee.    I am concerned     to know how the
       continued work to develop suitable technology for possible future
       use would be financed when the scheme itself is not to be
       implemented.   It seems to me unlikely that either the companies
       who responded to the invitation to tender, or the football
       authorities, would be prepared to meet these development costs.
       In these circumstances further work would not take place unless
       supported by public funds.    I could accept the reference to this
       further exploration of the technology only on the understanding
       that any such funding will be met from within existing provision.

       3    I am sending copies of this letter to the Prime Minister,
       Geoffrey Howe, Douglas Hurd, David Waddington, Malcolm Rifkind,
       Patrick Mayhew, the Lord Privy Seal, Timothy Renton and to Sir
       Robin Butler.

          PUBLIC ORDER - FOOTBALL - THE TAYLOR REPORT

       CROWN CONTROL AND HOOLIGANISM IN FOOTBALL GROUNDS



I have today spoken with John Goddard, F8 Division of the Home
Office who has informed me that he is taking forward the Taylor
Report.   He has indicated that in due course the views of the
CPS and ACPO will be formally requested by letter and that no
action is required in their regard until such time as that letter
arrives with us.

I have indicated that I am the contact point for such a letter
and shall await it before taking this matter forward.

     CROWD CONTROL AND HOOLIGANISM IN FOOTBALL GROUNDS


     Thank you for your letter                       dated 31st January.

     I had been alerted by the press reports, and have asked Roger
     Daw to look further into the matter and establish contact with
     those concerned at Home Office.

     I was interested in the accompanying correspondence.   I don't
     think we here are in danger of becoming "too Sir
     Humphreyesque". More seriously, I am pleased that the
     possible resource implications have been noted in the letter
     from the Chief Secretary; this is an aspect which I had asked
     Roger to keep in mind and he will alert our FinanceDivision
     at an appropriate stage.

          CROWD CONTROL AND HOOLIGANISM IN FOOTBALL GROUNDS


          You will be aware that Lord Justice Taylor's report on the Hillsborough Stadium
          disaster recommended the creation of three new specific offences in connection
          with football hooliganism: throwing a missile; chanting obscene or racialist abuse;
          and going on to a pitch without reasonable excuse.


          In his statement of Monday, the Home Secretary undertook to look carefully and
          quickly at the suggestions.           He also commented that the suggested new offences
          did seem to duplicate to some extent offences which are already available in the
          Public Order Act. The Attorney General was not consulted about the terms of the
          statement;             indeed, he only saw a copy          of   the    statem ent     at     the   weekend.


          I am enclosing with this letter a copy of the full text of the statement together
          with correspondence between various departments.                         You may wish to note, in
          p a r tic u la r , the c o m m e n t s of the C h ie f S e c r e ta r y c o n cer n in g th e s u g g e s te d
          offences.         The Attorney General has not offered any comments at this stage;
          clearly, it will be necessary to take the matter forward at official level.                           Would
          you be good enough to ask the person to whom you delegate this matter to keep
           me in touch with the discussions which take place.

         TAYLOR REPORT:   HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT



    The Home Secretary was very grateful for the comments of
the Prime Minister as set out in your letter this morning and
those of the Chief Secretary, recorded in Carys Evans' letter.

   I attach a redraft which the Home Secretary has now
prepared in consultation with the Minister for Sport and
which, as you will see, picks up nearly all of your comments.
The peroration is somewhat longer than before since the Home
Secretary took the view, on reconsideration, that the original
draft ended too abruptly.

    Copies of this go to those who received copies of my
letter of 25 January.

         HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT ON
    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT
               OF HIS INQUIRY INTO THE
         HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
                         29 JANUARY 1990


With       permission,            Mr Sp e a k e r , I            should

LIKE       TO       MAKE     A    STATEMENT                ABOUT       THE

FINAL REPORT OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S

In q u i r y        into      the        tragedy                at     the

Hi l l s b o r o u g h     stadium      on       15 A p r i l 1989,

which      is       published         today.           So m e    months

have     passed          since        that       terrible            event

BUT     NOT         LONG    ENOUGH           I    KNOW      TO       DULL

THE    pain         suffered      by    the       bereaved, and

I   wish       to    place       on    record         my    sympathy

FOR THEM AND FOR THOSE WHO                                 SUSTAINED

INJURY.

                                                 /I   AM MOST....
I     AM     MOST         GRATEFUL        TO     LORD      JUSTICE

Ta y l o r    for     the     Re p o r t ,     which    sets     out

CLEARLY WHY WE HAVE HAD SO MANY MAJOR

TRAGEDIES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS OVER THE

YEARS        AND     WHY      WE        HAVE    HAD     DISORDER

AND        HOOLIGANISM.                    As        THE     HOUSE

FAMILIARISES               ITSELF        WITH    THE       REPORT,

IT       WILL       BECOME         CLEAR        THAT       IT     IS

ADDRESSED           AS      MUCH         TO     THE     FOOTBALL

INDUSTRY AS IT IS TO THE GOVERNMENT.

Lo r d     Ju s t i c e    Ta y l o r    explains          how    in

HIS INTERIM REPORT HE CONCENTRATED ON

OVERCROWDING               BECAUSE            THAT     WAS       THE

CAUSE        OF     THE     HILLSBOROUGH               DISASTER,

BUT NOW HE GOES ON TO TALK OF A GAME,



                                              /THE IMAGE OF
THE IMAGE OF WHICH HAS BEEN MUCH

TARNISHED,         AND        OF   A   BLIGHT      OVER       THE

GAME       DUE          TO     OLD       GROUNDS,            POOR

FACILITIES,              HOOLIGANISM,             EXCESSIVE

DRINKING AND POOR LEADERSHIP.



Lo r d   Ju s t i c e    Ta y l o r    does     not       spare

THOSE WHO RUN THE INDUSTRY.                            H e SAYS

INDEED      THAT        THE     PROVISION        THEY        MAKE

FOR      THEIR      CUSTOMERS            IS     OFTEN         NOT

MERELY      BASIC        BUT       SQUALID,            AND     HE

SAYS THAT SQUALID CONDITIONS CAN HAVE

AN    IMPACT ON          SAFETY AND           THAT     IN HIS

VIEW THEY ALSO LEAD TO LOWER STANDARDS

OF BEHAVIOUR.

    Lo r d       Ju s t i c e     Ta y l o r       says       that      the

    Fo o t b a l l       As s o c i a t i o n       and        Fo o t b a l l

    Le a g u e     have         not    seen       it     as   any     part

    OF    THEIR         DUTY          TO    OFFER        GUIDANCE        TO

    CLUBS          ON      SAFETY               HATTERS,       AND       HE

    QUESTIONS            WHETHER            THE        DIRECTORS         OF

    MANY CLUBS ARE GENUINELY INTERESTED IN

    THE WELFARE OF THEIR OWN SUPPORTERS OR

    THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOUR.                         PLAYERS TOO ARE

    CRITICISED,             WITH       LORD        JUSTICE        TAYLOR

    POINTING OUT THAT INCITEMENT FROM THE

    PITCH        OR     BAD       BEHAVIOUR              BY   PLAYERS,

    WHICH        IS NOT CONFINED TO SOCCER,                            HAS

    A    MAJOR        INFLUENCE             ON     THE    CROWD.           I

    ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME CLUBS HAVE MADE

AN     EFFORT     TO     IMPROVE           STANDARDS,        BUT

Lo r d J u s t i c e T a y l o r 's    clear      conclusion

WAS     THAT     THE      MAJORITY HAD               NOT     AND

THAT     THE    GAME      ONLY HAS           A    FUTURE     IF

THE     DIRECTORS         AND        THE     PLAYERS         CAN

CHANGE      THEIR OWN           PRIORITIES          AND     GIVE

A LEADERSHIP WHICH IS PLAINLY LACKING

AT PRESENT.



He    agrees      with         the     Go v e r n m e n t   that

THERE     MUST      BE     A     MOVE        TOWARDS        ALL-

SEATER      STADIA        AND        POINTS        OUT      THAT

SECTION 11 OF THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS

Act       specifically                  provides             the

MACHINERY FOR THIS.                    THE       CHANGE WILL

about.       Lo r d        Ju s t i c e     Ta y l o r     makes

CLEAR THAT THE BULK OF

THE    FINANCES       FOR      GROUND          IMPROVEMENTS

WILL   HAVE TO        BE RAISED             BY THE         CLUBS

THEMSELVES.           He     SAYS         THERE    ARE WAYS

OF    RAISING   THE         MONEY         IF    THE      CLUBS'

MANAGEMENT        IS            ENTERPRISING                  AND

RESOURCEFUL       AND         HE      POINTS          TO      THE

OPPORTUNITIES                      PRESENTED                  BY

SPONSORSHIP.          He . ALSO           POINTS         TO   THE

REVENUE    THAT       FLOWS         TO      THE     FOOTBALL

AUTHORITIES FOR TELEVISION RIGHTS AND

SAYS THAT THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES

SHOULD            ENSURE      THAT          THIS        VALUABLE

POSSIBILITY OF A LEVY ON TRANSFER FEES

WHICH        HE      SAYS    HAVE     REACHED           A    LEVEL

WHICH MANY REGARD AS GROTESQUE.

RECOMMENDATIONS SET OUT IN CHAPTERS 3,

4 AND 5 ON MATTERS RELATING TO

SPECTATOR            SAFETY      SUCH       AS     GATES      AND

LIKE US        to     go     FURTHER AND             EXTEND           ITS

REMIT      TO       COVER        OTHER         THAN        FOOTBALL

grounds.            Th i s      would       require            primary

LEGISLATION               AND      WE       WILL           HAVE        TO

CONSIDER WHETHER IT IS JUSTIFIED.

OF PROPOSALS RELATING                    to     CROWD CONTROL

REMINDS        US THAT,          WITHOUT          THE       WORK OF

WANT TO ADD MY THANKS TO THE                      POLICE

FOR     THE          WAY     THEY      CARRY     OUT     THE

 TAYLOR REPORT: HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT

 Thank you for copying to John Gieve your letter of 25 January
 enclosing a drat of the statement which the Home Secretary
 proposes to make on Monday. The Chief Secretary has also seen
 Mr Moyniha||b letter of 26 January to the Home Secretary.

 2    The  Chief Secretary is generally content, with the draft
 statement but he would not want the Home Secretary to mention tax
 issues.   Such a reference would be unnecessary since the report
 makes no recommendation on tax issues 5 and might well provoke
 questions   to   which Ministers would not be able to reply
 substantively in Budget purdah.  In the first paragraph of the
 third page of the draft statement/ he would like the words
 "including a change ..." to the end of the sentence deleted.

 3   The Chief Secretary has noted Lord Justice Taylor's proposals
 to create three new specific offences. He is content with what
 the Home Secretary proposes to say about this, but has commented
 that enforcing such offences, particularly that regarding the
 chanting of     obscene or racialist abuse,   could    have   very
 substantial    resource implications for the police and the legal
 departments.    It will be important for these to be ^ properly
 assessed and the implications considered before any decisions are
 taken.    On this point, the Chief Secretary would find it
 difficult to accept Mr Moynihan's proposed redraft, which suggests
 that the Government will look at how the measures should be
 implemented rather than whether they should be.

 Environemnt) Tim Sutton (Lord President's Office), Richard Gozmey
 (FCO), Jim Gallagher (Scottish Office), Juliet Wheldon (Attorney
 General's Office), Gillian Kirston (Lord Privy Seal's Office),

From the Principal Private Secretary                             29 January 1990



                       TAYLOR REPORT: HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT

        The Prime Minister has seen the draft of the statement
  attached to your letter to me of 25 January, and the letter of
  2 6 January from the Minister for Sport to the Home Secretary, to
  which was attached an alternative draft of the final paragraphs
  of the statement.

       She agrees with the Minister for Sport that it is helpful to
  present the Taylor proposals as an alternative strategy which is
  beipg adopted to replace the Football Membership Scheme. She
  also agrees that it is desirable to include a reference to
  further work on membership schemes, as without it the threat to
  return to them, should the Taylor approach not work, is weakened.

       She feels, however, that the DOE draft goes too far in
  suggesting that it is simply a matter of technological
  modification to the existing scheme. The effect of the DOE draft
  is to sound rather grudging in accepting the main recommendation.

       The Prime Minister suggests that the final two paragraphs of
  the Home Office draft should be replaced by the passage attached.

       On the new offences and sanctions suggested by Lord Justice
  Taylor, the Prime Minister felt the Home Office draft was too
  Sir Humphreyesque, while the DOE draft went too far in committing
  the Government to adopting the Taylor proposals.  She felt the
  matter could be dealt with at the bottom of page 5 by

          "I shall look urgently and sympathetically at these
          recommendations".

          I also attach a sheet of other drafting suggestions.

       I am copying this letter to Alan Ring (Department of the
  Environment), Tim Sutton (Lord President's Office, John Gieve
  (H.M. Treasury), Richard Gozney (Foreign and Commonwealth
  Office), Philip Stamp (Office of the Minister for Sport), Jim
  Gallagher (Scottish Office), Juliet Wheldon (Law Officers'
  Department), Gillian Kirton (Lord Privy Seal's Office),
  Murdo Maclean (Chief Whip's Office) and Sonia Phippard (Cabinet
  Office).

             PROPOSED DRAFTING CHANGES


Page 1, para 2.
Although the reference to "careful and thorough
analysis" is literally correct as it refers to the
history of hooliganism, it could be quoted back in the
context of the NMS.     Try
"...   for the report, which sets out clearly why we
have had ...".


Page 2, line 5, "safety and that, in his view, they
also ...."


Page 2, middle paragraph.
It would be helpful either in the statement or the
speech for the debate, to include a criticism of one of
the major vices of modern soccer, the endemic habit of
disputing referees' decisions.


Page 2.
The Government should take more credit for promoting
all-seater stadia.     Two lines from the bottom to read:
"... and points out that Section 11 of the Football
Spectators Act specifically provides for this".


Top of page 3.
Include a reference to large and growing TV monies.


Top of page 4.
Again it is possible to take credit for provisions in
the Act:
"Lord Justice Taylor welcomed the establishment of the
Football Licensing Authority but would like us to go
further and extend its remit to cover ...".


Further down this paragraph which discusses the
extension to other sports, replace "we will have to
consider the matter further" by "we will have to
consider whether this is justified".

                      PROPOSED CONCLUDING PASSAGE


I now come to the proposed Football Membership Scheme.        Lord
Justice Taylor examined the Invitation to Tender for a scheme
which was issued by the consultants employed by the football
authorities.     He came to the conclusion that he could not support
a scheme of that kind because he did not believe the technology
would work well enough to avoid the danger of congestion and
disorder.    He was also concerned about the call on police
resources.     Instead he proposes the measures to which I have
referred.


The Government have decided in the light of his advice not to
procieed with the establishment of a Football Membership
Authority.     Instead we propose to follow his strategy of
combining certain measures aimed directly at hooligans together
with progress towards all-seating, improved accommodation, better
facilities, improved arrangements for crowd control and better
training of police and stewards, which Lord Justice Taylor
believes give the best chance of eliminating or minimising
football hooliganism.


In the meantime Part I of the Football Spectators Act will remain
on the statute book and work will continue to see how the
shortcomings identified by Lord Justice Taylor could be overcome
in case we have to return to the matter again, should the problem
of hooliganism not be defeated by the alternative strategy
proposed in the Report.


The right course now is to implement Part II of the Act and to
give effect to Lord Justice Taylor's proposals in the way I have
indicated.     Mr. Speaker, we are giving the industry and the clubs
a final opportunity to put themselves in order.     The public will
not forgive them if they do not now act.

 ...     I shall look expeditiously at how best these measures can
 be implemented against the background of recent changes in the
 criminal law.




        I now come to the proposed Football Membership Scheme.                     Lord
 Justice Taylor examined the Invitation to Tender for a scheme
 which was issued by the consultants employed by the football
 authorities.     He came to the conclusion that he could not support
 a scheme of that kind because he did not believe the technology
would work well enough to avoid the danger of congestion and
disorder.        Instead he proposes the measures to which I have
referred.




       The Government have decided in the light of his advice not
to proceed       with   the   establishment           of   a Football    Membership
Authority.        Instead     we   propose       to    follow   his     strategy    of
combining certain measures aimed directly at hooligans together
with progress towards all-seating, improved accommodation, better
facilities, improved arrangements for crowd control and better
training    of   police     and    stewards,     which      Lord   Justice   Taylor
believes give the best             chance   of    eliminating      or    minimising
football hooliganism.



       In the meantime Part I of the Football Spectators Act will
remain on the statute book and the practical concerns expressed
by Lord Justice Taylor about the type of scheme envisaged in the
Invitation to Tender will be fully explored in the light of the
available advice, including that from the specialist companies
who responded to the Invitation to Tender.




                               CONFIDENTIAL
                          CONFIDENTIAL




     If hooliganism is not defeated by the alternative strategy
proposed in the Report and if at some future time a workable
membership scheme can be produced, we will then be in a position
to come back to the House and seek the approval of the House for
the scheme.



     The right course now is to implement Part II of the Act and
to give effect to Lord Justice Taylor's proposals in the way I
have indicated.   Mr. Speaker, we are giving the industry and the
clubs a final opportunity to put themselves in order.   The public
will not forgive them if they do not now act.

                              HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


            With permission,     Mr Speaker,         I should      like to make a
            statement about the final report of Lord Justice T a y l o r ’s
            Inquiry into the tragedy at the Hillsborough stadium in
            Sheffield on 15 April 1989, which is published today.



            I am most grateful to Lord Justice Taylor for the Report,
        which is a careful and thorough analysis of why we have
        had so many major tragedies at football grounds over the
        years and why we have had disorder and hooliganism.                                 As
        the House familiarises          itself with the Report it will
        become clear it is addressed as much to the football
        industry as it is to the Government.                  Lord Justice Taylor
        explains how in his interim report he concentrated on
        overcrowding      because       that     was        the    cause    of          the
        Hillsborough disaster, but now he goes on to talk of a
        game, the image of which has been much tarnished, and of
        a     blight   over    the   game      due     to    old    grounds,          poor
        facilities,      hooliganism,       excessive        drinking      and        poor
        leadership.




                                                                                 i v i ni   i n •j u

         Lord Justice Taylor does not spare those who                         run the
         industry.     He says indeed that the            provision they make for
        their customers is often not merely basic but squalid,
        and he says that squalid conditions can have an impact on
        safety but they also lead to lower standards of behaviour.


        Lord Justice Taylor says that the Football Association and
        Football League have not seen it as any part of their duty
        to offer       guidance    to clubs on           safety matters and          he
        questions      whether    the        directors     of     many     clubs   are
        genuinely      interested       in     the    welfare      of      their   own
        supporters or their good behaviour.                       Players     too are
        criticised, with Lord Justice Taylor pointing out that
        incitement from the pitch or bad behaviour by players,
        which is not confined to soccer, has a major influence on
        the crowd.      While he recognises that at some clubs changes
        have been made towards realising a new concept of how
        football should be,         he says that the game only has a
        future if the directors and the players can change their
        own priorities and give ;a leadership which                        is plainly
        lacking at present.


        He agrees with the Government that there m u s t be a move
        towards      all-seater     stadia      and      points    out      that   the
        machinery for that now exists in section H                       of the

             Football Spectators Act.                 The change will improve safety
             and will        improve    behaviour,          and we intend to b r i n g it
             about.     Lord Justice Taylor makes clear that the bulk of
            the finances            for ground improvements will                  have to be
            raised by the clubs themselves.                    He mentions ways in which
            clubs' finances might be improved to help cover the cost
            and   canvasses          a number of possibilities,                   including   a
            change      in     the      system        of     capital     allowances      which
            discourages expenditure on new stands but encourages what
            he describes as grotesque transfer fees*                        The Government
            will consider these suggestions.


            There are a whole series of detailed recommendations set
            out in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 on matters relating to
            spectator safety such as gates and gangways.                           Indeed, 43
            of the 76 recommendations appeared in the Interim Report.
            The Government accepts these proposals, some of which can
            be implemented immediately.                    Some will need further work.
            For convenience I am placing in the Library of the House
            a schedule setting out the Government's response to the
                                                  i


            proposals set out in Chapters 3, 4 and 5.


            Hon Members will recall that section 13 of the Football
            Supporters        Act      provides       for     the      Football     Licensing
            Authority to supervise the safety responsibilities of local

             authorities in respect of designated footbal1 gr o u n d s . We
             intend to implement that provision.             Lord Justice Taylor
             would like us to go further and extend the remit of the
             Football      Licensing      Authority     to cover    all     grounds
             designated under the 1975 Safety of Sports Grounds Act,
             and indeed all premises requiring safety certificates or
             licences under Parts III and IV of the Fire Safety and
             Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.              This would require
             primary     legislation and we will         have to consider the
             matter further.       There is, of course, also the possibility
             of a voluntary interim arrangement to             cover other than
             football grounds, pending any legislation.


             Part III of the Report contains a number of proposals
             relating      to     crowd   control      and   hooliganism.         It
             acknowledges       the crucial       role of the police      in crowd
             control.      Lord Justice Taylor rightly         reminds us     that
             without work by the police many sporting events would be
             chaotic and could not be permitted to take place.              He pays
             tribute to the police for their service which he says is
                                              *

             often thankless.       I want to add my personal tribute to his
             and to thank the police for their invaluable efforts in
             maintaining order at sports events.

                          Lord Justice          Taylor also recognises the great potential
                         value of the police National Football Intelligence Unit in
                         dealing with           footbal1-related crime and             with hooligans
                         travelling to matches abroad.


                         As I have said, Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
                         better facilities and better treatment of fans will bring
                         better behaviour.           Beyond that, the Report recommends the
                         creation   of    three       new   specific        offences    to apply at
                         designated sports grounds:             throwing a missile;             chanting
                         obscene or racialist abuse;                    and going onto the pitch
                         without    reasonable        excuse:            and   it    also      asks   for
                         consideration to be given to extending the courts' powers
                         to impose attendance centre orders and for the use of
                         electronic tagging in the case of offenders convicted of
                         footbal1-related offences.                I shall     look carefully and
                     sympathetically            at   the    case        for making     these     changes
                     recommendations.

             Lord Justice Taylor then comes to the question of whether
            there should be a national membership scheme and he says
            that he has grave doubts about the feasibility of the sort
            of scheme envisaged in the Invitation to Tender issued by
            the consultants employed by the football authorities, and
            serious misgivings about the likely impact on safety.                             In
            the   light      of     that,       he      says     he cannot   support the
            implementation of Part 1 of the Act.


           The Government have decided in the light of Lord Justice
           Taylor's advice not to proceed with the establishment of
           a Football Membership Authority.                      Part 1 of the Act will
           remain on the Statute Book lest we have to return to the
           matter.       But the right course now is for us to follow the
           strategy proposed in the Report and give the industry and
           the clubs a final opportunity to                     put themselves in order.
           The public will not forgive them                      if they do not now act.

PUBLIC ORDER - FOOTBALL


Newspaper reports of Lord Justice Taylor's report indicate
that the creation of certain new public order offences is
suggested.  I think you ought to get hold of a copy of the
report and have a look at exactly what is proposed.

I am concerned that you make contact reasonably speedily with
those in Home Office and/or Department of the Environment who
will be taking forward the proposals. New public order
offences may mean extra prosecutions, and resource
implications which are more than minimal. There was some
difficulty in this respect over the Football Spectators Bill,
as I recall. You should have a word with Bruce, who was
dealing with the later stages of that Bill.

Please inform Finance Division of possible resource
implications, if there is any likelihood that new offences
will be brought in and they will have more than minimal
resource implications for us.




                                                                331^7

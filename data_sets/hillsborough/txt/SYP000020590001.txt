TO                                                       21st April, 1989

FROM:

                                                                       l(*
          F.A. CUP SEMI-FINAL - LIVERPOOL v. NOTTINGHAM FOREST
                       SATURDAY, 15TH APRIL, 1989                       Q cU 3L(

I attended the above game and would make the following observations:

1.   I arrived at the ground at 1.30 pm as opposed to 2.20 pm as I
     normally do on league gsunes. The journey to the stadium was one of
     the easiest I have ever undertaken.  It appeared to me that the
     majority of car parking had been well away from the ground and that
     those people occupying areas other than the Leppings Lane end had
     taken up their positions well in advance of the kick-off.

2.   The atmosphere in the car park and the immediate surroundings at the
     Kop end seemed to be extremely friendly and there appeared to be a
     very high proportion of both young children and women in the crowd.

3.   I took my seat by 2.40 pm. Obviously in the stand area the
     atmosphere was of what one would expect.  Unfortunately, immediately
     in front of our seats was another bank of seats,  in which several
     foul mouthed, drunken Nottingham Forest supporters tended to spoil
     the spectacle.

4.   With regard to the Leppings Lane end and the subsequent disaster, my
     companion and I both noticed how extremely congested it was in the
     centre of the enclosure, although there were large spaces on the
     sides.

I do not feel I can make any more factual statements   about the occurence
so I will leave it at that.

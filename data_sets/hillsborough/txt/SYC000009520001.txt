o        Dea r Sirs,

         Re: R E SU MED INQUESTS 19th N O V E MBER 1990.



          If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
          of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
          on the 19th of Nov ember 1990 at 1 0 . a.m. Details of venue will be n o t i f i e d in
          due course.

          I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
          evidence has already be en taken, n o r of the nature and limitations of a
          coronal in vestigation w h i c h you w i l l recollect is not adversarial but
          inquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

          Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
          under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
          w i t n ess es who w i s h to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in c o n s i d e r i n g
          this and in d eterm ining w h o I w i s h to invite to attend.

          W i t h o u t prejudice in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
          to give you an opportun ity to dr aw to my attention the names and other
          appropriate details of any witness or witnesses w h o m yo u w o u l d like me to
          consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

          May I please ask you in c ons iderin g w h e ther you w i s h to draw any names to my
          attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

          I also w a n t to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
          names for c o n sidera tion is n o t hing more than that, and that the decisi on as
          to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

          I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
          heard from you by t                        I will assume yo u have no names to
          submit.

          Yours    faithfully

            ^           Sirs,
o           Re:           DAVID 2, 33EHSOH (deceased) Ho,50
            As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
            Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
            be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
            on the 15th of January 1990.

            I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
            has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
            behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not-to resume the
            Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

            I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
            Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
            he may wish to undertake.

            I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
            or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the

o           matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
            a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
            on this matter further.

            I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
            is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
            fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

            Yours faithfully,

          Dear Sirs,

( )       You will be arare that I do not normally release post mortem
          reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
          in fact put in as evidence.

          However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
          and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
          I have decided that subject to cartain conditions set out below,
          I am prepared to release toyou upon request, the post mortem
          report of your client(s).

          The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

                a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                        subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                        they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

                b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                        conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
                        legitimate purposes in connection with.-any legal proceedings
(J)                     in which solicitors may be engaged.

                c.      Subject to th&';abQV§, they are to be kept confidential until
                        they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

          I have your.request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
          of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
          assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
          each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
          above, and in order to save farther delay and upset to your client,
          I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
          reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
          the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

          The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is    ^ per sheet (total £ 3>- V9                          )
          Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

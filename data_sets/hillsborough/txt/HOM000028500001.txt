      Further to our discussion in connection with the John Motson commentary on the
      BBC video (our ref MAP 7) I have had the tape examined and the following are
      the timings and the comments mades-

         1.   15.04.07

          "I think there may be a slight overflow in the crowd at the Liverpool end,
      at Leppings Lane end of the ground.  But there is room in the sections to
      either side if they can shift them over."

         2.   15.05.34
 J.
I     "I can only think thats overcrowding.                           It doesn’t look to me to be any sort
I’of misbehaviour.”

§      "I have to say that it was crushing that seems from here to have caused
 faccidents and the injuries."     r— — »

   With regard to the plan of the ground. I have arranged for a scale plan to be
   prepared which will include the lettering and numbering of the gates and
   turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end. It will be produced on A3 size which can
   then be reduced to or folded to A4 size.

With regard to             who wrote to the Football Association and the Sports
Minister about last year’s game, I enclose a statement taken from him.

With regard to the traffic delays for Liverpool fans attending the match, work
is in hand to produce a summary note on this subject.

I am arranging for a visit to the ground for 0845 hours on Thursday 1st June to
view the communications arrangements and the CCTV facilities.  These aspects
will be demonstrated by a South Yorkshire Police Officer not directly involved
in the incident. Chief Superintendent Pemberton will be in attendance to
advise on the specific aspects from a general police point of view.

With regard to the levels of manpower, with effect from Friday I will have
reduced to a total of 125 officers involved on enquiries on behalf of Lord
Justice Taylor and H M Coroner.  There will be 38 here in Sheffield, 33 in
Liverpool and 54 at Nechells in Birmingham.  In addition there will be 22
civilian staff. Most of those people who contacted the inquiry either by
writing to Lord Justice Taylor, to yourself, to us, or to others have been
contacted where they are thought to be material witnesses. Questionnaires have
been completed in every case and statements in most.

Enquiries will continue to re-interview many of the fans who were in pens 3 and
4 specifically to identify where they were, who they were alongside and
whether they were witnesses to deaths or injuries.   In particular we will be
attempting to identify the precise time that the crash barrier collapsed. I do
not intend to interview any other categories of persons outside those pens
unless something specifically emerges from the analysis phase on the
information we have gathered.  The analysis should be able to begin in earnest
in about one month’s time. As you appreciate we have a considerable amount of
information which has not yet been processed owing to the need to supply
Treasury Solicitors for the oral hearings.

I trust that this information is of some assistance.

Dear Mr Goddard

RE: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER 15 APRIL 1989

Further to the above, officers from the West Midlands Police are still actively
engaged in the preparation of files for the Coroners inquests.  Part of that
process has entailed the viewing of certain visual evidence by some members of
the deceased’s families.

The material already supplied by your office has been invaluable in this regard
and I am aware that we are in possession of what should be regarded as all
relevant material, however, in one particular instance, one of the families are
of the opinion that they saw their late son alive on the terraces during the
’BBC Grandstand' programme •, which was broadcast on the afternoon of
15 April 1989. My officers have spent considerable time with the family in an
effort to find the footage referred to, without success.

This is a matter of some importance, both to us and the family, as evidence in
respect of this particular individual is weak.  I would be grateful if you
would allow us the facility of a copy of that particular broadcast.

Yours faithfully

                                            I ''© ! ^              L e f --Tr       W W  n

                                                      October 11th 1989

Bear Superintendant Taylor,

Following your letter of September 21st and our phone conversation, I have to
tell you that the BBC does not appear to have any recording of 'Grandstand' as
transmitted on April 15th between 1440-1640. It is not the programme policy
to record the programme on professional videotape though it does record a YHS
cassette. That cassette has gone missing. Despite considerable investigations
ovqr the past three weeks, it has not come to light.

Let me make it clear that when I compiled the professional videotape material
for the Hillsborough Commission of Inquiry, I included all the material that
'Grandstand' had access to. There was only one line from the Hillsborough ground
to the BBC Television Centre. Everything that came down that line from 1438-1640
is exactly as it came into the Television Centre on April 15th. Apart from a
5-minute transfer from a single camera unit at approx. 1610, all the material
was recorded in real time. 'Grandstand', in their transmissions, had access to
no other material than appears on tape 1 and the first part of tape 2.

I am sorry that we are unable to provide a YHS cassette of 'Grandstand', but I
hope this letter clarifies the position.

                                       Tours sincerely

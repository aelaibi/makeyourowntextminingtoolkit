point       some          local          Policemen             came       in     to       warn        everybody            the     Pub         would          be

closing          at       2    pm     (1400)         there          were       no        problems.




We    got       to    the          ground       at    about          2.10        pm       <1410)          and      waited        outside             the

ground          till          about        2.30      pm    <1430)          in        an    attempt            to     swap     our         ground

tickets          for          stand        tickets         -    this       we        were        unable         to    do.

We    knew       where             the     turnstiles               we    required               we                         soon          as    we

entered          the          mass       of    people          we    had       no        choice                                  we       went.

There       were          no       orderly          queues          at    this           stage,          it   being        just       a    mass          of

people          with          just       two    or    three          Police              Horses          trying       to    block          the       outer

gates       to       relieve             pressure          by       the    entrance                 to    the      turnstiles.

                 At        this       paint        I would           describe             it    as    being        e x t r erne mi y         packed,          people

                 unable              to    move      their       arms       freely             and    being        taken          with       the    crowd.              At

                 one        point          I thought            we    were       going          to    get        pushed       over        the      embankment                   by

                 the        River          Don     and     had       to    push       ourselves                away     to    save        ourselves.




                 This           went       on    for      about       twenty          -    thirty          minutes           just       ebbing          and

                 flowing,                 and     people        around          me    going          red       with     having          difficulty             in

                 breathing.                     I feel         now    knowing             what       to    do,     that       if       the    gates       h a d n ’t

                 The        n0xt          thing      I realised             was       that       we       were     flowing             with       the    crowd          and

                 ent/ring                 the    tunnel         which       leads          to    the       terracing.                  I had       been       looking

                 what           appeared           to     be    loads       of       room       and       tried       to     make       towards          it.        I

                 d i d n ’t          realise         at    the       time       that       it    was       a     separate          Pen       as    we    were

                 confused                 when     we     tried       to    make          towards          it     but      couldn't.

Anyway          at    this          point        I    found       myself         being          pushed             forwards          and     I was

uanble          to    do       anything              about       it.       I remember                at    this          point       players

kicking          a    ball          about        on       the    field       but     I ’m       still          not       sure     whether          it

was       the    match          had       started           or    the      players          warming                up.




I found          myself             going        forwards           till       I reached              a    point          about        twelve          feet

from       the       perimeter                fencing,,          coming        to    a     halt       at       a    barrier-            At       this

slight          space          in    front           of    mey'I       was     pushed           forward             and    stopped           with       the

barrier          against             my       stomach.            It     was     really          frightening,                   the     only       way          I

could       br e a t he         was       iri    sWor t         pants,       I was         u n a b l e to           move        in a n y     other

way.        My       head       and       arms        w ere still,             the    only thing                     I could, d o          was

breath,          and       I was          having           so m u c h      d i f f i c u l t y in         doing          that        I honestly

thought          I was          going           to    die.




I was       stuck          like          this        for    about        ten     minutes,             I d i d n ’t         take        much       notice

of    what       was       going          on     around          rne a s     I was         more       concerned                for     myself.              I

can       remember             seeing          Policemen            on     the      fencing           in       front       of     me    shouting

for       people          to    push          back,        but    this       was      impossible                   to    do.      There          were

people          screaming                we     c a n ’t a n d      others          were        panicing.                 I then        remembered

seeing          an   ambulance                  coming          onto     the     pitch,          a    short             while     later          there

seemed          to        be    a    swell           backwards,            this       lasting             for       a    second        or    so.        1

took       this       opportunity                    and    dropped          straight            down          ■- a n y t h i n g      to    get       off

the       barrier.              However              as    I was       dropping            down       my       left       arm     was       caught          as

the       gap    was       shut          with        the    people         pushing          -forward.




I stayed             in    that          position,              crouching            virtually             under          the     barrier          with

my    arm       trapped             on    the        horizontal             pole,         for    about             five    minutes.               My

              I stayed         there       as    1 said             for        about          five       rnintues         until       the    crush

              lightened         slightly             and       I    could           get       my    arm       out.        I was       able       to    stand

             up,    as    in    front       of       the       barrier              there          appeared          to    be    a    bit    more          space

             back,       and    people          were       still              shouting             and    screaming             around       me.           I then

             saw    a    lad    on    the       barrier             where           I had          been       trapped          and    he    shouted             to

             me,    "Help       me,     help         me.           I ’m       going       to       die."            He    appeared          to    be       in

             great       difficulty             his       face       had        gone          bright          red    and       his    eyes       were

             I asked       a    couple          of    other           chaps          -    I d o n ’t          know       who    they       were       to     help

             me,    I then        counted            to    three              and    we       tried       to       push    back       with       our       arms

             to    get    the     lad      out,       but          the        pressure             was    too       great.




             People       were       crawling             over       our        heads          at    this          point       trying       to    get        out,

             At    this    point        the      pressure                 seemed          to       lift       again       for    a    moment,          and       1'

                 A     Policeman                who       I would          say       was    about          fifty       with       grey       hair             (he        had       no

                 helmet              or    hat       on)     told         us    to    put       him    down.           I said,          "He's                dead        the       St

                 John's              have       already           tried."             But       the    Policeman             said       abruptly,                       “P u t     him

                  down          we       know    what        w e ’ re      doing."              1 said,          "We    just       want         to           know        where

                  to    take             him    he's        dead."             The    Policeman             snapped          put    him         down,              and        we

                  did.           I asked             if     t h e y ’d     cover       him       up.        But    the       Policeman                  again            was

                  very          abrupt          and       rude       and       told    us       to    go    away.




                 We     went             back,       and     I d i d n ’t s e e            the       body    of    Keith          McGRATH               again.                We

                 went           back       over        to    the      Leppings             LN    end       and    there       were       people                   taking

                  bodies             away.




                  I then             stayed          in     the      ground          for    a    while       I remember             people                   bringing

                 After          a    while,          I d o n ’t                                k now^'what                                 ti               must    have    been       about       4.30    pm

                 <1630).               I'm      not          sure,                             I went                             back          through       the    gate       into    Pen    4 and       oul

                 through             the     tunnel.                               This                        was                empty          by    this       stage    except       for    the

                 Police.               I got         into                     the                   holding                            area       and       waited       there    a    while

                 getting             my    thoughts                           together.                                            I eventually                   walked    off       and    met    my

                 friends             back       at      the                   car.

                 for      this        as     I realised                                       the                    doctors                    had    more       important       things       to    do.




                 My     own         views       on     the                    incident                                           was       that       if    the    perimeter          fencing       was

                 not      there,           or    had              better                                 openings                           then       the    whole       incident          could    and

                 would          have       been       avoided.

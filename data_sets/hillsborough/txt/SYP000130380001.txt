co-ordinating              body which             attempted              to    ensure        that     a balanced and

consistent           a pproach was               maintained              to    current          i s sues.          Fo r      example             the

Minutes          of    the       Officer          Working         Party were                 taken      by me         due       to m y

position with                   the    Council.             So    far     as       my       involvement              with       the W o r k i n g

occasion          demanded             although          in p r a c t i c e            this     did     not a r i s e           very       often,

owing       to    the       smooth          operation            of    the W o r k i n g           Party.

Regarding             the       reduction          of B a r r i e r       144,          this       arose        at    the       bi-annual

inspection             attended             by the       various          agencies             at H i l l s b o r o u g h          on 7 A u g u s t

1986    (070886).                  Repres en ta ti on was                 made          by the P o l i c e            for       two    s e c t i o ns

o f the      barrier             i n the S o u t h          Central           Pen       to    be     removed          so    that       persons

entering          the       t e r race       from     the        tunnel        would          not     be      obstructed              by    it.

According             to    the       Police       some       difficulties                   had a r i s e n         in t h i s       area.

Following             discussion             it w a s       agreed        by       the O f f i c e r          Working           Party       that

the    barrier             be    reduced.           In a t t e n d a n c e             at    the     time       that       the     discussions

were    taking             place       were       representatives                      of E A S T W O O D S      on    behalf          of       the

During       the       course          of    the    discussion                in       regard        to the          reduction             of    the

barrier          I am       unable          to    rec al l       whether           a ny me n t i o n was              made       on the

question          of       crowd       capacity          of      this     part          of    the     ground.              My    personal

The    significant              changes         arising          from    the       review were                 that    the     Health

and Consumer             Services           Department               now had a          role,          the     inspection            system

specified activities.                         The       practical        effect           of      the     change       to     the

inspection           s ystem was            that        written        reports          were        submitted          by e a c h

authority          to H e a d        of A d m i n a n d L e g a l        Department                 following          an

inspection.              T he    Officer           Working           Party    ceased           to      exist     and       it wa s

replaced         by the S a f e t y           of S p o r t s         Grounds       A dvisory Group.                    As     the       re p o r t

says:        This;-

regular         use w o u l d        probably           be     the    discussion             of     i t em s    of a d v i c e       to    the

Council         before      they are            finally          formulated             by the a p p r o p r i a t e

Authority.              Meetings         of     the G r o u p         would       be    h e l d at        the    request           of     one

or m o r e      Authorities             and     on      receipt        of a       request           the H e a d       of

Administration              and Legal              Department           would          arrange          a meeting           and

despatch a           list       of    ite m s      to     be    discussed.              At     the      conclusion            of     the

meeting         a further            list     of     i tems      would       be    prepared and                 the    details            of

anticipated             that     detailed written advice                           would          be    provided           by e a c h

discipline           and    be a c t e d        u p o n as a p p r o p r i a t e .

copies       of all        relevant           correspondence                 w h i c h will            be a v a i l a b l e    to all

allegations              have       been made              that     the     certificate               should       (for      example)

have       specified           capacities              for    the      pens       on    the       terraces.            At    no     time

s h o uld     be     imposed          in    respect          of     the     pens.           Had     such a s uggestion                   have

been made            I would          have       taken appropriate                     action         (as    I did        for     example

        (Ex                 ).

        Had    any      of       the    experts           identified any                issues          relating          to       reasonable

        safety         then       the     system          I have        outlined            should        h a ve    encouraged              them        to

        raise     them and              have        them       resolved.              There       are     examples            of    such      i s su e s

        on the         Advisory Group                    notes.         It    is a l s o      relevant             to    note       that      it    is

        the    duty         of    professional                 officers          involved          in a n y        Licensing           System           to

        bring     safety              issues        to    the      attention           of    the       Licensing          Authority.                I am
aware       that    the       Green Guide              d oe s      have     a    relevance              to     reasonable             safety

issues       as    does       other        guidance.

Regarding          amendments              to S a f e t y C e r t i f i c a t e s            my    view        is      that     it    is    not

necessary          to    physically alter                       or a m e n d     the       original            certificate

document.           Where        amendments                are made         by       the     co u n c i l      in a c c o r d a n c e       with

legislation             it    is s u f f i c i e n t        that      notice          procedures               as      specified           (in

the S a f e t y     of S p o r t s         Grounds          Regulations)                are       followed.               This       involves

notifying          by    letter        various             parties        involved and                  notices           in the P r e s s .

With     regard         to    the     increase             in    capacity            for     the     Spion Kop             this

procedure          was       followed with                 the     exception            of    the       notice           in the       press.

As    part    of    the       third        element          referred            to    previously               the S a f e t y

Certificate             conditions            were         reviewed         on two           separate             occasions,            the

second and most                detailed           draft          being      circulated               to      the       authorities            for

comment       on 30 M a r c h          1 98 9     (300389).               I produce               the     l e t t e r,     to     the C h i e f

Fire    Officer,             together         with         the     draft        conditions              (Ref        DM8    9)     (Ex             ).

A similar          letter/memorandum                       and     draft        were       sent      to      the       other

a utho r it i e s »

At    the    time       the    second         draft which               considered                crowd        c a p a c i t y was

proposed.           Obviously              officers             comments         on     the       d ra f t ,      which may           have

included          reference           to    capacities,               were       not       made      prior          to    the     disaster

occurring          on the        13 A p r i l         1 98 9     (1 5 0 4 8 9 ) .

The    Council          as    the     licensing             authority            have        a duty          to     enforce          within

their       area    the       provisions              of    the S a f e t y          of S p o r t s       Grounds          Ac t      and

regulations             made     under        it a n d          for   that       purpose,            to a r r a n g e         for     the

periodical          inspection              of    designated Sports                        Grounds.               In     carrying          out

the    functions             I have        described             I consider             that       they        (The C o u n c i l )         have

fulfilled          their       duty.

             and    should       be   read       in   conjunction with                it.         I produce       a    c o p y of     the

             I have        no   reason      to    doubt      the a c c u r a c y      of     the t r a n s c r i p t .        I am

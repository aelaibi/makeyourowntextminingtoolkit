I am Debra June Martin, a former special police constable with South Yorkshire
Police.    There is now produced and shown to me exhibit ‘DJM1 appended to this
my statement.        This exhibit is a statement which I made on 8 May 1989, in relation
to my involvement at Hillsborough Football Stadium on 15 April 1989.


I confirm that the contents of the statement dated 8 May 1989 are true.


In relation to exhibit ‘DJM2’ appended hereto, I would like to point out that the
statement contained therein, dated 17 March 1990, was compiled by WPS 7844
Appleton, a member of the West Midlands police force. WPS 7844 Appleton visited
me at my home on 17 March 1990 and tried to convince me that my original
statement dated 8 May 1989 was untrue.


After exerting considerable pressure on me WPS 7844 produced a dictionary which
she referred to whilst compiling a statement which I believe is the one appended
hereto as exhibit ‘DJM2’. In relation to exhibit DJM21 was unable to read the
statement prepared by WPS 7844 Appleton due to my state of distress brought on by
her behaviour.


I signed the statement which she had prepared because of the pressure exerted by her
and because I wanted to put Hillsborough behind me.

          by ex-SPC D J Martin

       At 10.35am (1055) I left HZLLSECFCUGi stadium to patrol KERRIES PCAD

       Ac this point I saw abcut 6 ticket touts.               I saw them selling tickets

     fars and Notts Forest, who were obviously drunk, although at this

    stage they were behaving reasonably.

    At about 2.45pn (1445) I started to make my way to the LEPPlNGoJ^ME_

    entrance, as I passed what I tHink is the main entrance to the SPICN^

    KOF, the turnstiles were shut dcwn.

    At about 2.50pm (1450) there was trouble at these turnstiles when the

     Notts Forest fans, realising they were being locked out, were trying

     any way they could to get in, this included paying money to the

     turnstiles stewards and trying to buy tickets frcm the touts.      The

     crc-d became very abusive and angry and I had to assist in the

®    removal of fans from the ground, . I was on the read sice ana the

     police inside were passing fans back out over the turnstiles and

     there was a very large numter of fans trying to get in still, so mucn

     that nounted officers and their horses were being pushed up against

     the wall. The next thing I knew is a large blue gate was openea and

     a large nejority of the crowd pushed their way into the ground.      I

     found myself being carried along with the crcv*i unable to resist.        A

     ireuntsd officer grabbed mv collar but hao to let co, bec_use h_ wc

     have been pulled from his horse.       I got pushed to e.e floor, tut I

     nvaracec to cet beck to my feet by pulling myself* up a man's bac.-c.     I

     then rnrerrer opening my eyes and finding myself insice the ground,

     at the be teem of the_Spion Kcpjndjthg_g^es_had been shut behind---

     ne.       I asked the steward on the gate to let me out, but at first he

     refused, it was only when a mounted officer, the same one wno hac

      tri=d to help ne a fev moments earlier, put his horse up acai_^t the

     cat =, he ccer.ed it a short way and let me out.

     One = cutside I found myself surrounded by drunken fans, screaming

      abuse, and the area covered by police.      An officer used my radio to

      try and call for back up but to no avail because the channel was
   MAf t in                DEBRA   JANE


   full cr static.     My radio was handed back to me and I ran to the

  Leepings Lane end of the ground.        Ambulances and police cars were

  rusninc to that end of the ground.       When I got to the Lappings Lane

  enc of the ground I saw a vast crowd outside the turnstiles trying

  to s e t in, it must have been abcut four tiroes larger than the crcwd

  I laft at the other end, so that would mean the crowd at the Spicn

  Kcp end numbered abcut 1000 plus ar.d I would estimate about 4000

  outside Leppings Lane end.

  I can't really remember how, but seme how I got inside the ground,            •

  thrrucn the large blue gate which was open, and I ended up on the         j
                                                                            r
^^itrh.       I did not go through the tunnel.

  One = on the pitch I saw a lot of people who were obviously injured

 and I can rsnember a nvar. caning up to me shouting, "THERE'S TWD DEAD

 YCU EASTARD".      I then saw people who appeared to be dead.    Peccie

 wer= screaming and shouting and ambulances were driving onto the pitch

 I assisted ether police officers with dead and injured people ar.d

 helped to take them cn stretchers to the gym, and I can remember

 sesinc officsrs frcm E2 (WXDSEATS) everywhere.

 I took abcut 6 dead to the gym, as well as irenv injured and whilst I

 w=s trying to revive a ycung bey I remember something hitting me cn

 the bacx of mv head, but I didn't really notice until much later when

 I f-und a larce swelling.      I could see marry bodies being put cn the

 pitrh, seme of them appeared to be dying.       I lost count of the number

 ef bodies I helped carry into the gym.                                             j

 I hsiped carry a ycunc bcv into the gym frcm the pitch nearirv.      He            j
stepped breathing so I gave him the kiss of life, and heart massage                 !

anc a doctor also helped.      He started breathing and opened his eyes,        j
his only word was "JOT and then he died.

At 4.06pm (1606) Dr CURFEN certified death and I stayed with him.           I
     •                     DEBRA   JANE


  would describe him as white male, 5'6-5'7, 14-15 yrs, slim build and'

  brcvn haix, with a cut under his chin.         He had slightly crooked

  te-h, there were no other marks cn the bcdy.          Ke was wearing a white

  shirr, green sweat shirt, beige trousers, white socks, white Reebcks

  and green and white boxer shorts.         He had a gold metal chain with a

 gold horn, a bus ticket, a train ticket and an entrance ticket.           He

 hac no identification or money.          I later found cut the number given
 to this boy was 5i.

 I stayed with the body and at 5.20am (0520) Sunday 16 April

 (160489) an ambulance arrived and I went with the body together with

 DC ^ N T and GRIFFITHS to the Medico Legal Centre, WATER LANE,

 Sheffield.   I s<_ayed with the body until he was striccec and details

 taks.n frun me.   I finally went off duty at 6.30 (0630) cn Sunday

 16 April 1989 (160489).

          j ^ z z h e z to my previous statements I would like to acd the following,

           Cn Saturday 15th April 198? (150489) I worked in the capacity of

           Special Constable at the F.A. Seni-Final football match between

           Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. which was being played at

           the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield.

           tty recollection of the events of that day are vague and confused.

           As i result of the disaster I was prescribed medication by ntv Doctor

           to assist me to sleep.        I was really upset tv the whole incident and

          was cn medication for abcut a week.                    The result being that I was in a

          state of what I can only describe as semi-consciousness.                                       I felt like

          a 'Scrrbie.'

          As - result of this I feel that my memory, mv recollection of that day

          is possibly inaccurate.           I am unsure of what time I arrived at the

          Leppir.cs Lar.e entrance to the ground cr even hew I came to be cn the

          picrh but I aid.

          Ey time I got onto the pitch it sezred to be mass confusicn, there

                    police officers and supporters all over the place.                                  I could see

          people who appeared to be injured and possibly dead, lying cn the

                         a state of shock.       I didn't knew what to do but my

     *■*1     instinct             was to help thesepeople in the best way that I could.

:    c2n-t describe to you in any detail my exact movements over the next

half an hour cr so.                I knew that I approached several people lying on

che pitch and assisted if possible.               X did not give any of these

people      m o u t h - to-mouth   or heart massage.

I dscided that there were enough people dealing with the situation

at the Leppincs Lane end of the grcund and made my way to the Spicn

Kcp end of the ground.
I csuld see that bodies v«re being carried frcm the Leppincs Lane end_

to C e Spicn Kcp end of the grcund and then being placed on the pitcn.

I assisted to carry a number of dead and injured people fron the Spicn

Koc end of the pitch, into the gymnasium where a temporary mortuary

hac been set up.            I was talking to sane of these people, comforting

then and trying to reassure then.               I am unable to d e s c r i b e '"any of

these people in the detail.

By   this tire I really was in a state of shock, I couldn't believe wtat

I v - seeing.           I sesred to be on automatic pilot.          My memories are

very ccnfu-ssci fine ciisccr"csci.

I cin recall carrying a youth who X new knew to be, Kevin Daniel

WTLLLAf-S fron the pitch to the gymnasium.                He was the last person thau

I assisted in carrying.                I first saw Kevin WHi.IAMS lying cn the pi ten

near to the gcal area at the Spion Kcp end of the grcund.                      At that

st_2 re he wasn't on a hoarding or a stretcher.

 I r-renter that there v^re several people around where he was lvmg.

 I can't recall anyone giving him mcuth to mcuth.                   With e.e help of

oth=r people, who.I can't recall, Kevin WILLIAMS was placed onto a

 hoarding and carried into the gymnasium.                 Someone instructed me to

 stay with the body.
       riN               DEBRA   JANE                                         3


  I   didn't knew what to do.    I didn't want to believe the boy was dead.

  I didn't knew if he was dead or not but I decided that I had got to

 attempt to revive him.     I started to give him mouth-to-mouth but

 sar.3cr.e, I ccn't knew who, touched me cn the shoulder and told ire he

 was dead.    By this time mv head had gone, I wasn't aware of what I was

 doing or what was really happening.

 At 16.06 hours (1606) Doctor CURPEN examined Kevin WILLIAMS and

 certified him dead.

 I rsmember a detective officer, DC Paul MSNFREDI helping rre to

 complete the GEN 18 form (sudden death form),

f s caved with the body until the early hours of Sunday 16th April

 (160489) when I escorted Kevin WILLIAMS, who at this stage had not

been identified, to the Medico Legal Centre.

I identified the bedy by the number allocated, which in the case was

Nurrcer 51.   I had no further dealings with Kevin WTLLIAhSS.

This statement is made to the best of my recollection and I believe it

to be the truth.    However, under the circumstances I cannot be

positive that the details are accurate.       I have been quite badly

affected by the whole incident ar.d I am trying to erase it frcm my

memory.

I have marked on a plan of the pitch (Reference D.J.M.l) the

approximate location where I first came into contact with the

deceased, Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS.

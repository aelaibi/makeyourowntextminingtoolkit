Dear Dr Brade

HELLSB09ROOGH INVESTIGATION - REQUEST FOR DRAWINGS

Flakier to our recent telephone conversations, I confirm
trarc copies of the drawings, which you produced for HSE
on behalf of the Inquiry, should not be supplied to
parties involved in civil actions arising from the
disaster.

I understand you have received a request from Hammond and
Suddards, representing South Yorkshire Police, for copies
of the drawings. This matter is now being dealt with by
Treasury Solicitors and I will inform Hammond and
Suddards accordingly.

Yours sincerely

HIIISBORCOGH - REQUEST FOR DRAWINGS

i^fcive received a request for copies of the drawings
jMpared by Ralph Brade and Associates for HSE on behalf
of the Inquiry. A copy of the request is attached. It
is Mr Whalley's view that these drawings are the property

Yours sincerely

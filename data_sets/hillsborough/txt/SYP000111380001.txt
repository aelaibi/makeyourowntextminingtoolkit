                   Following       packed meal,          deployed to      point    on Leppings Lane      (see

possession of a radio,                   the Serial       Sergeant    being the only Officer                   to

have    one.      Duties         at this    point    involved       placing    barriers across

E skdale Road and only                  permitting    local    residents access.             At    this

time    there were a few Liverpool                   fans making       their way to the Leppings

Lane    stand for the opening                of the ground at          12 noon.



As ground opening                time    neared the       number    of supporters       gr a d u a l l y

increased and there was a steady stream of fans                               to the ground.               I

remember       that    from       IE noon until about          2.30    p.m.    the    number      of fans

walk i n g    up to the          ground    seemed    to    increase    once then s u d denly

decrease,       a lt h o u g h    there was always          a large    number    of them walking




                                                                                                                     f

fams were walk i n g             up and down L e p pings       Lane              c h of anyone with

spare    tickets.          These        particular    fans    seemed    to form       into    large

 g
 r oups along L e p p i n g s Lane and were                 a sked to disperse         by Officers

w h i c h they did only to gather a g a i n                 on some    other    part    of the       route.

I was    not asked,           personally,      by any Liverpool          fan    if    I knew      of any

spare    tickets,        although         1 believe       other Off icers may have            been.            I do

remember       that    several          Liverpool    fans were asking where             there was a

public house.            This      h a p pened on several          occasions and because             I was

unfamiliar with            the area        I could not       tell    them.     Several       times    1

noticed       that    certain fans a p p e a r e d         to be going       to the    ground only              to

return down L e p p i n g s Lane.             This    occured       constantly during          the

a fternoon.          Although       the    crowd seemed       in good humour          there were

                         ho      I w o u l d say had been drinking and a l t h o u g h they

were    not    too    drunk       they were v e r y boisterous          and noisy.       Moun t e d

Branch       p a trolled      continuously.

                                                            I remember         it was a continous                stream of

                  large    numbers        of fans,       some who had been drinking,                    others who            had

                  not.     However,        the   crowd a p p e a r e d to be making               their way         to the match

                  w ith no problems          and from-my own vantage                       point at the j u n c t i o n of

                  Leppings Lane and Eskd a l e Road,                    e v erything a p p e a r e d      in order as           they

                  w a l k e d to the      ground.        As kick      off time approached,                however,           more and

                  more    fans w e r f increasing            their      pace,        some    running,     o b viously         so as

                  not to missr the          start    of the game.



                  Just    pfrior to 3 .00        p.m.     I was a p p r o a c h e d        fay Police S e r g e a n t Reynolds

                  who asked me to a c c o m p a n y          him w i t h other             officers,     including           Police

                  C o nstable 2 668 Fletc h e r           and Police Con s t a b l e            114 Br'adley to the

                  L e p p i n g s Lane    end of the        ground.         I unde r s t o o d at this           time that

                  there was a d i s t u r b a n c e       outside       the t u rnstiles and several                   other

                  officers were making              their way there.                  Upon arrival         I saw      large

                  numbers     of Liverpool          fans,      I cannot            really say how m a n y , outside                 the

                  gro u n d gates and at           the    t u r n - s t i 1e s .     The    crowd was      not      pushing     or

                  shoving,       but was m e r e l y made          up of numerous              people    just mill i n g about

                  At this     time       I believe       gates B and C were                 closed whilst           gate A was

                  also    closed and        I believe,         a ground        steward was          in a t t e n d a n c e    at this

                  particular       gate.     ^Wsj/were ordered by a Senior Officer                             to    clear     the

                  crowd from the turn-stile.                     I do not           remember the        rank     of the       officer

                  and do not       know his        name..      In company with other                 officers,         the     fans

            I t hen.heard an officer ask             for men to go        into the       ground behind the

            m a i n stand.      I went    forward but was          then stopped by another Officer

            who a sked us to assist with             crowd     control    just    outside       the ground and

          . to    clear   the way for      e m e rgency vehicles,        which a r r i v e d    in a very

            short     time.     At   no time was     I involved        in the    removal       of bodies.



            S u b s e q u e n t l y the L e p pings Lane    stand began to empty.              Numer o u s

            L iverpool     fans were      hurling abuse at Officers.               All   were      upset,     some

            more      than others,      several   were      limping.



            After      one and half      hours approximately,' we were             told to at t e n d        in the

                       INCIDENT      AT     HILLSBOROUGH     15-04.89.


Time:

 8.15 am     On duty at Stainforth Police Station.                   Subsequently paraded at

             Doncaster DHQ.          Transported toHillsborough.



 9.50   am   Parade at Hillsborough            in company with Serial Sergeant PS 1561

             Reynolds and other members of serial including PC 1280 Hebdige,

             PC 3145 Punton, PC 1169 Kerr.



10.50   am   Following packed meal,            deployed to point on Leppings Lane (see

             attached map)           junction with Eskdale       Road.      Point    covered by

             myself PC 31^5          Punton and PC 1280 Hebdige.          None of us were in

             possession    of        a    radio,   the Serial    Sergeant   being    the    only

             Officer to have one.              Duties on this point involved           placing

             barriers across Eskdale Road and only permitting local residents

             access.     At this time there were a few Liverpool fans making

             their way to the Leppings               Lane   stand for the opening of the

             ground at 12 noon.



             As gound opening time neared the number of supporters gradually

             increased and there was a steady stream of fans to the ground.

             I remember that from 12 noon until about 2.30 pm the number of

             fans walking       up       to the    ground   seemed   to   increase   once   then

             suddenly decrease, although there was always a large number of

             them walking to the ground.



             From 12 noon until 3.00 pm it became apparent that large numbers

             of fans were walking up and down Leppings Lane in search of
                                              - 2 -


          anyone with spare tickets.                  These particular fans seemed to form

          into large groups along Leppings Lane and were asked to disperse

          by Officers which they did only to gather again on some other

          part        of   the    route.       I   was        not       asked,   personally,       by    any

          Liverpool fan if I knew of any spare tickets, although I believe

          other       Officers     may     have    been.            I    do   remember     that    several

          Liverpool fans were asking where there was a public house.                                    This

          happened on several occasions and because I was unfamiliar with

          the area I could not tell them.                           Several times I noticed that

          certain fans appeared to be going to the ground only to return

          down        Leppings     Lane.          This        occurred        constantly    during       the

          afternoon.         Although the crowd seemed in good humour there were

          numerous fans who I would say had been drinking and although

          they were not too drunk they were very boisterous and noisy.

          Mounted Branch patrolled continusouly.



2.30 pm   From    this      time    until     3.00       pm    the      crowd along      Leppings       Lane

          increased dramatically.                  I remember it was a continuous stream

          of large numbers of fans, some who had been drinking others who

          had not.         However, the crowd appeared to be making their way to

          the match with no problems and from my own vantage point at the

          junction of Leppings Lane and Eskdale Road, everything appeared

          in   order       as    they    walked       to      the    ground.       As    kick     off   time

          approached,           however, more and more fans were increasing their

          pace, some running, obviously so as not to miss the start of the

          game.



          Just prior to 3-00 pm I was approached by PS Reynolds who asked

          me     to    accompany        him   with       other       Officers     including       PC    2668

Fletcher and      PC 114 Bradley to the Leppings Lane end                   of the

ground.       I   understood        at    this time       that   there      was     a

disturbance       outside    the         turn-stiles      and    several     other

officers were making their way there.                     Upon arrival I saw

large numbers      of Liverpool           fans,   I cannot really          say how

many, outside the ground gates and at the turn-stiles.                            The

crowd was not pushing or shoving but was merely made up of

numerous people just milling about around the turn-stile area

and the main      ground gates.          (please see map)



At this time      I believe gates B and C were closed whilst gate

A was     also closed and I believe,              a ground steward was in

attendance    at this particular gate.                 We were ordered by a

Senior Officer to clear the crowd from the turn-stile.                        I do

not remember      the rank of the Officer and do not know his

name.     In company with other officers the fans were moved

from the turn-stile area out onto Leppings Lane, through the

exterior gates to the ground.



I then heard an Officer ask for men to go into the ground

behind the main stand.          I went forward but was then stopped

by another Officer who asked us to assist with crowd control

just outside the ground and to clear the way for emergency

vehicles, which arrived in a very short time.                    At no time was

I involved in the removal of bodies.



Subsequently       the   Leppings         Lane    stand     began    to     empty.

Numerous Liverpool fans were hurling abuse at Officers.                           All

were upset some more than others, several were limping.

          After H   hours approximately we were told to attend in the

          North Stand for de-briefing.   After de-briefing took meal at

          Claywheels Garage.



8.15 pm   Off duty at Stainforth.

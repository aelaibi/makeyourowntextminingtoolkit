Thank you for your letter of 17 November to Chris Bone. I am sorry you have not heard from
us earlier.

We have now compared the copy of the body file relating to Gary, which you gave us, with
that held by South Yorkshire Police. I can confirm that the file in your possession is identical
to the police copy.

I am therefore returning your copy of the file with thanks. I apologise for the number 3 which
has been written on the top right hand comer of the first page of the file. This is a document
number, entered erroneously when it was placed in one of our own files.

Yours sincerely

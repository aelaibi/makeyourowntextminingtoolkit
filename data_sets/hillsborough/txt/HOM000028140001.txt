Dear Mr Leopold

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

I mentioned to Mr Mervyn Jones recently some correspondence which
Lord Justice Taylor had received from Liverpool City Council
about the football match between Coventry City and Everton on 19
August. This correspondence began with some serious criticisms
of the attention which had been paid to the safety of spectators.

Lord Justice Taylor is in some difficulty with this
correspondence/ because many of the allegations made by Everton
fans are refuted by authorities in the West Midlands. Lord
Justice Taylor would be very grateful for any further comments
you might have on the correspondence/ a set of which I attach.
Mervyn Jones knows the background, but if you would like to
discuss it with me, please get in touch (I sun afraid I sun not
available now until 16 October).

                                        Yours sincerely

     Dear Sir,

          Following serious allegations by Everton fans, arising from
     the crowd management operation and entrance/exit facilities in
     operation at Coventry's ground, on the opening day of the season,
     this Working Party called for a full investigation by the football
     authorities given the nature and consistency of the representat­
     ions made to this office.

          Please find enclosed copies of twenty signed statements from
     fans in attendance which formed a representative cross-section of
     the complaints presented to the Working Party in over 100
     telephone calls.

           Included in the dossier contained herein is a complete file
     of all our correspondence on the identified incidents including
     a futile (minuted) meeting with representatives of the West
     Midlands Police, Coventry City Council and Coventry City Football
     Club.

           I trust this material will be of some benefit to your deliberations
      in phase II of the Hillsborough Inquiry and serves as an indicator
      of the continuing 'piecemeal' approach to matters of safety following
      the publication of your Interim Report.

                                                 Yours faithfully,

                                                       }\ .

                                        Councillor: H. Chas
                               Chair, Hillsborough Working
                                                    Party.

    When calling or telephoning please ask for
      is the statement of
and                                                            we were Everton fans

                                  flus-usr-
We both arrived at the turnstile area of the Sky Blue Stand at approximately
2.30 p.m. We both had £7.00 "Sky Blue Terrace" tickets for this stand.

Having passed the stand we were to access on our transport, we knew exactly where
out entrance area was. This was about 1.45 p.m. We took some refreshment and
then attempted to join a queue at 2.30 p.m.

When we arrived we confronted an orderly queue for two turnstiles to our left
which were taking cash payment. Our turnstile, two in number, was blocked by
supporters. There appeared to be little movement forward. Police Officers present
made no attempt to filter and channel fans to our turnstile into an organised queue.

There were no more than four Officers on duty until just before kick-off time when
ifficers were drafted into this area. One Officer informed us that he had been
failed from the Coventry City Centre area as back-up.

From 2.30 p.m. onwards the presence continually built up and anxiety increased
proportionately. The actions of one mounted Officer to force fans against a wall
only aggravated the situation. At no time were loud-hailers used to aid the
situation in this area. We overheard Officers sending radio messages to the
effect that there were problems outside TE' block.             ,

Sometime around 2.50 p.m. after repeated requests from fans for the kick-off to be
delayed the Police claimed to be communicating this request. One WPC claimed that
the kick-off has indeed been delayed. This of course was not the case.

Repeated attempts to discuss our problems rationally led to Officers claiming "I
suppose we are going to get the blame again . . . . it is the clubs fault . . . .
write to them with any complaints". Indeed the WPC claimed that they had
underestimated the amount of Everton1s travelling support. As far as we could see
the Police could not handle the situation. No sensitivity was shown to the Everton
fans in our vicinity. One fan was told by a Police Officer to write to Geoffrey
Dear.

We decided to withdraw from the crowd when the mounted Officer began to press fans
against the wall. This was about kick-off time - the crowd behind and around us
by now were crushed. We feared for our safety.

Leaving this mass of people we heard a Police Officer say "it has gone ahead . .
it is too late". By this he obviously meant the kick-off. We hung back and
witnessed about four fans who had gained a refund on their tickets. At this
point we spoke to the Policeman from the City Centre. He told us we could collect
a refund and go in the ground where there was loads of room. We presumed he meant
the Everton Section. Only on entering the ground did we realise he in fact meant
the Coventry Section, where there was plenty of room and no queues. I (Christine),
commented, quite reasonably "you have not learned from Hillsborough", to which
he replied "Oh, come on we have had only 3 months". He admitted to me, in his
own words, "this is fucking chaos".

We actually entered the turnstile at 3.20 and took up our seats. We were the
last people to enter these turnstiles. A steward indicated where our seating area
was. With no row lettering on the steps we could not locate our seats. Seat
numbers were marked in block felt tip ink only. We sat in two empty seats.
 Having missed 25 minutes of the game we felt aggrieved having paid £7.00 each.
 We then watched the match uninterrupted.

  We were told to, stay behind for 10 minutes after the final whistle to receive
  an escort back to our transport, j At 4.55 approximately we assumed we would exit
  the ground throjugh the stand exit at Thackhall Street. The two sections of the
  stand were expected to exit through a small opening in a corrugated (sheeting)
  fence that ran parallel to the segregating radial fence. No stewards or Police
| were available to advise and monitor the crowd flow in our section. At this
* time it was sheer pandemonium. The pressure was greater than that experienced
! outside.

 After some ten minutes the pressure eased off only because we again - as outside -
 pulled out of the throng. Many fans again asked Police Officers to intervene
 but to no avail.

  We cannot understand why we had to exit the stands via the Coventry City terracing
^Jrea. As we left the ground we could not help but notice the amount of Police
^Vitside the stadium. No formal escort was organised to our knowledge.

 Our experiences outside the Ground prior to kick-off, and leaving the ground
 left us disgusted especially in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster and
 Justice Taylor's Interim Report. The Police response to ours and other protestors
 was lamentable.

 It appeared to us that ticket allocation, turnstile allocation and the exit system
 in operation was not capable of dealing with the numbers of Everton fans present.
 To blame fans for turning up late, as the aforementioned WPC commented really
 borders on disbelief.  If you cannot get in with a ticket when you arrive some
 30 mintues before kick-off then what use are Taylor's recommendations.
 Mismanagement, disruption and a lack of communication characterised the Police
 operation on the day for visiting fans.

      I arrived at the ground at 2.15 and went to the stand which I
was told by fans was full, i I went to the turnstiles for away fans
paid £6 and got in at 2.35.1 The ground was fulli       The stairways
were full.    I went to the sltairs up the higher terrace.     I could
not see anything.    A WPC was trying to move people off the steps
but there was no-where to go.     Several people were coming back
down the stairs saying it was no good.      The gangway between the
upper and lower terrace was now full.      I could not see and could
not move.     The police moved to open      the gate between the home and
visitors section where there was an empty section on the home side.
A surge of fans moved towards the gate HOPING TO GET A BETTER SPEC
IN THE EMPTY SECTION.    The police (and stewards) however delayed
in opening the gate.     At this stage      many people were indistress and
urging the police to do something. Now I could not move at all.
The police responded by telling people to stop swearing.        An older
   iitleman who was obviously in some distress, was attempting to

«  imb down into the walkway from the upper terrace.       The WPC
   physically got hold of his leg and tried to push him back,
 continuously telling people to stop swearing.      Many people
 suggested she should tell other officers what the problem was,
 her reply was "I've got a job to do". When the older man had
 got over she told him to behave etc.     Many people were annoyed
 and frustrated and tempers flared a bit.

     Just before kick   off the police opened the gate and a large
influx of Everton fans went through.    I was relieved to be out
of the crush.

     I was one of the last ones in before the gate was shut.     The
police ordered everyone into the lower section, which was full.
The stairs down were full.   We could not get in.   A policeman
said there was room for another 200 which was rubbish.     We could
not physically get into the terrace.    The policeman said "You
either go in there or   I'll throw you out of theground -you've
got thirty seconds to decide".

     About five mintues into the game I stood up on the wall behind
me.  Others were continuously asking police to allow them into the
upper terrace behind me which was empty, the police refused saying
there was no-one going into that section.

      During the game several fans were thrown out for swearing.
 Despite being in the Coventry fans' terrace there were no
 problems at all - except their singing!

      Mid way through the first half I saw a large influx of fans
 into the away fans seating area.  Hundreds had no seat.

      At this stage there were still a few hundred waiting at the
 gate in the gangway.

      Some were allowed into the terracing behind me.  An argument
 started between two policemen.  Where I was standing one, whose
 radio was not working, was shouting across the terrace to another
 policeman at the gate to open it immediately and let them through
 he replied "no - no more 'til half time".  This argument went on.
 At half time some more fans were let in.

     At the end of the game we were kept in the ground for 15 minutes,
getting out was_a crush - p e a c e f u l . - --though. Many fans complained
tHey~RK3-’not seen any of the game at all.

     The attitude of the police and stewards was terrible they had
no control of the situation, had obviously underestimated the
number of Everton faijs who would travel. Had there
of fans into the ground injuries and possibly deaths could have
occurred.  This would be the fault of the club and p o l i p
COVENTRY CITY vs. EVERTON

Saturday 19th August, 1989

Statement of 1


We arrived at the ground at 1.45 p.m.  After the Hillsborough
disaster we thought it best to arrive early and avoid any
crush at the turnstiles.

As we went through the terrace turnstiles there were 2 police
officers and one was showing the other a manual and saying
to him "and if this happens you do this".  We thought it
strange they should wait until almost the kick-off before
running through procedures.

We had no problem getting onto the terracing at the Swan Lane
end and we positioned ourselves on the "shelf" part of the
terrace so we could get a better view.    The "shelf" became
very packed as did the rest of the terrace and the police
opened a gate into the empty pen adjoining the area were the
Coventry fans stood.
               v O K c L _____
Obviously fans srlStj were being crushed on the "shelf" and the
other terracing tried to move into the empty pen.    This led
to further pushing and shoving and increased discomfort.

One man in his 5 0 's was so desperate.to get out he climbed
up the dividing fence to get into the pen but a policewoman
told him to get back into the crowd.    Pleas fell on deaf ears,
The tannoy system was almost inaudable and there were no
announcements that the pen was being opened for late-comers.

At half-time I tried to get a drink at the refreshment bar
but you had to clamber up and over fences to get to it.

We were kept behind for 15 minutes after the match ended and
again no tannoy announcement was made.  When we were finally
allowed out there was a terrible crush as .'•■.he exits were so
narrow.          —

     Statement o f ;
     Merseyside.



         I arrived at the ground at 1.10 p.m. and parked at the
    Mercer Arms Car Park.  It was £2 to park.  We walked down
    Swann Lane to meet some friends from Coventry.  There were
    already people queuing outside the ground.  The turnsiles were
    closed and there were no police about.

         We returned to the ground at 2.30 p.m.  We had paid £9.50

♦   tor stand seats and we were surprised to find a mass of people
    outside the turnstiles.

         There were 2 police on horses (one was a senior officer -
    he had a flat cap) and a couple of special constables by the turn­
    stiles.  None of them seemed able to control the crowd.  It was
    quite frightening and many people mentioned another Hillsborouqh.
    Tne police made no attempt to form queues.

    u    I protested to the flat-cap that something        must be done.
    He said,    go and stand by the pub with .yfcurmates   and r.cotll
    call y.oo over one-at-a-time" . It was 2.55 p.m.       We didn't follow
    nis ridiculous advice.    We eventually got in at      3.10 p.m.

         There were 4 turnstiles in all which was totally inadeauatp

     can   you sort this out".  "Shut up or I'll arrest you" was the
    response.

         We got to our seats which were on the back row.  People
    around us had tickets but no seats and sat or stood in the gang-
           0thers had £7 seat tickets and were in the £9.50 section.
    I did not see a steward in the stand.

Saturday,   19th August,   1989


Statement of
Liverpool, 4.


     I went to the match with my son aged 12 years and we went
on the terraces.  We had no trouble getting into the ground
but by 2.30 p.m. it was getting very crowded.  The police
opened a gate into an adjoining pen at about 2.40 p.m. and
loads of people tried to get through.  After the pen filled
up a bit the police closed the gate.  We were left by the
gate and I asked the police to let me through because we
were being crushed against the fence.

     The police told me to move back over the terrace but that
was not possible because of the density of the crowd.  I asked
them how could we go back and they said "get your mates to
move back".

     Eventually we climbed up onto the "shelf" section of the
terrace.  Fans were talking to the police through the fences
and asked them time and again to open the gate but they said
they weren't opening the gate again.  The fences caused a
very restricted view of the pitch.

     The police opened and closed the gate a further 4 or 5
times and each time people rushed to get through.  This
resulted in fans actually climbing over you to get through.

     When the game started we could hardly see any of it
because of the fences.  There was a continuous verbal
exchange with the police.

      "Let us through the gate"

      "No, watch the match"

      "can't see the match because of the railings.   Its
       like Chester Zoo in here".

      "you should have gone there then".

     An officer who had some pips on his uniform told us he
"didn't get these by knowing nothing" in response to questions
about policing arrangements.  Someone asked him if he was
in charge at Hillsborough and he was thrown out.  When we
complained we were told "shut up or we'll arrest you".

     The Officer with the pips went missing.   When he came
back he said he had been to the control room to ask if he
could open the gate but they said he couldn't.

      At half time they let people out of the pen to go to the
 toilet.  This made for further confusion as others claimed
*




    they had been to the toilet to gain access to the pen.  A policy
    of "only 60 went out so only 60 can come back" was operated
    which left many who had been in the pen unable to get back.

           During the verbal exchanges in the second half the police
     admitted they had made a mess of it and they would have to
      look atit again.     They tried to blame the club and 'pips'
    ; said it   would have been better to fill the small pen first.
     We asked'pips' if we were getting locked in.    He said we were
     but no announcement was made until the match had finished.

           As the fans began leaving with 10 minutes left the
    1 announcement was a little late.  You could hear people
      shouting and screaming from the area by the exit gates.

           I've been watching Everton since I was 6 years old and
     the chaos and the police operation was one of the worst
      ever.    It was also noticeable that the police wore jackets

    •that coyered their numbers.

Statement of
        Liverpool,       4.


I arrived at the ground at 2.35 p.m. and had a £9.50 stand
ticket.  There were no signposts to indicate.were I should.go
and after going 'to thr^TOKg^parT*' o f t h e ground a police
officer directed me to a set of 4 turnstiles.       Two of the
turnstiles were for those with tickets and two for those
paying cash.

There was no proper queue at the turnstiles - it was like
a large rugby scrum 50 deep.  There were 2 officers on
horseback who didn't do anything.  I asked a police officer
to get the game postponed for h hour.  He said "don't
think we haven't tried - can't get through".

At about 3.10/3.15 p.m. I got through the turnstiles and I
spoke to a police officer and asked him if his radio was
working.  He said it was o.k. and let me listen to it to
prove it was working.  I could hear an officer saying
"... still Everton fans outside - we are trying to get it
under control..."

 There were 2 stewards on the stairs leading to the stand.
 My seat was not taken as my mates who got in before me had
 moved people from them.   Fans were sitting on the stairs
 and the police moved them to the back of the stand.    5
 police then stood in the middle of the stairway blocking my
 and other fans views.   We approached the officers and asked
 them if they could move but they said their sergeant had
 told them to stay there.   However a few minutes later
 they moved.

 With 5 minutes to go we decided to leave as did quite a
 few others.       The police told us that we had to stay behind
 for 10 minutes             t&e^e h-a-d &©■ announeeHtenrt Qii&r feJie

 The police officers said they were closed for our safety
 and escorts to the trains and coaches would be provided.
 I asked about those of us who came by car and was told we
 would be o.k.

  Later on the police said the gate we were next to would
  not be opened and we would have to go out another way.

    There was a lack of police control.   One officer said "we
    don't usually get this many ". Most of the police were
    either very young or were specials.   The turnstiles were
    completely inadequate as well.

Statement- of


     I arrived at the ground at 2.30 p.m.  I had a £9.50
stand ticket.  There were hundreds of supporters around the
4 turnstiles.  The police horses had only just arrived as I
got there.  Fans were not being organised into proper queues
and some were nipping in front of others.

     My ticket was for Section E.        I looked for direction signs
but couldn't see any.

     The police seemed unable to handle the crowds.  A man in
front of me with a small girl asked a police sergeant whether
he could do anything about it.  "Get your mates to move back"
was the response.  An officer was pinned to the wall by the
turnsiles and was appealing to his colleagues for something
to be don e.

     I got in at 3.05 p.m. and went to find my seat.        Last season
the seats were not numbered and were not allocated.        This year
someone had numbered them with a felt-tip pen!        When we found our
seats people weT^'already in them’T u t they m o v e d . Fans were
still coming into the ground until half-time.

     I saw some stewards inside the ground but they were too busy
dealing with complaints and questions.  There were no clear sign­

gate went to get out and those of us in the stand went to get

STATEMENT    :   COVENTRY CITY V. EVERTON


My name is
             I am 21 years of age and attended the Coventry
City - Everton Football Match on Saturday, August 19th, 1989.

I arrived in Coventry at 2.45 p.m. and with no directions to
a car-park it was not until 3.00 p.m. that I entered the ground.
My delay was caused by traffic problems on the M.6.

I was with a friend and we paid cash to enter into the East
Terrace Vicitors Section.  Getting into the ground was no
problem and fans were still arriving up until about 3.15 -
3.20p.m.

Upon entry we couldn't find a place to stand as our section of
terracing was full. We stood on the gangway between the upper
and lower section.  From this position we couldn't see the pitch
at all.  Not able to gain access to the lower terrace we stood
on a stairway which led to the top section or 'shelf' terracing.
From this position, with limited views, (75% of the pitch) we
watched the first-half of the match.

At half-time there was the usual activity.  We moved to          the
lower section of the terracing next to the radial fence          that runs
from behind the goal to the back of the terrace.  Still          with a
limited view, due to the nearby fencing, we watched the          second
half.

Some five minutes before the final whistle (approximately 4.35)
we began to make our way to the exit to avoid the rush to leave
the ground.        No tannoy message _indic.at^cLthat the Everton fans
had to remain i n ’their positions.            We were penned in the above
merit"ione ct*”cen t r a I - q anqway . Because no-body was aware the exit
gates were locked pressure conseiquentTybuilt up behind us.

When people began to realise there was no movement the pushing
relented.  Because of the heat and the concentration of people
it became an unpleasant experience.

We witnessed a police-officer above our heads in the police
control box offering hand signals which I took to mean an
indication of the time we had to wait before the gates were
opened.  We were held             c-t-ei»-;*minut.es after the final
whistle.  I was in~this crush for at least fifteen minutes
given I had tried to leave before the match itself ended.

fA fight broke out directly in front of where I was standing at
 approximately 4.45 p.m.   Some half-dozen Everton fans were
 fighting amongst themselves.   People were too concentrated for
 the police to intervene though they did not attempt to do so
 even though it took place behind the police control box.
 The struggle last some 3 0 seconds and ended.when Everton
 fans intervened to break it up.
                            - 2 -




When the gate was opened a wee e of fans were
                                    !

J5^*cf^sh, perhaps the worst I have ever encountered leaving
a ground.

We experienced no further problems other than the usual traffic
build up accessing the M . 6 except for a 10 minute delay while
Everton coaches departed from their pick-up point.

around 2.20 p^m.    At this stage there weren't that many around
t ^ T u Tnstlfes but the queues were losing shape.

     We just didn't seemed to be moving at all and the crowd
|ehind us got bigger.  Fans were being searched at the turnstile

     At around 2.4 5/2.50 p.m. we asked a policeman to get the
kick-off delayed.   He went into the sky blue shop and we saw
banging his radio as if it wasn't working.

     The crush got quite bad and I was shoved over by the wall.
The female special constable at the turnstiles looked very pale

     Fans asked a police officer on horse-back to get the kick
off delayed but he said he didn't have a radio.  The specia
didn't have radios either.

      The special constable shouted to the sergeant on horse
 back to do something.  He did this several times but the sergea
 didn't react - he either didn't hear him or he ignored him.

      I have been going to football matches for 34 years and I
 have never been so frightened.  There was                insx e
 the ground and it took us ages to find our seats which

             I arrived at the ground at about 1.15 p.m.  There were 3 0 0/
        400 fans queuing for the terraces.  I got there early following
        the Hillsborough Disaster and the publication of the Taylor
        Report.  At 1.30 p.m. the gates were opened.  There were very
        few police around and I heard one say "It's about time the gates
        were open".

             I was standing on the "shelf" part of the terrace.  It was
        quite full by 2.15 p.m. and at about 2.30 p.m. a man on the
        touch-line with a megaphone requested that we "move forward and

    •   iet our friends and compatriots in". We shouted that there was
        no room for people to keep coming in. More and more fans came
        onto the terrace and there was a terrible crush.  To make matters
        worse the fences badly impeded your view of the pitch.  There is
        just no way that Coventry's ground can hold such numbers of
        people and for them to see the game in comfort.

             I could see only 3 exits; one onto the pitch, one from the
        middle section of the terrace and one at the corner of the
        terrace which was only wide enough for 4 people shoulder-to-
        shoulder to pass through.  In an emergency there was no way
        you could have rapidly cleared the area.

             I didn't see any police officers or stewards in our part of
        the terrace - there was no one to appeal to about the crushing
        problems.

             We were locked in 10/15 minutes after the game had finished
        which led to friction amongst the fans who wanted to get out.
        In fact there were a couple of fights but these were stopped
J       by other fans.

        improve but it hasn't.

             In 24 years of watching football this was definitely one of
        my worst experiences.

                              OU/iO    LlCU,
Dear Sirs

I wish to express my disgust and downright disappointment as to the way
Everton Supporters were treated on the opening game of the new season, by
Coventry Police and Coventry Football Club. The date 19 August 1989 - the
place Highfield Road.

Has nothing, one asks been learnt from the aftermath of Hillsborough.    The
same scenes could so easily have been repeated if it wasn't for the
commonsense, patience and resourcefulness of the Everton fans.

The same excuses have been stated today, 21 August 1989, by Coventry Police on
local radio. We did not know how many fans to expect, they arrived la e ,
"We couldn't delay the kick off". The only one not to materialize was
"everyone was drunk".

 Everton had sold their allocation of stand tickets by Thursday afternoon.
 Surely this must of emphasised the amount of people who would ascend on
 Highfield Road.

 The visiting section aptly named the Blue Stand, as that is what I did for the
 time I saw this match, had four turnstiles operating, some for cash, others
 for ticket holders who had “pSTTthe grossly inflated price of £9.50.

 On arriving at the ground the time being 2.35pm, I was confronted with what
 can only be described as chaos. People not knowing which queue to be in or
 even where to start q u e u ^ g . The Police Officers on duty in their wisdom
 were content to look on without a care in the world attitu e.

 The three Police Officers on duty at the time did not make any attempt to
 quell the pushing and ensueing crush until 2.55 pm, five minutes before the
 start of the game.

 Requests of "get the kick off delayed" was met with, "we don't have the
 facilities". In the 45 minutes I was in the queue I did not see any attempt
 by a Police Constable to use the valuable piece of equipment they carry ca e
 a Police Radio. Another breakdown in communications.

  I eventually gained admission into the ground at 3.20 pm, to see only mo^
  mis-management by Police and stewards unfold. People ...were W • ^ r o n g seats
  standing at the front and in the aisles, also complaints of duplicated tickets
> could be heard. I myself could not get a seat as the one a]l°ca^ d to m       c.
  occupied and as far as I could see so where the rest. For the rest
  first half, 15 minutes, I remained standing.
At half time I made my way to to the so called refreshment area, only to be
confronted by more mayhem and five Special Constables discussing what had
happened earlier. I purchased one cup of fizzy orange, five minutes after the
second half had commenced. The pies, sausage rolls, crisps etc had obviously
been eaten by the first five people to arrive at the 'shed' marked
refreshments.

I then proceeded to watch the remainder of the second half in a standing
position.

What a shamble, all in all a good day ruined by bad (disgusting) Policing,
inadequate entrances, seating and facilities. For too long the football
supporter has been treated like a third rate citizen.

T rfomand a full enquiry, a full explanation


Yours disconsolately

We arrived at the ground at 1.45 p.m.  After jfhe Hillsborough
disaster we thought it best to arrive earlyjand avoid any
crush at the turnstiles.                  Jr

As we went through the terrace turnstiles there were 2 police
officers and one was showing the other JL manual and saying
to him "and if this happens you do th| © ". We thought it
strange,they should wait until almost^the kick-off before
running through procedures.        #

We had no problem getting onto th§f terracing at the Swan Lane
end and we positioned ourselves g$i the "shelf" part of the
terrace so we could get a bettei#view.   The "shelf" became
very packed as did the rest of :he terrace and the police
opened a gate into the empty   in adjoining the area were the
Coventry fans stood.

Obviously fans       were bejfng crushed on the "shelf" and the
other terracing tried to m#ve into the empty pen.      This led
to further pushing and s h y i n g and increased discomfort.
                          $
                         f
One man in his 50's was|so desperate- to get out he climbed
up the dividing fence     get into the pen but a policewoman
told him to get back i$to the crowd.      Pleas fell on deaf ears,
The tannoy system was/almost inaudable and there were no
announcements that trfe pen was being opened for late-comers.
                    /
At half-time I trif€ to get a drink at the refreshment bar
but you had to claiiber up and over fences to get to it.
                  §
We were kept behind for 15 minutes after the match ended and
again no tannoy#?announcement was made. When we were finally
allowed out th^re was a terrible crush as the exits were so
narrow.

The policing/outside the ground was non-existent.

the away supporters ticket office but when we got there we were
told that tickets were only available at the turnstiles.

     When we got to the turnstiles 2        of them had small signs
above them stating "tickets".  After        a few minutes queuing
we realised they were for those fans        who already had tickets
so we went to the unmarked turnstile        and paid cash to get in.

     As it was only 1.30 p.m. and there was already a great
deal of confusion amongst the very few supporters outside the
ground»I can easily understand how the reported chaos
developed later on.

     We had no problem getting our seats but there were a lot
of fans sharing seats.   The stewards were trying to stop
people getting into the stand and this went on for the first
^ hour of the match.   Many fans were standing in the gangways
or sitting on steps.

     At the end of the match we had to stay back for 10 minutes.
We got up and^tob'd'by the exit gates.  After 15 minutes we
started shouting to let us out.  An officer who had pips on
his uniform was standing on a small roof surveying the crowd
and speaking into his radio.  We shouted to him to open the
double-gates.

     We were told to turn around and go back up a small passage
and pass through a small gate.   We were being b a d j ^ ^crjashed
and asked a police officer why* the double gate wasn't opened.
He said it wasn't his fault.   Paris wer§ slioutirig at the police
that they hadn't learnt anything about Hillsborough.

       On the approach roads to the stadium there were no
signposts to direct supporters to the stadium; atWcfc^^*s»ti#dium
tftfsre      no,, signposts, to, direct .supporters to, their
respective parts^qf,, the.; g-round and the information at the
turnstiles was confusing.

 19th August 1989

 Statement of E
                                                1

 I went to the match with 4 other people andiwe had £9.50 stand tickets
 we had bought from Everton.  We arrived at the ground at 2.35 pm.
 There were very few signposts and we actually walked past the turnstiles
 we should have passed through.  This was because we couldn't believe
 such a disorganised massive queue had paid $9.50 each for stand seats.
 When you pay such prices there is usually no queue or very few people
 waiting.  There must have been 3/4,000 people waiting and it just
 spilled into the street.

 Tflfc 'queue' was just left to organise itself and it became worse as
 the kick-off approached as fans became more unsettled.    There were
 two mounted police officers and we asked them to do something such
 as form queues.    They said there was nothing they could do.  It got
 worse and worse as more fans arrived.

 One man demanded that the police take action.  "Can't you do anything
 about it" he said.  The police officer smacked him across the face.
 "Is this how you deal with complaints by beating people up" the man
 said but the officer just turned his back.

 There was a young lady with her son who was aged 6 or 7.  She was
 petrified about what was happening and she mentioned Hillsborough.   I
 escorted her and her son out of the crowd and took her to a man with
 a white shirt with pips on who appeared to be a senior officer.   He
 escorted us to a side gate and into the stadium.

 When we got in the ground there was a couple of very young stewards
 and no one asked to see our t i c k e t ,stubs.   When I got to my seat it was
 occupied.  I asked the people to move        and they sat in the gangway.
 It was about 3.-5/3.10 pm.  The police moved people away from the
 staircases but they stayed blocking our view.         Fans shouted to them
 to move and they did but then the fans they had moved came back.          You
 had to pick your way through people to get to the toilet.

 At the end of the match we were going down the stairs when we heard an
 announcement that we had t o stay back  and we would be given a police
 escort. At first I thought it was just for the terraces but our exit
 gates were locked.  The police acted provocatively and formed a human
 chain to stop people moving forward.   They even tried to stop fans coming
 down the stairs but the pressure was so great the the police cordon
 was broken.

M Fans were pushed up against the gates and we shouted to'the police, "let
f1us out, this is ridiculous".       After 15 minutes the police said they
  were noi^Qpening the gates and jwe would ha.ve. J;o turn around and cjo out
 "'nnriffrrc** ^wny. Th£re was a tremendous^orush   and children   had €6He
  passed otit. One man had climbed^on top of        the turnstiles to escape
  the crush and he was shouting to the police to        open the    gates.One
  officer remarked that the police operation        was "how you    treat
  peasants".                                         . .
jL'here w S ^ s e v e r a l police vehicles outside the ground but once we had
turned'left to go to our car there               no police.  We saw a young
girl being dragged across the road as a group of Coventry fans waylaid
her.    Some Everton fans charged them and they ran off.

The police monitoring and control of the crowd was non-existent,
jrh^re was no attempt to control the crowd and the police did not
Iseem to know what they were do i n g . The stewards were very young and
ineffective and getting out of the ground was a disgrace.

 COVENTRY CITY vs EVERTON
 SATURDAY, 19TH AUGUST 1989


 Statement-, of



 We arrived at the ground at 2.25 p.m. and we had stand tickets
 for which we had paid £9.50.  Our tickets were for Block 'E1.
 We went to the turnstiles for Block 'E' but the gateman told us
 t ey were for Coventry fans only and we had to go to the visitors
 section.

There were two queues outside the turnstiles but there were no
signs indicating where you should queue if you had a ticket or
were paying cash.

^We had to ask a Police Officer on horseback where we should queue.
 There were only 2 turnstiles and the build-up of fans was too
 great for the turnstiles.  The Police did not attempt to organise
 queues and consequently problems of crushing occurred as it
 approached kick-off time.

An Officer on a horse who had no number except for a 14 1 1 on his
helmet responded to calls for help and to organise the queue by
waving his white riding crop at people and advising us to "tell
your mates to stop pushing".

There were about 6 Officers by the turnstiles who did nothing.
They just ignored fans pleas for help and the fans comments like
 haven't you learnt anything since Hillsborough".  We had to pass
youngsters caught up in the crush out to them.  There was no
drunkeness it was just a question of sheer numbers and insufficient
turnstiles.

After we got through the turnstiles at about 3.10 p.m. we saw 6
Officers in yellow jackets chatting away.  There was a steward
at the foot of the stairs who did his job well directing fans to
their seats.

Our seats were at the back of the stand and were unoccupied.    Other
fans tfere not so fortunate and had to stand up or sit on the
stairways.   We met fans inside who didn't get in until after
3.20 p.m.

After the match we were held in for 10 minutes.  A small gate was
then opened which led to the terraces.  The gate was only 6-8
feet wide.  There was a terrible crush to get through the gate
and in the 'alleyway' to the terraces which had a bend in it
causing further crushing.                                    *

Fans tried to climb over the fencing to avoid the crush but Police
told them to get down.  When we got outside there were many
Police.  A lad aged about 25 years said something to an Officer
on a horse.  He was grabbed by the scruff of the neck.  Two Police
came over and grabbed the lad and then an Inspector went over
                                     - 2 -


    and did a rugby tackle on all three causing them all to fall over.
    Fans were shouting at them and questioning the need for the
    manner of the arrest.

    In over 40 years of watching football it was one of the most
    frightening experiences I have ever had.  The Policing was quite
    simply awful and 1 speak as a former J.P. who served on the bench

 Dear Sir,

 With reference to the crowd management problems involving Everton
 supporters at Coventry City's Football Ground on Saturday,
 19th August last.

 Following a torrent of protests from Everton fans, to this office, we
 wish to solicit a response from you regarding the police operation
 at the visitors sections of Highfield Road on the day in question.
 The basic corroborated allegations are as follows

 -   That the officers on duty to the visitors turnstiles area of
     the Sky Blue Stand did not operat^,A,_queuejIntg; regime. No
     attempt was made to filter and channe l pe op l e in this area.
     Given only four turnstiles were available at this point to not
     operate          low system would compromise recommendation 2 8
     of Lord Chief Justice Taylor's Interim Report.

 -   That repeated requests by fans for a delayed kick-off were met
     with firm refusals.  Given the consistency of fans statements
     to the failure of crowd supervision at the Sky Blue Stand it
     would appear this decision was somewhat misplaced as many
     fans did not access the turnstiles until after 3.15 p.m.

 -   Police communications were confusing and on occasion failed.
     Officers are reported!to have held heated arguments amongst
     themselves on the terracing behind the goal concerning the
     overfilling of the Everton section.  instances of police radio
     failures have also been identified.  In the wake of Lord
     Justice Taylor's comments on police communications this matter
     is of some concern.

     Reasoned complaints to police officers from individual fans,
     were often met by abusive language and misleading claims.
                               -2-


As officers of the West Midlands force acted as agents for Lord
Chief Justice Taylor it concerns this authority that recommendations
3,9,19,27,28 and 29 of his Interim Report appear to have been
compromised on the basis of these allegations.

Quite clearly Coventry City Football Club and the local authority
have much to answer for and a dossier of fans statements will
be forwarded to Lord Chief Justice Taylor, the Football Association,
Football League, Football Supporters' Association and Coventry
City Council.  With regard to the police operation at the visitors
sections of Highfield Road I suggest the enclosed allegations
require investigation.

Yours faithfully,




Councillor H. Chase,

        Dear M r . Roxburgh,

        With reference to the crowd management problems involving Everton supporters at
        Coventry City's ground on Saturday April 19th last.

        Following a torrent of protests from Everton fans to this office I wish to
        solicit a response from you regarding the existing General Safety Certificate
        for the Highfield Road stadium.                                           *

        The allegations, listed below, raise serious questions about the adequacy of
        the Safety Certificate in the wake of Lord Chief Justice Taylor's Interim
        Report particularly in relation to recommendations: 3; 9; 13; 18; 19; 27; and
        28.  As the licensing authority we are concerned that Coventry City Council, as
        a responsible authority, investigate these matters forthwith.

        The basic allegations are as follows:-

/   X                      .
^       -    severe crushing and unrelieved pressure at the 4 turnstiles allocated to
             visitors in the Sky Blue Stand-. Arrivals at the back exceeded the rate
             of turnstile flow and no queueing regime was imposed throughout:

             severe crushing and unrelieved pressure occurred at the egress gate,
             adjoining the stand and terracing areas, which visiting stand occupants
             had to exit after the game:

             overpacking in the visitors' pen behind the goal was not relieved until
             half-time when police officers allocated an adjoining pen to a number of
             Everton fans.  This pen already contained Coventry City supporters:

             Police officers misled and misinformed fans about a delayed kick-off.
             Some officers blamed the overcrowding to the turnstiles on the fans
             themselves.
Currently we are formulating a dossier based on statements taken by my staff.
The consistency and clarity of the allegations suggests that an investigation
is warrented by yourselves, the football authorities and the Football
Association.

I am sure you will treat this matter with the utmost urgency.   I await your
reply in anticipation.

Yours sincerely,




Cllr. Harry Chase,
Chair Hillsborough Working Party.

Dear Mr. Kirton,

With reference to the crowd management problems involving
supporters of Everton Football Club at Coventry City F.C. on
Saturday, 19th August last.

 Following a telephone conversation between my research officer and
 yourself on Monday, 21st August I write to confirm the nature and
 seriousness of the incidents discussed.

 A deluge of complaints continue to pour into this office regarding
 serious allegations about the conduct of the crowd management
 operation at the visitors sections of Highfield Road.  The allegatic
 basically identify four problems:-

 -       severe crushing and unrelieved pressure at the 4 turnstiles
         allocated to visitors in the Sky Blue Stand. Arrivals at
         the back exceeded the rate of flow through the turnstiles and
         no queuing regime was imposed throughout;

 -       severe crushing and unrelieved pressure occurred at the egress
         gate, adjoining the stand and terracing areas, which stand
         occupants had to exit after the game;

         overpacking occurred on the visitors pen behind the goal causing
         police officers at half-time, to open up the pen allocated to
         Coventry supporters to relieve the pressure;

  -       police officers misinformed fans about a delayed kick-off and
          many fans were balmed for the absence of a queuing system.

  A copy of the dossier will be forwarded to your office. Lord Chief

Dear Councillor,

     I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 23rd August, 1989, concerning the
complaints received from Everton F.C. supporters regarding the crowd control
arrangements at the Coventry City F.C. ground on Saturday, 19th August, 1989.

     This matter is receiving urgent attention, contact has already been made
with the Secretary of Coventry City F.C. and steps axe„
to prevent any repeat of the incidents complmnga of.

     I       am calling for a full report from the Secretary of Coventry City F.C.
and I will communicate with you again in due course.

                     Dear Councillor Chase

                     SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
   G •               COVENTRY CITY V EVERTON
                     19 AUGUST 1989

                     Your letter dated 23 August 1989, received by facsimile transmission
                     addressed to Mr Iain Roxburgh, my Chief Executive, has been passed to me
                     for reply as it is this Department in conjunction with the City Secretary
                     that has responsibility for overseeing safety at sports grounds.

                     Your Working Party would seem to be making a number of serious allegations
                     concerning safety standards at Coventry City Football Club’s Highfield Road
                     Stadium, however, as a preamble to my reply you should be aware of the
                     following facts.

                     Immediately on publication of the Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor’s interim
                     report into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster a meeting was called by the
                     City Council of all those parties interested in safety at sports grounds,
                     namely

                     1   The Local Authority
    V .'
                     2   Coventry City Football Club
                     3   West Midlands Police
                     4   West Midlands Fire Service

                     This group which has always met on a regular basis was immediately
                     reconstituted into a Formal Advisory Group and it was agreed that future
                     meetings would also include representatives from the West Midlands
                     Ambulance Service and a Supporters Group.

                                                                                        Continued




                                                                       Head of Planning:
                                                                       Bernard Dowell
                                                                       Head of Economic Development:
                                                                       Christopher Hammer
                                                                       Head of Administration:
                                                                       Roy Davies
                                                     2

             The immediate responsibility of this group was to make sure that the 28
             points of the Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor’s interim report were implemented
             as far as was practically possible before the commencement of the 1989/90
             football season. I am satisfied that this was achieved.

             As you are no doubt aware, Coventry City Football Club had considerable
             foresight in attempting to create an all seater stadium for viewing
             football many years ago, but this was frustrated by fans who wished to
             stand. Be that as it may the total spectator capacity of the stadium was
             significantly reduced by the experiment and currently is a mere 26,218.

             A new General Safety Certificate was issued to the Club on 24 August 1988
             and this has been amended once since that date. Coventry City Football
             Club have recently made application for a further amendment of their
r            General Safety Certificate concerning reduction in ground capacity in the
\            light of recommendations. Furthermore, the City Council will be carrying
             out a review of the Safety Certificate in its entirety, also as
             recommended.

             There have never previously been allegations of crowd problems, either
             inside or outside the ground, which were beyond the control of Police or
             stewards and which could have prejudiced safety.

             The problems which were encountered on Saturday 19 August were in the
             opinion of the Advisory Group - many of whom were present - of a minor
             nature and certainly not beyond the capabilities of the Police to control.

             Taking your allegations point by point

             1     The Coventry City Football Club have acknowledged that there was a
                   problem concerning the rate of admission of visiting spectators to the
                   seated areas of "The Sky Blue Stand". This has been identified by the
                   Advisory Group as being due to spectators possessing tickets and those
/                 |wishing to pay by cash attempting, to pa|? ,througti,rit^e same TurnS^ttes.
                 yLTfre problem TS&s been addressed, a solution put forward ancT'^So^ffS^by
    —            Imthe Advisory Group. It must be said that the situation was
                  "exacerbated by the late arrival of Everton supporters.

        ,,   >    At no time was there "severe crushing and unrelieved      pressure" and the
                  Police did impose‘'lT queueing regime.

             2    It has been the policy, as it is at many football grounds, for the
                  Police to keep "away" supporters inside the stadium until such time as
                  the home supporters have dispersed.

                  Although it is acknowledged that there was crowding, there was nothing
                  exceptional in the size and density of the crowd which would have
                  warranted any Police or steward intervention.

                  I believe it is the intention of the Match Commander (Police)
                  to elaborate on the point in his reply to your letter to
                  Mr Geoffrey Dear.
                                                                                          /3
                                     3

3   I must entirely refute this suggestion. On analysis of the figures,
    at no time was a density of more than 44 person per 10 m2 of terrace
    prevailing on the visitors terrace. The pen did not contain any
    Coventry City supporters.

4   The Match Commander (Police) in charge of policing matters on
     19 August entirely refutes the claim that his officers misled and
    misinformed fans about a delayed kick-off. There was never any
     suggestion of delaying the kick-off. Police officers are there to
     assist the fans, not to attribute blame.

I would be pleased to inspect your dossier of complaints when it is
complete, but I must say that on the^ unchallengeable information available
to me I feel that the matter does not warrant any further investigation.

Yours sincerely

♦
 Dear Sir

 I am directed by the Chief Constable to reply to your letter dated the 23
 August 1989 about the difficulties experienced on 19 August 1989 by some
 Everton supporters, and other related matters.

 I am aware of the content of the letter sent by you to the Chief Executive
 of Coventry City Council which arrived in time for its content to be
 discussed by our Advisory Group. The Director of Economic Development and
 Planning will reply to you on behalf of the Advisory Group, but as
 Match Commander on the day I will comment on the points in both letters
 which relate solely to the policing of the event.

 Since the Taylor Enquiry, recommendations 1, 2 and 3 have been addressed by
 the Advisory Group, and as a result the capacity, of the Highfield Road
 Ground has been re-adjusted to 26218. Of that number, 5849 is allocated to
 visiting supporters; 2789 for those seated and 3060 for those standing.
 On the date in question the attendance was 17981 which included 5540
 visitors, 2578 of whom were seated and 2962 standing.

  Closed season improvements carried out in the visitors seated area were
  designed to separate the covered from the uncovered area. Those
  improvements allowed the club to re-introduce reserved seating for the
  convenience of seated supporters and to make marshalling and stewarding
  more effective.

  For the match itself, our intelligence indicated that between
  Everton sLuppo-p-teers wouTcl attend the match and that the overall atten ance
  would be in the region of 19,000. It became apparent quite early on in the
  week that the seated and standing overspill areas for visiting supporters
  would be required. That information was relayed to the club and
  re-inforced on Friday morning as a result of information received from
  Liverpool. The policing operation was adjusted to accommodate a capacity
  crowd in the visitors areas. The tactics used by the Police have been well
  practiced in the recent past and reviewed in the light of the events at
  Hillsborough and the recommendations made by Taylor.

We have experienced larger visiting support and never before had
allegations of crowd problems, either inside or outside the ground which
were beyond our control and which could have prejudiced safety.

 At the pre-match briefing the potential for a capacity visiting contingent
 and our response to it was dealt with in detail, and sufficient reserves
 identified, again in line with the recommendations made by Taylor.

 The club informed us that almost 2000 tickets had been sold before the
 match and that a further 600 were to be made available for sale on the day;
 again a normal practice.

 The four turnstiles in question are described by the club as being s Io t .
 Their potential rate of flow indicates an ability to admit one persorFevery
 4 seconds, that rate correlates very well with the capacity for that
 viewing area (recommendation 19)-

 Two of the four turnstiles into the Sky Blue Stand were initially allocated
     ticket holders and two for those wishing to pay. Our deployment
KPmprised 8 officers and a Supervisor and 2 mounted officers. At
 2 .15pm we were aware of a build-up of supporters at those four turnstiles.
 This was seen on the ground cameras and reported by the Officer Second in
 Command of Operations, who was at the scene. It was apparent that the
 queuing was to the two pay gates but at that time, the queue was orderly
 and good humoured. There was no queuing at the ticket turnstiles. At that
 time there was not need to increase Police presence at that location.

 The situation was monitored and at 2.25pm.there was evidence of an increase
 in the size of the queue and an additional 10 officers and 2 mounted
 officers were deployed to that area. It was congested in the immediate
 vicinity of the turnstiles but along its length, supporters were queuing in
 twos and threes. At that time, it is true to say that more people were
 arriving than were passing through the turnstiles. Those joining the queue
 again did so in twos and threes. There was a separation of ticket and cash
 queues and it is reported by the Sector Commander that those wishing to pay
 cash formed orderly queues, whereas those with tickets were not so orderly.
 There was an attempt made to form the ticket holders in to some sort of
 order using horses and foot patrols, but because of complaints, the tactics
 used by mounted officers were eased. I was able to view the events on the
 video and there was no request from the Sector Commander to deploy other
 available officers to the scene. I was satisfied with the tactics being
 used and the number of officers deployed to what was a relatively small
 crowd. By 2.40pm the cash sale gates were re-designated "ticket only" to
 ease the congestion outside the tickets turnstiles.

 There is no funnelling at those turnstiles and therefore, the verbal
 advice and containment tactics from the mounted and the 18 officers was
 ample to control the 400-500 supporters who were outside the ground. I
 think you will agree that the number of officers at that location was
 appropriate to deal with the numbers waiting, but we could do nothing about
 the rate of flow through the turnstiles. Our tactics and availability of
 resources was fully in line with the letter and spirit of recommendation 28.
                                         -   3   -




    I am aware that by 3.12pm there were no queues at any of the four
    turnstiles mentioned. There were the inevitable late arrivals who
    experienced no difficulty in gaining access to the seated area. You will
    see from the details given in the jthird paragraph of my letter that the
    number of visiting supporters was under the reviewed capacity. The "Green
    Guide" density recommends 54 persons per 10 square metres. A 15% reduction
    in that figure results in a recommended density of 46. On Saturday the
    actual density averaged out at 44 persons per 10sq.m. I have had the
    opportunity to view the video of the crowd which shows there to be ample
    room in the visiting standing area. The Director of Economic
    Development and Planning will respond to you in more detail about
    densities and video footage which1completely refutes the allegations
    contained in your letter to the Chief Executive.

      At 3-00pjp it was estimated that there were 400 spectators,waiting.a,t the
      foy.ir,.tWr’Q.sj;iles, and at' that time I still had 18 patrol and 4 mounted
   "“"officers in attendance. The presence of that crowd did not constitute
         ther a public order or a public safety risk. I was able to police the
    ^ P o w d inside and outside the ground, and the mere fact that there were^
t*    people who could not get in in time to view the kick-off is not sufficient
      justification to warrant a delay in the kick-off. That option was
      considered by me prior to the players taking to the pitch. That fact was
      relayed to those still waiting outside the ground. They were
      understandably unhappy and frustrated about their delayed entry, but in the
      circumstances were quite orderly. It is interesting to note that one
      complaint related to a persistent refusal to delay the kick-off, yet in the
      letter to the Chief Executive one of the complaints was that we misled fans
      about a delayed kick-off! There was little the Police could do to
      relieve that frustration as we had no control of the speed of entry of
      those fans into the ground. I saw no justification to order the kick-off
       to be delayed and on reflection I still consider that to be the right
       decision.

     There is no doubt that a number of people were frustrated at not being able
     to get into the ground in time, even though most had arrived early enough
     to do so. I would say that the 400 outside the ground probably arrived
     near to the kick-off time. Nevertheless, the fact that quite a few of
     them were frustrated can have implications for public order with
&    consequential safety ramifications. The mood of a few visiting supporters,
     and only a few, made marshalling and stewarding thereafter more difficult
     than it should have been, but I can fully understand their feelings. On
     Monday morning I expressed my views to the club on the delay caused by the
     turnstile configuration and other related matters. That was discussed at
     the Advisory Meeting on 23 August. The outcome of that meeting will be
     outlined in the letter from the Council.

      In relation to your third point, I recollect that the communications on the
      day were good and that there were no systems failure. The volume of radio
      traffic was reasonable and did not pose any operational problems to the
      experienced operator, nor did the volume of information being fed into the
      Command Post. I am not aware of any heated arguments or disagreements
      between Police Officers in the overflow section behind the Everton goal, or
      in any other area. It is true that officers spoke strongly to one or two
      fans. I have viewed the video of that section of the crowd and it
      appeared well behaved, requiring little intervention by the Police.
Nothing occurred which would have led to a 'discussion' on policing tactics
or action. I certainly saw no arguments between officers. My enquiries
since receiving your letter confirms that fact.

Referring now to the last allegation about the ttitude of my officers,
They were briefed to act in a courteous, firm ar<d positive manner and to
communicate a philosophy of professionalism in dealing with both home and
visiting supporters.                            j
We tried to deal with a frustrated section of the crowd with firmness and
understanding but it was perhaps inevitable, where the tempers of some of the
fans were becoming frayed, that there was a breakdown in effective
communication.   At the end of the day, allegations of curtness from both
sides were inevitable and understandable.

 If I may touch briefly on the letter you sent to Coventry Council, there is
 no evidence whatsoever from the video to support the allegation that there
^was severe crushing or over-packing of the visitors pen which we refer to
    the overspill area. I can make the video of thisavailable to you,
 Jhich will show quite clearly that conditions within the crowd generally were
 comfortable and in the pen referred to specifically by you, you will see that
 conditions were very comfortable indeed.

I listened with interest to some of the comments made on Radio Liverpool
and you may have heard that I responded to them all. Some of the comments
about the absence of police , the time taken to get into the ground and
that some fans were still queuing at 3.40pm were wholly inaccurate and
unhelpful.

 Like many other grounds, including Goodison Park, the visiting supporters
 are kept in until the streets are relatively clear of home supporters. You
will fully understand the reasons why we continue to employ that tactic.
 There were 6 announcements made to the visiting fans that this would be
 done and as far as I am aware, there was no severe o\tgrcrgwdio^^wthe
^approach to TEe~exiT gate. Beaming ‘in mind we were under the reviewed
                      rea there was nothing exceptional in the size or
 density of the crowd which would have warranted police or steward
 intervention. Our Police box is situated just 10 metres from that exit
 gate. It is elevated some 5m above the crowd and the windows at the front
 face out on to the main exit gate and have excellent views of the
 crocodile which forms behind that gate. Police Officers manned those gates
 and assisted with the stewarding of the exiting fans and I , as Match
 Commander, had an un-restricted view of the exodus of..f^as^>§gj|iu.-iMittiing
 exteptlonal"Cq "Jasf.ify the' allegation that there was severe crushing at
 that ■location.    ‘    "                                              ■

I hope the above comments have eased your fears over the conditions
reported to you. I can assure you that everything possible was done on
the day to allow the match to take place in a safe environment. Having had
the opportunity to again review the events of the day I am satisfied that
the spirit and letter of the Taylor report were followed and that there
were no safety problems at the ground.

Chief Constable,
West Midlands Police H.Q .,

Dear Mr. Dear,

     Following the recent complaints from Everton Supporters
regarding aspects of crowd safety at the Coventry City -v-
Everton match on Saturday, 19th August, 1989, members of the
Hillsborough Disaster Working Party were invited to visit
the West Midlands Police at 7M 7 Division Headquarters in
Coventry.  This meeting took place on Wednesday, 6th
September, 1989.

     Unfortunately, the meeting did not resolve most of the
issues we raised.    The supporters complaints centred around
the lack of police control and poor turnstile facilities
outside“the Sky-Blue Stand from 2.15 p.m.   onwards and
localised overpacking on the terraces from. ,2.35 p.m.  The
edited police video of the scenes outside the Sky-Blue Stand
did not commence until 2.57 p.m. and offered a very
restricted view;  the video of the terraces was inconclusive
and the still photographs of the terraces were taken during
and after half-time.   The video evidence neither proved or
disproved the supporters7 complaints.

     I had hoped that we could have either supported the
fans7 complaints and then taken the appropriate action to
ensure such problems do not happen again or that we could
have been reassured that the complaints were unfounded.   To
be left doing neither is a most unsatisfactory situation.

         I have requested the Football League to hold

    you^will also investigate the problems the suPP°£ters have
    raised.   I have enclosed copies of statements which
    supporters have submitted to me.

  Dear Mr. Dent,

       With further reference to the crowd management problems
  involving supporters of Everton Football Club, as detailed
  in our recent correspondence, at the request of
  Superintendent Birch, as commander of the police operation
  at the match, I, along with Councillor Steve Ledwich (Chair
  of the Liverpool City Council Licensing Sub-Committee and
  Chair of the General Safety Certificate Advisory Group) and
  two Council officers, attended a meeting on Wednesday, 6th
  September 1989 at Coventry Police Headquarters with Graham
  Hover (Secretary, Coventry City F.C.), D. Giles (Chief
  Building Surveyor with Coventry City Council) and other
  police officers.

       Relying on a heavily edited police video for the
  visitors7 terracing and turnstiles, together with
  black-and-white photographs - the latter taken from 3.57 p.m.
  onwards - of the terracing, all three officials dismissed
  the allegations on the .basis of the 7evidence7 provided at
  this meeting.

       Throughout the meeting we contended, and continue to
  contend, that the evidence available to our group was
  highly selective and irrelevant to the substance of the
  allegations already tabled and documented.  Concern at the
  quality, character and presentation of this evidence was
  compounded by a joint decision of Mr. Hover and Mr. Giles to
  deny our request - presented well in advance of the meeting
  and again during the meeting - for an accompanied visit to
  the ground.

Mr. J. D. Dent,      ,
The Football League.




     Without access to the Highfield ]Road stadium the visit
to Coventry by our delegation proved futile.

     In consequence we consider the allegations remain open
and require a full Football League investigation.   Our
confidence in the response of the West Midlands Police,
Coventry City F.C. and Coventry City Council in the light of
our approaches has proved misplaced.

                                Yours sincerely,




                               Councillor H. Chase,

   Department of the Environment,
   2 Marsham Street,
   LONDON.
   SW1P 3EB




       Dear                Mr. Moynihan,

       On the opening day of the new football league season on Saturday,
       19th August, 1989 Everton F.C. played Coventry City F.C. at Highfield
       Road, Coventry.

       Over 100 telephone calls were received by the Hillsborough Working
       Party office from Everton supporters raising serious allegations
       about the crowd management operation to the visitors sections of the
       Highfield Road ground.

       The Working Party began an immediate investigation into the complaints
       and 20 statements were taken by officers of the Working Party from
       Everton supporters.

      A dossier of these statements have been handed to West Midlands Police
      and the Football League.  Copies are enclosed together with other
      relevant documentation.

       The main complaints raised by the Everton supporters are:-

                  inadequate turnstile facilities to the visitors' section of the
                  Sky-Blue Stand where, in the absence of a queueing regime, arrival
                  at the back exceeded the rate of flow causing severe localised
                  crushing and unrelieved pressure;

                  severe crushing and unrelieved pressure occurred at the egress
                  gate adjoining the stand and home terrace area which visiting
                  stand occupants had to exit after the game;

                 overpacking in the visitors 1 pen on the East Terrace was not
                 relieved until half-time, when police officers allocated an
                 adjoining pen to a number of Everton fans;




W h p n f ‘» l l i n n r . r t o l o r i h r ^ n i r n i r \ ! o
                                 -2-


    inadequate and misleading police communications with the
    Everton supporters;
                                I
-   poor and hazardous existing feacilities from the Sky-Blue Stand
    and from the East Terrace visitors' section.

The Working Party are concerned:that all the good intentions raised
in the recommendations contained in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim
Report and the non-statutory recommendations contained in the Guide
to Safety at Sports Grounds are already being ignored.

We believe it is essential that these recommendations are made
statutory at the earliest opportunity.  We have written to the
Football League   asking that they conduct a full inquiry into what
happended at Highfield Road.

Yours sincerely,




Cha i r,
Hillsborough Working Party.

Tnank you very much for your letter of 8
January, about the inquiries which you have
been conducting into the Hillsborough disaster,
which I have shown to Lord Justice Taylor. He
was grateful for the assurance it contained.
His present inclination is not to quote from it
in his Final Report, but to have it available
to be drawn upon if necessary.

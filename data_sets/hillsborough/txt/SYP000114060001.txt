          After       a time       the     gates were          closed and the area b e t w e e n the

          there was a pitch                   invasion and as a result                       of this    i n Company with

          I could see             people       climbing        over      the   fences         between       the    track and the

to        the           central                     penof the Leppings                                                      Lane           terrace.    I can recall            that the

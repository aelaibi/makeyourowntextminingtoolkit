                       At this time at the ground we noticed that the                                 immediate area to

                       e n t e r the stadium was very cojogestsG.                         We realised we were            in the

                       wrong queue           because we were standing                  in an area for the stands                 but

                       0 u r t i c kets t ha t we pur c hased from t he C o a ch P a r k were f o r t he

                       terraces

                       Due to the amount of people waiting to go into the ground Henry and I

                       were split up.              That was the last I saw of him.

                       1 was qjjueuing u p and when the gates opened                            II just walked in.           I

                       remember thinking               to myself that            I ’d wasted £.6 ,,      I tried to get away

                       from the mass of people and 1 moved over t o t h e r iq h t the ma j o r it y of

                       the other         people went straight f o r w ar d ,,                This was os cause of the amoun

                       of people behind me                 pushing and shoving forward,,                   I got into an area

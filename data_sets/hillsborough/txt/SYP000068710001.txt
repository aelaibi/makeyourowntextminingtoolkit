co ntinu ed down the tunnel                    and onto the terraces at                 the L e p p i n g s L a n e

end.

At this        time      I saw a small           group of s u p p o r t e r s a t t e m p t i n g    to move a

m i d d l e a ged man and              I a s s i s t e d them   in carrying         this man back          up the

tunnel        and      into the        y a rd at the      rear of the          stand,

I then a t t e m p te d to revive               the man and,         during      this    time,       I r e c eived a

blow to my             right    side.       I looked a r o u n d b r i e f l y to see a small                group

of suppo r t e r s who were                shouting     abuse and then saw them being moved

back     by some         police        officers.        I c o n tinued w i t h what I was            doing      but,

after        a short         time,     realised      it was     i m possible      to    revive the man and,

after        covering         his face with his           coat,     I made my wa y to anot h e r               man

who was        being         tended     to by four      supporters.            This man was          u n c o n scious

and    purple          coloured to his face             but still        bre a t h i n g and    I i nstructed

the    fans       to    carry the man out of the gr o u n d                 to the a w a i t i n g a mbulances.

I then saw another ma n w ith an a p p a r e n t                      injury to his         right        ribs and         I

a s s i s t e d him out of the              ground,     where      I w a i t e d w ith him until          an

a m b u la nc e     became available.

B y this       time      it was ajbout 3 ,30 prtT and            I looked over          to a small

en closur e         outside B g a t e where            I saw about 6 bodies w h i c h were                  covered

B es i d e    one of the         bodies       I saw a man who          I now know to be B rian

became       inc r e a s i n g l y     rowdy and          noisy      in b e haviour and more                people

rushed from the               coaches         to    relieve         themselves           in bushes      s i t uated

opposite           the bus garage.              Also during            this    time       I saw a small           group of

Li v e r p o o l     s u pporters w i t h 4 pack               cans     of    lager,       a l t h o u g h not

at    the junctions            of P e ni st on e Rd,             L e p pings       Ln and Harries           Rd.    I would

say that           in the    last       half an hour,               prior     to 3. 0 0 p m     (1300),      the

incoming           traffic     increase d           con s i d e r a b l y a n d a l t h o u g h the area           became

v e ry   crowded and           busy,         there was           no problem and the a t m o s p h e r e was                     of

a    carnival         nature with            all       supporters        in a good natured mood.

About 3 . 0 0 pm < 1 5 0 0 ), the are a q u i e t e n e d down and my serial                                 was      stood

down     to meal        at C l a y w he el s        Ln.      Whilst     en-route          to C l a y w h e e l s Ln    I

heard on the S e r g e an t' s                radio       that      there was a disorder                s i t u a t i o n at

the L e p p i n g s Ln of the                ground.         A p p r o x i m a t e l y 30 yards      from the ground

Irispector C HA RL ES gave                   instructions             for    the five         serials     under his

commend        to form up and,                w he n    this was        done,       he    informed G r o u n d Contro

that     he had five           serials         for      deployment.           At    this    time,     man y voices

could      be heard all              t r a n s m it ti n g    over the        radio and         there     seemed to be

a general            confusion.         At    this      time     I thought          that     there was a serious

public       order      sit u a t i o n      in the ground,             p/ossibly a large fight.

Inspector C HA RL ES            repeated his                 i nf o rm-at i on and the          reply     came     back

that     we were        required          in the I.e p p i n g ■/ L n area               to the    rear     of    the W

Stand.

Under      the d ir ec t i o n of            Inspector C H A R L E S , we            ente r e d the g r o u n d and

once     in the yard at the                   rear of the stand,                   I saw a small          number       of

injured        s upporters           emerging          from the       tunnel        under     the stand and

s ta g g e r i n g    into   the yard.             I continued down                the   tunnel     and onto          the

terra c e s at         the L e p p i n g s     Ln e n d .

At   this      time     I saw a small              group of s u p p o r t e r s a t t e m p t i n g         to move         a

revive       this man a n d,         during        this     time,       I received a blow to my                       right

side.       I looked round to see a small                           group who were             shouting abuse               and

then saw them being m oved                       back    by some Police Officers.                      I continued

with what          I was     doing     but,      after a short              time,       realised       it was

impossible          to revive        the man and,              after       covering        his   face with          his

coat,       I made my way to j|                     n          who was           being     treated      by four

supporters.          This man was            un c o n s c i o u s    and    purple        coloured to his              face,

but    still       b r eathing and          I i nstructed the               fans       to carry the man out of

the grou nd         to the a w a i t i n g amblances.                 I then saw another man with an

a p p arent     injury to his              right    ribs and          I a s s i s t e d him out of the

ground,       where       I w ai t e d with        him until          an a m b u l a n c e     became available.

By this       time       it was about 3 . 3 0 pm <1530)                    and    I looked over to a small

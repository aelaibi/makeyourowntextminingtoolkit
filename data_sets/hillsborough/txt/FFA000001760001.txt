        Dear Sir

        RE:     FOOTBALL MATCH           15TH APRIL 1989

        Thank you for your recent enquiry concerning temporary sign
        posting in connection with the above.

        Arrangements are presently in hand to seek permission from
        the Local Highway Authority for the Association to sign post
        the above and as soon as such permission is received I will
        re-contact you.

        The charge for the service will be based upon the following
        scale of charges which are V.A.T. inclusive:

                                        Up to 10 Signs                    Each Additional Sian

        Up to 7 Days                          £79.25                                   £8.14

        Up to 1 Month                         £87.41                                   £8.14

        Each Additional
        Month         '                       £23.70                                   £8.14

        The Association reserves the right to decide the number of
        signs required and their position and at this stage it is
        estimated that approximately i*0 signs will be required
        although it is stressed that this is only an approximate
        estimate which is given purely for your guidance.

        Please note that no payment should be made to the Association
        at this time and if meanwhile I can be of any further
        assistance in any way please do not hesitate to contact me.

        Yours     faithfully

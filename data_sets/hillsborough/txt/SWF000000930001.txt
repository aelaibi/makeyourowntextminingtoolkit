Dear Sir,

Hillsborough Disaster - Trial of Chapman and Rimmer Actions on
2nd October, 1990_________________________________________________

We act on behalf of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in these
proceedings,   in  which  the   South  Yorkshire  Police  seek
contribution or indemnity.    As you are aware the trial has
been listed for hearing in Manchester on 2nd October next,
estimated to last six weeks, and Mr. Justice Jowitt will be
the trial Judge.

Hammond Suddards, Solicitors for the South Yorkshire Police,
have suggested that the Judge may wish to inspect the Ground
prior to the trial, possibly with Counsel in attendance.   The
Club intend to carry out certain works to the Leppings Lane
Terrace prior to the start of the next football season, and
clearly any inspection would require to take place before
those works commence.    We confirm that the Health & Safety
Executive, the Crown Prosecution Service and H.M. Coroner have
all agreed that they have no continuing interest in the Ground
which might prevent the works of alteration going ahead.

In the circumstances we write merely to confirm, on behalf of
our Clients, that inspection of the Ground can be arranged at
short notice and no doubt this is a matter which can be
discussed at the forthcoming Pre-Trial Review on 24th July.

Yours faithfully,
DAVIES ARNOLD COOPER

    Dear Sirs


    Hillsborough


    Thank you for your letters of the 17th July enclosing copy
    Summons, 18th July enclosing copies of bundles 3, 4 and 5, and
    also your List of Documents.  You have also indicated that you
    are awaiting a reply to the comments in the final paragraph of
    your letter of the 11th July.

    The position in relation to barriers is that there there was a
    dispute amongst the experts as to what should happen to
    barriers 140 and 141.   Your engineer wanted to remove then.
    Other  experts were opposed to this.       For his   part,  we
    understand that Dr Eastwood wants to test those barriers, and
    you clearly are against that course of action.

    In view of the dispute this is a matter which may have to be
    resolved by the court, but our own view is that if the Judge
    does wish to carry out a site inspection, then he ought to be
    afforded the opportunity to see barriers 140 and 141 in situ,
    in their present state.  Subject to that, however, the Club co
    propose to carry out alterations to the Leppings Lane terraces
    before the start of the new football season, and we would have
    thought that since the present state of the barriers is a
    question of visual evidence which can be recorded by the
    experts with their own notes, photographs etc.     Dr Eastwood
    should then, if he wishes, be afforded the opportunity to test




                                                                                                                                          Contd../..

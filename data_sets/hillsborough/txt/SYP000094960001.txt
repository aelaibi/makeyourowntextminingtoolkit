  Dear Mr Metcalf

  A dlintiton v Murray: Adlinjgton v Dnckenfj.eJ.d

  You will no doubt have heard o f the decision o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions,
  announced today, that he will not exercise his powers to take.over the prosecutions.

   We have read your letter o f 14* December in which you purport to reply to our
   December. We note with disappointment that you do not indicate that you wi appe
   represented on the hearing on Monday 21“ As we reported to you, the m asstrate expressed
   the hope that you would attend. You suggest uncharitably that the a p p l . c a t i o n for w,tncss
   summonses may be intended to -force" the Chief Constable into reaching a h M y d e c s .o n
   Since the question o f disclosure has been discussed in our letters to you now for several ^
   months, ii is absurd to suggest that a request for you, after fair notice to assist or deal with e
    issue o f witness summonses puts the Chief Constable at some disadvantage.

   We know that Mr Daines expressed the view last spring that the prosecutions ^          “ “ [y *
   •'tall at the first hurdle", but no reasonable person can be sum m ed at the
   o f the matters that have been disclosed at the insistence o f the Home Secretary after Lord
   Justice Stuart-Smith’s "Scrutiny".

    Your concern is. understandably, to avoid public costs. N odoubt this concern is * ™ d b y
    the South Yorkshire Police Authority. It must be sensible that judicial review by y M
    this case is avoided if at all possible, and no doubt the Police Authority above all other part.es
    wishes to avoid this type o f expense, especially when, as we have been “t o m * . ■>'■<*^ ' " S
    the costs o f the entire criminal defence as well, and, perhaps, the judicial review proceedings
      hat M M ning has been threatening in relation to the CPS decision rf adverse» * < * - •
     We do hope therefore that you will be present before Mr Cadbury on hMonday,£ help h,m
     and us. constructively, about early and timely disclosure o f the various pap
    requested.

                                                     -I-

          information a Parliamentary reply by Mr Boateng o f 3^ November 1998. which makes the
          position look rather simple.

          As a matter o f courtesy we would inform you that we are copying this letter to the solicitors

 Dear Ms Adlington
                                                                H illsborough Prosecutions

 Thank you for your fax o f today which I received at 5.35pm.

 I thought that numbered paragraph 6 o f my letter made the position clear but for the avoidance of
 doubt the application for a witness summons against Mr.Daines will be opposed and he will be
 represented at the hearing by Miss Louise Varty o f counsel.

  I remain o f the opinion that the application is misconceived but I should make quite clear that in
  taking this view I do not in any way prejudge the separate issue oi whether material from the
  Hillsborough archive should be made available to the prosecution and, o f course, to the defence.
  This is a matter under consideration by the South Yorkshire Police now that the decision o f the DPP
  has been made.

  Subject to my clients’ instructions I hope to be able to write to you further on this point early in the
  New Year but obviously the present application represents a distraction irom that objective.

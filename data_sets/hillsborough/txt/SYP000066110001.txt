when       I was       able       to    sit       in    the       stand          and        enjoy       the        atmosphere,          the

colour,          the       satisfaction                and       pride        of       knowing           that       1' h a d    assisted        in

creating          all       this.

From       about       half       past       twelve          (1230          hrs)        onwards           every          half    hour

roughly,          1 popped             down       the       players          tunnel           or    into           the    South       stand    to

check       that       all       the    advertising                   hoardings              were        in    place       and       monitor       the

build       up    of       spectators.

I was       aware          that       the    Kop       end       was     filling             up    normally              with    happy,

singing          Nottingham             Forest          fans.

My    feeling          of    the? W e s t         stand          was     that          generally              it    was    just       not

filling          as    in    previous             semi       finals.               I    cannot          be     specific          as    to    which

pens       were       full       or    empty       at       this       time.

I had       seen       the       players          leaving             the    dressing              rooms           under       the

South       stand          for    the       warm       up    before          the        kick       off.

A    short       time       later       I made          my       way    to       the        top    of    the        Directors

Box    and       stood       there          in    time       for       the       kick        off    at        3 O ’cl ock        (1300

hrs).           One    of    my       responsibilities                      is     to       make    sure           the    large

’U M 8 R 0 ' s i g n        is    removed          from          the     pitch          in    time        for       the    kick-

off    and       I sent          an    apprentice                to    do    this           for    me,

1 started             to    watch       the       game       after          the        kick       off/and           I became          aware

a    few    minutes          later          that       there          were       problems           in        the    West       stand

terracing             as    I could          see       people          c l i m b i r \s g    over       the        top    of    the

fencing          and       getting          onto       the       pitch,          iihe s e         people           started       sitting

down       in    front       of       the    a d v e r t i s i n g \]j/ardings                    behind           the    Liverpool

goal       which       gave       me    concern             as    I am       responsible                 for        making       sure

these       hoardings             are       free       from       obstruction.                     Otherwise              the

relevant          sponsors             may       withdraw             their        sponsorship                 money.                 I went

down       through          the       players          tunnel          to    get        onto       the        pitch a n d        I

started          to    walk       across          the       pitch       towards              the    Leppings              Ln    goal    as    by

this       time       play       had    been       stopped             and       the        players           were       coming       off    the
                                                                                                                                             PAGE              3

pitch.

As    1' g o t      towards           the    goal          I glanced                to    my    left      and        saw    a    policeman             and

perhaps          two       other       spectators                   attending             to    a man       lying          on    the    grass,

I have         been        shown       a    map       of       the       ground          and    have      marked           the    location             of

this      person           on    this       map       with          a    cross.           1 now         produce        this       map       <E x h i b i t

No.            ) (Reference                 N o . ____1).

These         three        people          were       banging                on    this    man's         chest        in a n      attempt             to

revive         him.            I didn't          look          at       his       face    but      he    was     pretty          well       built,

wearing          a white             shirt       and       dark          trousers.              I heard          a    comment          by    one       of

these         three        people          like       "Its          too       late,       h e vs     dead."

I turned            away        and    at    that          point             realised          the      seriousness              of    the

occasion.              I am          not    able          to    describe                this    poor      man        further.

I    could       see       a    few    St    Johns             Ambulance                people       carrying          a    number          of

people         from        the       Leppings             Ln    end          across       the      pitch       towards           the    corner

between          the       Kop       and    the       North             stand       and    it      was    then        I heard          the       Forest

fans      applauding                 every       person             the       ambulance            people        were       taking          off.           I

was      by    that        time       amongst             the       Liverpool             supporters             on    the       pitch       and       I
                                                                                                     *
could         see     that       a    number          of       these          supporters             were      becoming           incensed             by

this      applauding                 and    chanting.

I was         aware        that       also       a    number                      these    Liverpool             supporters             were          well

under         the     influence             of       drink/and                if    the    situation             continued,             other

serious          consequences                may V-^sult.                         I felt       I had      to     do    something             about

this      so     I went          in    front          of       the       Kop       and    indicated            with        my    hands       and

arms      for       them        to    be    quiet          and          not       chant    every         time        someone          was    carrissd

of f .

An    Inspector                came    to    me       to       check          on    my    position          with       the       club.           After

this     was        done,        he    assisted                me       in    trying       to      get    the        message          over       to    the

Nottingham             Forest          fans          as    to       how       serious          the      situation           was       and    for

them      to     behave.

I spoke          to    a       number       of       Forest             fans       at    the    front       of       the    Kop       and    asked
                                                                                                                                     PAGE           4
                                                                                                                                     £•>1037

them    to    pass       tine m e s s a g e            back       behind       them     so      that     they       would       be    aware

of    what    was       happening.

I believe          to    a    certain              extent         that     this      was     successful.             .

Other       Liverpool           supporters/came                     across        the      pitch        and''*!     assisted          them

to    rip    down       the     advertising                  hoardings          to    use       asystretchers              which       these

people       were       us i n g 'f o r / t h e i r          injured        colleaguac.

I then       went       back        i nrthe          players        tunnel        and      to    the

some    jugs       and       plastic               cups     of     water          forthe                f o l k s onthe p i t c h a n d         I

went    back       out       amongst               t hese people.

I saw       one    or     two       people           being        covered       over       and     being       carried          away       but

I was       more       concerned              at     that     time       with     people         who     were       injured          who    1

was    able       to    help.            I h a n d e d out          the w a t e r       I wascarrying                 to t h e s e

people       and       did    what        1        c o u l d for    them.

The    majority          of     these          were       grateful         for       this       and     for    what      the       police

were    doing          but    there           was     quite        an    element        who      I would          class       as     yobs

who    had    been       drinking,                 some      of    them     I would          say      were J r u n k .          These

noticed       my       club     tie       that         I jstfas w e a r i n g     and      I was/subjected                 to      verbal

abuse       which       I walked              away      from       rather       than       pr/voke          it.

I felt       that       if    I had/attempted                      to    converse/with                them     or    try      to     justify

our    position          as     a    club          that      it    would       certainly           possibly          have       resulted

in    violence          towards           me.

I    carried       on    for        the       rest      of    the       afternoon          assisting           as    I have

described              with     the       injured            people       on    the     pitch         where       I could.

I did       notice       later           in    the      afternoon          after        an      announcement             to     clear       the

pitch       had    been       heard           over      the       tannoy       system        and      the     police       were

starting          to    clear        the       pitch         of    the     last      few     Liverpool            supporters,              that

a    fight    started           in       the       West      stand       seating        area       in    the      centre        of    the

of    its    own       accord        without            police          intervention.                 I would        presume          that

these       people       concerned                 would      be    Liverpool           supporters             as    Nottingham

             was    then       that   I became       aware              that     a    considerable                number       of   people     had

             lost    their       lives.                                                          ✓         *

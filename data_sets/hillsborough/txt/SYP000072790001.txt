          the    fence       dividing     pen 4 from         pen 3.        It was     the second barrier                 up

          At about 2.40pm,             the    pen was       so full,       IA>as      being     pushed a g a in st           the

       crush      in the       pen got worse.              It was so       intense,       the    pressure          of    people

       s qu a s h e d   in was       preventing       movement       of    limbs.        I tried to move and got

       my ar m stuck           in betw ee n two men,            it was      impossible          to    pull   free,        after

       a short while,               one of the men noticed my ar m and somehow m a n a g e d to

       free     it.      liy arms were            then bent at the elbow and were                      sticking          into

       the    b ottom of my             rib cage.

       The    noise      of    people       shouting,       crying and screaming was                   like a droning

       sound,      you     c o u l d n ’t hear anything          specific         that    people were             saying.        I

       looked a ro u n d and saw my f r i e n d p u s h i n g                          a man back off              the

       barrier.          The man was             behind the     barrier and was being                  crushed against

       it.      It was        the    same    barrier       that we had gone             under.        The m an was

       screaming         for help,          the    barrier     bar was      being       pushed       into his       stomach

       area,               was      pushing       the man back,       I think          from his       chest.        The

       m a n ’s face was turning                  blue and there was a lot of saliva                         coming       out

       of his mouth,             dri bb li ng      down on to his jacket.                 I don't       know       if he had

       s top pe d screaming,               due    to the    noise.

                c ontinued to try                pushing    the ma n a way from the              barrier,          but due

       to the       pressure         of    people    behind the man he was unable                      to do so.            I

       As    I continued to w at ch                        with this man,             I was    pushed to the front

       of the       pen,      bringing me          right agai ns t        the    front    fence.        I t ried to

       climb up the            fence       but w a s n ’t able      to do       it.     I was aware          of           about

       3 feet awa y from me,                 he shouted        'Try and get out of the                  gate,       if you

            still    being       crushed       into the    front       fencing.       I grabbed the fencing

            w i t h my hands and tried to edge my way along                           towards     the    gate.      At one

            point,      my feet        left    the ground and           I was   carried off       completely.             It

            s ee m ed that       I had been there           for hours.          The heat       in the    pen from

            people was          intense,       it was so hot,           I was sweating         profusely.        iiy shirt

            was    stuck to me from sweat.

            As    I got    nearer       to the     gate,     I was aware        of bodies       on the    floor,      I

      one      of the      lads was        crying,    so    I ran over and helped to take                 over         from

      them      carrying       the    body    into    the    stand area.

      I then went           back a g a i n and       picked up a n o th er       body w ith five         other

      lads.         We    carried the        body to the same area.

      W he n    I got out of this area,                I met       up w ith ______ |ind             again.        We

      r em ained         in the ground for about              15 minutes,        just walking a r o u n d and

      we were         given a drink of water.                 There was a chant from the Kop end of

      the ground,           from the N o t t i n g h a m Forest         fans,    they were       chanting         things

      like      "Boring,       b o r i n g , ’ one shouted         ’You've     spoilt a good game            of

      football           here.*      The    chants    continued and most of the fans                   on the

      pitch turned a ro u n d p6              look at them.           Due    to the     trauma we h^d all

      been      through and tyodies still                  being    carried away,        emotions/took over

      and      I along witl/ other            fans,    ran towards          the Forest       endK     I d o n ’t know

      w hat     we w o u ld /i av e    done,    but the       tension an d emotionVwas               urging       us
O n
      t owards        them/       I think     it w o ul d have       been to tell        them what       had

      h ap pe n e d      if they didn't a l r ea dy know.              The     police formed a cordon

      ac ro ss      the    pitch,     to    prevent a possible           fight.        I wa lk ed back and we

      sat      on the      pitch for about           ten minutes at the             corner    flag    of the

            what     h a pp en ed to the     property      it was    just all   over   the    place.

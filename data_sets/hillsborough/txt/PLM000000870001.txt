Dear Mr Jones

HUISBCROOGH INQUIRY - SOHHSSICNS ON BEHAIF OF ER EASTWDOD

My comments on the above document are as follows:

Paragraphs lfi) . 8 and 9 : This submission contains no mention of corrosion, or
its assessment, which should have formed part of the inspection procedure. ^
Dr Eastwood agreed in his evidence (day 26 pl09) that barriers which contained
corroded holes would have been condemned. The collapsed barrier contained
corroded holes (HSE Report para 3.4) which would have been visible at the 1988
inspection.

Paragraph 10: Since deflections were not measured on each span (day 26 pll3
Collins/Eastwood) how can it be said that both spans passed?

Paragraph 11: Dr Eastwood stated (day 26 pll3) that "there has been an error
in testing" and hence this paragraph is confusing.

Paragraph 12: It was accepted eventually by Dr Eastwood that deflections could
get larger with successive load applications (day 26 pll7) and hence it is by
no means certain that the span requiring a re-test would have passed.

Paragraph 13: It has not been proved that barriers 128 and 137 were deformed
on or before 15/4/89. The test results supplied to HSE by Dr Eastwood
(covering letter Eastwood/James dated 1/6/89) state that for barrier 128 the
"first load application, 15 ) to 1.4 tonnes resulted in a 75% recovery after
release of load" which suggests that, for this barrier, plastic deformation
occurred at less than 1.2 times the design load for a new barrier (5kN/m).
Eastwood's data require explanation.

Recent HSE results (not available when the report was issued) indicate that the
crowd density was similar in pens 3 and 4 and hence "crush pressure" would also
have been similar in the two pens.

Paragraph 14: The Green Guide does not quantify "crowd pressure", and hence
this statement could be challenged.

Paragraph 16: A definition of "significantly" is required here. Certainly
barriers which were as much as 18% below the minimum recommended height were
not replaced (eg barrier 136 pen 3).

                                        1
Paragraph 18; Most barriers at the Leppings lane End had been positioned so as
to prevent spectators standing on the same step as the barrier. The examples
chosen by Dr Eastwood were not typical (day 27 p61).

Paragraph 20: Some spectators have stated that they were pressed over the
barriers, thus compressing those on the lcwer side. The height of the barriers
is therefore very relevant.

Paragraph 22: The alignment of gaps in successive rcws of barriers is
specified in the Green Guide. This does not appear to have been considered by
Dr Eastwood. Some of the gaps in the lines of barriers were well in excess of
the Guide recommendations. For example, the gap between barriers 136 and 136A,
immediately above the collapsed spans of 124A, was 57% larger than the Guide
maximum.

Paragraph 33: I do not agree with this statement. In the absence of radial
fences, spectators would have spread more uniformly along the leppings Lane
Terrace, thus reducing crcwd density in the central area.

Paragraph 42: In Pen 3, a configuration of barriers complying with the Green
Guide would have led to a reduction in pressure on specific barriers
(particularly 124A) and hence barrier collapse may have been averted. _ Crushing
injuries may still have occurred but the death toll would, in iry opinion, have
been reduced substantially. The situation in Pen 4, where the barrier
configuration was better, and the crcwd density was similar, supports this
view.

Paragraphs 45. 47. 48 and 50: The capacity of Pens 3 and 4 is not given,
although that of Spion Kop is! It is not credible that "a loss in capacity"
(para 47) or "the effect on capacity" (para 48) could be quantified or
rHgoiggprf unless the original capacities had been calculated already. Likewise
the only sensible way of allocating spectators to a particular pen would be on
the basis of a known and agreed capacity. The term "visibly full" (para 50) is
meaningless in this context.


Do not hesitate to contact me if you require clarification of any of the above
points. I expect to attend the Inquiry tomorrow (14th) from 9.30am onwards.

Yours sincerely

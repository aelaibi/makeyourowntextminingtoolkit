            On Saturday 15th April 1989 150489 I performed duty at the Sheffield

            Wednesday Football Ground on logistics supervised by Inspector BENNET

            and with PS FIDLER and P C ’s SHELTON and CAMPBELL.

            I commenced duty at 6arrs 0600 on various different tasks which were

            routine and unremarkable until about 2.45pm 1445 when I overheard a

            radio message that difficulties were being experienced with crowds

            entering the stadium at the Leppings Ln end.               At this time I was in

            the gymnasium supervising mealing arrangements,              half of the gymnasium

            had been set out with tables and chairs and the other half was being

            used by the Sheffield Wednesday Stewards.

            I obtained a radio and commenced to monitor events.               Chief Inspector

            BEAL came to the gymnasium and complained about his radio,              it was

            realised at this time that there was a fault on all radios and
                                                                  PAGE     2


reception was poor, voices taking on a ’warbling' note and they were

almost impossible to understand.    A civilian wireless engineer was

present in the gymnasium and I directed him to the Police Control B o k .

Police Officers from D Division were arriving at the ground and

attending in the gymnasium for a meal, due to the worsening situation

I held them for deployment.    Inspector SEWELL was in the gymnasium and

instructed me to record the deployments which I did on a sheet of A3

paper,   recording the Officers concerned,   the time and where they had

been deployed.    1 saved this record and can produce it if required to

do so.   At about 3.20pm 1520 1 stopped recording deployments when a

senior officer came to the gymnasium and instructed that it be cleared

of tables and chairs to become a casualty receiving station.

Entrance to the gymnasium by the door nearest to the pitch is

difficult, the door being only just wide enough to admit a stretcher.

This area became congested, with PC LARKIN I took charge of the door

and directed casualties.    The dead were separated from the living and

as support services arrived they were directed to the live casualties.

Whilst engaged on this duty I received numerous requests from

Liverpool   people to be admitted to the gymnasium to look for

relatives, apart from the obvious difficulties that this would have

caused to Officers, the scene inside the gymnasium of eighty two

bodies of mainly young people, many only partly clothed, was a

harrowing sight unfit for relatives to see.

In turning people away I expressed my sympathy to them and no real

difficulties were experienced.     PC LARKIN

    whilst on this duty but he continued to assist until he



I continued on this duty until about 4pm 1600 when I was relieved by

PC BUCKLEY.

I then joined PC CAMPBELL and together we and other teams recorded
                                                                              PAGE


             details of the dead and the Police Officer involved in recording the

             death in the major incident books provided.

             I later performed duties detailed to me by Inspector CHILDS, the

             Officer in charge of the mortuary,   these consisted mainly of casualty

               I am a Police Sergeant in the 'South Yorkshire Police at present

               stationed at Ecclesfield Police Station,

               At 4,30 p.m.,        ( 16305 on Saturday the 15th April 1989 (150489)            I

               attended at Ecclesfield Police Station in answer to a plea by local

               radio for o f f du ty poli ce o f f i cers t o g o in to wo r k folio win g an

               incident at the Hillsborough football ground at Sheffield.

               On arrival at the station I was transported to the ground together

               with another officer and on arrival         I went to the gymnasium at the

               ground itself.        I arrived at approximately 4.50 p.m.,       (1650) this date,

               and at this time there were a large number of football supporters

               bodies laid on the floor of the gym.

               After assisting in the gym for a while I was then transported,                   together

               with a number of other officers to the Northern General Hospital,,
                                                                                     PAGE


Once at the hospital we went to the mortuary building and there the

mortuary staff began to take out further football supporters bodies

from the fridges.        Each body was allocated to a police officer, having

been handed over by the mortuary staff.                The bodies were at this time

unc1othed and had been given a number by the hospi ta1 staf f «                     I was

given body number 65 ( hospital number) together with articles of

clothing in a bag.         The body and clothing,         once handed over to me,

was then placed in an ambulance and transported down to the gymnasium

where it was laid with the others.

           States s

           I have previously completed a questionnaire in connection with my

           attendance at the Hi 11sborough Footbal1 Ground on 15th April 19S9

           (150489) for the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool Football Club and

           Nottingham Forest.



           I. was on the pitch after the game was stopped,      from about 3.20 pm

           (1520), for some two hours or more.        Most of that time I was looking

           for my brother and other friends.



           At about 3.30 pm (1530)   I’?ffllped some other fans to carry one of the

           casualties on one of the advertising boards.        We picked him up from a

           point just left of the goal post as you look from the direction of the

           pitch, just off the playing area.     We carried him the length of the
                                                                                       PAGE    2


        pitch and handed him over to the police officer in the centre circle

        of the pitch.         In fact, what happened was as we went to take the

        casualty through the line of police that was across the pitch,, one of

        them looked at the casualty we had and said,               "It’s no use, he is dead,

        leave him there," so we just put the board^down on the ground.



        I would not be able to identify the police officer again, and I would

        not say that he was wrong about the person being dead.



        I would d e s c r i b e   the casualty I helped to car ry as a whi te youth,      of

        about 14 y r s .      I   can't help about his hai r , build or facial f eatures,

        but I   remember he was wear ing blue jeans, a Liverpool football top,

        red one, and a pair of whi te trainers.               He was the only casualty I had

        any dealings with.



        I am 17 yrs old, 5*10",               slim build, brown hair, brushed back,

        spectacles      (gold), and on that day I was wearing jeans (blue), white

        training shoes and a grey Liverpool football shirt.



        If it would help,             I would be willing to view a video in an effort to

        identify myself and the casualty I handled.



        Also in my questionnaire I said it was a doctor who said the body was

        dead but,     in fact,         it was the police officer I mentioned in this

        statement.




                                                                                      SIGNED

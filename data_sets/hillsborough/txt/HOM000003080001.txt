Dear Mr Whalley

I write in confirmation of the questions raised by Lord Justice Taylor on
4th and 6th July 1989.

The time that Mr Dalgliesh made his Tannoy announcement is recorded on Video,
MAP 7, on 15.15.09. A transcript of that announcement was sent to you by fax
on 6 July 1989.

With regard to the use of the Tannoy at around 2.40 pm, the following statement
numbers can be referred to:
S.213, S.407, S .1521 S. 12.71, S.855, all relate to outside in Leppings Lane;
S.771, S.683, S.220, S.357, S.737, S.819, S.864, S.257, all relate to inside
the ground and the standing terraces.

I confirm that the term ’Operational Support’ is being assessed and the
necessary statements will be obtained as a matter of urgency from Chief
Inspector Edmondson snd Police CnnntabJe I      1 1 confirm that no record of
the term ’Major disaster plan’ can be found in any of the verbal or written
context of 15 April 1989. You are aware this terminology was used at the
Public Inquiry by certain of the Senior Officers in evidence.

With regard to those persons seriously injured, I refer you first of all to the
appendix on this subject in the interim report submitted by West Midlands
Police.  The particular emphasis on brain damage has been difficult to assess
but an urgent request has been made to the two Sheffield Hospitals for a
breakdown of the seriously injured without reference to names which should
avoid the problem of confidentiality.  If this is unsuccessful, I will consider
another option to obtain the information.

                                                              Cont’d I ...




     PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
I
    2.


    In relation to the boardroom meetings the written evidence suggests only one
    meeting took place in the actual boardroom.   You are of course aware of an
    initial meeting in the Police Control Box and a short reference is made by
    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield of him meeting Mr McGee, the Sheffield
    Wednesday Chairman in the Police Room in the North Stand much later on.   From
    my research, those present at the boardroom meeting were Mr Smith, Mr Ensor and
    Mr Robinson (Liverpool F.C.), Mr Rowarth (Notts. Forest F.C.), Mr McGee and
    Mr Mackerell (Sheffield Wednesday F.C.), Mr Kelly and Mr Kirton (F.A.), Mr
    Lewis the referee, ACC Mr Jackson and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.    It is
    also evident Mr Lock entered the meeting but only to pass a message.

    As discussed with you the other matters are being attended to.

    I trust this information is of value and sufficient for your requirements.


    Yours faithfully




    M J FOSTER

           It should be remembered a number of people have made both
           questionnaires and statements.

           I hope this assists for the time being.

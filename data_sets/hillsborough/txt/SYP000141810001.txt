        leading to the ground.                   Before      leaving Liverpool   two Officers

        searched the coach for alcohol and advised the supporters

        to maintain good behaviour.                       When we were stopped the second

        time just off the HI,                  the Police also      checked rny passengers

        tickets and found that two of them didn't possess a ticket.

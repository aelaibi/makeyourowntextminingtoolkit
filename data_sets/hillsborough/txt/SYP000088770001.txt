                     ambulance              man.      In         "1987     I did       my    extended              training.              I was       taught

                    methods            of    intubation,                  canruUtion,               which          is    the    fitting          of    drips       and

                     based        at    Rotherham                for      two    years       and        prior       to    that       I was       at   Parkway

                     for     two       and    a    half          years.          For     the       week       leading          up    to    the    Hillsborough

                     incident           I was       on       a       floater         which       basically              involved          covering          s h i t Is

                     going        to    be    doing          for         the    whole       week.            un   Thursday           and    i~ r i u a y    I wot k e d

                     3.      On    Saturday           I should                 have    been        on    nights          which       is 2 2 0 0       hours      to
                                                                                                      P AGfc.

0 600 hours       but       I swapped shifts on the Fr i d a y w i t n _______________ so

t hat    I was wo rk i n g ev en i ngs w hi ch is 1SOO to 0200 hours.

4.      I was at home and washing                  the    car at about         1445 hours.      The     radio

was     on.     A football         report    came on at about             1505 hours and        the

comment ator          said that      there was       crowd trouble;;           there was     no m e n t i o n of

injuries.         My g ir l f r i e n d works at the N o r t h e r n General               Hospital     and          I

was     going    to    collect     her that evening              so   I decided to set off earlier

to try and avoid any fans who would be                            leaving      the ground     if the game

was abandoned.              The   radio     commentator a c t u a l l y said that            the game        had

been stopped and that                it looked       like       it was    going       to be abandoned.               1

set off       to the N o r t he rn General           Hospital         at ar o u n d    1510 hours and got

there at about              1530 hours.       I was       not    listening      to the     radio on the

way.

5.      My girlfriend?                                      came      out to meet me.         She    said

that     there    had beers trouble at H i l l s b o r o u g h and that                  patients at        the

hospital        had beers w a t chin g       it on television.               We got      into the     car    to

set off       back home.          As we were going up Herries Rd„                       near the

Devonshi re Public H s e , I saw two 3 outh Yor k s h i r e A m b u 1anc e s both on

eme r g e n c y mode.         One was     going     towards       the N o r t h e r n bsneral and the

other was        travelling         in the opposite             direction.        I also    saw a

N o t t i ng ha ms hi re     vehicle    going towards           the ground.            I realised thal­

ibis was more than                crowd trouble as you do not expect                      to see a

N ot ti n g h a m vehicle         in our area unless            there     is a major       incident.         I

decided       to go to the          nearest    station which             is Long l e y about       half a

mile away.            I arri v e d at about         1545.        I got out and my g i r l f r i e n d look
                         -
my car Horne.           1    contacted      control       centre      on the external        emergency

telephone which              is outside      the    station.          A woman Control        A s sistant

answered.         I asked whether            they needed any help and she said yes.                              1

told her that           I was     exten ded trained.              It was     not my station and so

I did not have a key to get                   in.        An a m bulance w o m a n arri v e d while           I

went    to    contact      control          by going      on to a vehicle and using a radio

set.     We were       on channel            three but the                controller       told us to switch to

                          W 1 rived as           soon as      i    >3 0   t into    the    station.         we tearned

up and got on to an out                     patient ambulance.                    This    is not a front           line

vehicle.        They do not have any equipment                              except       for blankets        and vomit

boxes.        1 w ould say that about                  ID front            line vehicles       had     left the

station before           us and that             there were          no front         line vehicles          left at

the    station.

6.     We were      told fay control              to go to the Pen i s t o n e Rd entrance.                        By

now    it was .about         1555.               was driving.               We went       down Herries Rd and

crossed Penistone Rd,                      The   police    had blocked off the                  road and were

only allowing          emergency vehicles                 through.            We went       into the ground

through the second gym entrance.                           We met S t a t i o n Off:i cep'EASON and ne

told us that we            could only be of use                   to the walking woun d e d                 because

our    vehicle was         not e q u ipped for any more                      than that.        EASON knew that

I was    s p e cially trai n e d but without my equipment                                 I could not do

an y thing     more than an o r d inary a m bulance man.                             We started        to    collect

the walki ng wound,ed w h/ch only took a couple                                    of mi n u t e s y S We were

collecing       them f r\n jy /'the side           of the gym,               We    took .atn/C iI    10 injured

people.       Su p e r i n t e n d e n t    DALE was      directing           things       in the gym yard.               He

told us only to take the                     injured and not any                   relatives        or escorts.

Whe n the amb u l a n c e was              full we set off                by the same       route     that we had

come    in on.       There were             fans everywhere                in the yard,         1 did not see

any dead bodies at this                     time but the view was                   limited by all           the

fans.        We got a police/escort                 onto the              road and       left going     north bound

on Pen i s t o n e Rd and yonto Leppings Ln.                              We were    heading        for the Royal

journey.        We were        passed by a front                  line a m bulance          on the way.            it

took    us about        15 minutes           to get to the h o s p i t a l .

7.       At    the    hospital          I knew        from    the m a j o r     accident          plan       that      fractures

are      r e g a r d e d as      minor    injuries           but    I did       not    want      to    let    all      the

patients            out    of    the    ambulance           before    I had       spoken         to a s i s t e r       in

charge         of    casualty.           I. w e n t    to    speak    to a s i s t e r        and      she    t o l d me      to

ta ke     them       through       to    the    far     end    of    casualty          to   be    s ea t e d .        I we nt

b ac k    to    the       ambulance       a n d we      escorted          the    patients         through.

S.       We were          then    clear and so we              rang through to control.                          Webers

i nstruc ted to go N st h e r t h o r p e                   roundabout and stand by on                        LKe dual

carriageway.                Control       knew that we were a second                          line vehicle              by our

call      of Sierra 4^2.                 It took        us about          five minutes            to get         to    Che

roundabout.

9.       As we arri v e d another message                          came through telling all                       vehicles

there         to go to Harries Rd bus depot.                              There were alre a d y about 6 or 7

vehicles at N et h e r t h o r p e              roundabout w hich all                   looked to be front                    line

V 0 h 1 C I8 S n

•10.      We    tried to get             to the bus depot                 by going along P e nistone Rd and

turning         up Herries Rd south.                        We were h i n dered by Forest                     fans who were

on the         road at          least    two miles away from the ground,                                They were

walk i n g about 20 abreast                     right up the middle                   of the          road.      The        police

were      also       trying       to get       to the ground and were equally                            being         hindered.

We were        vicing about             five miles           per hour as we went                  through         the       crowd.

11.       It took us about 20 to 25 minutes                                to get to the bus depot,

U n f o r t u a t e ly we do not have an e m ergency mode on this                                       type      of

ambulance,                There were messages                 coming       over       the   radio but            none for us,

12.       At the depot we were met                          by S t a t i o n Officer E ASON and he

o r g a n i s e d where we were                parked.         I had       completely            lost track            of time

by this stage.                   There were           five    rows of front             line vehicles                 three

deep and we were                  put to one           side.        The    front       liners were            going         in and

out while we were there._____________________/ __________________

             I am a married man with two children living at the above address where

             I have been for the last six y e a r s . I have been in full

             employment as a                             for the        last twenty four y e a r s .

             At appro:;.       14. 10am Saturday the 15th April             I was returning with my

             wife from shopping         in Hi 1lsboorugh,        knowing that Meddlewood Road would
5 o -b.      foe busy.     I decided to take an alternative                tya'ffte home.   I therefore
rC\ /'rs
 UJ-XJ
             drove up Dy 1 es Ha 11 Road passing the^-BHehi ve Public House both my wife

             and myself were attracted by J m e             crowds of peopie drinking,

             swearing shouting and g^yreral boisterous                    n a t u re. They were      in the car

             park,      on the footpatii and across the               road in the''chip shop some with

             pint glasses        in the i r h a n d s . The s cene was^/epeated but mo re so

             at another        pub called the Horse and JoG'fiey on Wads 1ey L a n e . There

             more      people were again on that         car jzfark on the footpath sat on the
                                                                                PAGE       E
                                                                                S787

kerbside and on the opposite side of the road. The actions of the

people we saw were as previously described,              further along the road

there was another fish and chip shop, with people queuing with pints

in the i r h a n d s . Still   f urther along the road the rap^f^jg s caves we re

being repeated at another          pub called the Spo r ^ M n h n ^

In my opinion and that of my wife,            some sn these    people were   in such a

drunken state that not only did they^appear              to be not interested       in

getting    to the ground,       but they also appeared u nc a p a b l e , knowing   that

area very well,      like I do, they would not have had time to get to the

ground in reasonable time to get in c om f or t a b l y . I would make the

point that     I am a football      supporter and do attend the Hillsborough

ground for most matches and 1 know how long              it takes to walk to the

ground from these pubs,          under normal   conditions.    It is also my opinion

that all    I saw on that day led to the traggi c circumstances that

occurred    later.

We    entered        Sheffield           City       Centre      from        the     South        West       and    joined

There      was     a mini-bus            immediately            infront            of    our     vehicle          which    h a d an

Eventually           at     about      1 4 . 2 0 p m we      parked         our     vehicle           in the       vicinity        of

          rapidly            already          my       friend                          had      fallen             over    twice and            other

The    situation                had        now    deteroriated                     from     being       overcrowded             and

uncomfortable                   to     being          crush         situation.

We    were       then whilst                  trying           to m o v e          over     towards         the      left      of     the

terracing             (North S t a n d                side)         gradually              pushed       forwards            u n til      at    about

At    this       time       about           14.5>^yn           I w a V a b e i ng          pushed       towards         the c r u s h

barrier          and       th e      people           arouncNme               were       swirling          around       trying           to a v o i d

being       pinned against                       the     barrier.

I eventually                found           myself         positioned                b e hind a man who                 was     forcing

himself          back       with           both       hands         from       the       crush     barrier.             Inti a l l y          1 was

just    pushed             up a g a i n s t           t h is    man       and       other      people           were    pushed           up

against          me    I could              feeler         pressure                f r o m all     sid es.

The    pressure             had        been       intense               and    unbearable            a n d wa s        increasing              in

in t e n s ity .

The    man       positioned                 in f r o n t        of me          and       holding        himself         back        from       the

barrier          I can          only        describe            as       being       a white         male        I would        guess          in hi

mid    S O ‘‘s he          wa s      of a v e r a g e          to       stocky        build       certain!y            at    least        my

height       which          is S ' S "           he    had      short          to m e d i u m      length           hair     f ai r      to m o u s e

in    colour.              He     was       wearing            a wollan             or a c r y l i c       sweater          either        w hi t e ,

cream       or    beige           in       colour.             It wa s         a    chunky        k ni t    t y pe     of    sweater           and     I

think       he m a y        have           been wearing                  blue       denim      je a n s .        I d o n ’t t h i n k          I

would       recognise                t his       man     from a           facial           photograph            but    I think           I would

recongnise             his        sweater.

As    the    pressure                continued            to        increase             the   man      in f r o n t        of me        I have

described             above,           o fav i o u s 1y s tar t e d                t o w ea k e n from           the    e f f or t o f

pushing          himself             b a ck      off     the        crush          barrier,        as      t h is    man     slumped

forward          slightly              I was          able      to m o v e          my     arms    to      either       s ide       of    him and

take    hold          of    the        crush          barrier            and       p ush    backwards.

At    about       this          time        I heard            some-one             shouting         in a        panic,        ’my       neck,       my

positioned                with       his      chin       stuck        on m y         r i g ht          shoulder         with       his     head

being        forced          backwards.

This       man       I would            say was          shorter than                   me b e c a u s e of            his     position,           he

was     a white            male         aged     in      hi s       m i d 3 0 ’s        he h a d          a    reeceeding           hair     line

of m o u s t a c h e ,          he      had     normal         complexion                    I think           I may       have     a fair

chance          of    recognising                this      man        from a            photograph.

At     this       t im e     I was         only about               10 f e e t          from           the     perimeter           fence,        people

were       panicking               and     shouting            at     the         Police           to     help.

I cannot             be    certain            but     I think             by      now    the           game     had     kicked       off.

Eventually                the      man who          was     positioned                  in        front        of me       in the        chunky-

The     reaction          of       the    Police       to    the \ ^ g e d y         was      unexceptably                slow and

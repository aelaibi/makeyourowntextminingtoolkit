    Thank you for your note about the tragic events at Hillsborough and the calls for
    the inquiry to be reopened. I would like to say first of ail how saddened I was
    by this terrible disaster and I fully understand your desire to reach a better
    understanding of how your cousin died.

    in the House of Commons, I gave an undertaking to consider carefully the
    representations that have been made to reopen the public inquiry. I emphasised
    that I would not take the decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need
    to be convinced that it would be in the public interest to do so.

    I explained that in coming to a decision, I would consider whether there is any
    new evidence, and, if so, whether that evidence appeared to be of such
    significance that had it been put before Lord Taylor or the coroner, either the
    outcome of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
    different.

    The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide me with a
    detailed report of all the points raised by the programme. I will reach a decision
    on any further action to be taken as soon as I have been able to consider all the
    issues. Meanwhile I would like you to know that my thoughts will be with you
    and all the bereaved families

HILLSBOROUGH : CORRESPONDENCE FROM VICTIMS’ FAMILIES

Issue

You asked to answer personally any correspondence which we received from relatives
of the Hillsborough victims following the broadcast of the television programme and
adjournment debate about the tragedy.

Timing and recommendation

2.   We recommend an early reply to the families, in advance of any
announcement of your conclusions on the need for a fresh inquiry.

Consideration

3.     In the adjournment debate on 17 December that followed the broadcast of the
Hillsborough television programme, you undertook to consider the representations of
the bereaved families to see whether any new evidence had emerged that would justify
re-opening the inquiry into the tragedy.

4.     The relatives who have written to you are listed in annex A. The draft replies
follow the line that you agreed in my submission of 19 December for representations
to re-open the inquiry.

Thank you for your letter of 2 January about the tragic events at Hillsborough and the
calls for the inquiry to be reopened. I would like to say first of all how saddened I was
by this terrible disaster and I fully understand your desire to reach a better
understanding of how your son, Philip, died.


In the House of Commons I gave an undertaking to consider carefully the
representations that have been made to reopen the public inquiry. I emphasised that
I would not take the decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need to be
convinced that it would be in the public interest to do so.


I explained that in coming to a decision I would consider whether there is any new
evidence, and, if so, whether that evidence appeared to be of such significance that
had it been put before Lord Taylor or the coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor
inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.


The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide me with a detailed
report of all the points raised by the programme . I will consider his report carefully. I
fear that there may remain matters about which we may never be certain. In a tragedy
of this magnitude I feel that it is sadly inevitable, though deeply distressing, that there
will be confusion about some aspects of what occurred. What I must consider is
whether a further inquiry, if it were to take place, would be able to provide greater
certainty about what happened than we have at present.


I will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon as I have been able to
consider all the issues. Meanwhile I would like you to know that my thoughts will be
with you and all the bereaved families.

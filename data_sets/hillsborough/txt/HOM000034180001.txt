HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you very much for your letter, faxed to us this afternoon.

Like the Home Secretary, I have given a public undertaking to scrutinise the Granada "drama
documentary" with a view to seeing if it contains any new evidence and to pursuing such new
material if it emerges.

It is the professional view o f those o f our officers completely familiar with the material
afforded to the previous enquiries - Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry; the Inquest before HM
Coroner and the Judicial Review - that there is in fact no new evidence brought forward. We
are content to have this view challenged.

The programme is also inaccurate in a number of respects. Whilst this is expected in a
programme with any dramatic content, the observation should be seen in the context of
Granada's assertions as to the film's factual base.

I will have staff examine the ten questions you have relayed to me as soon as possible and
certainly before the end o f January.

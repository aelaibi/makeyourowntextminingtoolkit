                  WEDNESDAY. 6th FEBRUARY 1991

     THE CORONER:   Ladies and gentlemen, when we rise at
lunchtime we are going to have to resume in the afternoon
without the Jury because there is a problem.  I do not need
to go into details but anyway it is necessary for mum to be
at hospital. What we might do in the afternoon is deal
with any legal aspects which we need to deal with and then
we will carry on hopefully all being well tomorrow. That
means we are trying to cancel a couple of the witnesses who
were scheduled for this afternoon if we can still catch
them before they set off. They may not make it anyway
because of the weather.

     MISS KENNAH:   Sir, I am afraid that Mr. King may have
had problems with his car again and so I will sit here
until he comes.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, indeed. You will explain to Mr.
King that I hate starting without him.

       MISS KENNAH:   I think he realises that.

                      GRAHAM IAN SEDDON Sworn
                          Bv THE CORONER:

Q. You are Graham Ian Seddon? - A. I am.

Q* Of ^                             |, Merseyside, is
   that right? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q. You are a Liverpool supporter, is that right? - A.
   That is correct, yes.

Q. You have been one for a long time? - A. Yes.

Q. I think you came to Sheffield on the 15th April 1989
   to see the Semi Final? - A. That is right.

Q.   Did you also come in 1988? - A. Yes.

Q.    In 1988 were you on the terraces or somewhere else? -
     A. No, we were on the terraces at the Leppings Lane
     end.

Q.   The same bit of the terrace? - A. Yes.

Q.   We are now dealing with 1989    and we will come to1988
     later. You came with a couple of your friends,
     Stephen Pitts and Mark Best? - A. Yes.

Q. You came by car, is that right? - A. That is right.

Q. You left I think about ten o'clock in the morning? -
   A. Yes, roughly.
                                                 G. I. SEDDON


You arrived at about twelve noon or thereabouts? - A.
Yes.

Between 12 and 12.30 I think it was? - A. Yes,
roughly.

Let us say 12.30.   Then you parked? - A. Yes.

Of course, you knew Sheffield from previous
occasions? - A. Yes.

Did you go straight to the ground or did you go and
look for a drink or something first? - A. Yes, we
went for a drink.

Did you find a pub, in fact, or not? - A. Yes, we
went to the same pub the year before.

Which one was it as a matter of interest? - A. I
can't remember the name and I can't remember the
road.

Not too far from the ground? - A. No, about ten
minutes' walk.

You say it was a pub off Middlewood Road? - A. Yes,
that is right.

How long did you stay there? - A. A couple of hours I
think.

About how many pints would you say you had? - A. I
had five pints.

Your friends had about the same? - A. No, one was
unwell and one was driving. So about two pints each.

They were cut down? - A. Yes.

You then left the pub at about 2.30, would that be
right? - A. A bit earlier, yes.  It was about quarter
past two, something like that.

Then you made your way down to the ground? - A. Yes.

Did you get there at about what time? - A. About
2.30.

In your statement you have put your time a little bit
later for arriving at the Leppings Lane turnstiles? -
A. Yes.
                                                G. I. SEDDQN


Which is right, what is in the statement or what you
have told me now? - A. From 2.30. No later than
quarter to three.

So between 2.30 and quarter to three is what you are
saying? - A. Yes.

I take it that a large crowd of people were there? -
A. Yes.

On the way down or when you were at the pub or
walking to the pub did you meet any people who were
looking for tickets? - A. Yes, I met quite a few,
about 70 or 80 people round the c o m e r from the
turnstiles.

70 or 80? - A. Yes, about that many.

Were they all asking for tickets or were they just a
big crowd of 70 or 80 people? - A. They were all
along a wall just asking for spares, spare tickets.

You think there may have been as many as 70 or 80? -
A. Yes, roughly.

Did you also notice whether people were drinking from
cans to any extent? - A. No, the only people who were
drinking were in the pubs.

Did you see any Police Officers on the way down to
the ground? - A. Outside the pubs and down the road
but none in the immediate area of the ground.

On the way down? - A. Yes, I saw quite a few.

You had to come down and turn right into the
turnstile area, is that right? - A. That is right.

When you got to the ground you say you did not see
any Police Officers in the immediate vicinity? - A.
Only two on horseback, two mounted.

Where were they? - A. Before the turnstiles, a couple
of steel gates, and they were across the steel gates.

Which look like park gates? - A. Yes.

Were those gates shut when you came? - A. Yes. Well,
they had the Police horses across them to prevent
people going through.

The Police horses what? - A. Were across the gates
preventing people going through.
                                             G. I. SEDDQN


So you realised that is what they were intending to
do? - A. Yes.

What was happening in fact? - A. People queuing at
the turnstiles, they were waiting for the queues to
go down and then as the queues went down they were
letting a few more in but everybody was pushing
trying to get through because it was getting late.
Are you saying, in fact, the people outside the
turnstiles were actually trying to get in despite the
fact that the horses were there because they wanted
to get? - A. You are getting pushed from behind and
you are all pushing with the flow of people.

Did you think you yourself were going to miss the
kick-off when you got there? - A. I knew I would at
the time, yes.

Pardon? - A. I knew I had missed the kick-off then.
You did? - A. With the size of the crowd, yes.

Did people in the crowd comment on that? Were people
saying, "We will miss the kick-off"? - A. Yes, as it
got nearer three o'clock, "There is no way we are
getting in here". I did myself.
You did yourself? - A. Yes.

Did the pushing increase, did it diminish or did it
stay the same? - A. No, it increased. The more
people got there, the later it got, the more it
increased, the pushing.

The more it increased? - A. Yes.

Did you see anybody distressed? - A. As the game
kicked off.

I mean outside? - A. Some were with the pushing,
"Leave it out" they were shouting, "Getting too much
this".

You yourself were not too worried? - A. No, I have
seen it all before.

You have seen it all before, have you? - A. Yes.

At Hillsborough or different grounds? - A. Different
grounds, Hillsborough as well.

As far as you were concerned it was... - A. A typical
football game, yes.
                                             G. I. SEDDQN



Did you eventually get through the perimeter gates?
You must have done obviously? - A. Yes, when the
Police horses moved.

As the Police horses moved or pushed they dispersed
and the whole crowd went through the perimeter gates
to the turnstiles and then it was just like a
bottleneck at the turnstiles.  It was so crowded that
there was nobody going through the turnstiles. You
could not squeeze through.

Did you then see a gate open? - A. Yes, after the
kick-off. When you are near the kick-off there is
more of a crush.

What made you say the kick-off had actually taken
place because you were obviously outside? - A. You
hear the roar.

You heard a roar and you deduced it from that? - A.
You know the noises. When you go to the game you
know the noises from the kick-off.

Did you look at your watch? - A. I don't think I was
wearing a watch.

You, in your mind, felt that the kick-off had taken
place? - A. You know, yes.

Because of the roar? - A. You know.

Did you actually see any gates open, any big gates? -
A. Yes.

Did you see them opening or did you just see them
when they were opened? - A. I was seeing them getting
drawn back.

You did? - A. As we were queuing at the turnstiles.

Which gate did you see open? - A. The gate to the
left of us.




                         /Q. Show me on that model.
                                           G. I. SEDDON


Show me on that model which gate you saw. - A. This
one here.

     MR. GRIFFITHS:   He has indicated Gate B, sir.

     THE CORONER: That is what I thought he was going
to say, but I wanted to be sure.

      MR. GRIFFITHS:  The witness has indicated he
went through Gate B and then through the gate in the
wall.

     THE CORONER: Come back and you can tell us in
your own words. So you were in that area where there
was a wall on your left and then there was this big
gate? - A. Yes.

It was that big gate on your left-hand side which
opened? - A. That is right.

You decided, because the turnstiles did not seem to be
functioning, to go through that gate? - A. We waited a
couple of minutes to try going through the turnstiles,
but there was no movement so we just went through the
gate.

Having got through the gate what did you do then? - A.
We went through the next gate in the separating wall.

So you came back on yourself, so to speak? - A.   Yes.

Why was that? - A. That was the way the crowd seemed
to be pushing that way through the gate and then
through the next one.

So the crowd was actually moving in that direction? -
A. Like a snake, yes.

How well did you know the ground? - A. I have only
been once before, so not very well.

Did you know that you could get onto the ground if you
had gone straight and you would have got up onto the
terrace on the left side? - A. No.

Did you know about the tunnel, how to get in? - A. No.

So you, in fact, just followed the crowd? - A. Just
followed the crowd, yes.

Having come through that little gap in the wall, what
happened then? - A. Most of the crowd went straight
down the tunnel, but we stopped off for a programme
                                              G. I. SEDDON


and to go to the toilet and that.   We broke out of the
crowd.

So you were able to do that? - A. The initial crowd
that went through the gate was a lot more severe than
the crowd we went through because we were waiting at
the turnstile.

So you were at the tail end of it? - A. Yes, that is
right.

Are you saying that the crowd which went through the
gate which you entered initially went through with --
A. Quite a bit of force, yes.

You stopped by a programme seller, you went to the
toilet and then I think you decided to go down the
tunnel as well, is that right? - A. That is right,
yes.

In fact, I do not think you did buy a programme? - A.
No, it was too chocka.

It was too busy and so you decided it was time to go?
- A . The game had kicked off.

When you looked through the tunnel could you see what
was happening on the pitch? - A. No. It just looked
like any normal crowd behind. You could just see the
people.

What I am trying to find out is did you see the
players on the pitch? - A. You could just about see
the pitch through the tunnel, yes.

Were the players on it? - A. Yes.

Definitely on it? - A. Yes.

No question about that? - A. No.

Could you see whether they were just kicking the ball
around or were they actually playing, or did you not
see it? - A. No, you could only make out the goal and
just see the players.

You could not really tell? - A. No, you could not tell
the game was on even, no.

But when you looked down you could see what looked
like to you as if it was going to be a normal
situation? - A. Yes.

You went down the tunnel - right? - A. Yes.
                                            G. I. SEDDON


Going down the tunnel you did not have any
difficulties, did you? - A. No, not really.

There were not that many people? I mean there were
people, but there were not that many? - A. We were on
the tail end of the crowd so it was abiteasier.

Were there people coming in behind you did you notice?
- A. Yes, not many.

Many or not many? - A. Not many.

Were you walking slow, fast, running, what were you
doing? - A. Walking quite fast.

Were you with your two friends? - A. Yes.

By the way, did you see any people standing along the
walls of the tunnel when you were going down? - A. No,
not really no.

You did not? - A. No.

When you got to the end of the tunnel was it blocked
by people or not? - A. Yes, it was blocked by people.

How deep into the tunnel was the block? Do you
understand what I am meaning? - A. Yes. It was on the
edge of the tunnel. It wasn't that bad that you
couldn't get through the people. You had to push your
way through the people at the back to getin.

That is, in fact, what you did? - A. Yes.  Some people
are content just to stand at the back, you see. I
like to get a bit further in the middle.

I think you went towards the right, is that correct? -
A. Yes.

Into what we now know as Pen 3? - A. Yes.

Is that the same pen you went in in 1988? - A. No.

You went to the left, did you? - A. Yes. I didn't go
down the tunnel. I didn't go through the same
entrance.

I misunderstood you then. You pushed your way, or
wriggled your way, or whatever word you wish to use,
through the crowd which was at the back? - A. That is
right.

What happened then? - A. The game had kicked off.
                                          G. I. SEDDON


It had definitely kicked off? - A. Yes.

You are sure about that? - A. Yes, because I remember
Liverpool hitting the bar. When Liverpool hit the bar
there was a big push. When you think it is going in
the goal, you jump.

I am trying to find out whether the game had kicked
off. Was it already in play when you got onto the
terrace in the first instance? - A. Yes, it was in
play.

It was in play? - A. Yes.

Not just that they were kicking the ball about? - A.
No. I think it was in play, yes.

Carry on. What was your first impression of the
terrace once you got through the crowd at the back
there? - A. Where we ended up it wasn't very chocka.,
you know, it was quite calm.

We will get you to show us in a minute where that was,
but just describe it. - A. Right in the centre of Pen
3.

In the centre? - A. Yes, maybe a bit further towards
the back than the centre.

So at that point you were quite content with the
terrace for yourself? - A. We were happy at our place,
yes.

And the match was in play? - A. Yes, that is right.

You were watching it? - A. Yes.

You were able to watch it? - A. Not then because
people were starting to get over the fence then.

That is right, so when you got to the position where
you were and which was acceptable, were people already
beginning to climb over the fence at that point, or
was it a little bit later or before? - A. Within a
couple of minutes, yes.

Before they started climbing over the fence, were
people cheering and being happy in the area where you
were? - A. Yes, it seemed pretty normal.  It is a
shallow terrace, you can't see what is in front of
you.

Could you hear any cries from the front at all at that
point? - A. At that point no, not really.
                                                          10

                                                 G. I. SEDDON


Q.   You then saw people starting to climb over the
     railings? - A. Yes. First of all, I had seen a Police
     Officer shouting, "Get back".

Q.   That was the first thing you saw? - A. Yes, but at
     first I couldn't understand why, and there was nowhere
     to go anyway, and then people started climbing over
     the fence.

Q.   In fact, you at that point had no idea what was
      happening? - A. No, you couldn't see nothing, no.

Q.   When was it that you first realised that something was
     happening which was extraordinary? - A. When a
     Policeman ran on the pitch to see the referee.

Q.   That was when you first realised that things were not
      as they should be? - A. At that stage there were a lot
      of people on the fence then and the Policeman ran on
      the pitch and got the referee.

Q.   I think at some point you   actually started going
     forward to have a look to   see what was going on? - A.
     Yes, that is right. Mark    Best, a friend of ours, he
     went down first when they   went off the pitch. It got
     quite easy then.

Q.   When the players went off the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q.   Is that when you went forward? - A. Yes.   It went
      through a bit of a calm and Mark went under first,
     under the crash barrier, and then he called me down
      and probably Steven, I don't know, and we went under
      the first crash barrier and the second crash barrier
      was on the floor twisted.

Q.   Was it then that you saw that people were hurt and
     injured? - A. Yes, as we walked down, yes.

Q.   Did you go out through the front, or what did you do
     yourself, can you remember? - A. Well, my first
     reaction was to cry like for a couple of seconds, and
     then we just got the bodies off. There was just a
     mass of bodies.

Q.   So you started helping? - A.   Yes.

Q.   From what you were saying it sounds to me as if you
     did not really notice the gate in the front of the
     perimeter track as such until later on? - A. Only when
      it got opened. I didn't notice there was a gate
      there.
                                             G. I. SEDDON


In other words, you saw it when it was opened? - A.
When it was getting opened, yes.

Do you mean it was actually being opened, or that it
was open? - A. I can remember people shouting at the
Police and they seemed to be in that area.  It was
only then I realised that is where the gate was.

Was this after the Police Officer had already got on
the fence and shouted, "Push back"? - A. Yes, long
after.

Long after? - A. Well, five minutes or so, yes.

Had the game already finished by then? - A. Yes.

It was then that you heard calls about the gate and
noticed the Police Officer? - A. Yes.

So prior to that you had not    seen the gate at all?   -
A. No, I had not noticed it.

So you would now know whether it was open before or
not, you have no idea? - A. No.




                          /Q.    Show us on the
                                             G. I. SEDDON


Show us on the plan where you were, when you were, as you
described it, reasonably comfortable.     (The witness
marked the plan)    I think that will do.   It was after
the game had finished you said you had moved forward. -
A. That is where we started off and then we went under
that crush barrier.
That was when the game had finished? - A. That's right.

     MR. BEECHEY:   C.445.

     THE CORONER:   That position which you have shown
there.   You know the overhang from the stand? - A. Yes.

Were you in front of it or were you behind it? - A. I
wouldn't know, to be honest.

You didn't see the people going up then?   You didn't
notice people being pulled up? - A. Yes, you could see
people getting lifted up from the back.

Were they being lifted up behind you or from in front of
you? - A. From behind.

So you were further forward? - A. That's right.

You didn't really pay much attention to them, I take it?
- A. Not really, no.

So you can't describe them?   You can't describe what the
people looked like who were being pulled up? -A. No, not
really.   They just seemed to want to be getting into the
stands for whatever reason.

That was your impression anyway? - A. Yes.

In 1988, let's just quickly deal with that.   Youcame to
the match.   I take it you entered through the same
turnstiles, would that be right? - A. I am not sure
really.

Where did you position yourself in 1988? - A. Looking at
that there...

That is only part of the plan.   Sergeant Griffiths,
could you put a plan of the whole of the ground up?   I
just want to see where you were in 1988. - A. Roughly
there.

That was pen 1? - A. Yes, 1 or 2.

Do you remember how you got into there?  You said you
didn't go down the tunnel? - A. No, I can't remember.      I
know that is where we had to go the year before.
                                             G. I. SEDDON


But you don't know how you got there? - A. No.

You don't remember what time it was that you... - A.
Roughly the same sort of time.   It is usually the same
that we go.

Can you remember anything at all about the tunnel in
1988? - A. No, I never saw the tunnel that I can
remember.

You didn't see it as far as you recollect? - A. No.

             Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Can you go back to the time when you arrived outside the
park perimeter gates?    By which time you arrived there
were some Policemen with horses obviously trying to hold
the crowd back from the perimeter gates to give
protection to the people who were congregating outside
the turnstiles? - A. I think it was more to keep them
slightly orderly.   There weren't a lot of people the
other side of the gates.    I don't think they were in
need of protection.   It was just to let them go through
the turnstiles and then to let more in to queue up for
the turnstiles.

Were the Police successful in holding back the crowd
outside the park gates? - A. No.

Can you explain in your own words what happened about
that? - A. As more people pushed, the Police were
shouting, "Get back.   Get back/'   There were so many
people there the horse couldn't take the pressure and
they just seemed to split up and then everybody charged
through to the turnstiles.

Everyone what? - A. Charged through to the turnstiles.
Well, I say "charged", they rushed through with the
weight of the crowd.

Why was it that people didn't respond to the instructions
by the Police to hold back? - A. Well, it is the weight
of numbers really.    We are right in the front by the
Police horses.    You couldn't see nothing but people
behind you.    It was just the weight of people.

At that point in your evidence you were asked by the
Coroner whether you were worried, or something to that
effect, and you said you weren't because you had seen it
all before? - A. A lot of big games are very similar.
The same sort of crushes getting into the ground.

I would like you to help the jury about your experience
at other big games.   Before you start telling us about
                                                               14

                                                    G. I. SEDDON


     that experience, how long have you been attending big
     match? - A. I have been going to home games at Anfield
     since I was 9 years old.

Q. How old are you now? - A. Twenty-three.

Q. So that's home matches at Anfield.   You mentioned other
   grounds as well as Hillsborough? - A. Well, I have been
   going to away games and semi-finals for five years.

Q.    As a keen Liverpool supporter?   - A. Yes.

Q.    What do you mean by saying you have seen similar
     situations at other grounds?    Give as much information
     as you can in your own words. - A. Well, every game -
     inside or outside the ground?    Inside the ground, the
     likes of Liverpool FC, most Liverpool supporters tend to
     congregate in the middle of any ground.    That is where
     the atmosphere is and that is where it is most crowded.
     As a Liverpool supporter, and I like the atmosphere, that
     is where I tend to go myself.

Q. You mentioned this in connection with the crowd outside.
   - A. Well, outside the ground it is usually a lot better.
   At Millwall, for instance, we were coming out after a cup
   game and we were just pushed by the Police into a small
   pen.   There was only like a chickenwire fence stopping
   us from going over the edge. There was about a twenty
   foot drop and that was worse, I thought, than what was at
   Hillsborough.

Q. You mean that particular experience? - A. Yes. Well, my
   feet left the ground then with the crush.   That was
   outside the ground.

Q.   Another thing you mentioned was that when you arrived in
     Sheffield, when you had some time to spare before the
     match you went to a pub and had some drink? -A. Yes.

Q.   How many were therein your   group at that time? - A. Just
     the three of us.

Q.   Were there other people in thepub as well?    - A. Yes,
     there were about eighty people in the pub.

Q.    Were they Liverpool supporters as well? -A. Half and
     half.   A lot of Sheffield people - locals - and
     Liverpool supporters as well.

Q. The amount you had to drink, five pints, is that more
   than most people or less or what? - A. Pretty average,
   really.
                                             G. I. SEDDON


Is this a normal thing when you go to a big match?   I am
not... - A. It's normal for me, yes.

I am asking you from your experience as a keen football
supporter.   Is that a normal thing for football
supporters to drink that sort of amount before they go to
a match? - A. Yes, as far as I know.




      Q. Does this have any effect
                                             G.   I.   SEDDON


Does this have any effect on your personal behaviour,
do you think? - A. No, not really.  I mean, if the law
let me drive I would drive with five pints, but because
it doesn't I don't.

Do you think this has any effect on the behaviour of
the other people who drink similar sort of amounts
before a match? - A. Young people it would, yes.

Younger than you, you mean? - A. Yes.

You look pretty young to me. - A. I mean 17, 18 year
olds, they go a bit wild every ,now and again.

Younger ones, 17 or 18 year olds, go wilder? - A. Well
more than likely, yes.

But at your age it is different,   is it? - A. Yes.  I do
drink quite a lot and five pints   really is nothing to
me.

No? - A. No.

I am not really only interested in your amount of
drinking, I am asking you from your experience as a
football supporter about other people, and are you
describing the general behaviour of other people? - A.
I can only speak for Liverpool supporters.  Liverpool
supporters I find are well behaved in pubs, and it
doesn't matter what they drink.

One other point about your experience as a football
supporter, can you confirm that it is quite common,
especially at big matches behind the goal, for there to
be a big crush just before kick off? - A. That is
right.

Then after kick-off the crowd finds its level? - A.
That is right, yes.

That happens at various different grounds? - A. Yes,      it
happens at Anfield every week.

Have you continued to go   to football matches after this
disaster? - A. Yes.

Has there been any change in behaviour? - A. Not at
football, no.

Of the kind that we have just been talking about? - A.
At Anfield, yes, going out of the ground it is a lot
easier, there is a lot less crushing.   You are always
hearing, "Leave off", any pushing is   usually a lot less
at Anfield, going out of   the ground, but going    in it is
                                               G.   I.    SEDDON


always easier to get in at Anfield.    I can only really
speak about Anfield.


            Cross-Examined by MR.   ISAACS

Mr. Seddon, you mentioned to the Coroner that when you
approached the ground there were a number, a large
number, 70 or 80 people, round the corner from the
turnstiles, all along a wall? - A. Yes.

Asking for spares.  Could you nelp us with this, give
us perhaps a little bit more meat on the bone?  Where
were they?  Can you show us from the plan or perhaps
from the model where they would have been when you say
round the corner from the turnstiles? - A. Hot on the
mo d e l .

Not on the model.   Have a look at the plan.

     THE CORONER:   I think he   will need another plan.
It is the overhead we want.

     MR. ISAACS:    That is the one, sir - I think C255.

     THE CORONER:    Yes, C255 is probably the best.

     MR. ISAACS:    Does that help you at all,      Hr.
Seddon? - A. Yes.

Could you show us?   The Officer will point for you.
(The Witness used Exhibit C255 to illustrate his
ev idence) You are indicating the wall on the otnar
side of Leppings Lane, directly opposite the turnstile
area?   No, you are pointing somewhere else - to tne
wall along the bridge? - A. Yes.

Very well.  So where were these people, sat on the
wall, sat against the wall, stood against the wall,
that sort of thing? - A. Yes, just leaning.

How is it that you appreciated, realised that they were
asking for spares and they did not have tickets? - A.
Even derbys at Anfield it is the same there, there is
always people without tickets at big games.

Always is, but why these particular people? - A. What
do you mean?

What was it that made you realise that these are the
normal people who don't have tickets at the game? - A.
As you walked past they are asking for spares, which
means a spare ticket.
                                           G.   I.   SEDDON


70 or 80 is quite a lot of people.  You feel pretty
sure that it was around that sort of number? - A. Yes.
You get hundreds at Wembley.

I am sure you do but on this particular occasion there
they all were, in that particular position, and it was
not just an occasional one of those people who were
asking people who went by for spares, but virtually
everybody? - A. Yes, that is where they seem to
congregate, as you are going towards the turnstiles
they always wait.  It is a good vantage point near the
turnstiles where tney can see the Liverpool supporters
coming from wherever their transport was.

So you reckon that people who were in that area amongst
that particular group, because of where they were and
what members of that group were doing, were all part of
the normal looking for tickets crowd? - A. Yes.   You
see, there might be five lads together and only one
wants a spare, a spare ticket.  The rest have got
tickets.

But you can't tell that? - A. No, you wait with your
mates.  I have been to a game without a ticket and my
mates wait with me until I have got my ticket, if I get
one

So lesser numbers than the numbers actually congregated
there might have been without tickets? - A. There might
only have been ten people wanted tickets, but there was
70, 80 people there.

I see, and they were in the position that you showed
us? - A. I think so, yes.

Ready to go towards the ground, for example, if a gate
opened? - A. Well, you couldn't have seen the gates
open from there.  Maybe you would have seen tne crush
get less but ....

Well, we nave heard some evidence about this.    Thank
you very much indeed.

           Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING

I have a note, just pursuing that point, that you said,
"All along the walk there were people asking for
spares".  Does that mean the walk when you came from
the public house, the ten minutes or so while you were
walking down to the ground? - A. No, all along the
wall, that area there.

I want to look at one or two different things with you.
Did you recognise either of the mounted Officers as
                                                                 19

                                                   G.   I.   SEDDON


     being people that you had seen at Anfield, that they
     were Liverpool Police Officers? - A. No, I didn't
     recognise them.

0. we have had mounted Officers come to give us evidence
   and you won't have heard what they said, but I wonder
   if you would like to comment on what the Officers said,
   that the crowd on that day just did not appear to want
   to listen to them saying to hold back, to stand still?
   - A. That could be true, yes.

0. You were in front of a Police horse, you were able to
   stand still, weren't you? - A. .No, I was getting
   pushed.

0. Yes, instantaneously when you came up to the perimeter
   gates .... - A. That is right.

Q.   You were at the front? - A. Yes.

Q.    Then at tnat moment in time you stopped because        there
     was a Police horse there? - A. Yes.

Q. And you heard a Police Officer on that horse saying,
   "Stand still, get back"? - A. That's right, I could
   hear him.

Q.   And he was doing it continuously? - A. That    is right.

Q.   You were trying to do that? - A. I was just    moving with
     the crowd.

0. You had stopped? - A. Yes, we stopped because there was
   a Police horse in the way.

Q.   That is right and he had said to you, "Don't go any
     further" or "Stop, get back", all those sort of things?
     - A. That is right.

Q. And you could see clearly from where you were standing
   why it was that they were acting as a sort of filter
   system to clear the people from the immediate turnstile
   area and then let some more people come through? - A.
   That is right.

0. Then a time came when people joined behind, when you
   found yourself getting pushed, and then more people
   came and you found yourself getting even more pushed? -
   A. That is right.

Q. Whilst you were standing there did you see anybody grab
   the reins of the Police horse? - A. No.
                                                               20

                                                 G.   I.   SEDDOIJ


Q. Did you see anybody punch a Police horse? - A. No.         I
   seen a couple of people get under the Police horse.

Q. That was the next question - you actually saw somebody
   going right underneath the Police horse, under its
   legs? - A. They had to, yes.

0. Do you agree a dangerous thing to do for everybody? -
   A. Well, maybe if I was in their circumstances I would
   have gone under myself.

Q. Let's please move inside the ground.  You said that you
   would not have gone in through ±hat gate straightaway,
   you wanted to see what it was about and wnether you
   could get through tne turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. So you waited for a couple of minutes outside the
   turnstile, before you decided that you were not moving
   anywhere and you may as well go through tne gate as
   well? - A. That is right.

Q.   So you were not in the first crush of   people going
     through that gate? - A. No.

Q. You have described the way in which they entered as
   being severe? - A. That is right.

0. Would you have liked to have tried either to have gone
   and got a programme or gone to the toilet, if you had
   been part of that first onrush through the gate? - A.
   No, you would have just gone with the crowd.

Q. When you came to the terrace were the three of you
   still together then? - A. Yes.

0.   You were able, by pushing through the  people at the
     back, to gain a position on the terrace? - A. That is
     ri g h t .

Q. The three of you in that position marked with the "x",
   the three of you together? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q. I just wanted to ascertain whether that "x" really
   marked the position of all three of you.  You were
   still together on the terrace? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. At that stage you were not uncomfortable? - A. No, it
   was quite easy where we were.

Q. Quite easy, and you would have been content, had it not
   been for this disaster, you would have been quite
   content to have watched the match from there? - A. Yes.

Q. You had no idea at all what was going on down in front
   of you? - A. No, not at that time.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING

0. Mr. Seddon, can you just help us on some of the matters
   you have been asked about already for the moment?  Unen
   you talk about going with the crowd, and the weight of
   the crowd, what do you mean by that? - A. If there is a
   large number of people going the same place it is a lot
   of weight.

0. Do you yourself as an individual have much control over
   your own movements when you are in a crowd like that? -
   A. No.

Q. It has been suggested to you that you stopped and then
   you moved forward again.  What caused you to move
   forward again? - A. At what point was tnis?

Q. While you were by the horse, the Police horse.    - A.
   With the weight of the crowd the Police horse
   dispersed.

0. Were you yourself consciously forcing your way in? - A.
   Yes.

Q. In so doing was it with the people around you, that you
   were up against the people in front of you then, and
   the person in front of you was ftaving the weight of you
   behind them? - A. No.   When the Police horses
   separated, I moved.   I went to the turnstile.

Q. And the person in front of you, they went too? - A. I
   think at that time we were near enough at the front.

Q. I see, you were at the front, so you did not have to
   force your way in by the sound of it? - A. No, the
   Police horses got out of the way, pushed or separated
   themselves, I don't know.

0. Sorry, I misunderstood you.  I thought you said you
   forced your way in and clearly you did not have to
   force your way? - A. No, you went with the weight of
   the crowd behind you.

0. Let me then take you into the ground, and this does
   interest me.  You say that you went through a gate
   which we know is gate B - I wonder if Mr. Griffiths
   could just show us gate B - that would take you into
   the concourse on the other side of the dividing wall
   from the tunnel? - A. That is right.

0. You see the gateway you went through? - A. Yes.
                                                              22

                                                 G.   I.   SEDDON


Q. There was a gate there, wasn't there? - A. Yes.

Q. There was actually a gate? - A. I am not sure.  It just
   looked like an opening to me.  I think there was a
   gate, yes.

Q. Was that gate open or snut as far as you could tell? -
   A. Yes, it was open.

0. Did you see anybody in the concourse where Mr.
   Griffiths is pointing, did you see any Police Officers
   in that concourse area? - A. No, we just went straight
   with the tail end of the crowd..

0.    So there was nothing preventing your going through that
     opening in the wall into the concourse with the crowd?
     - A. No.

Q. When you got to the end of the tunnel, as I understand
   your evidence the fact that there was a block of people
   at the end, you said to yourself that wasn't
   particularly unusual. - A. No.

Q. Because some people like to stand there? - A. That is
   rignt.

Q.    So you had to worm your way in but you did not regard
     yourself as doing anything foolish  or daft or anything
     like that? - A. No, I do that every week when I go to
     my position at Anfield.




                 /0. My learned friend
                                               G. I. SEDDQN


My learned friend, Mr. Payne, was the gentleman who
asked you the questions to begin with, said at
Anfield you expect the crowd to ease off. You heard
that question, did you? - A. Yes.

At Anfield is it right that the terraces open across
the whole of the terrace? - A. That is right, yes.

You can spread all the way across if you wish? - A.
Yes. You could not be forced into one area.   It
spreads out right across the Kop.

Unlike here, of course, where you have pens and
radial fences? - A. You cannot move, no.

I am also interested in your evidence as somebody who
was not aware apparently of the horror which was
going on at the front of the pen at the time it was
going on. Clearly you were not aware of what was
going on at the front until very later? - A. No, not
until we went down and saw it.

You are very helpful to us for the sort of view you
had as somebody in that position in the pen. Can I
show you two photographs? First of all, can I show
you C.327 and then I want to ask you to look at C.328
please? - A. Yes.

Mr. Seddon, you told us I think that when you got on
to the terrace your impression was that the game was
already in play. That is what your impression was? -
A. That is right.

You can take it from me that that photograph was
taken at a certain time. You can see the time on the
electronic scoreboard if you look in the middle near
the top at 1501? - A. That is right.

So it is just after three o'clock? - A. Yes.

You would have not long perhaps been on the terrace.
You might have just been coming in at this point, I
do not know? - A. I was probably just coming in, yes.

Turn the page to the next photograph, C.328? - A.
Yes.

This is only a couple of minutes later, three minutes
past three? - A. That is right, yes.

You might have been on the terrace for a minute or so
and maybe again just arriving. From your position,
and this is a good three minutes or so before the man
                                               G. I. SEDDQN


ran on the pitch to stop the game? - A. That is
right.

Did you ever see all these people? From your
position could you see all these people apparently
out of the pen and on to the pitch side behind the
goal? Could you see all that? - A. I do not think
so. You see the Police and that in front and people
climbing the fence and that was it. It is so shallow
at Hillsborough you cannot see.

This is not a criticism of you, Mr. Seddon.  In fact,
I am investigating because it is important what
somebody in your position can see because you are
there? - A. If you were on the Kop you would see
that.

Yes but not from your position? - A. That is right.
Just going back to C.327, you can see that fairly
early on, just after three o'clock, there was a
situation at the front which if you had seen it would
have made you ask questions of yourself, would it
not? - A. Yes.

You also told us that you were conscious of a
Policeman shouting to get back? - A. That is right.

First of all, you said to us that you could not
understand why he was asking that? - A. No.
I take it from that again that you could not tell
what was happening at the front? - A. No, like I say
it was pretty easy where we were stood.

What did you mean by saying, "There was nowhere to go
anyway"? What did you mean by that? - A. All that
was behind us was a wall, the wall underneath the
stand.  I mean, they had the little tunnel but you
could not obviously all go back through that little
tunnel.

The position was of   somebody in your position that
you did not realise   what was going on at the front?-
A. No.

You could not see what was going on at the front? -
A. No.

As far as you could see there was nowhere to go
anyway.

Let me go back to 1988. You told us,      did you not,
that your favourite   position it would   appear would be
                                             G. I. SEDDQN


in the centre because most people like to be in the
centre? - A. That is where I wanted to go the year
before but couldn't.

Can we go back to C.274, the plan? Let me just
remind you that it shows the West Stand and it shows
the standing terrace in front of it at the Leppings
Lane? - A. Yes, that is right.

It is my fault because I was making a note at the
time and I was not watching, but could you tell us
again where you were in 1988.looking at the plan? -
A. Pens 1 and 2.

     THE CORONER:   Could you turn round and just
look to see whether the Officer is pointing to the
right spot? - A. That is right, yes.

     MR. KING:   That is in the right hand corner if
you have got your back to the terraces? - A. That is
right, yes.

That is not where you would   like to have   gone in
1988. You would have liked to have gone behind the
goal in the centre pens? - A. Yes.

You do not recall ever going down the tunnel in 1988
from what I understand? - A. No, not that I can
remember, no.

I suspect you would remember if you went down the
tunnel. You certainly do not remember it, do you? -
A. No.

Can you help us as to how it was that you could not
get to the centre pens in 1988 if that is where you
wanted to be? - A. You see the segregation fences?

Yes. - A. They prevent you going any further and that
was also the pen where my ticket had to go. That is
where on my ticket, it was probably down for Pens 1
and 2 and I probably went to the turnstiles for that
pen.

I have to tell you, Mr. Seddon, we have seen the
tickets for 1989 and I will be put right if I am
telling you anything wrong but so far as I understand
it none of the tickets indicated a particular pen at
all.  It just indicated whether you were in a
standing terrace or a seat, you see? - A. I cannot
remember that now.

You would certainly have liked to have got on to the
centre pens, would you not? - A. That is right, yes.
                                                               26

    Q. So something prevented you apparently going down a
       way which would lead to the centre pens? - A. That is
B      right.  I was with my brother that year and we would
       have gone in as far as probably the segregation fence
       and that would have been it. We could not go any
       further then.

    Q. So be it. You obviously got on to the side pen
       otherwise than down the tunnel? That would seem
       obvious from what you are telling us? - A. That is
       right, yes.

    Q. Did you observe the end of a tunnel in 1988? - A. No,
       no.

    Q. It looks as if you did not notice any big opening in
       the concourse at all in 1988? - A. No.

    Q. If there had been a big opening it might be that that
       was shut off to you? - A. That is right, yes.

                  Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:
    Q. Mr. Seddon, you indicated that you went through Gate
       B when you pointed to the plan? - A. That is right.

    Q. Had a huge crowd gone in through that gate before you
       had? - A. Yes, before we had.

    Q. You are quite sure it was Gate B or could it have
       been Gate C? - A. No, because we could not see Gate C
       from our position. As far as I knew that was the
       only gate that was opened, Gate B.

    Q. You thought only Gate B was opened? - A. Yes, it was
       only later on that I heard that the other gate got
       opened.

    Q. It could not have been Gate A, for instance? - A. I
       only know two gates.

    Q. Might it have been Gate A? - A. No, I think it is
       definitely Gate B we went through.

    Q. What time was that please? - A. Just after kick-off.

    Q. We have heard a lot about 1988 and that you did not
       go to the centre pens. You did not go down the
       tunnel that year? - A. No.

    Q. Do you think someone may have directed you around to
       Pen 1 or 2 that year? Your ticket did not direct you
       but a steward or the Police may have directed you? -

A. They may have done. That is where we ended up.
We didn't want to be there, like.

You cannot really remember how it was you got
there? - A. No.

I think you did say you did know there were dividing
fences, did you not? - A. That is right, yes.

Did you know that in 1988? - A. Not until I was in
the ground.

You did discover they were there then? - A. That is
right, y es.

It seems from your evidence you thought the dividing
fence completely separated the pens from each other,
didn't you? - A. That is right, yes.

You were not aware of a radial gate at the back of
the pen, were you? - A. No.

So you did not see a Police Officer standing at those
gateways indicating that there was a route along
there? - A. No. I didn't know there was.

So that you could move from pen to pen? - A. I just
thought it was a complete segregation.

It looked to you like a complete segregation because
obviously the crowds would fill in those areas? - A.
That is right.

There would be nothing that would stand out to
attract your attention. You would just see the
masses there? - A. Yes.

It would have made it a lot easier for you, no doubt,
if you had seen someone with an illuminated bib
standing at that gateway.  It would have drawn your
attention, wouldn't it, to that spot? - A. That is
right.

You would wonder why they were standing there? - A.
Yes.

          Cross-Examined bv MISS ADDLEMAN:

I would just like to ask you about one point in your
evidence after you got into the pen and I think
before you realised anything was wrong you saw people
being lifted into the stands behind you, is that
correct? - A. That is right, yes.
                                             G. I. SEDDON


You did not pay much attention to that, is that
right? - A. No.

That I think is because that occurs quite regularly
at matches that people go in there? - A. Maybe one or
two.   I have seen maybe the odd one or two the odd
time at Wembley, for instance, but it does not occur
that often. People tend to stay where they have been
put.  I go in the terracing and I am happy to stay in
the terracing.

Did you think to yourself, given your experiences at
Wembley where it is a big match, that people have not
got a good view and that is why they are going up? -
A. At that ground possibly, yes.

            Cross-Examined bv MR. RUSSELL:

Can I take you back to the time when you arrived
outside the perimeter gates? It was at a time when
you were aware that kick-off was getting reasonably
imminent? - A. That is right.

You could see a crowd outside the perimeter gates? -
A. Yes.

You could see mounted Policemen in that crowd? - A.
Yes.

As you approached that crowd, is it fair to say you
could see and or hear what those mounted Policemen
were trying to do? - A. Yes, I could.

Just for clarity's sake, could you tell us what that
was, what you appreciated at that stage you realised
the mounted Police were trying to do? - A. Trying to
prevent everybody going through to the turnstiles.

So you approached that crowd and as you got to the
last person constituting a member of that crowd did
you stop? - A. Yes, I stopped.

You stopped and waited for something else to
happen? - A. Yes. Before he had let a few more in.
As we got to the front by the horse...

Before you got to the front by the horse presumably
you had made your way through the crowd, between the
horse and the back of the crowd? - A. Yes.

Is this right; you joined that crowd and made your
way through it? - A. Yes.

Until you got to the horse? - A. That is right.
                                              G. I. SEDDON



The horse moved? - A. Yes.

You were able to dodge round the horse and into the
turnstile area? - A. The horses just went.  I did not
have to dodge them. The horse went and the gates
opened and we were free to go into the turnstiles.

Am I right about this; you did not wait to be
propelled through that crowd by people behind you?
You made your own way through from the back, is that
right? - A. You all went through together. There is
no way you could stand still with a couple of hundred
people behind you.  If you do not walk with them you
go under.

It was that sort of unstoppable force, was it? - A.
That is right, yes.

Would it be fair to say that you were a part of that
force? - A. Yes.

Now I want to take you forward in time to the point
where you have found your point in the middle of the
pen where you describe yourself as being in a
position which was pretty easy, do you remember? - A.
Ye s .

                                                               30

                                                 G. I. SEDDON


Q.   I think it is the one that you have marked on the
     plan? - A. That is right.

Q.   You could see that the game was in progress? - A. Yes.

Q.   And there came a time when you could see a Policeman
     standing on the fence, either saying or gesticulating,
     "Get back"? - A. That is right.

Q. At that stage, as you have told us, it was pretty easy
    in the area where you were standing? - A. Yes, it was
    comfortable.

Q.   Would it be fair to say that if the crowd had been
     minded to, you could have made more room around where
     you were and stood tighter together to have allowed
     the instruction given by the Policeman to take effect?
     - A. There was quite a bit of room round us.

Q.   So is the answer to my question "Yes"? - A. Well, it
     was already there, the room. The room around us was
     only because of the crash barrier going over.

Q.   You did not see the crash barrier go over, did you? -
      A. No, but when I saw the crash barrier I knew why it
      was so easy by us. There had become a void.

Q.   There were people standing in front of you? - A. Yes.

Q.   Who were equally in a position where it was, in your
      words, pretty easy? - A. That is right, yes.

Q.   If we could just pinpoint that, if you would look at
      the last photograph which you were asked to look at,
      which was C328 in the bundle which you have there. -
      A. Yes.

Q.   If you cannot discern what I am going to ask you, I
     shall ask Sergeant Griffiths to provide you with the
     original from which this photograph was taken, but you
     can see in that photograph behind the goal there is a
     Policeman without a hat on standing on the fence with
     his arms raised? - A. Yes.

Q.   He has got his armslike a pair of rugby     posts. - A.
      Is he on the fence?

Q.   He is on the fence and he   has not got a hat on. - A. I
      think so, yes.

Q.   Do you see that?

          MR. GRIFFITHS:   Near to the gate to   Pen 3, sir.

Q.          MR. RUSSELL:   That is at the gate to Pen 3. - A.
     Yes.

Q.   It is clearer on the original, if you could perhaps
     have that. Is that the position and the Policeman?
     Is that the gesticulating Policeman that you remember
     standing on the fence saying, "Get back"? - A. Yes,
     that is the same area as the Policeman I had seen,
     yes.

Q.   He, I think, is the only person in black on the fence
     at that point, is he not? - A. That is right.

Q. We know when that was happening because of the clock
    in the backgroundwhich says it is 3 minutes past 3? -
    A. Yes.

Q.   In the course of your evidence you told us, according
      to my note, this:   "I remember when Beardsley or
      Liverpool hit the cross-bar, or the bar, and there was
      a big push"? - A. I never saw him hit the bar, it was
      only what I heard somebody say.

Q.   But you remember the event? - A. That is right, yes.

Q.   Because the match was televised we know precisely when
     that occurred. - A. Yes.

Q.   We know that that happened at 8 seconds before 5
     minutes past 3, 15.04.58. - A. Yes.

Q.   That occurred then at least a minute after this
     Policeman was on the fence trying to encourage people
     to move back? - A. Yes.

Q.   That is right, is it not, and it would follow, would
     it not, that the push forward was exactly contrary to
     what the Policeman on the fence wanted to be done? -
     A. Yes, but we were watching a football match as well.

Q.   Yes, you were watching a football match and you were
     intent on the football? - A. Yes.

Q.   It is difficult to communicate with you because you
     and the other people in the pen were intent on the
     exciting action on the field? - A. That is right.

Q.   There was a time when you saw the gate at the front
     open? - A. Yes.

Q.   I think you told us that first one of your mates went
     forward and then he called you forward? - A. Yes, this
     was before the gate was open.
                                                            32

                                                G. I. SEDDON


Q.   This was.before the gate was open? - A. Yes, that is
     right.

Q.   Or before you noticed the gate was open? - A. Well,
     before I noticed the gate was open.

Q.   At that stage you were able to make your way forward
     fairly freely at first? - A. Yes.

Q.   Until you came upon the tangle of bodies, as people
      have described it, around the area where the crash
     barrier had gone down? - A. Yes.

                   Further by THE CORONER:

Q.   Can I just ask you a couple of questions which the
     Jury have asked me to ask. I think one is answered.
     I think you have almost answered the second one as
     well. The question was whetheryou saw Beardsley hit
     the cross-bar and I think you said you did not? - A.
     No, I never.

Q.   But did people around you say? Was it at the time,
     because of the noise, or people said, "Beardsley hit
     the cross-bar", or what happened? - A. Yes, it is the
     same sort of reaction when it goes in when it hits the
     cross-bar, yes.

Q.   It was not that you learned about it later, that is
     what I am trying to find out? - A. Yes, I learned
     about it later. I just jumped with the crowd. I
     never saw that at all, no.

Q.   So you did not know he hadhit   the cross-bar at the
     time? - A. At the time, no.

Q.   And nobody said to you, none of the people around you,
     "Beardsley's hit the cross-bar"? - A. No. I think it
     was Steve, he told me, "Imagine if that had gone in
     when he hit the bar".

Q.   So there was some comment made? - A. Yes, but that was
     after when we hit the bar, or somebody said, "If it
     had gone in it would have been a lot worse if it had
     been a goal".

Q.   But at that point there was a surge forward, you said?
     - A. Yes, that is right.

Q.   The other question that I want is just to take you
     back. When you were walking down towards the ground,
     or even walking up towards the pub, were you checked
     for tickets in 1989? - A. No.
                                                            33

Q.   What about 1988? - A. No.

Q.   Not at all? - A. I can't remember anyway.

            Further Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Q.   May I just follow up one particular matter which was
     raised by Mr. Russell.  I wonder if Mr. Griffiths
     could just put up 326 again. It is the one you have
     got open in front of you.

          THE CORONER: We have got a better one now, 326A.
     Mr. King, I do not think you were here when we got
     326A. Were you here, I cannot remember?

          MR. KING:    Sir, I feel aggrieved.   It was my
     suggestion.

          THE CORONER: I am sorry, Mr. King.

          MR. KING: I feel even more aggrieved that you do
     not recall because you said, and it stuck in my mind,
     "Well done Mr. King".

          THE CORONER: Yes I did, I am sorry. It just
     shows you, but you are quite right, absolutely
     correct. It is all coming back. We have put up 326A.

          MR. PAYNE:   It is about time Mr. King got some
     congratulation!

          THE CORONER: It is exactly the same photograph.
     It is just better quality print.

Q.        MR. PAYNE: That is the one taken two minutes
     earlier than the one you were looking at a few moments
     ago. - A. That is right.

          MR. RUSSELL: Sir, it is A minutes earlier, I
     think. The one I was showing was 3 minutes past 3.

           MR. PAYNE: Yes, thank you very much.
Q.   We can see that there is a shadow which falls across
      the crowd? - A. From the roof, yes.

Q.   It appears on the photograph that the people in
      sunlight appear to be very closely crowded? - A. Very
      tight, yes.

Q.   But the people in the shadow appear to be less
      crowded? - A. Yes, that is where we were.
                                            G. I. SEDDON


Many of us may have thought that that was a trick of
the light in the taking of the photograph? - A. No,
that seemed pretty right.

That is your experience, is it not? - A. Yes. If I
could make a reference to a newspaper picture, if you
have got them there.

Let us just go on to the one Mr. Russell was asking
you to look at, which is 328, because this one is
nearer the time, as Mr. Russell correctly says, when
you place your arrival into the place that you thought
was quite comfortable, about halfway up the terrace,
is that right? - A. Yes.

We can see in   our   mind's eye whereabouts you are
talking about   and   it is about just inside the line of
the shadow? -   A. That is right.

That is where you   were? - A. It wasn't that
comfortable.  It was slightly just behind. You know
where the main void is, it wasn't quite that comfy but
just slightly behind there. It wasn't pushy or not.

So from your own experience does the picture then give
a true idea of what it was like? - A. Yes, it does.

i.e. less crowded at the back but more crowded at the
front? - A. That is right, yes.

It is almost as if there is a line across the crowd
which goes where the shadow is? - A. Yes.

Never mind about what it seems from the photograph,
but thinking about what it was like when you were
actually there, is that your memory of what it was
like? - A. That is right, yes.

A question arising from that. I asked you earlier on
about crushing shortly before a kick-off and then the
crowd finding its own level after the kick-off, and I
did ask you about other grounds, not just Hillsborough
or Anfield, and you said that that does happen at
other grounds? - A. That is right, yes.

It is quite a common experience at different matches -
right? - A. I am only going as a Liverpool supporter.
With Liverpool supporters, yes.

So this is a situation which we are looking at in that
photograph, that if the crowd had been able to find
its level it would have done so by moving back into
the less crowded part where you were? - A. You go
forward and move back, but crash barriers and things
                                            G. I. SEDDON


prevent you.    You can only go as far back as a crash
barrier.

Quite. Where you were standing the crash barrier, the
one that broke, was about halfway between you and the
front perimeter fence, was it? - A. Yes, that is
right. I would say it is on line with that shadow,
looking at it there.

       Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Just arising out of that last point, it is right, is
it not, that the way a crowd finds its own level is
not just simply forward and backwards, it is sideways,
is it not? - A. Yes, that is right, you have got to
find your own footing.

I am just interested in two things arising out of what
you have been asked. First of all, you told my
learned friend Mr. Russell that it was only after what
you believed to be the crash barrier going that you
had this room around you. - A. Yes.

Before the crash barrier went, albeit you regarded it
as comfortable, just tell us what it was like in your
part of the pen as regards how close you were to the
man either in front of you, behind you, or alongside
you?

     THE CORONER: I do not mind you asking that
particular question, but I just wonder whether the
premise is correct. My impression was that what he
said was when he got into this area it was easy
straight away. He then subsequently made a deduction.
He said, "I think it was easy because when I
eventually moved forward I found the crash barrier had
gone and I deduced, therefore, that people had gone".

     MR. KING: I agree with that, but he was being
specifically asked about the room which he had when he
was conscious of the fact that someone was asking him
to move in some way, and he explained his own
impression at that time. Sir, what I am interested in
is simply his own factual evidence of what it was
like, whether we call it easy, comfortable, or what-
have-you.

     THE   CORONER: I am quite happy with that, but I
just did   not want you to put to him that he was there
and that   the crash barrier went after he had arrived.
I do not   think he said that.
                                             G. I. SEDDON


     MR. KING: I did put to him that it was his
impression and it was not that he knows or has any
knowledge.

     MR. MANNING:  If I may help my learned friend
with the notes which I am sure will be looked at by
others, he said this:  "My first impression of the
terrace was it not very chocka". Those were the words
he used.

      THE WITNESS: I think the crash barrier went with
the initial rush for the gate. As we got in it was a
void.

     MR. KING: I understand you said that. All I am
interested in is factually, not a label which you put
on it, but factually tell us where you were standing,
about how close you were to the man alongside you on
each side, the man in front or the man behind you,
albeit you say it was whatever word you describe it
as. - A. I can only explain it as a mid-table game,
Liverpool playing a mid-table game.

Yes, but can you put it in terms of shoulder to
shoulder and back to back? - A. The only way I can
explain it is by being at Anfield, that way like.

I cannot take that any further, I have done my best. -
A. It wasn't crowded.

I have got your point. I was trying to discover not
what you regard as crowded or not crowded, but
factually what it was like, and so be it. I will not
take it any further. Secondly you explained, indeed
Mr. Russell, the gentleman at the very end, said to
you as to the fact that it was difficult to
communicate with you from the front, and he was
talking about the Officer at the front. - A. Yes.




                         /Q.   He used the
                                                            37

Q. He used the words that it was difficult to communicate
               Yo“ explained that you were only football
   fans watching the match? -A. ThatYs right.

Q. Were you ever conscious not of somebody trying to
   communicate with you from the front, were you ever
   conscious of anybody such as a Police Officer coming down
   the tunnel from behind you trying to communicate with you
   from behind? - A. No.                                 7

              Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Mr. Seddon, you said you didn't realise people at the
   front of you were in difficulties? - A. No.

Q. But the Police Officer or Police Officers in the front
   were aware of it because they were saying, "Push back"?
   You saw them doing that? - A. Yes, they could see it from
   the front.

Q« They could see because they were much closer to those
   people in the front? - A. Yes, and they are looking down.
Q. Obviously the only means, as you couldn't do anything
   from your position, and you couldn't really understand
   why they were saying it because you couldn t see the
   people in front, obviously the only way for them was to
   go forward? - A. That's right.

        THE CORONER:   When you say "obviously", do you mean
   the Police Officers had to go forward?

        MRS. MCBRIEN:   No, sir.   This gentleman wasn't
   aware of the intense pressure at the front where he was
   standing...

        THE CORONER:   I don't think you can make him draw a
   conclusion as to which way it was obvious to go because
   he could just as obviously have stood still, moved
   sideways, gone backwards, gone forwards, gone up.   I
   don't think you can ask him that question.

        MRS. MCBRIEN:   It wasn't for him, what he was to
   do.   As long as he stood still it would help, I suppose,
   but the people at the back, the only escape route for
   them surely on a slope would be forward.

        THE CORONER:    No, I am not going to allow that,
   Mrs. McBrien

        MRS. MCBRIEN:   All right.

        THE CORONER:   Mr. Seddon, I am exceedingly grateful
   to you for coming and for giving your evidence very
                                                                38

                                                       G. I. SEDDON


       clearly if I may say so.   Ladies and gentlemen, despite
       the pressure of time we will still stop for coffee.

                          (Short adjournment)

You got to Leppings Lane*   What time would you put it
that you got to Leppings Lane? - A. Approximately 2.35.

We have already heard there was a substantial number of
people there.    Did you see a couple of mounted Officers?
- A . There were a number of mounted Officers in the dip
in Leppings Lane by the double metal gates.    There was
also a Police Land Rover by the sweet shop which I think
is just to the left of the gates.

Was the Land Rover already there when you arrived? - A.
Yes, it was.

Did you hear any announcements coming from it? - A. No, I
heard no announcements at all.

You didn't hear any tannoys? - A. No, I didn't.

You definitely saw this Land Rover? - A. Yes.

You are sure it was there when you arrived? - A. I
believe so.

The reason why I ask you is because we know what time
that Land Rover arrived, or we think we know what time it
arrived, and that helps us with your timings because I
don t suppose you were looking at your watchwere you? -
A. No, I wasn't.

Is it right there were a couple of horses across the
perimeter gates? - A. There were two Police horses by the
perimeter gates; one in the centre as you go down the
dip and one nearer the gates.

Did you see any other Police horses apart from those two?
-A. I can t remember if I saw any further Police horses.

The gates were open or shut? - A. The gates were closed.

Were there a substantial number of people on this side of
the gates? - A. There were a great deal of people on the
road side of the gates.

Were you able to look in towards the turnstile area? - A.
Yes, as we came down the hill and if you look at Leppings
Lane it obviously goes down towards the gate.    Whenyou
approach Leppings Lane you can look across.

What did it look like in through there? - A. There were a
few Police Officers down the side going around the canal,
down the side of the ground.   I think there were a
couple of Police Officers outside by the turnstiles.   I
can t remember if anyone was actually going in through
the turnstiles.   The area itself was fairly deserted.
                                                                  40
                                                         T. S. PITT

    Q.    Deserted you say? - A. On the other side of the gate,
         yes.    There weren't many people there.

    Q. You are quite sure about that? - A. Yes, there wasn't
       that many people on the other side of the gate.
B
    Q. Including the area directly leading to the turnstiles?
       If you look at the model you can see.   Show the
       perimeter gates A to G, and then go towards the
       turnstiles area and you can see there is that metal bar.
       Can you see that? - A. Yes, I can.

    Q.   Then there is in fact theroadway between that metal
         bar... - A. The gates and the fence, yes.

    Q. What I am trying to find out is when you say it was
       fairly deserted, are you talking about the roadway area
       or are you talking about the whole of that area? - A. I
       am talking about basically the whole of the area.   There
       were some people around the turnstiles but there weren't
       that many.   Most of them had been held back by the
       Police on the outer gate.
D   Q. You are saying the bulk of the people were on the
       outside? - A. Yes.

    Q. As far as you can recollect? - A. Yes.

    Q. Tell me this: you then approached this... - A. Yes, we
       approached the outer gate.    We went down into the dip.
       There were a large number of people and there was a crowd
       building up.    I remember a comment from Mark who had
       actually attended the game the year before and he said to
       me, "It wasn't this bad last year."    At the time there
       seemed to be no control.    The Police Land Rover, I
       believe there was a Policeman stood next to it talking to
       someone inside.    The two Police Officers who were
       mounted were having a difficult time controlling people.
       There was no-one to direct or control the people as they
       arrived at Leppings Lane.

    Q. The only Officers you saw were those two Police Officers
       and the Land Rover? - A. The only Police Officers I saw
       were the two mounted Police Officers.

    Q. You saw no foot Officers of any sort? - A. Only the
       people round the Land Rover.

    Q. What happened then? - A. Myself, Mark and Graham went
       down towards the gate and joined the rear of the crowd.
       Within a couple of minutes the crowd behind us had almost
       doubled.   The two mounted Police Officers at that time
       were having difficulty in controlling the crowd.   They
       were both surrounded by the crowd who were not being




H
                                                 T. S. PITT


directed anywhere.   They couldn't go any further than
the metal gates and they couldn't go backwards because of
the amount of people arriving behind.

The area immediately behind them was, of course, a road?
It was Leppings Lane itself, is that right? - A. No, it
wasn t.   I am talking about the actual dip going down on
to the concourse just by the gates.

Sergeant Griffiths, could you point to that light
coloured area. - A. This is Leppings Lane.   Just here,
although it doesn't show on the map, there is a slight
incline. As you go down towards those gates there is a
slight incline.   We were situated about the centre.
The crowd was building up back towards the road.

Immediately behind that, of course, is   the road? - A.
Yes, it is.

So what happened then? - A. We couldn't go anywhere.
The crowd kept building up.   There were a number of
teenagers and younger children who at this time were
becoming a bit worried.   Although the crushing wasn't
excessive, the people behind were beginning to push
forward.   There was nowhere to go for the people in
front.   There were a number of young teenagers and
younger people actually trying to climb over the fence
and the gate at the side.   A number of adults were
helping to push the teenagers and the younger children up
on to the fence.   Although we were in the centre, I
believe the crushing at the front at this gate was a bit
more excessive than it was either in the middle or
towards the rear.

When you say people were climbing, are you saying they
W6*e          over these park gates, the perimeter gates?
- A. There were a number of people climbing on the gates
and there were a number of people climbing up on to the
left to try and get above and out of the way of the
crowd.

This went on, presumably, for a little while? - A. This
went on approximately maybe ten minutes.

What happened after that? - A. I remember speaking to the
Police Officer on the horse.    I believe he had number 24
on his helmet.   I said, "Is there anything you can do?"
He shouted there was nothing he could actually do.
There was no way these two Police Officers at that stage
could control any of the crowd.    They were completely
helpless.   The only thing those Police Officers could do
was to keep their horses still at that stage.    I did see
a number of people actually go under the horses' legs.
Or I believe, I should say, that they went under the
                                               T. S. PITT


horses legs to actually escape the crush because under
the horses legs there was more space than there was
actually outside on the ground*

How was the situation relieved outside there in the end?
- A. Eventually the gates opened.   I don't know whether
it was because of the force of the crowd or on the orders
of the Police Officer that the outer gates were opened.
The crowd surged forward, obviously because of the weight
of the people behind, and made their way towards the
turnstiles.

When the crowd surged forward are you saying that the
turnstile area was in fact clear?.  I don't mean totally
deserted but relatively clear? - A. I believe that the
area around the turnstiles was not congested.




          Q. We will show you a
                                             T. S. PITT

We will show you a photograph in a moment and perhaps
you can help us on that in a moment, but let's move on.
You were carried in or walked in, or how did you get
through these perimeter gates? - A. We actually walked
through, obviously at a quick pace because of the crowd
behind us.

Did you aim for the turnstile area? - A. Yes, we aimed
for tae turnstile.  I remember taking the ticket out of
my top pocket and heading for the turnstile. That was
about the third on the left, and we headed towards that
turnstile. When we eventually stopped I was about five
yards, maybe six yards from the. turnstiles.

Were you being crushed at that point? - A. Not at that
stage. Obviously with the gates being open there was a
certain amount of relief and people went towards the
turnstiles. - A. So in other words you found it easier
once you got in - when you say tne gates open, you mean
the perimeter gates? - A. The perimeter gates, yes.

You found it easier in the turnstile area? - A.
Initially.

Just go on describing what you yourself experienced? -
A. Having got through the open gates I thought it was
only a matter of time before we eventually filtered
through the turnstiles and in the ground.
Unfortunately, for some reason which I can't explain,
people did not seem to be going through the turnstiles.
There seemed to be a blockage.  I believe there were a
couple of Police Officers at the turnstiles, I can't
say how many, and people weren't going through.  At
that stage the crowd was building up behind, the crush
was becoming more severe, and I think at that stage
people at the front by the turnstiles, who were being
pressed against the walls and the turnstiles, were
beginning to panic and beginning to get worried.

I don't want you to guess if you don't know, but did
you look at your watch by any chance at that tine? - A.
No, I didn't.  I didn't know what time it was.

So you have got no idea of time intervals or how long?
- A. On an approximation, we arrived at approximately
2.35, we were outside for approximately ten minutes,
outside the outer gate, we moved forward within a
couple of minutes, maybe 2.50, approximately.

At that point you say there was a crush within this
turnstile area? - A. Yes.

How did you yourself get in? - A. Eventually, after
helping a couple of people, I actually helped to young
                                                            44

                                                  T. S. PITT

     lads to actually climb on the wall and they actually
     stood on people's shoulders to get out of the crush, at
     that stage the1 crush was becoming severe, a concertina
     gate to my left was opened and tne crowd, whether they
     wanted to go through or not I think they were forced
     through by the weight of the crowd behind them.

Q.   Did you go through with that crowd? - A. Yes, I did.

Q.    Did you go througn with your friend? - A. We were
     separated slightly, I would say, a couple of yards
     between each of us within the crowd, but we eventually
     met up once we got through the concertina gate.

Q. Let's just make sure - having got through the gate how
   did you enter the terracing, just describe that? - A.
   As we entered through the concertina gate there was a
   small Portacabin on the right hand side, which was
   selling programmes. Hark said to us, "Stop, I'll get a
   programme". We said, "No, we'll go through, we'll go
   into the ground". Mark and Graham had both been to
   Sheffield before, I hadn't, the year before - I was
   working.  I basically followed Mark and Graham because
   I did not have a knowledge of the ground. We went
   through an opening in the wall and in front of us was a
   tunnel.  I and Graham both went to the toilet, Mark
   waited for us. We then eventually made our way down
   the tunnel.

Q. Just make quite sure that we have got the right
   perimeter gates and the right gate that you entered
   through.  (The Witness illustrated his evidence
   using the model) - A. We went through that turnstile
   there, that concertina gate there was open, and we went
   through, there was a small Portacabin there and we went
   through the opening towards the tunnel.

Q. You have indicated Gate B and then an entry through the
   opening in the dividing wall and the concourse. One
   other question on the perimeter gates. The perimeter
   gates are actually in three sections, they are three
   double gates, which you may not know? - A. No, I
   didn t.

Q. Did you enter the ground through the left hand one, the
   one nearest the wall, or the one nearest the River Don,
   or were you more or less in the middle, can you
   remember? - A. Can you explain? I am not too sure what
   you mean.

Q. Yes. Look at C258. If you look at that you can see
   there are three sets of perimeter gates, you can see
   the wall and you can see the turnstiles in the
   distance, right? - A. Yes.
                                              T. S. PITT

Which one of these three sets did you go through, if
you can remember? - A. I went through the concertina
gate, just to the right, where it says "Visitors Only".

No, I didn't mean the concertina gate, I meant the park
gates. Wnich of these park gates did you go through? -
A. I apologise - the centre ones.

Those were shut when you were waiting to get in, so to
speak? - A. Yes, they were.

You have taken us up to the tunnel. Did you look down
the tunnel before you set off?   A. Not originally, no.
We went to the toilet and then as we came out we made
our way down the tunnel.

Could you see what was going on on the pitch, that is
what(I am interested in? - A. Not at the time, no.  I
didn't actually look towards the end of the tunnel, we
just walked down towards the end of the tunnel.

Was the access down that tunnel reasonably clear? - A.
The access at that time was reasonably clear. There
were a number of people actually in the tunnel.  It was
not until we approached the end of the tunnel that it
started to be congested.

How deep into the tunnel was the congestion? - A. tlaybe
five yards.

So it was right into the tunnel? - A. Yes. Obviously
as people were going in people were stopping, deciding
whether to go left or right into the pens, obviously
this caused some congestion as people were making up
their minds whether to go in.Obviously I   didn't know
at that time, but the actual pens were crowded as well.

Yes. Did you see anybody come out? - A. Yes, I did.
There was a gentleman, about 30, and he was carrying a
young boy. The boy was obviously distressed and crying
and he came out and said to me, ’’It's absolute murder
in there".  He went back out of the tunnel.

This was when you were still at the back of the group
in the tunnel? - A. Yes, it was.

How did you then make progress to get into the terrace?
“ A. People made their way in.   There was no pushing or
shoving at this stage.  People were either going left
or right into each of the pens. Obviously behind us
there were more people coming in at that stage. We
eventually decided to go right and we went into the pen
on the right. Obviously once you go into a ground,
football supporters try to get the best vantage point
                                               T. S. PITT

they can to watch the match.   As we arrived in the pen
the game was going on.

It was definitely in play, there is no question? - A.
Yes.   I asked a supporter who was stood there, I said,
 Has the match kicked off?", and his words were,
"Just".

How was it when you got into the pen at that point? -
A. When we actually went at the back there didn't seem
to be a great amount of crushing.  We eventually made
our way forward down towards the goal and down towards
the right hand side of tne pen..

What was the position like as far as you were
concerned? - A. Initially when we first got in the pen
there didn't seem to be any problems.  Having situated
ourselves in the pen and then started to watch the
game, within a couple of minutes, in fact, less -
within a minute or so - the crushing seemed, or if I
can describe it, the pressure of the crowd became
gradually worse.

You were still watching the game,   I take it, at this
point? - A. Yes.

Did you see Beardsley hit the crossbar? - A. No, I
didn t.  The only thing I remember, obviously with the
movement of the crowd you obviously try to get tne best
vantage point, with people moving in front of you
sometimes you miss some of the match and it was tnis
stage that we missed.

At what point did you realise that something was
terribly wrong? - A. Once we had arrived in the pen,
once we had arrived in about the centre of the pen,
having looked towards the front, there was a Policeman
actually on the fence shouting at the Liverpool
supporters.  I could not hear what he was saying.
There were a number of fans climbing up the fence and
trying to get over the top.  Having looked down, there
is a gate, I believe, in the centre of that fencing,
which is an access gate onto the pitch or out towards
the pitch, that was actually open at that stage.   I
believe there was a Policewoman, WPC, and a Policeman
taking a couple of people out of that gate.  At that
stage I had not realised what was going on.

You have described what you saw but it had not impinged
that there was a terribly serious crush? - A. I must
say at this stage the Beardsley shot had not hit the
°air* .This was before this incident people were
climbing over the fence and this gate was open.  Peter
                                                             47

                                                    T. S. PITT


       Beardsley's shot hit the bar - again we didn't find out
       until later what had happened.

    Q. How did you know?  That is what I am interested in
B      because you said you didn't see it, so how did you
       know.  You are now recounting something in relation to
       it and you may be right, but I want to know on what
       basis you are saying that? - A. If I can explain, you
       know something has happened, you don't know what but
       you know something has happened with the movement of
       the crowd.  I say it was Beardsley hitting the bar
       because I now know that is what caused the push, but at
       the time I didn't.  The crowd surged forward, we went
       forward down the steps.  I was then separated from hark
       and Graham, I then lost them until I actually found
       them again outside the ground.   I was pushed down
       towards the right and I lost Mark and Graham.   If you
       have ever been in a football crowd, when you are pushed
       forward people obviously regain themselves, push back
       and stand up.  When the crowd went forward, pushed
       forward, they didn't come back.   No one regained
       themselves, no one stood up.   I tried to keep my feet
D      and I stumbled, although I didn't fall, but no one came
       back.  That is when I realised that there was something
       wrong.  Having been in football crowds for many years I
       am very used to the sway of football crowds.   The crowd
       went forward, no one came back.

    Q. That was the distinguishing feature? - A. That was the
       feature that something suddenly clicked and I realised
       that there was something wrong.

    Q. You associated the crowd movement with what you now
       believe to be tne Beardsley shot? - A. Yes.

    Q. You yourself fortunately were not actually hurt,   I mean
       physically hurt? - A. No, I wasn't.

    Q. I think you did actually manage to move towards the
       back, didn't you? - A. Eventually.  I remember
       confirmation of my fear that there was something wrong
       was there was a fan on the floor, and both myself and
       another fan pulled him forward.  He actually came out
       with no shirt on, no pants on, and no shoes on and it
       was then it began to sink in that he obviously was
       greatly distressed.  We pulled him up, and then people
       started screaming, people started at the front to climb
       over the fences.  Having looked around and turned
       around and looked back, people were actually being
       passed up to the West Stand at the back.   I could hear
       people shouting from the West Stand, fans that were in
       the West Stand were shouting, although at that time I
       could not make out what they were shouting.

    Q. I think you helped somebody up into the stand yourself
       at some point? - A. Eventually I pushed myself back
       towards the back.

B   Q. Had the match finished by then, as far as you know? -
       A. I remember when the crowd had gone forward, I
       remember there was something wrong, the game at that
       stage was still going on.  I believe it was looking
       onto the pitch and looking around at that stage, I
       think it was an Inspector ran on to speak to Mr. Lewis,
       the referee.  He ran onto tne pitch.  In fact,
       Nottingham Forest had gained a corner on the left hand
       side and I remember Mr. Lewis come running up, the
       referee, and the Inspector ran onto the pitch, grabbed
       hold of Mr. Lewis, told him there was something wrong,
       he abandoned the game and the players then were
       eventually walking off the pitch.

    Q. It was after that, Mr. Pitt, that you managed to get
       back? - A. Within a minute, within a couple of
       minutes, I pushed myself towards the back of the
D      crowd.

    Q. I know that you made considerable personal efforts to
       help people, did you not? - A. Yes, I did.

    Q. You got various people out and, in fact, one or two
       whom you tried to resuscitate you managed to
       identify, did you not? - A. Yes.

    Q. Most of these people were in the concourse area or in
       the tunnel whom you assisted, is that right? The
       ones who died I mean? - A. Yes, the ones who died
       were originally being brought out of the tunnel. At
       that stage obviously I did not know they were dead,
       they were just being carried out of the tunnel.

    Q. You were just doing your very best which I am sure
       you were? - A. Fine.

    Q. I know one was David Benson and the other one was
       Peter Reuben Thompson. The third one I just cannot
       recollect the name. Do you remember? - A. No, I do
       not I am afraid, no.

    Q. I will check it. We will do the plan and get you to
       show us your positions. Show us the position you
       took up in the first instance when the match was in
       play but you yourself were reasonably content, I
       think it would be fair to say? - A. Approximately
       around that area.

    Q. When Beardsley hit the crossbar, do not mark it but
       just show me. Did you stay there or did you move
       forward? - A. No, I was eventually pushed forward
       down I believe it was through a gap in the barrier
       though I cannot be certain.  I actually went forward
       down towards the front of the terracing.

    Q. You would time that at around the time when Beardsley
       hit the crossbar? - A. Around that time
       approximately.

    Q. Do you know where that was? Can you put a mark on it
       where you finished up? - A. Yes.

        MR. BEECHEY:   C.446, sir.

           THE CORONER:   Can you put up C.294 and can
      someone who is not colour blind see if they can read
      the time on it but do not tell me yet?

Q. The third person was Kester Ball. Does that ring a
   bell with you? - A. No, I am sorry, it does not.

Q.    I am sorry, it was C. 274. Can you see that picture
     I have put up? - A. Yes, I can.

Q.    Tell me whether you remember scenes like that outside
     the turnstile area? - A. No, I do not.   It did not
     seem that crowded when I looked round.

Q. Did it seem that crowded when you were within the
   turnstile area before the gate opened? - A. It was a
   lot more crowded.

Q. It was more crowded.       Can somebody read me the timing
   on that?

        MR. GRIFFITHS:     1454, sir.

       THE CORONER:      That is six minutes to.

     MR. KING:   Sir, the corrected time for that
photograph is, in fact, 1453.

Q.       THE CORONER:    That photograph was taken at 1453
     but you do not remember a scene like that at that
     time? - A. Obviously I am looking at it now from a
     different angle. I was actually in the crowd and so I
     would not be able to comment on whether that is what
     the crowd looked like. I was actually in the crowd.

Q. Your impression was that it was worse than that when
   you were in that crowd? - A. Yes, it seemed so.

     THE CORONER:    Mr. Catchpole, what is your photograph?
What number is that?

      M R . CATCHPOLE:   C .305, sir.

Q.       THE CORONER:      Have a look at C.305, would you?

     MR. KING:   Sir, I am sorry to interrupt.  I am not
being rude but I lost track of how this photograph was
being put to the witness.  Is it that he is on it, sir?

     THE CORONER:   No, he is not.  I was merely trying to
find out. He says that when he got there the turnstile
area was more or less deserted and all I am trying to find
out is whether he can remember the turnstile area in
relation to what it looks like.

     MR. KING:   Sir, all I point out, using this
particular photograph, the one we have just seen, C.294,
that is the photograph with Gate C being opened and people
going through it.

     THE CORONER:   In other words, his evidence was that
it was even worse when he was there and so that would be
consonant with what you are saying.  In other words, the
pressure was already being relieved at that point.

     MR. KING:   He gave evidence he went through Gate B,
sir. This is the famous photograph - I say famous - where
on the original large size we did not have the whole
photograph of and we can see this, is a minute after Gate C
is opened when people are going through. All I am saying,
sir, is that we could find ourselves in a lot of confusion
given his evidence that he went through Gate B and it was
Gate B that relieved the pressure he was in. This is a
picture of Gate C relieving the pressure on this
photograph.

       THE CORONER:    You are right, I agree, yes.

Q. Have a look at C.305. You can actually see Gate B on
   that one. That is the big gate which you went
   through. Can you see it in the background? - A. Yes,
   I can.

Q. You say you arrived at about 2.35 when you got to
   the... - A. Leppings Lane outer entrance, yes.

Q. Did the scene that you saw look anything like this? -
   A. No, the outer gates were closed.  I believe the
   outer gates were closed. The inside of that area by
   the turnstiles to me did not look congested.

Q. Did not look congested? - A. Until the outer gates
   were opened and then obviously the crowd were allowed
   through towards the turnstiles.

     THE CORONER:    Mr. King, what is the corrected time
for this one please?

      MR. CATCHPOLE:     It is 1430, sir.

Q.        THE CORONER:   You would be surprised if we tell
     you that this photograph was taken at half past
     two? - A. Yes, I would.

     MR. KING:   I am not trying to steal anybody's thunder
but he mentioned seeing the Land Rover.

     THE CORONER:   That is right.  It was 2.45 or
thereabouts, perhaps 2.44, and that was quite a bit later.
That is why I was trying to straddle the two.
     MR. KING:   To be fair to the witness, and I do not
think anybody is trying to trap him, sir, he is just maybe
wrong on the times.  It is as simple as that.

     THE CORONER:   This is the bit that puzzles me because
if he is right that the inner area was clear he ought to
have been there very much earlier but if he is right the
outer area was as congested as he says then he ought to
have been there somewhat later and particularly if he was
there when the Land Rover was there.  It is difficult to
reconcile.

         MR. KING:      We also know, sir, when Gate B was opened.

         THE CORONER:      Indeed we know that 2.58 I think it
wa s .

         MR. KING:      It is all very confusing.

Q*        THE CORONER:   Mr. Pitt, Mr. King is quite
     right. We are not trying to catch you out and I am
     certainly not trying to catch you out. What we are
     trying to do is reconcile your recollection with what
     other people have told us and also what we have seen
     on photographs and what we have been told with regard
     to the openings. That is why I was pressing you
     about the Land Rover. We know approximately what
     time that came there.  It was after 2.44, 2.45,
     something like that. You were pretty sure it was
     there when you arrived? - A. I remember seeing the
     Land Rover and I am pretty sure it was there when we
     arrived. Although I cannot be 100 per cent certain I
     am sure it was.

Q. Your recollection still is that the turnstile area
   itself was relatively clear? - A. When I looked down
   towards the side and the turnstile area, to me, the
   area looked fairly clear.

                     Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:

Q. May it be, Mr. Pitt, that your assessment of the
   situation between the perimeter gate and the
   turnstile is inaccurate? - A. You may be right, yes.

Q. In your own mind you are quite clear about what you
   remember but that obviously has repercussions and has
   consequences for the reliability and accuracy of the
   other evidence you have given.  If you are wrong
   about that you may be wrong about any number of other
   things? - A. I can only give the evidence I thought I
   saw at the time.

               Cross-Examined bv MR. MANNING:

Q. You were with Mr. Seddon? - A. Yes.

Q. When the time came that you got to the terrace, the
   three of you - and I use the word "push" not in a
   derogatory sense - had to get through the people who
   were standing either preferably or because they had
   not made up their minds right at the back of that
   terraced crowd? - A. No, I didn't say that.

Q. Mr. Seddon told us that. Did you hear Mr. Seddon
   give his evidence? - A. Yes, I did.

Q. He had to push through the people who were right at
   the back until you could gain a position and he
   described the three of you taking up a position
   together on the terrace? - A. Yes, I heard his
   evidence.

Q. Would you like to describe how you gained that
   position by Mr. Seddon on the terrace? - A. On
   approaching the end of the tunnel, the tunnel was
   crowded. As I said before there were people moving
   to the left and right deciding on which pen they were
   going to go into. Once people had made up their mind
   we started to move through. Obviously if you have
   ever been in a football crowd it is impossible to
   move through without touching people. You have to
   either move, slightly jostle and move through.  I
   would not go so far as to say we were pushing. We
   weren't. We were actually just moving and jostling
   for position.

Q. That is very helpful indeed. A small amount of
   inevitable physical contact but no need for you to
   have to even go so far as to push through, let alone
   force your way through? - A. At that time, no.

Q. You agree the three of you then were together on the
   terrace? - A. Together loosely.  I mean, if you have
   ever been to a football match, again if you have ever
   been with friends you are with a number of yards of
   each other.

Q. Do you agree with his words when he said it was
   certainly not chocker? - A. No, I do not agree with
   those words.  It was certainly close. Mr. Seddon is
   a rather large man and bigger than I am and would not
   feel the amount of pushing that I feel. Mr. Seddon,
   as I say, is a big fellow. He can look after
   himself. Obviously smaller people of a smaller
   stature would find it more difficult than Mr. Seddon
   would.

                                                  T. S. PITT



Q. If nothing had changed from that moment when you
   gained your position, if I may put it that way, on
   the terrace, would you have felt perfectly
   comfortable to have watched the match from there? -
   A. No.

Q. Why would you not have been comfortable there? - A.
   Because there were still a number of people coming in
   behind.

Q. That is a different matter. That is not what I asked
   you. What I said to you was at that moment in time
   when you had gained your position, not what happened
   afterwards, I appreciate lots and lots of dreadful
   things happened afterwards, but at the time the three
   of you got into the crowd and got on to the terrace,
   is it not fair to say that at that time you would
   have been prepared to watch the match from there? -
   A. Not necessarily, no. Although Mr. Seddon did say
   he thought he had plenty of room I felt I didn't.




                   /Q. So we have got a difference.

                                                 T. S. PITT


Q.   So we have got a difference of perception between you
     and Mr. Seddon as to you not feeling you had plenty of
     room and him obviously feeling that he was
     comfortable. Would you associate yourself with his
     words, when he was asked by my learned friend Mr. King
     to describe how the crowd was standing, that he felt
     it was like a mid-table game? - A. No.

Q.   So although two people standing pretty close to each
     other, having gone into a match together, come if you
     like consecutively to give evidence, what you are
     saying is quite at variance with what Mr. Seddon was
     saying? - A. I can only say what my evidence is and
     what happened at the match.  I cannot speak for Mr.
     Seddon.

Q.   You have the advantage. He did not know what you were
     going to say, but you have heard what he has said and
     what you are saying has some differences between what
     he has said and what you have said, does it not? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   Different perceptions, two different people, two
     different ideas? - A. Yes.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Q.   Mr. Pitt, you are an important witness because we may
     not be talking about difference of perceptions.  It
     may be just a difference of what we mean by labels.
     You probably heard me trying to ask Mr. Seddon some
     facts, not the label he was putting on the facts, such
     as 'easy', 'comfortable', but what the facts were, and
     what I want to deal with with you is what it factually
     was like on the pen when you entered. You told us
     that factually when you first went to the back, my
     note was, "There was not a great amount of crushing".
     That was the expression I wrote down. - A. Yes.

Q.   Not a great amount of crushing carries with it the
     inference, the meaning, that there was a certain
     amount of crushing, is that right? - A. I did say
     that, yes.

Q.   Do you mean by that, therefore, there was a certain
     amount of crushing when you first entered? - A. It
     would be hard to describe it as crushing. Again I can
     only go back to say if you have ever been in a
     football crowd, and you have ever been close in a
     football crowd, there was a certain amount of
     pressure.

Q.   It certainly was not an easy crowd in that sense then?
     - A. No, it wasn't.
                                            T. S. PITT


You described how within a minute the pressure of the
crowd became worse? - A. Yes.

You are with Mr. Seddon, the same time? - A. Yes.

This is the time he has described as the 'mid' that he
gave. You also described how you were conscious of a
Policeman on the front shouting to the Liverpool
supporters, but you could not hear what he was saying?
- A. No, I couldn't.

What was it like around you at the time when you could
see the Policeman but could not hear what he was
saying? - A. Although I have said that there was no
actual crush, I felt the pressure on me through the
crowd.

Was it this time that the pressure was getting worse
and worse? - A. That would be hard to describe.  I
would not say worse and worse;  I just felt a constant
pressure on me all the time.

So clearly at that time if you had constant pressure
you were not in a position where there was bags of
room around you? - A. Personally I wasn't in a
position where there was a great deal of room.

Because you are talking about pressure, and pressure
means bodily contact, does it not? - A. Yes.

It looks as if you entered the terrace after the gate
at the front was already open.  I say that because we
have got photographs which show it already open before
or just about kick-off. You were not conscious of
that, I understand? - A. Can you repeat that, I am
sorry?

Yes. Did you realise as soon as you entered the pen
that people were being carried out at the front of the
pen? - A. No, I didn't, no.

But it looks, and if necessary I can show you C326A,
that at 14.59 there were pen gates open. Have a
little look if you like. Do you see 326A there? - A.
Yes, I see.

That is literally either just before or just at kick-
off. It is 14.59. This looks as if it was before you
entered the ground even, the pen? - A. That is very
possible.

It looks, therefore, that you entered the tunnel and
entered the pen when this was already going on at the
                                                             57

         front, that is what appears to be the case? - A.
         Possibly.
B        Tell me, when you went to the tunnel to enter the
         tunnel, how did you enter it? Did you run through the
         tunnel or walk through the tunnel? - A. No, we walked
         through the tunnel.

         At the entrance to the tunnel, at a time when it
         appears that things were already happening at the
         front unknown to you in the pen, was there anybody at
         the front of the tunnel directing you, stopping you
         going in? - A. No, there wasn't.

         Do I take it from your walk that you would have been
         prepared to be directed elsewhere if you had been
         asked so to do? - A. I am a football supporter.   I am
         used to being directed.  I will go anywhere I am told.

                  Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

         You said you got there at 25-to 3 or thereabouts? - A.
         Yes, I said approximately 25-to 3.

    Q.   But you said you went in Gate B? - A. Yes.

    Q.   We have been told that that opened at 2.58? - A. That
         is right.  I also said I was outside for 10 minutes
         before they opened the outer gate.

         Were you very crushed at the turnstiles? - A. Once we
         went forward to the turnstile I did say there was some
         respite from the pushing against the outer gates. We
         then went forward to the turnstiles.  I took my ticket
         out ready to go through. Unfortunately, for some
         reason, there wasn't any movement through the
         turnstiles, and with the outer gates, people were
         still moving down towards the turnstiles, the crushing
         then started. The people against the wall and against
         the turnstiles were being pressed against the
         turnstiles and obviously people were then being
         crushed and under pressure.

         So you were in that area between 25-to and 2.58, so
         did this crowd suddenly move earlier than you went
         through a gate, because we do know that Gate C opened
         at 2.52, so all those crowds there where you were,
         surely would you not have seen them moving to Gate C
         at an earlier stage? - A. I have no idea. The only
         thing I know is that we went through the gate and went
         to the turnstile. There was a certain amount of
         pressure.  There were people actually climbing on top
         of the turnstiles trying to escape, mainly young
         people, and then the concertina gate on the left


H
                                              T. S. PITT


opened up. I now know that to be Gate B, and the
crowd was actually moved through and went through Gate
B•

We have been told now that Gate B opened after Gate C
opened, so when the people were climbing over the
turnstiles a gate had already been opened to the
right? - A. I find that depends on how many people
were there anyway. Obviously there was a great amount
of people there and some would have gone through Gate
C and some would have still been in the Gate B area at .
the turnstiles.

We have been told that thousands went through Gate C
at 2.52.

     THE CORONER: What are you trying to establish,
Mrs. McBrien?

     MRS. McBRIEN:  I am wondering why you, Mr. Pitt,
did not move with the crowd when the people were going
towards Gate C? - A. I cannot give any explanation.
When the outer gates opened we moved down towards the
concertina gate, Gate B, which the turnstiles are next
to, and we waited there for the turnstiles to open and
go on.

So you did not move away when most of the crowds moved
to another spot, you just stayed in that area? - A.
You have obviously never been in a football crowd.
Most of the time you can't move. If you are waiting
for a turnstile, you stay there. There was no room to
move. There was no room to go anywhere.

I appreciate that, but when Gate C opened we do know
that people did move from that particular area. - A. I
am sure you do, but I can't comment on Gate C. I was
next to the concertina gate, Gate B. Idon't know
whether people went round to Gate C and I can't
explain what happened of the events before that.

When you were going down the   tunnel you saw a man
carrying a boy out? - A. Yes   I did.

I believe the words you used were that he said it was
murder down there? - A. Yes, he did.

Was it fairly easy for him to take the boy out back
through the tunnel at that time? - A. Not at that
time. He obviously had to push his way out. There
were more people going into the tunnel and he was the
only one at that stage coming out, and obviously the
amount of people going in, he had to jostle and push
                                             T. S. PITT


his way through to get himself and - obviously I took
it to be his young son - his young son out.

But he certainly said to you that it was murder down
there? - A. He did say to me, "It's murder down
there". His young son was distressed, his young son
was crying. He didn't seem too distressed. He just
pushed his way through and made his way out of the
tunnel.

And nobody turned to go back the way he was going? r
A. No. People continued to go in.

The fan that was on the floor, was he injured, the one
who was near you in the pen? - A. I would say he was
in a state of shock, yes.  I couldn't see any physical
injury.

He certainly did not die then? - A. I could not say.
I don't think he did. He was just in a state of
shock. He had no shirt, no trousers on, no shoes.
Myself and another fan pulled him up. He didn't know
where he was. He just seemed to be in a complete
state of shock. Someone pulled him up, and again with
the movement of the crowd I don't know where he went.
I don't know whether he was taken out of the back or
he was taken down the front. I just don't know where
that fan went to.

            Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. Pitt, you have described a Police Officer standing
on the fence shouting, but you told us you could not
hear what he was shouting? - A. That is right.

The same Police Officer was described by Mr. Seddon
and identified on one of the photographs, and I wonder
if you could have a look at the photograph and see if
we are talking about the same Police Officer. - A.
Give me the number, please.

Yes, 328.

     THE CORONER: Sergeant Griffiths, help the Jury.
Can you just point out the Officer with your big stick
because it is a long way to see.

     MR. RUSSELL: Behind the goal, standing on the
fence, just to the right of an open gate to Pen 3,
there is a man dressed in black who is a Police
Officer, do you see him? - A. Yes, I do.

He appears to be gesticulating to the crowd, do you
see that? - A. Yes.
                                                                60

                                                      T. S. PITT


    Q.   Is that in accordance with your recollection of what
         he was doing? - A. Yes.
B
    Q.   What gesticulation did he appear to you to be making?
         - A. I must admit at the time when I looked at the
         Policeman he was asking the crowd, or he seemed to be
         asking them, to move back. The Policeman himself, I
         remember him standing on the fence, looked rather
         concerned and was actually gesturing with his arms for
         people to actually go back, push back.

                      Further by THE CORONER:

    Q.   Mr. Pitt, I just want to ask you one other question
         about the density around you because you gave a
         statement and you made a comment about what it was
         like in your first match viewing position and I will
         just let you look at it because it is this bit which I
         happen to have marked in yellow.  I overlooked it.
         Having marked it, I still overlooked it. (Handed to
D        the witness) Do you recollect that? - A. Yes, I do.

    Q.   Do you want to just read us that paragraph because it
         is an interesting paragraph? Just that little bit
         from, "At the time of taking up .... A. Yes.

              "At the time of taking up my first match viewing
              point No.l, as indicated on the grid, there was
              no excessive crowd crush evident. Mark even had
              room to get a paper out. I saw other people
              round me reading too, although on looking down at
              the front of the pen I saw that people had
              started to climb up the front fencing."

    Q.   Would you agree that that is, in fact, right, that
         Mark was actually able to read? - A. When I say
         reading a paper, I mean actually reading the
         programme, the paper.

    Q.   And other people were doing it as well around? You
         did not mean a newspaper, you meant the programme? -
         A. I mean that people were actually looking at
         programmes, yes.

                                                       T. S. PITT

    Q. I see, yes,   You didn't do it yourself? - A. No, I
       didn't.

    Q. Because you didn't have a programme? - A, No.
B   Q. Was that the programme Mark had bought? - A. No, Mark
       didn't actually buy a programme.   I think he borrowed
       one from somebody next to him to look at the back of they
       programme to see the teams.

            THE CORONER:    Does anybody want to ask anything
       arising out of that?

            Thank you very much indeed. - I am most grateful to
       you, Mr. Pitt.   The fact your evidence isn't identical
       to Mark doesn't matter because all we are interested in
       is your evidence and it is one of the fascinations of
       these Inquests that we can have people giving different
       accounts of the same events.   That makes it interesting
       and complicated as well.

            I do want Mr. Seddon back because I want to ask him
       one more question.

                     GRAHAM IAN SEDDON Recalled

                      Further by THE CORONER:

    Q. You are still on oath.   I want to ask you about the Land
       Rover.   Do you remember that Land Rover? - A. No, I
       don't.

    Q. You don't remember seeing it? - A. No.

    Q. I take it from that you didn't hear any public address
       announcements of any sort? - A. No, I didn't hear any
       addresses.

    Q. Either from the back or the front? - A. No.   Can I just
       say one thing?   The difference between me and Steve, at
       home games we don't stand together.   I stand in the
       middle of the Kop where it is more chocka and he stands
       at the sides where it is less.

    Q. In other words, you have a different perception? - A.
       Yes.   Where I like it a bit more chocka, he doesn't.

            THE CORONER:   Thank you.   Nobody is complaining
       about either of your evidence.

            Now Mr. Doyle.

               BRIAN JOSEPH DOYLE Sworn

                   By THE CORONER:

You are Brian Joseph Doyle? - A. Yes.

                            , Liverpool? - A. Yes.

I think you came to the match on the 15th of April, 1989
to watch the semi-final? - A. Yes.

You came by car with a   couple of friends? - A. Yes,
that's right.

Do you know what time you left? - A. Eleven o'clock.

What time did you arrive in Sheffield? - A. About twenty
past one.

What time did you get to the ground? - A. Twenty past
two.

What did you do with the time in between? - A. We went to
a pub and got a bottle of lager each and then went down
to the ground.

That is all you had? -   A. One bottle.

Then you made your way   to the ground? -A. Yes, that's
right.

Which way did you approach it?    Didyou have to turn
right into Leppings Lane, or did you come straight on to
it? - A. We came a hill and turned right.

Did you see Police Officers scattered about on your way
down? - A. The odd few, yes.

You weren't stopped on your way down? - A. No.

When you got to the ground, I think you said 2.20 or
thereabouts? - A. Yes.

What was it like? - A. It was just a mass of people.
There were no lines or anything.

Was this mass of people within...   Have you been to the
ground before? - A. Yes, I was there the year before.

Was this mass of people within the turnstile area or were
they spilling out on to the road? - A. No, it was just
towards the turnstiles.

So the road bit was still clear? - A. Yes.
                                                              63

                                                   B. J. DOYLE

Q. That means you managed to get through the perimeter gates
   without too much difficulty? - A. That's right.
Q. They were open, I assume? - A. Yes.

Q. I think you saw a couple of Police horses.  Were they
   within the area where the crowd was or were they outside?
   -A. There were two Police horses; one by the turnstiles.
   They were both within ten or twelve feet of each other.

Q. I'm sorry? - A. There were two mounted Police Officers,
   yes.

Q. What was your impression as to their activity? - A. Well,
   there was just no organisation at all going through to
   the turnstiles.

Q. Did you see the Police Officers, the mounted Officers, do
   anything? ^ Were they walking up and     down or   werethey
   just standing or... - A. No, the Police horses were stuck
   where they were but there was an Officer as well ramming
   his horse into us, like.

Q. I'm sorry, there was an Officer...? - A. Ramming his
   horse into the crowd.

Q. There were two Officers, plus a third one? - A. No, there
   were two Police Officers on horses.

Q. One was stationary? -A. Yes, and one was trying to move -
   push the crowd.

Q.   So he was making some attempt to do something with the
     crowd? - A. Well, I don't know what he was doing but he
     was like putting his horse into the crowd.

Q. Was he a Merseyside Officer, as far as you can remember?
   - A. I haven't got a clue.

Q. You don't know? - A. No.

Q. You didn't recognise him anyway? - A. No.     I remember
   his having a moustache.

Q. I think you attempted to queue?    In other words, you
   wanted to go to the turnstile following the person ahead
   of you? - A. Well, that was the main idea.    The year
   before they had them all in lines.    It was all spot on,
   like.

Q. As you have mentioned the year before, what time did you
   get there the year before? -A. Around the same time.
                                                              64

                                                      B. J. DOYLE


    Q. But you couldn't do it.   Why couldn't you do it? - A. It
       was just like a crowd from the turnstiles going that way.
       It was anything from sixteen going across.

    Q. Are you saying there were just too many people all aiming
B      for the same area? - A. There were too many people trying
       to get through a little turnstile.

    Q. Did you experience any pushing? - A. Yes.

    Q. Where was that coming from?   Back or front or the side?
       - A. Sideways and the back.

    Q. Did you eventually get through the turnstiles or not? -
       A. No.

    Q. How did you get in? -A. Well, we were waiting by the
       turnstiles.    There were two children who were trampled
       on.    They got passed up off the floor.   My brother
       picked them up.    One of the young lads had wet himself.
       My brother shouted at the Police Officer on the horse,
       "What's going on here?    Why don't you get those gates
       shut?"    There were still people coming through this...
D
    Q. Do you mean the perimeter gates? - A. Yes, that's right.
       The Police Officers picked those two lads up and took
       them through a gate.

    Q. So it was your brother who passed the lads to the Police
       Officer? - A. Yes, picked them up off the floor.   I save
       about five 14 or 15 years old kids who had been passed up
       from the turnstiles on top of the wall on top of the
       turnstiles, drop down.   I saw a Police Officer open a
       gate and pull them back out.   There was just no way of
       getting through the turnstiles anyway.

    Q. How did you get into the ground? -A. We waited...   Well,
       the turnstiles are here.   We went to the right of the
       turnstiles.

    Q. So you managed to get out of this crowd? - A. No, we side
       stepped it.   There was enough room.    There was room
       there by the railings and then the blue gate got opened.
       I got trapped as the gate got opened.    The Police
       Officer who opened the gate when more or less to say,
       "Come in."   I had my ticket ready.    At this time I got
       squashed against the gate with the fellows coming in,
       landed on the floor.    A Police Officer picked me up so I
       said to the Police Officer, "What's going on here", and
       all that - not so much in those words, there was a bit of
       swearing as well.    I had my ticket and he just said,
       "Get into the ground."




H
                                              B. J. DOYLE


You were knocked over, you said? - A. Yes, I was jammed.
I lost my footing.   As the gates opened that way, I was
jammed against the gate and my foot...   There was a
Police Officer there and there were people nudging into
me.   I was in between the Police Officer, the gate and
people pushing me.

When you were against this gate before it opened, were
you squashed against it? - A. No.

How come you got jammed against it?   Was it that the
people behind you carried you forward as they noticed the
gate opening, or what happened? - A. What it was with me
was that when I saw the gates opening, I was a bit wary
whether to just go in or...   I was waiting to see what
was happening.   I was looking for my ticket.   As I am
looking for my ticket I am walking towards the gate and
then there was people going in then.   While I was
looking for my ticket I lost my footing.

You say the Police Officer picked you up? -A. Yes.

You spoke to him in slightly less polite language than
you do to me? - A. Yes.

He said, "Get in", or words to that effect? -A. He just
said, "Get in", not bothering to look at my ticket.

You had been to the ground before? - A. Well, I had only
been to two games in two years and they were those.

In 1988 you went? - A. Yes.

Where did you go in 1989?   Tell me where you went.
Having got through the concertina gate what did you do
next? - A. Through Gate C?

Yes. - A. I walked over towards the toilet.   The toilet
was pretty chocka so there were a lot of people going
outside the toilet against the wall.   We got together
again, the people I was with.

How many were you with? - A. There were five of us.

You went to the toilet.   People were weeing outside
because it was chocka.   I don't know whether you wee-ed
and I am not going to ask you.   You then met up with
your... -A. Yes, we were all in around, say, ten feet.

Then what did you do next? - A. We started to make our
way down the tunnel.

What was the passage down the tunnel like? - A. It was
OK.
                                                             66

                                                     B. J. DOYLE


Q. At the end of the tunnel, what was that like, just as you
   come to the exit of the tunnel? — A* I should say there
   was a lot of movement as we got out of the tunnel.

Q. What I am trying to find out is:   was the exit clear or
   was it blocked by people, as far as you were concerned? -
   A. It was pretty full.

Q. How did you get on to the terrace? - A. Well, I have just
   said that, haven't I?

Q. Well, perhaps I missed it. - A. I came out of the tunnel
   on to the terraces.

Q. How?   Did you walk through?   Did you push through?
   Did the people open? - A. I got to the end of the crowd
   and you just got sucked in.

Q. You what? - A. I got sucked in.   As soon as you went two
   or three feet into that crowd it was crazy.

Q. Tell me in your own words -you had got on to the
   terrace, did you look on to the pitchat that point? - A.
   Yes, I could see the pitch.

Q. What was happening on the pitch? -A. The teams were just
   coming out.

Q. Play hadn't yet started? - A. No.

Q.   So it was the pre-match warm-up?     - A.Yes.

Q.   That was the point when you     got out.Now     describe the
     terracing and what happened. - A. I had been standing on
     there maybe not even fifty seconds and there was a man
     making his way back up towards the tunnel who punched me
     in the neck.   He was hysterical.   He punched me in the
     side of the neck screaming, "Get out of my way.    Let me
     out" and all that.

Q. Go on. - A. We were all together one minute, the five of
   us.   One of'them with us was nearly twenty stones and he
   got pushed like a baby going that way and me and young
   Carl got from that area towards the front.




                  Q. Was this a severe
                                                           67.

                                               B. J. DOYLE

Q. Was this a severe push that you experienced or a gentle
   pressure, or what was it? - A. Well, you couldn't get
   your breath.

0. No, I understand that, but what I am trying to   find out
   is when you were carried forward was it just a   gentle
   push or was it a sudden push, or was it steady   the
   whole time?  What was it? - A. It was sudden.    Your
   feet wasn't touching the steps.

0. You then got carried forward to near the perimeter
   gate, is that right, to near the gate on the fencing,
   or where did you get to? - A. It was more or less
   straignt down, towards the right, about 12 foot from
   the fence.

0. When you got to that position did you stop?  Did you
   come to a full stop? - A. We come to the crash barrier.

Q. What happened? - A. I told Carl to get underneath
   because he was only little.

0. Get over it? - A. No, go under it, because it was bad
   enough being in, I didn't want to be trapped against
   the crash barrier, so we got under the crash barrier.
   By that time you could smell vomit, people had been
   vomiting.  There was people turning the wrong way, for
   instance, who looked like they had had enough anyway.

0. What was happening on the pitch?  Had the game started
   yet or not? - A. To tell you the truth I wasn't
   worried.

0. I know that, nobody was, or very few people were, but
   does that mean that you don't know? - A. It was that
   bad, I wasn't interested in the football.

0. Okay, so you were then near the crash barrier, Carl had
   gone underneath, you were still on this side, right? -
   A. No, the two of us went under.

Q. You went underneath as well? - A. Yes.

0. Did you get out? - A. Out where?

0. Out of the pen? - A. Well what happened is we went
   under the crash barrier, got to by the front, and the
   year before I had been on the right side, by the Police
   Box, so I looked over there, that looked pretty empty
   and we started fighting our way through, absolutely -
   not^pushing but - — you know, it was a feeling like, I
   don t know what it is, how to say it really.  I had a
   feeling if I didn't start moving towards that way I was
   going to die.
                                                                    68
                                                         B. J. DOYLE


    Q. In other words, what you are saying is that you felt
           you had to get out of there at any price? - A. No, not
           at any price.

B   Q <    If you possibly could you would get out? - A. Yes,   I
           would ratner not be in there.

    0     .So you were trying to make your way over to the right,
           is that right? - A. Yes.

           Because you wanted to get near the Police Control Box?
           - A. Yes.

    Q.     How did you actually then get out. - A. I was in pen 3,
           there is railings going up that go over to pen 2.

    0. That is right. - A. There was an old man right in the
           corner, he was facing towards the stands because he
           couldn't turn round.  Carl got over the fence and I was
           trying to help the old man to get his arms onto the
           fence, which must be six foot.  I was trying to get his
           hands up to that, there was people jumping on my
D          shoulders, on his shoulder, to get out.  There was a
           Policeman walking up and down - I was right by the
           fence then - a Sergeant with a stick.

           A Sergeant with a ...? - A. He had a stick, a baton.
           He walked past, I was screaming for him to help, and he
           just looked and looked the other way and spit on the
           floor.  I was trying to get this old man up and I
           couldn't.  There was people screaming everywhere.   In
           the end it was hopeless, I couldn't lift him anyway -
           he was a big man, a grey haired fella - so I got hold
           of tne thing, stood on his shoulder and jumped over.

           What was happening on the pitch at that point? - A. The
           game was playing.

    0. It was in play at that time? - A. Yes.

    0. You are sure about that? - A. Yes, I am positive.

    o. Did you see Beardsley     hit the crossbar?   - A. No.

    0. So you don't know how far the game .... - A. I heard
           the big roar.

           Were you still in pen 3 then or were you already in pen
           2, when you heard the big roar? - A. As I heard the big
           roar I was just on the fence to jump.   I remember
           because I turned round and looked back at the old fella
           and he was just completely --- he looked like he was
           dead.

Q. Then I think you got out of pen 2, is that right? - A.
   I ran over --- this Policeman just kept walking up and
   down, he was doing my head in.

0. So you are saying that there was a Police Sergeant,       you
   say? - A. Yes.

Q. With a stick, who was walking up and down .... - A. He
   was walking up and down, obviously he must have been
   seeing them faces against the fence, and turning the
   other way.

0. Did you see any Policemen on the fencing at all? - A.
   No.

0. You saw none? - A. No.    The only two Policemen I seen
   wnen I got in that pen was there was a Policeman on
   gate 2, to the gate by the Police Box, like you could
   get out to   the ground, and this fella walking up and
   down.  I would   just like to ask - could I ask you
   something?

0. Not really.  Well, ask me and I will see if I will
   allow it. - A. I would just like to know what kind of
   job he was supposed to be doing that day?

0. Well, that isn't a question you can ask,      I am sorry. -
   That's fair enough then.

0.    What I am interested in is what   you saw and the time at
     which you saw it.   We will make   up our mind what, if
     anything, he was doing.   What I   am trying to establish
     is that you are certain that it    was a Sergeant? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   That he had a stick   in his hand? - A. Yes.

0.    That he was walking   up and down, and that he was
     walking up    and down     at the point in time when you
     managed to    get into     pen 2?- A.He walked past me when
     I was trying to get the old fella up, yes.

0.   That was more or less at the time when you heard the
     big loud roar? - A. Yes.

Q. And the match was in play? - A. That was when --- when
   there is people jumping on you and you are trying to
   help someone, don't  get me wrong, I was swearing at
   them who was jumping on me as well, but it was the time
   then tnat I thought I had to get out for myself.

Q. Did you see the gate leading onto the pitch? - A. In
   pen 2?
                                                B. J. DOYLE

In pen 3? - A. No.

But in pen 2 you saw it? - A. Yes, well I ran over,
there was a Policeman there standing by it.

Was it open or shut? - A.   It was shut.

So when you ran over it was shut? - A.     I ran over to
him, yes.

What did you do then? - A. I said to the Policeman,
 Tnere s people getting killed in the next pen", and he
just seemed to --- he didn't want to say, and then he
seen people getting lifted up, he was looking at people
getting lifted up on the stand.  I told him again, and
I don't know whether he couldn't understand ray accent,
I was looking at this old fella - all I could see was
this old fella.  He opened the gate and I think there
was a girl who was crying or something, or wanted to
come in to pen 2, so I pushed the gate and him out of
the way.

Then you ran onto the pitch? - A. No.

What did you do then? - A.    I ran down to the fence
behind the goal and jumped    on the fence, and what I
seen there, I mean — —— but   this is it, this Policeman
must have seen it.   I seen   it.

Yes, tell me what you saw.   Never mind what the
Policeman saw. — A. I jumped on the fence and all you
could see was people's heads going blue, they was sick,
white stuff coming out of their mouths, their tongues
nanging out, all with their arms up screaming.

Had the match finished by then? - A. No, because I
remember someone in the stand shouting, "Doyley".  I do
remember this man shouting, "Doyley, go and grab the
ball , because they were still playing.

Was this a man you   knew? - A. No.

What is your name?   - A. Brian Doyle.

So you are telling me that somebody in the crowd     .... -
A. In the stands.

In the stands, called to you by name? - A. "Doyle-y".

But you don't know   who it was? - A. Well, there was a
lot of fellas from   Tower Hill there, you see.

So there were people there who knew you? - A. Yes.
                                              B. J. DOYLE


It wasn't that they were total strangers, you might
well have had friends up there? - A. There was friends
up there.

Did you then turn and run onto the pitch? - A. No.

What did you do? - A. I had hold of people's hands
trying to drag them up.

Did you see any Police Officers on that fence at that
time? - A. No.

Did you see gate 3 at all? - A- No.

You didn't see it? - A. No.

Where were you on the fencing in relation to ...? - A.
Just to the left of the goal.  I did get up on the
fence twice, at different places.

The first time I am interested in, and this was just to
the left of the goal? - A. Yes.

You say as far as you know the match was still in play
at that point? - A. Yes.  What it was, it was like I
was the only one who was seeing anything and everyone
else wasn't, even though there was people in the stand,
or towards ....

Are you saying you were the only fan on the fencing as
well? - A. I was one of the first, yes.

Apart from this one Police Officer who was walking
down, who you have described, did you see any other
Police Officers? - A. When I pushed this Policeman out
of the way by the gate, I seen out of the corner of my
eye, like three Policemen running after me, thinking I
was going to start running on the pitch, whatever.   I
want you to mark where you were first on a plan, and
mark where you were - show him where pen 2 is - I want
you to put another mark which is where you were on the
fence the first time, you said just to the left of the
goal - put the other plan up because it will be easier.

     THE CORONER:   (Addressing a member of the J u r y )
Are you all right, can you go on?  I don t want you to
be panicking.

     MR. MANNING:    Sir, I hesitate to interrupt but we
on this side are feeling a little disquiet.   The lady
member of the Jury wants clearly to be with the child
that is in hospital.   I would hate us to have to, on
the one hand, not ask questions - and I have canvassed
                                                B. J. DOYLE


some views - that we clearly are going to need sometime
to do.

     THE CORONER:   In that case we will break off and
we will bring him back.

     MR.^MANNING:   I don't want you to feel there is
any criticism anywhere but I am just voicing the
feeling ....

     THE CORONER:   The reason why I am anxious about
this witness is that he is himself, I think, quite
anxious, and that is my dilemma.. That is why I wanted
to deal with him.  Let me just see where he has marked.

     MR. BEECHEY:      The "C" number for the first one,
sir, is C447.

     THE CORONER:      Show me where the other one is?

      MR. GRIFFITHS:   That is the first one, sir, and
on trie second one he has indicated, looking from the
pitch, down towards the terraces, just to the right of
gate 3, sir.

     MR. BEECHEY:      That is C448, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Your recollection is that you were
one of the first people on the fencing? - A. Yes.

Trying to help? - A. Yes.

And you definitely did not see any Officers on the
fencing as you   ran past? - A. No.

You didn't see      the gate? - A. No.

You exited through pen 2, you are certain about that as
well? - A. Yes.

Just go back to the overhead once more and show us
which gate you came out of if you can. - A. The Police
Box was h e r e , I came out o f ,this gate.

That is fine.    That is gate 2 but Ijust wanted to be
sure.  Mr. Doyle, I am afraid we are not going to be
able to finish because it looks as if the legal people
may want more time.   One of the Jury has got to go to
hospital so we can't carry on this afternoon.



             MR. PAYNE:       I am just wondering
                                                    B. J. DOYLE


     MR. PAYNE:   I am just wondering whether we can short
circuit i t . May I just ask one question which I think
could easily actually bring a lot of questions to an end if
Mr. Doyle will accept the position and this will resolve it
both from his point of view and also the other pressure
that we have got.

     THE CORONER:      I was listening to Mr. Manning.

     MR. PAYNE:     I know, sir.

     THE CORONER:   By all means let us start but what I do
not want is that any of you should feel pressurised.

     MR. PAYNE: May I just try this question which I think
might, in fact, cut the Gordian knot?

     THE CORONER:     Yes.

                  Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Q. You have given your evidence that it seemed to you
   that you were the only one who appreciated how bad
   things were? - A. No, I am not saying that.

Q. I am not very successful. - A. What I am saying is...

Q. I am sorry, carry on. - A. What I am saying is that
   when I was shouting to the Policeman the Sergeant is
   walking past, the one on the gate, to try and tell
   him what was happening. They did not seem to be
   clicking or registering.

Q. At the time you were on the fence was when there was
   the big roar of the crowd? - A. No, I jumped over to
   Pen 2 when there was a big roar.

Q. That is right, going over the fence into Pen 2 when
   there was a big roar of the crowd? - A. Yes.

Q. Which you think was probably Beardsley hitting the
   crossbar? - A. I never said that.  I cannot say that.

Q. It was after the game had kicked off and it was
   playing? - A. Yes.

Q. Although you were not paying attention to it. - A.
   Would you be?

Q. Quite. There was a big roar? - A. Yes, I heard the
   roar from the crowd.

Q. Here is the question I want to ask you; from other
   photographs which if necessary we can go through in
                                                                74

                                                     B. J. DOYLE

       quite some detail, in fact, we can see a lot of other
       things were happening at that time, that the gates
       were open? - A. I never saw any gates open.
B
    Q. Quite. Policemen were clustering around the gate and
       starting to pull people out. You did not see it
       yourself though, did you? - A. No.

    Q. That is all it amounts to really? - A. I never seen
       it but I am just saying what I seen. If I could add
       something else to that now is that when I was on that
       fence and jumped down I got hold of a Policewoman and
       said, "Are you going to help these poor people?" and
       she started going ( indicating) "That way” as I was
       grabbing her and also a Policeman.

         THE CORONER:   Mr. Isaacs, I take it you will want a
    little bit more time?

         MR. ISAACS:   I do feel, sir, with respect to my
    learned friend, it would not be right for any of us to be
D   put into a position where whatever questions we want to
    ask...

         THE CORONER:I have accepted the point.    I think   he
    is an important witness and I think it is just one of those
    things.

    Q. Mr. Doyle, we will break and I am afraid you will
       have to come back. Is tomorrow an inconvenient day
       for you because it would be best if you came back
       tomorrow so that we could complete your evidence as
       nearly as possible in one go. You have not got any
       other commitments tomorrow is what I am asking? - A.
       No, I will come back.

    Q. If you would be so kind and we will pick it up where
       we have left it for today and carry on from there.
       It is inconvenient for you, I know, but it is just
       one of those things. We cannot help illness as I am
       sure you will appreciate, all right? - A. I have had
       enough of that, yes.

    Q. You will understand? - A. Cheers.

         THE CORONER:   In fact, all of you can go. It will be
    ten o'clock tomorrow. We will also rise and have lunch.
    Shall we come back at quarter past to give us an hour and
    then we can deal with any legal points? Is that
    satisfactory to all of you? Yes.

                       LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT
                fin the absence of the Jury)

     MR. KING:   Sir, could I first mention the evidence of
Mr. Hicks because you will recall you very kindly drew my
attention to matters which have emerged since he gave his
evidence?

     THE CORONER:   Yes.

     MR. KING:    Can I say simply that it would be
preferable in our view for Mr. Hicks to be recalled to deal
with that matter.

     THE CORONER:   I am very happy to do that because
after all I would not have mentioned it to you.  I have not
got the transcript with me. Do you remember what page
number it is?

     MR. KING:   Can I undertake, before the day is out, to
pass that information to you?

     THE CORONER:   I can find it because, after all, I
found it in the first instance but if you happen to know
the page number it saves me time.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I have a very efficient instructing
solicitor behind me. Can I leave that then?

     THE CORONER:   Yes, indeed.

     MR. KING:   The second matter is that you may recall
the other day my learned friend, Mr. Payne, handed up to
you without much comment a copy of the Times of last Friday
in which there were comments recorded of Lord Justice
Taylor.  In many ways I shared the concern of my learned
friend as to the desirability of comments being made
outside this Courtroom on the very issues which the Jury
themselves have to determine.  I noted my learned friend
said nothing, and I do not blame him for that, as to what
course you could or could not take in the light of the
contents of it. He simply drew it to your attention.

     THE CORONER:   Yes.

     MR. KING:   In the same frame of mind, attitude and
concern, I draw your attention, sir, to that which I know
probably you are already aware of because I asked that it
should be drawn to your attention.  It appears in today's
Yorkshire Post which is an account apparently of a bill
going through Parliament and a report published by a
Parliamentary Select Committee, Backbench Home Affairs
Committee, on the state of football. This is the Yorkshire
Post for today, Wednesday, 6th February 1991, page three,
and you will see, sir, in the article headed "MPs backing
for football cleanup bill", in the second column near the
bottom there are three paragraphs beginning, "The Labour MP
for Bassetlaw, Mr. Joe Ashton, a Director of Sheffield
Wednesday said

     THE CORONER:   I have read it.

     MR. KING:   It then gave comments which clearly are
directed to a certain standpoint as to one of the causes of
the disaster which this Jury is having to investigate. I
say no more at this time save to draw it to your attention.
I do not know where he made those comments, whether they
were made in Parliament, outside Parliament, or what have
you. That is not clear from the report. Clearly it is a
matter of concern that another example is now produced of
matters which could easily come to the attention of this
Jury. I do not know what one can do about it and in many
ways I have to rely on your own expertise in this matter
but I do draw it to your attention.

     THE CORONER:   As you know, from past experience, I
have tended to tick the press off when I have thought they
have exceeded their prerogative, so to speak, and made
comments. I have done it at least twice before and
possibly more than that. I have no particular inhibition
on that front. I think my problem is the people who are
making the quotes.

     MR. KING:   Absolutely, sir. If I might interrupt, my
concern is not so much with the press who may well be no
more than honestly and bona fide reporting of that which
has been said elsewhere. It is the alleged identity of the
speaker who is a Director of the Club with which we are
concerned and allegedly he is giving his belief as to what
the very Inquest we are now at into these deaths would
reveal. If he is making those comments outside Parliament
(because within Parliament one can do nothing) it is a
matter which I would submit is a matter of concern.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Catchpole, do you perchance know?

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Sir, I attempted to contact the Club
today. Obviously I was concerned as my learned friend when
I saw the comments. Regrettably neither Mr. Ashton nor Mr.
Mackrell are available. Mr. Ashton is at Westminster and
Mr. Mackrell is at a meeting. I will attempt to find out
exactly what Mr. Ashton said, if he said it, and I shall
speak to one of your Officers accordingly. All I can say
is that I know that the Directors of the Club are concerned
not to give any offence to you, sir, and I am sure Mr.
Ashton did not intend to have that effect. I will do what
I can to find out how these comments came to be reported.

     THE CORONER:   I entirely agree he does deal, and for
that matter Lord Justice Taylor deals, with issues which we
are considering in this Inquest. It is just exceedingly
difficult for me as a mere Coroner to say to Lord Justice
Taylor, who obviously has both position of status and
experience in this field because he did the Inquiry, for me
to say, "Don't do it". I have got to face the reality of
the situation but I know my view has always been that
whoever it might be the comments on the Inquest is sub
ludice. There is plenty of judicial authority to support
that and if comments are made which infringe that principle
then, strictly speaking - I cannot enforce it myself. The
only way I could enforce it would be to apply to the
Attorney General to take proceedings if he were so minded
but if he were so minded and if a Court were to uphold no
doubt the appropriate penalties would exacted.

      The issue really is whether in view of the
personalities it is a sensible thing to even begin to set
that ball rolling. I would much rather say as a matter of
principle, whoever it might be, I would prefer if they
remembered the general principles of law which is that the
Inquest is sub iudice and however interesting and
relevant - I cannot do anything if it is in Parliament as
you very rightly say. If it is in Parliament they have got
absolute privilege and I agree with that because if they
are discussing a bill they must have freedom to say but
even there they should be careful in what people say so as
not to invalidate or give the appearances of invalidation
to the verdict which a Jury might reach. Does that help in
any way? Perhaps you could, Mr. Catchpole, make a few
judicious enquiries and find out where it happened. This
is no criticism of you, of course, and if it happened I
will decide an appropriate word may be spoken in people's
ears.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Sir, you can rest assured that an
appropriate word has already been had with the Club and I
will reinforce that by saying that wherever it happened, it
should not happen again, if indeed this is an accurate
report of what Mr. Ashton said. Certainly I will make
enquiries.

     THE CORONER:   If this sort of thing were to continue
then I think I would have to say - I do not care who it
is - that we will go off to the Attorney General and let
him take whatever decision he thinks is right.

     MR. KING:   Obviously there are two different issues.
One relates to what has already happened and the other is
the future. Obviously we are concerned about what has
already happened, but we are very concerned as to the
future and it was because of the identity of the alleged
person who made these comments and the express reference to
the Inquest, not simply the disaster, that gave us the
gravest concern. I say no more at the moment on that. I
have drawn it to your attention and you have indicated your
view at this stage.

     THE CORONER:   I will wait to hear what Mr. Catchpole
says and then I can take an absolute and final decision but
my dilemma is that I have to be consistent between the two
comments. It is not fair to say that it is all right to
one but that it is not all right to the other. If you read
the Times extract, although it does not refer directly and
does not use the word "Inquest", he does actually say what
he thinks and how it happened. That is the very question
we are supposed to be deciding.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Certainly, sir, I shall let him know
as soon as I possibly can the outcome of such an enquiry.

     THE CORONER:   I will think about it a little bit
further as well. May I just say that so far as I am able
to convey this to people who matter or people who do not
matter, is neither here nor there. I consider this Inquest
still to be in being and, therefore, sub iudice and I say
that no comment should be made and the paper should not
publish comments which can in any way be construed as
infringing the rule against sub iudice proceedings and
which could be deemed or held in any way to be prejudicial
to the verdict of the Jury and I think that is as strongly
as I can word it really. It is annoying but there is not
much I can do at this stage.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   Sir, I was watching the news yesterday
and I did see Mr. Ashton being interviewed on television
with another MP. One was a Labour MP, Mr. Ashton of
course, and the other was a Conservative and they were
being asked many questions about football and the state of
it today, and this sort of thing. I do not know if that
interview has brought about these comments in the paper
today. I would have thought they would really.

     THE CORONER:   It does not mean to say that nobody can
say anything at all about football stadia or Sheffield
Wednesday. Obviously they can and they certainly talk
about what changes they want to make and so on because we
live in the real world and it is almost two years on. What
I am concerned about is that they should not talk about the
issues directly relating to the Inquest, the when, where,
how and the who, I suppose, but they would not talk about
the who because it is not so important to them.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   Sir, there wasn't anything mentioned
that would relate to the Inquest what I heard on
television, nothing at all.

     THE CORONER:   The trouble is that there has been a
Bill introduced into Parliament yesterday, I think, on this
very topic and this, of course, is what has generated the
interest.




                          /I am afraid it would.
I am afraid it would have been better from our point of
view if they had not introduced a Bill, but my powers do
not extend to Parliamentary time. I think I have done my
best as far as I can at the moment.

         MR. KING: Thank you, sir. May I now turn to the
submission made by my learned friend Mr. Payne the other
day, which you will recall was in relation to whether or
not you may be prepared to call Dr. Phillips to give
expert evidence.

         THE CORONER: Mr. Phillips.

          MR. KING: Mr. Phillips, I beg your pardon.   It
shows my ignorancetotally of what his status is. Can I
say at once that I am conscious that despite the way it
may have appeared at times, we are in an inquisitorial
court and not in an adversarial court, and I am conscious
of the fact that I cannot demand that you call certain
evidence, nor can my learned friend.   I am very conscious
at the end of the day that the calling of witnesses is an
absolute matter for your discretion, sir.

         I say that at the outset because one of the
difficulties in dealing with such an application is that
it was put very much, and very properly put, in a way of
being helpful to you, sir.

         THE CORONER: Indeed.

           MR. KING: But I have to say at the back of it -
and   Ido not again mean this unkindly - clearly my learned
friend represents an interest in the Inquest, just as I
do, and has an interest in one of the verdicts being
returned as opposed to another verdict being returned.

         I know this much, sir, that the witness concerned
was an expert whose assistance was looked for by those
whom my learned friend now represents at this Inquest in
the context of an adversarial battle.  It was a report, as
I understand it, which was commissioned to be used in the
High Court in the context of civil litigation in relation
to issues of negligence.

         I raise that because that is a matter for your
discretion.  It is not for me really to do other than to
lay that before you because obviously, assuming for the
moment that the evidence be relevant to issues which the
Jury have to decide, one of the matters I know you would
want to take into account is whether or not it would be
right and proper that a witness going to those issues and
expertise was a witness who had been identified in the
making of the report, at the time he made the report, at
the time it was commissioned, with one of those who have a
particular interest to this Inquiry.  It is always
difficult because it is easy to say that a witness is
independent, and we all say it in the context of the
adversarial battle in the High Court - "I call my
independent witness, my Lord".  But in fact, and we all
know it, the independent witness has been commissioned
with a view to achieving, within the confines of his
expertise, and his bona fides of course, a certain end. I
do not mean this as a disrespect to any of the many
consultants who I have seen called in Court, but it is
well-known that a consultant will prepare a report, doing
his best, and it will be bona fides, but none the less he
will be concentrating his eyes and his mind to a certain
route and a certain result.

         THE CORONER: Mr. Payne, you may not agree with
everything Mr. King says, but he is entitled to tell me
his position.

         MR. KING: Sir, I do not know, and cannot claim
to know, the basis of the report which you have. The only
knowledge I have are the matters I have laid before you.
I am told - and I learnt this through the intervention of
my learned friend Mr. Catchpole, and I do not mean any
disrespect to him - that it was a report prepared for
those civil proceedings on behalf of those representing
one of the defendants in the civil proceedings.

         So I say no more than that because it is a factor
which I none the less ask you to consider carefully,
because it must be very different from where you, sir, as
a Coroner, call for expert evidence from, shall we say,
the HSE, not representing any particular interest at all.
Sir, that goes really to, if you do decide to call expert
evidence, who you would want to call on the various
issues.

         Sir, can I just then address you briefly, because
at the end of the day it is in your discretion, as to what
issues such expert evidence might be relevant. My learned
friend has concentrated properly on issues arising out of
a potential verdict of unlawful killing, and he has
directed you to passages in Archbold relating to unlawful
killing by reference to the label "gross negligence".  I
do not need to go to those passages again because they
have been drawn to your attention.

         This probably is not the time to go into a long
legal discussion as to what unlawful killing is, but I
would submit that what we are dealing with here is that
category of unlawful killing which is the classic category
of which there is no dispute, that is to say, the creation
of an obvious and serious risk of injury which either the
perpetrator acknowledges but takes none the less, or does
not give any thought to, which is known as the
Lawrence/Caldwell test of recklessness.

         Sir, I would submit that when one is looking to
the issues relating to unlawful killing, to which any
expert evidence might be relevant, one has to concentrate
very much on what are the potential areas of fact and law
relating to the creation of, and perhaps being indifferent
to, that obvious and serious risk.

         If I can work backwards without being too
contentious, I do not think it would be in dispute that
the immediate cause of the deaths in the pens was through
overcrowding.  I put it as simply as that.  It is not in
dispute that one of the causes of overcrowding was the
fact that a large number of people entered those pens
following the opening of a number of concertina gates.   I
am trying to be as neutral as I can at the moment because
I am trying to identify issues rather than address you on
the finding of facts, which I am not trying to do.

         THE CORONER: Indeed.

         MR. KING: The analysis of unlawful killing, in
my submission, would be directed to whether or not the
alleged perpetrator knew, or was indifferent to, an
obvious and serious risk of (1) those large numbers of
people coming through the gates, (2) the likelihood of the
route they would take, (3) the state of the pens at the
time immediately before they were into the pen, (4) the
likelihood of the result if such a large number of people
were introduced to those pens at a time when the state was
what was obvious at the time, whatever that be. I am not
trying to give the answers to what was obvious, but what I
am trying to direct you to is that those are issues which,
in my submission, if one looks at them, may not be
amenable to the sort of expert evidence which my learned
friend is referring to, as opposed to the factual evidence
of what was obvious from the position of whoever one is
looking to at the time decisions were made, be it somebody
in the Control Box, be it someone on the ground level,
that is to say, what the state of the pens was, what the
numbers were outside, the likelihood of the route and so
forth.

         Sir, I am not at the end of the day saying that
you could not have an expert who would deal with those
matters, but that expert would have to deal with them on
the basis of assumed fact, because he is not an arbiter of
the fact, and that is for the Jury.

         If at the end of the day you call the expert
evidence, so be it, and I certainly shall not complain
because it is a matter for you and it may seem that I am
being disingenuous, but I am generally trying to be
helpful in terms of identifying what the issues are and
for myself I would submit that the issues of what was
obvious and what was likely, in the context of the state
of the pens, the numbers coming through the concertina
gates, where they were going to go, the likely route, the
likely effect if they were introduced into the pens
without steps being taken to divert them, those are
matters the Jury can deal with without the help of an
expert.

         You may disagree, sir,’ and so be it. As I say, I
am not submitting on the basis - and I cannot anyway -
that you should not call it.

         THE CORONER: No.

         MR. KING: What concerns me slightly is that my
learned friend, such as he did outline the issues to which
Mr. Phillips might be directed, went beyond that immediate
series of facts, or questions of fact, to crowds arriving
at the ground, what happens at other grounds, the general
expectation of behaviour of fans, and so forth. I am not
suggesting for one moment they are not interesting
questions.   I am not suggesting either that we have not,
in the course of this lengthy Inquest, gone into those
issues. But if one is actually looking at a verdict of
unlawful killing, sir, and if that were the basis upon
which this were made, I would merely ask you to ask
yourself the relevance of those issues to the issues which
make up the unlawful verdict issue. Because, for example,
whether or not the large crowd outside Gates A, B and C
were to be expected or not for the sake of the argument,
the issue would still be, on the line of analysis I am
putting for a Jury, what was obvious if they were allowed
in, whether or not they were expected to be there in the
first place.

         Sir, the only danger I can see of calling an
expert on wide-ranging issues as to behaviour of football
fans and football grounds generally, is that one would
lengthen the Inquest considerably.  I have no idea how
long one would allow for such expert evidence, but I
suspect we would be talking at least about two or three
days, perhaps, not necessarily going to issues of help to
the Jury. That is really my main thrust on that, sir.

         I am not afraid, though, sir, if he were called.
In other words, I do not personally object because in many
ways, as you have often said in different contexts, it is
a 2-edged sword when people are called, because it opens
the field for someone in my position to ask wide-ranging
questions of the witness. To that extent, I am not taking
my stand on at all costs I must stop this evidence coming
forward.  Quite the reverse in that sense.

         I suppose nagging at the back of my head has to
be - I say it openly - the question why is it that those
who my learned friend represents are anxious, and they
clearly are anxious, for Mr. Phillips to be called, and
that is not an improper question because there may be a
very proper answer, which is, "He goes to issues which we
wish the Jury to hear, which are very relevant", and so
forth.

         But I would not be doing those I represent a
service if I did not raise that issue, in the sense that
you are not being invited, sir, I repeat, to call - it
sounds a hard way of putting it - a totally independent
expert.  I think that is the best I can do.  I repeat
again I am not challenging the bona fides of the witness,
but he is not an expert who you, sir, have caused to make
the report, if I can put it that way.  There must be a
danger that, if you call Mr. Phillips, those I represent
might say, "Well, Mr. King, I think you ought to go off
and find an expert for us who would deal with these
matters and perhaps put a different light on things".
Then we are back into the adversarial contest, which this
is not.

         I come really back to where I started, that this
is an inquisitorial matter.  At the end of the day it is a
matter for you, sir, and I accept that totally.  I repeat
I am not adverse at all to your calling Mr. Phillips, if
you make that decision, but I would ask you to look at the
issues in a relatively narrow context to which the lawful
killing verdict, if it is left to the Jury, would be
directed, and then to ask the question, the extent to
which Mr. Phillips's evidence can be of assistance.   You,
sir, have the benefit - and I make no complaint - of
knowing what he says and I do not.  I make no complaint,
but I would merely invite you to approach it in that way.
I know, sir, you have not made a decision anyway, and if
you make a decision to call him, I would be very happy to
see him.  That is all I can say, sir.

         THE CORONER:   We will let Mr. Catchpole go next.

         MR. CATCHPOLE:  Sir, I have listened with some
interest to the submissions made by my learned friends Mr.
Payne and Mr. King, and I have sympathy with both of them.
I am in the fortunate position in that a lot of Mr.
Phillips's report, I know, does not touch or concern
matters that would necessarily concern the Club.

         I would, however, express some reservations that
my learned friend Mr. King has just expressed.  I will not
have to go into any details because he has done it far
more eloquently than I could have done, but there are two
things.

         The first is that he is an expert who was
originally instructed by a party to the civil proceedings.
One can say, without being rude or in any way
disrespectful to parties not present, that one would not
have expected, for example, the engineer who was going to
be called in support of Dr. Eastwood's case at the civil
proceedings to have been called as the independent expert
at this Inquest.  One simply would not have expected that.

         The other point that I would make, and I have
made before again as a matter of caution really, is that
the report as it is drawn up at the moment was based on
assumed facts.  Now a number of those facts may well not
be the ones that we have heard in evidence under oath
here, and so in that sense a report that already exists
may not be particularly helpful to you if you do actually
decide to call Mr. Phillips.




                            /Q.   The second point.
     The second point is really the one that has again
been expressed by my learned friend Mr. King, simply
the length of time that this Inquest is going to be
extended by a witness who may not necessarily give this
Jury any assistance on the matters that are really at
issue.  We know that there is an awful lot of evidence
which has quite properly come out at this Inquest,
which does not touch on the very questions the Jury
have^to d e c i d e , but it fulfils the very important role
of filling in the background, giving them a context
within which to make that decision.        How far Mr.
Phillips can help on the very small number of questions
that they actually have to decid-e is a matter for you
to decide in deciding whether to call him or not, but I
would urge you to think along the lines Mr. King nas
been saying, that really an expert is not going to help
on tnose matters, which come down to a number of fairly
simple questions.

     My position as far as the Club is concerned, in
the spirit of trying to be helpful, is a note of
caution about this witness.  He is not someone that you
have instructed on the basis of evidence you have put
before him.  Equally he could very well lengthen this
Inquest without necessarily taking it that much
further.  It may even add to the confusion of adding in
peripheral details to the Jury when they have got more
than enough background to cope with before they come to
their proper decision.  On that note I really leave it.

        MRS. McBRIEN: Sir, my submission is that you
should call expert witnesses.   I feel that if a job has
to be done it should be done properly and thoroughly,
and I am referring to the Inquest when I say tnose
t h i ng s .

        THE CORONER:   Yes, Mr. Hale - nice to see you
back.

     MR. HALE:   Sir, it is just sheer fortune that I
learned of these submissions being made.  I think I
have one small point to make and that is that my
learned friend Mr. King missed out one essential
ingredient which an expert can deal with, and that is
that even if one sees a danger, if it was foreseeable,
and all sorts of things, the question then arises was
it really possible to do anything about it?  That is
something that an expert can speak about.

     It is not my job to address you on the facts, but
you will be aware that the only point I am really
concerned with is whether the crowd coming down
Leppings Lane could have been stopped before it got to
the perimeter fence.  You may take a view on that.  You
may say, as I might say, that evidence has been given
that is quite sufficient to resolve that point, and you
may find you have no difficulty whatever in addressing
the Jury as to the feasibility of stopping that crowd,
on the basis of the evidence you have already heard.

       If so that is the end of the matter, but if not,
and if you feel the Jury may have it in their mind to
be thinking, well really they jolly well ought to have
stopped them a hundred yards away, or at the end of
Leppings Lane with Catch Bar Lane and everything would
have been fine and dandy, then of course I would say
one would have to have an expert., whether it be Hr.
Phillips or anybody else, somebody who is used to
dealing with crowds in large numbers in that way, to
say what steps might have been taken even if it had
been foreseen and whether it was really was feasible to
stop that crowd, so there is an area in which an expert
of some sort could help unless, as I say, you have
already formed a view on that.

     MR. PAYNE:   May I reply to particular points made
by Mr. King, please?

     THE CORONER:   Indeed.   That is why we are here.

     J1R. PAYNE:  ilis submission eventually came down,
I think, to this, and I nope I am not doing him a
disservice, but it focussed upon this point, that he
says that really although other issues are interesting
in the case, really when the attention is drawn to what
- I am putting words in his mouth - is the main issue,
and he focuses entirely on what happened after the
gates had been opened, when one looks at that one does
not need expert evidence, and the other issues in the
case may be interesting but they are peripheral.   I am
summarising but I think that is the nub of it.

     Now tnis is a really good and useful point for him
to have made because it does raise a serious matter
about the conduct of this Inquest and about the Jury's
deliberations about how the disaster occurred.   There
is a serious question about whether the verdict can
properly be returned simply by focussing upon the space
of a few minutes, eight minutes or so, after the gates
had been opened.  Is the Inquest to be determined by
focussing upon that bracket, or in answer to the
question how did these deaths occur, is the Jury to
look beyond that event.

     I entirely agree with Mr. King in this sense, that
that is a very important question to be addressed.
Now, my plain answer to the question is that it would
be completely wrong and unfair to focus entirely upon
the space of about eight minutes and to say,
disregarding outside matters, whether what happened in
that time qualifies for the verdict, beyond reasonable
doubt, of unlawful killing by some individual not doing
something in particular within that time.

     I would submit that that is completely the wrong
and unfair approacn and that in fact in order to
determine the question how the disaster occurred I nave
made a note of five topic headings, all of which in my
submission are of at least equal importance in
determining now the disaster occurred.

     The issues which I have noted down are these,
which^the Jury should consider as eacn making a
contribution to the happening of the disaster.  First,
that there was no certified capacity of pens 3 and 4,
and no mechanical means of controlling the capacity of
those pens, notwithstanding the terms of the Safety
Certificate, and that, in my submission, is a factor
which made its significant contribution to the
disaster.

     Point two, the layout of the ground and the fact
that it is an old ground, situated in a built up area,
with difficult approaches through densely populated
city surroundings, not constructed to receive nuge
numbers of spectators arriving in a short space of
time, as occurred here, and although I know perhaps he
should not have said it while the Inquest is going on,
it is not insignificant that after a year's reflection
that apparently is the view which is now being taken by
Lord Justice Taylor, who was responsible for conducting
the Inquiry.  So on the question of how it occurred I
submit that factor, not because Lord Justice Taylor
said it but because it is true, is a major factor as to
now the disaster occurred.  It is something which the
Jury should take into account, the layout and
whereabouts of the ground.

     The third factor is the unprecedented build up of
spectators during the short run up period to the
commencement of the match, unprecedented in the history
of the ground, causing such an overwhelming crowding at
the gates as to lead to the serious risk of injury to
people outside the ground.  It clearly cannot be just
put on one side, saying well that is not something
which can be taken into account on the question of how.

     The next point is the unprecedented behaviour of
the spectators on that occasion is not something which
can be discounted in the question of how, i.e., the
fact that when such a large crowd arrived, within the
last half hour before the event, the crowd then behaved
in such a way as to cause the dangerous risk of
crushing of people at the turnstiles.

     Finally, the fifth point, that this led to the
unprecedented pressure on those responsible for
controlling the ground to have to take the decision to
open the gates, to fling the gates open to allow the
people to come in - whatever word one uses, but a rush
is not a bad description - an unprecedented event in
itself.  That also made its substantial contribution to
tne how of the way in wnicn the disaster occurred.

      In my submission - I am grateful to Hr. King for
raising this point because it goes right to the centre
of the kind of considerations which the Jury have got
to be directed about, i.e., can they simply arrive at
the verdict how by focussing on just a few moments and
a few actions within those few moments, and say right,
tnat is the key to it and we now return our verdict,
or, as I strongly submit, whether they should look at
at least those five other factors, all of which in my
submission made a substantial contribution to the now.
I say how, I mean each of which separately made a
substantial contribution to the how.   Actually our
submission is that the way the disaster happened was
when all tnose factors happened to come together at one
time.

     Sir, I don't elaborate the point any further but I
do submit tnat when Mr. King touched on that he hit on
a central point in the case.  That is relevant to the
question of expert evidence because expert evidence
would be very useful, in my submission, to enable the
Jury to look at those five factors in the context of
what was current Police practice at the time.  What was
their approach, based upon the then state of knowledge
and the then practice of policing crowds arriving at
big matches, in a city environment such as this, with
the Police policing by consent system of custom and
practice which was then in force.  So it is relevant,
in my submission, to have expert evidence to put the
Police behaviour in the context of those five points
that I have mentioned.

     Finally, may I say in answer to his submission,
perhaps I should not have muttered during his opening
remarks, but I must say I was most surprised to hear
that in civil litigation the reason you employ an
expert is to put forward you case, or words to that
effect, as expressed by Mr. King.  I know I am putting
it a bit more boldly than him but that is really what
he was saying.  Well that is not right at all, in my
submission.  One employs an independent expert to be
told how you should conduct the case and to tell you,
if it is true, that you have not got a case or that the
case is no good, so that you can then settle it or drop
the case or whatever it is.  You bring in an expert to
be told the truth.  Tnat is the idea of it and
certainly that is what one would expect, so that the
fact, as he quite correctly says, that Mr. Phillips was
employed in another action to give independent expert
evidence, and he was employed by those acting for the
Police, does not mean that he is tainted with
partiality at all, it means that he is employed to give
independent expert evidence by that party, so I submit
tnat he is not tainted in the slightest little bit.

     Finally, I do agree with Mr. King, however, that
he is your witness and not ours, and it will be for you
to judge whether his evidence is tainted with
partiality and if you thought so then obviously it
would not be very helpful to the Jury, and he should
only be called if you felt, having read his report and
looked at the videos, that he could be helpful to the
Jury as an independent and impartial witness, and we
certainly would hope that that is what you would think.

     Sir, those are our submissions in response to what
Mr. King said.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I don't want to reply in any
detail.  A slight misrepresentation of what I was
saying to you, quite understandably.  I don't start in
my analysis of the essential issues with the opening of
the gates, I start before that time, that is to say the
situation outside the gates which led to the decision
to open, and what should have been foreseen and likely
would be result of opening it.  In other words, I don't
start in my analysis with the opening, far from it.
Sir, if one were to look at Chapter 11 of the Taylor
Report, which deals immediately with those issues, you
could see the same analysis, on the basis obviously of
the facts as Lord Justice Taylor found them, but I am
not arguing the facts.

     I don't wish to reply in any detail to what my
learned friend says.   He has made the points he wants
to make.   I do stress though that I was not attacking
the^bona fides of Mr. Phillips at all, but I don't
resile from the fact that in civil litigation it is
well known there are plaintiffs' experts and
defendants' experts.   That is all I say on that.  It
would be an unreal world which my learned friend lives
in if that is his experience.   If it is his experience
then I bow to it and I commend it.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   My learned friend Mr. Payne did
not touch on any of the issues I raised because they
were substantially the same as Mr. King's, but I would
just add again a note of caution in the way the various
subject headings were formulated by learned friend.   It
teeters very closely on an address on the facts and
certainly could be put in a slightly different way by
other interested parties.  They may amount to the same
thing but the expression and formulation of them
depends on your standpoint initially, and it may well
be at some point we all have to sit down and work out a
formula by which legal submissions can be made to you,
sir, without actually formulating what is a disguised
address on the facts, but that is going to come,
towards the end of this Inquest there will come a point
where that question will arise.

     I would like to say that the five headings I could
certainly formulate in a slightly different way.  You
may put a slightly different emphasis on it.  I don't
intend to do it because I do not believe it is proper.




   THE CORONER:    Well I agree
     THE CORONER:   Well, I agree.  That is why I looked up,
because it is difficult to do legal submissions in a situation
like this without referring to the facts.  In fact, it is almost
impossible.  As you very rightly say, one is immediately in the
dilemma, has one traversed the barrier, and if so to what extent
and if so, does it matter.  Be that as it may, I think you have
got a good point there.

     One of the things Mr. King - before I say that, I will say
one thing to Mrs. McBrien, because I think this is a fundamental
point.   I am conscious of the time we have taken over this
Inquest.   I have become exceedingly conscious of that.   It is a
matter of great concern to me because I think we have taken in
many ways too long, and I lie in bed and think, "Where have I
made my mistake? How have I allowed itto happen?".     But be that
as it may, in a sense it is water under the bridge by now, and we
cannot easily shorten it at this stage, and we have got to finish
it having started, so to speak.   That is my first point.

     The second point is that merely because of length of time it
would be wrong to say, "What is the factor? It is time. We
won't have this witness because it is time".  So in that sense
you are quite right.  Time in itself must not be the overriding
factor.  It is a factor, because we live in a real world, but it
is not the one and only factor.  In that sense I think I can
reasonably assure you that although I consider the issue of how
long are we going to take over this, it is not a thing that in
the end, hopefully, as far as my judgment is concerned, is the
overriding factor, and if I thought that an expert would be
appropriate then I would call him, whether it be Mr. Phillips or
Mr. X or Mr. Y, is neither here nor there. Of course, you could
go on for ever, and at some point I would draw the line and say,
"We have heard enough".  My problem with Mr. Phillips or any
expert is, as I said before and originally I had intended to
call him -that was the premise on which I began - it is simply
that having listened to the evidence I have wondered in my mind
to what extent, if at all, what he was going to say would be of
such material assistance to the Jury as to require me to call
him. But because I am such a slow and perhaps cautious person I
have not finally made up my mind because I want to be reasonably
sure that I am doing the right thing before I do.

     To a certain extent, of course, and this is where I turn to
you, Mr. King, the problem of this Inquest and indeed, if you
like, Mr. Payne's argument, arises out of a comment which you
made very, very early on and which you may not even remember, but
on one occasion when I was twitched about the length of this
Inquest I looked around and said something about - I can’t
remember what I said - but your comment was, "We can’t let
anybody out of our sights at the moment", or words to that
effect.  Now, I know this is not an adversarial Court;   I know it
is inquisitorial;   I know all that;  but the fact of the matter
is that a lot of the stuff we have done has been in an
adversarial fashion.   You may say, "Popper, you have failed.  You
should never have allowed that to occur” , and time will tell wher
others look at this whether they will say this was a right
decision or not, but I took the view, because I take the view on
A                                                         92

    the whole that the Inquest performs more than just producing a
    verdict - I know that is what we are all aiming for, that we have
    got to have a verdict - but the truth of the matter is that one
    of the most important functions of the Inquest is actually to
    give the opportunity for people to express, give their evidence,
g   and for it to be examined, so that at the end of the day one can
    say, "Well, I may not like the verdict", or "I may like the
    verdict, but at least we have heard quite a bit” . That is one of
    the reasons why I have tended to call so many witnesses, because
    we could have done it in perhaps a shorter time.  I have argued
    about this with colleagues on whether I am doing it right and so
    on, and I still worry about it, but as I say, it is done.

         But, and this is a legal point, at some point or another
    when I come to address the Jury I have got to make up my mind
    whether or not I leave the verdict of unlawfully killed to the
    Jury at all - that is the first thing - and the second thing I
    have got to decide is, if I leave the unlawfully killed verdict
    to the Jury, do I as a matter of law direct them that they should
    not consider it in respect of certain parties.

         Now, that is actually not as easy as it sounds, because if I
    were, for example, to say we had parties A, B, C, D and E, so
    that we don't name anybody, and if I were to say to the Jury, "I
    direct you as a matter of law that you cannot find unlawfully
    killed against A, B and C ” , there is an inference;    it may not be
    intended but there seems to me to be an inference, that it can be
    found against D and E, and if I say it can be found against D and
    E, even if I give them all the proper directions about prima
    facie cases and goodness knows what, they may still be left with
    saying, "Well, Dr. Popper says it can be found found.      We had
    better find it", or words to that effect.     I don't know.   This
    Jury, I think, is an independently minded Jury, and I hope they
    will not be docile.  I d o n ’t want them to be docile.   I want them
    to be robust and I want them to apply their own mind, but I can
    see a certain dilemma in that course.

         On the other hand, and this is the other side of the coin,
    of course, that if we leave A, B, C, D and E or however many
    there may be, and just say to the Jury, "You can find a verdict
    of unlawfully killed if you are satisfied that the legal criteria
    have been met, and here are 5, 10, 15 people whom you could
    consider” , if they were to come back with such a verdict - if
    they were to come back;   I am not saying they will;   but if -
    then it is a blunderbuss verdict because it cannot name anybody,
    and you have got 5, 10, 15 people, however many it may be, all of
    whom can say, "Well, it isn't me.   It is him or her” , whoever it
    might be, or alternatively, all of whom may feel attacked.

         You d o n ’t agree, Mr. Isaacs?

         MR. ISAACS:   I am sorry, sir, I was only thinking to
    myself.  Surely, that is not the criteria, with respect, what any
    individual party may or may not feel at the end of i t . The
    question is what the Jury decide. Our individual concerns, our
    emotional worries are neither hear nor there.

     THE CORONER:   I quite agree.  I was merely just expressing
some thoughts of mine.  I am coming to the crux of the matter,
which I think is a legal point, and that is that in the final
analysis I have got to make up my mind whether I think it is
possible to leave the verdict or not, but we have got a ,*whole
bar of able people in front of me and it may well be that, too,
have heard the evidence, and you may come to me and say, "In our
view it is impossible for you, or at least it is unlikely and we
submit that you cannot in law - not on the facts - in law
consider this verdict against A, B, C or D.  If that were agreed
and accepted then it would in some respects make it both easier
for me and may be simpler for the Jury.  I do agree that if we do
that that we leave the others with the possibility of that
verdict being applied, assuming I take the view it is a verdict
which should be left with the Jury at all.

     I merely say this, Mr. King, because it sounded to me as
part of your submission today that you have moved from that
original point of view which you expressed, and which I am not
complaining about, to a very much more narrowed aim.  Did I
understand you correctly? I have taken an awful long time to ask
a very simple question.

     MR. KING:    Sir, I understand.  Can I answer it in the
following way.   I have to repeat again that I am not here in an
adversarial contest representing a case on behalf of a plaintiff
in a statement of claim seeking a certain end.   I have to start
in that way.   I cannot recall the exact context in which the
comment of "Keep everyone in their sights” was made, but I
suspect it was at a time when some pressure was being brought to
bear - I don't mean this again unkindly - as to whether or not
certain parties need continue to be here.   I may be wrong on
that.

     THE CORONER:   I think that is right, actually.   I think you
are right.

     MR. KING:   Sir, it could not be for me then or even now to
be put in that position of making that decision, because it is
the Inquest, and, sir, you have to say on the facts as you
believe they might turn now or now when you have heard the
evidence, as to what can be laid before the Jury.  Sir, as
regards the dilemma point about, if I can summarise, perhaps
unfairly, "I must not rule between potential parties and victims
of an unlawful killing verdict for fear of the Jury reaching a
conclusion, if I do that, that the ones I leave must therefore be
guilty at the end of such a verdict".  Sir, I would submit that
is a wrong approach.  One has to be clinical about it,
unfortunately, in your position, or any of us who were in your
position of a Tribunal, which is to say, "Is there evidence upon
which I could leave the verdict of unlawful killing in relation
to any given party to this Jury?", and without regard to what the
consequences are if one reaches the conclusion that it is against
A or A and B and not against C, D and E. That is the inevitable
consequence in any trial where there is more than one defendant,
say in a criminal trial, and you rule two out of the frame as a
matter of law and leave three to the Jury, or one or four. To
that extent, sir, I would urge upon you that is not a dilemma
which you should worry about, if I can say that.

     As regards the thrust of my submission to you today,
undoubtedly I was addressing you narrowly on the approach to an
unlawful killing verdict by reference to my learned friend’s
submission of the relevance of the expert evidence which he was
inviting you to call. In that context I have narrowed it down
and I was narrowing it down to that issue.

     Sir, I am in the difficult position, and it is going on the
shorthand note and I don't object to that, in that I cannot be
heard to say because I have no authority to be heard to say,
because it just not make sense in an Inquest to say, "I am only
seeking a verdict against one party*', because the reality may be
that that is right, and the reality of what flows from my lips in
the questions and the evidence which emerges from the questions
I ask, the reality may be that, and again I don't mean this
unkindly - the word "unkindly” falls from my lips all the time;
I don't mean it;  I may have caught it from my learned, Mr.
Catchpole's leader on a previous occasion - that I should not be
put in the position of having to nail my colours to the mast
because I am not a plaintiff in an adversarial contest.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. King, you misunderstood me.   I did not
mean that, and I don't want you to think, either you or anybody
else, that I am asking you to take the decisions which I have got
to take.  Whether I like taking them or not is another matter,
but in the end I will take them. What I was saying is I have no
doubt when the time comes people will get up, will address me on
the point of law, and no doubt will say, or may say, "In my
submission the evidence as a matter of law” , because this is the
issue of whether or not the verdict should be left with the Jury,
as I understand it, is a point of law. Again, you may correct
me.




                                   /MR. KING:   That is right.
     MR. KING:      That is right, sir.

     THE CORONER:    So that issue is clearly a point of
law.   If I use Mr. Hale simply as an example, Mr. Hale gets
up and addresses me and argues on what he believes to be
the principles on which unlawful killing verdicts can be
left with the Jury, he can then go on to say, "I have
listened to the evidence and as a matter of law I do not
think it applies to my clients". You might do it with
yours.   Everybody might do it all along the line. At the
end of the day I will have to say, having listened to the
legal points which you have raised, "I agree with him, him
and him but I do not agree with the others".

     MR. KING:   Of course, sir, at that stage I, for
example, would have the opportunity to either make a
submission contrary to the submission made, or to support
it, or to be totally neutral.  In being totally neutral,
one can be neutral in an Inquest....

     THE CORONER:      Indeed.

     MR. KING:   Where one cannot be neutral in perhaps an
adversarial situation. You are quite right when I
addressed you on the issue of Mr. Phillips and the issues
to which his expertise could be directed, I did narrow it
very clearly and deliberately, and I make no apologies for
it, to the approach on unlawful killing verdicts in a
particular way which I certainly would submit at an
appropriate time on the evidence should be left to the
Jury. Whether or not I would remain neutral or support an
application by other interested parties that theirs should
not be left to the Jury is a matter I can consider when I
hear those submissions.

     THE CORONER:      Indeed.

     MR. KING:   It may be, sir, you will be in a position,
having heard all the submissions, of finding it easier than
you may be at the moment and I do not resile from the fact
that I am concentrating in my submissions to you certainly
on an approach of an unlawful killing verdict which, I
submit, would be appropriate on the evidence at an
appropriate stage to submit but my submission has been in
the context of my learned friend's submission on Mr.
Phillips.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, I do understand.  I do want to
make it crystal clear to you, Mr. King, and indeed to
everybody, but particularly to you, that under no
circumstances do I want you to feel that I am asking you to
go beyond what you can or should do nor under any
circumstances am I asking you to take my decisions for me
or to prejudice the people who instruct you in any way
subject to the inquisitorial nature of this Inquest which
we have already clearly said, and that applies to
everybody. All I was trying to express was that if, at the
end of the day,    we come if you like to a view that    thereis
in law no way -    and I think it is ex parte Higgins    which is
the case.

     MR. KING:     Yes, sir.

     THE CORONER:    That there is no way in which a
reasonable Jury, reasonably and properly instructed, could
have brought that verdict in against parties A, B and C,
then let us say so at the time because I think Coroners
have been criticised for not listening to Counsel who have
been present and if I am going to be criticised I do not
want to be criticised for that.   I may not agree with you
but at least I want to listen to you if I can and that is
all I was trying to say but in no way do I want you, and
indeed when you have addressed me; indeed I think it was
your submission, Mr. Isaacs, if I may say so, you submitted
right at the beginning about calling your client.

     MR. ISAACS:    About not calling Mr. Duckenfield.

     THE CORONER:   That is right.   I think I seem to
remember for all practical purposes the whole of you were
against me on that.   In fact, you supported Mr. Isaacs and
yet I did not accept your submission because on balance I
thought I should not.   It does not follow that because you
all say something I will necessarily do it because I did
listen very carefully. That is all I am saying and that is
all I want.

     MR. KING:   If it is of any assistance from my
personal point of view, sir, it may well be that at the end
of the day I would have a positive submission to make in
response to any particular party who says the verdict
should not be left to the Jury from their point of view but
a neutral stance completely as opposed to other parties.

     THE CORONER:   We have tended to think that the only
conduct which can be called into question is the conduct
which goes to unlawful killing but that is not true.  In
virtually every inquest one does people's conduct is called
into question and the issue of unlawful killing never
arises. There is nothing wrong with calling people's
conduct into question. What has to be done is to decide
whether the evidence would support that particular verdict
in respect of that person and if he answers yes, well then
you leave it to the jury and they make up their minds
whether they are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt and all
the usual things but if you decide it is not that does not
necessarily mean that the conduct of parties may not be
relevant to people in respect of whom you have left a
particular verdict with the jury. So I am fully aware of
that. Just because we say, "The case for unlawful killing
has not been made out" does not necessarily mean that the
person has been negligent, for instance, just to use that
as an example.
     MR. KING:   If I can just come full circle, sir, I
made my submission to you in the specific context of a
specific potential expert witness with specific reference
to the specific application and I say no more.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Payne, I know you wish to come in.

     MR. PAYNE: Sir, may I say something further in the
context of the general discussion which you are kindly
permitting to continue on the question of order of
speeches, when it comes to submissions?

     THE CORONER:   Yes, I see your point.

     MR. PAYNE: I say this because Mr. King more than once
recently, over the last few moments, has said that he will
listen to submissions and then he will choose which ones he
opposes and which ones he does not or words to that effect.
This is certainly something which does need careful thought
because as I said in my original submission, on which you
are about to rule, in this Inquest there is, of course, no
pleadings, no indictment and so on, and it is also quite
clear from the way in which the discussion has gone this
afternoon that there are plenty of candidates and plenty of
topics which can be alighted upon to qualify as subjects
where conduct is called into question or negligence or
gross negligence or unlawful killing.  I mean one can pick
on all sorts of different things.

     At the moment, since there is no charge sheet, I do
not know, when I come to make my submissions I do not know
exactly what I am having to answer and the same goes for
each of the other parties.  It certainly would not be
appropriate, in my submission, for one to be put into the
position of having to make a submission and then for it to
be countered, as it were, by the 'Prosecution'.

     I have got slightly lost on this and I want to just
start again.  If this were a criminal trial then it would
have started off with an indictment and an opening speech
for the Crown and so that one would know exactly what it is
who is being charged with doing what. Then at the end of
the Prosecution case if there were no sufficient evidence
upon which a jury, properly directed, could reach a verdict
of guilty, it would then at that stage be for the Defence
to submit that the case ought not to be left to the jury
and the Crown would then have a reply on the law.
     However, that is not the procedure which is followed
here and so the nearest one can get to an indictment or a
charge sheet, one supposes, would have to be a submission
if there was going to be one that a vterdict of unlawful
killing should be left to the Jury ini respect of some
particular candidate doing something in particular.    In
other words, the speech would have to qualify as the
indictment or charge sheet.  If that is the proper analysis
then someone would have to make that speech before the
rival submission would be made - in this case if it were
being made on behalf of the Chief Constable by me - that
the evidence is not sufficient to allow that verdict to be
left. So that is an argument in favour of order of
speeches. Anyone who wants to say that a verdict should be
left of unlawful killing by anyone then they should make
the speech first and it should be countered by anyone who
says to the contrary and not vice versa otherwise it is
putting those who are making the submission it should not
be left in the position of having to answer a charge which
has not been made.

     MR. ISAACS:   May I just add my observations for what
it is worth on the matter that has just been raised by my
learned friend, Mr. Payne, because it was a matter that was
concerning me having regard to what has happened this
afternoon and what has happened on other occasions?

     THE CORONER:   Yes, Mr. Isaacs.

     MR. ISAACS:    We are all thankful for the way that you
have indulged u s . We are not used to i t . Whether it be in
the criminal Courts or whether it be in the Queen's Bench
Division, when we make a submission it may be answered by
our opponent and then we have a right of reply - finished.
We do not have the indulgence to make a submission to hear
the answer to have a right of reply to it going on to
rejoinder, counter rejoinder and the like. What happens,
of course, if we get the indulgence that you have given us
is that it goes on and on and on because I hope, with no
disrespect to my learned friends, in fact far from it,
giving them the respect they deserve, they are all
experienced and intelligent advocates.

      If my learned friend,   Mr. Payne, says something Ican
be assured that my learned friend, Mr. King, will find
something to say about it and when my learned friend, Mr.
King, has said something about it then my learned friend,
Mr. Catchpole, will say something about it or my learned
friend, Mr. Payne, will come back.   It cannot go onlike
that, sir. We must be kept    under some sort of rein and to
take up the point made by Mr. Payne, whichever way it is
decided, and we can have a debate as to how it should take
place, that that submission should be made, we must keep to
that particular way of doing it and you cannot allow us to
go on and on and on each taking up the points made by the
other. Otherwise the next four or five weeks is going to
     into nine, ten or eleven because it can go on ad
infinitum and I say what I am saying as a way of warning
you, sir, that you must think very carefully about the way
in which you want us    make these submissions.
    When it comes to the time that we make submissions on
the law, and to take a point that was made earlier, of
course, because we mention the facts and we refer to the
facts does not mean it is an address on the facts because
so often you have to refer to the facts in order to make a
submission on the law.  It is something that you mentioned
only a short time ago and one does not mean you are
transgressing the line, when you mention the facts, of an
address on them.  It is quite a different matter to say to
you, sir, as between these witnesses you should prefer A to
B for these reasons from saying, as to these witnesses,
whatever they have said, what they have said does not
amount in law to an allegation, or sufficient to leave an
allegation, of unlawful killing.

      If we come to make those submissions it has to be done
on the basis, in my submission, that for example Mr. Hale
says, "In respect of my client I say X, Y and 2 ".  Mr.
payne will say, "In respect of my client I say X, Y and Z",
whichever order we take it in. I say it, Mr. Manning, Mr.
King, and that is it. To have a system where Mr. Payne
says on behalf of those whom he represents, "A, B and C"
and then it goes down the line, everybody chipping in as to
whether he is right or he is wrong, and thinking about it
in terms of every person who is represented, it will be - I
do not want to say Bedlam because it will not be Bedlam,
because this Court has not been Bedlam - almost Bedlam and
very difficult for you, sir, to make head or tail o f . That
is a matter of obvious concern to us when you come finally
to do what is going to be a very important job (a) to
decide on the submissions that are made to you and (b),
more difficult, to decide on how properly to direct the
Jury.

      Having said what I have said, I do not want to be held
to what I have said as being the way in which it should be
done.   I think it will be a matter which will require
careful thought. What I am attempting to do is raise the
exclamation mark now in your mind and everybody else's
mind. We cannot go on in the way you have allowed us to go
on when it comes to the sort of submissions that have yet
to be made.

     THE CORONER:   Does anybody want to come in on that?

     MR. KING:   I think we should all protect ourselves
from the little criticism of my learned friend because the
latest interchange only arose through your very proper
response to me, initiated by your goodself and I make no
complaint, about how you might need help and you would
welcome help about the verdicts being left to the Jury.  I
responded to it, sir. My position if I can just help on
how it should be approached you, sir, make the decision as
to which verdicts should go to the Jury.




                               /In so far as you decide.
                                                                  100




Insofar as you decide a verdict should go to a Jury you
may want to hear submissions of those who would say to the
contrary.

          Certainly I do not regard myself, which I think
was the inference of what my learned friend Mr. Payne was
saying, in the position of a prosecutor, believe or n o t ,
who has to lay open the charges and say what you ought to
do, sir.  It i s , in my submission, entirely proper for
someone in my position as representing the victims of the
disaster, those who died, to discover what submission is
being made as to which verdict' should not be left to the
Jury, in order to respond if I thought proper, not in the
capacity of a p r o s e c u t o r , but in the capacity of being at
an Inquest representing those who were in the position of
being the victims of the very deaths which we are
investigating.

            Sir, I say no more than that.  I think my learned
friend M r . Isaacs is perhaps worrying unduly.        In f a c t ,
all that happened today was we had had Mr. Payne two days
a g o , I responded and, as far as I understand i t , M r . Payne
very properly responded to me and I think Mr. Catchpole
said something and I think I said two s e n t e n c e s , but it
was very s h o r t .

         THE C O R O N E R : It is true that I raised the issue
because I picked up a point which you had made and which I
thought was interesting, which I wanted to explore with
you.  I feel it is a difficult situation because my whole
policy has been, as I say, to allow people to have free
say.  Do not get up, Mr. Isaacs.

         MR. ISAACS:      All I was saying was we have got to
have some structure.

           THE CORONER:  I think you are right.    Mr. P a y n e ,
you were saying you wanted me to rule on t h i s , but I am
n o t . I am going to go away and think about i t . I am going
to make up my mind and then I will tell you what I think,
and I do not think there is any need for me to say any
more than that at this stage.

             I will say something else, even at the risk of
raising a new t o p i c . One of the points which I have
already addressed my mind to, and on which I have done
some preparatory work in connection with my directions to
the Jury, is that I have gone through the evidence to try
and s o r t , if I can put it like t h a t , in groups the entries
into the stadium of the deceased, because I find that a
very interesting topic and I think it is a relevant
consideration.      I do not think it is giving e v i d e n c e , if I
can put it like t h a t , because it is a summing up of what
has already been told to the Jury and I am merely
collecting it and saying, "You will remember this, and if
you look at it you get X, Y and Z" .

         The schedule is being typed for me so that I can
see it, but one of the things which I do have in mind, and
I mention it now, is that it raises some very interesting
statistical questions which I cannot answer because I am
not a statistician but I have it in mind, in fact, to
allow a statistician to have a look at these figures, if I
can use that word, to see whether or not there is any
statistical relevance in the times of the entries, and the
ages and the sexes and, indeed, the alcohol.  If he comes
back with an answer, "Yes there is", then I may well
decide to call him as an expert.

         The reason why I raise it is because I am
conscious of the fact that you might take the view, "Well,
hang on one minute, if you have prepared this for your
summing up, are you not, in fact, giving evidence to your
own Inquest?"  I could see somebody taking that point of
view.  My work has been purely to the best of my ability
to summarise the evidence.

         First of all, I would be interested to hear
whether you think that is a valid consideration from the
point of view of law, and the second thing is I do not
intend to submit my direction to the Jury to you for
vetting in any sense of the word, but this is, in fact, a
factual exercise, and if it would assist Counsel to look
through the schedules, not the opinion of the statistician
if I take it and use it but simply to see whether you can
see any obvious errors in it, then I would be quite happy
to do that if you think that that would be helpful but it
is not an easy task.  It is quite a hard job to check it
through.  Any comments?

         MR. HALE: Just to say, sir, that of course you
are aware that that has been in the minds of some of us
anyway as being a relevant issue, and not new evidence,
sir. Largely it is already in the evidence.

         THE CORONER:  It is all there.   It is just a
matter of collecting it.

         MR. HALE: Therefore, someone has to do it and I
respectfully say it would be better for your Officer to do
it than for someone here to do it.

         THE CORONER:  We have done that already. I did
it.  It has been checked and re-checked and, as best as we
can, it is right.  On the other hand, the difficulty is
that if on the day I say that 15 people entered, say as an
example, through Gate C, you might say, "Well, who are
these 15 people and what about X, Y and Z whom we know
whom you have forgotten?" It is a bit late to do it when
I am in the middle of my summing up, and that is all I am
saying. This is simply tendered to assist you so that you
feel that one factual aspect at least is right which I
leave with the Jury. Mr. Payne was going to rise and then
I will look at you, Mr. King.

         MR. PAYNE: Sir, in answer to your question, we
certainly do submit that such an examination of evidence
which has already been given, and an analysis to make
sense of what is a very large body of undigestible
evidence would be of great assistance to the Jury. So
with a view to assisting in this matter we have, in fact,
embarked and now completed one analysis of that aspect of
the evidence ourselves.

         We wonder whether, in fact, it might be helpful
to your statistician and yourself if we were to let you
have the results of what we have done for your
consideration and for the consideration of your
statistician in order to decide whether and how that
evidence could best be presented. We are in a position,
in fact, to let you have that now. It has, as you say,
been a very substantial exercise and we hope that it might
be helpful.  It does not involve doing anything other than
make sense of the evidence which has already been given.

         THE CORONER: Obviously I would like to see it,
but I think it would only be fair if it were handed to all
the representatives so that they can see it.

            MR. PAYNE:     I entirely agree.

         THE CORONER: Because whilst I have no doubt
whatever that your instructing solicitors, and whoever did
the job, did their very best --

         MR. PAYNE: It would be very beneficial if it
were to be checked, and that is why I am mentioning it now
in open Court, so that it is known exactly what we intend
to do. I entirely agree it would be a good idea.

            THE CORONER:    What do you think, Mr. King?

         MR. KING: I do not understand yet what my
learned friend's summary is directed to.

            THE CORONER:    I have not seen it, so I cannot
help you.

         MR. KING:       Is it to do with times of entry into
the ground?
         THE CORONER:  I presume it is something to do
with what I was talking about.

         MR. PAYNE:  It is.  On the topic that you raised,
the analysis which we have done has looked at the
blood/alcohol analysis which is already in evidence and it
has divided it up into the categories of those who entered
the ground after 20 minutes to 3 and before 20 minutes to
3, to see whether any useful conclusions can be drawn
about the blood/alcohol content of people who were
entering the ground before and after that particular time,
and we think that it does produce some quite helpful
evidence.

          THE CORONER:   I have divided mine into six
groups.

         MR. CATCHPOLE:   I have a suspicion that the
schedule prepared by my learned friend Mr. Hale, which I
have seen, and the one prepared by Mr. Payne, which I have
not seen, may have some basis on a schedule which I
prepared at an earlier stage which simply sets out times
of entry and mode of entry, based on the evidence given at
the Preliminary Inquests.   The only note of caution which
I would add in, which I know that Mr. Hale would like to,
is that the times of entry given at the Preliminary
Inquests may have changed from the evidence that has been
given here, only slightly.   I know of at least one case.
I am sure that has been picked up, but it may be helpful
once such a schedule goes in if the schedule I have
prepared goes in so that people can double-check the times
that you have got.

         I only rise on a subsidiary point.  I did
prepare, and I am sure you prepared, another schedule
which simply shows the times at which people were shown to
be either alive or dead on the consolidated body plan that
was produced.  It is again a simple form, listing people
by reference to the body number, and then alive, dead,
times and any other references that may be in the plans,
and I am quite prepared to hand that over if that would be
of any assistance in trying to simplify what is
essentially a quite complex piece of evidence.

         THE CORONER:  I have not done that particularly,
so I will probably find that useful, but I think the
principle is that we share it.  If we do, then everybody
has got to see it.  Mr. King, you are shaking your head.

         MR. KING:  I am in the position where I want to
think through the implications of what has been said.   It
may be entirely proper and right that it be done in the
way described.  Again a nagging doubt, only sitting here
thinking, is the prohibition on all of us to address you
on the facts, sir.



         MR. KING:         I know it is n o t , but say it were a
summary of the witnesses as to the state of individual
fans coming into the ground, and what-have-you.            That
would be addressing you on the facts and there is a narrow
dividing line between addressing you on the facts and
producing a s c h e d u l e .

         THE C O R O N E R : Mr. Payne, may I make this
suggestion.  Before you give anything to me at a l l , we
will photocopy it for you if you have not got sufficient
copies, and let the Bar look at i t .

          MR. PAYNE:   Certainly.

         THE C O R O N E R : Then we can come back. As I say, I
wanted to do this (a) because I was interested in i t , (b)
because I thought it was necessary for the Jury and (c)
because I thought I had to do it when I came to do my
summing up.

            Having done it, as I say I am not a statistician.
I could not give the evidence even if I were because I am
sitting up here and it would be quite wrong for me to say
to the Jury, "This is what is shown in the I n q u e s t , here
is a l i s t , and now I am going to tell you what the
statistical significance of that i s " . We need a witness
for that if it is relevant to what we are considering.

         I think the first thing to do is for the people
opposite me to look at what we have got, and if the answer
is "Yes, that seems all r i g h t " , then I am quite happy to
let the statistician look at it, because that is really
what you are saying.  He might find it useful in doing his
sums.

                 MR. P A Y N E : What we had in mind was if this
information were given to the statistician before he gave
e v i d e n c e , then when he gave evidence he would be in a
position to answer questions about i t , rather than be
taken by surprise.

         THE CORONER:  There is no point in giving it to
him on the day because statistical analysis cannot be done
in the head.

         MR. P A Y N E : Quite. May I say, sir, accepting
your kind invitation for photocopying, that perhaps we may
give to your Officer our draft, so that it can then be
circulated for examination.
         THE CORONER:  If I could go back to ray original
question, I take it from what you have said nobody is
going to take a point and say, "Hang on the statistician
should never have looked at anything which you yourself
have extracted from the evidence”? Good, I am relieved.
If you do decide you want to see what I have done on that,
as I say it should be typed today or tomorrow and if you
do want to see it, or some of you want to see it, I am
quite happy for you to have a look at it. Bits of it are
things like who certified the death, and so on, which have
got nothing whatever to do with the statistician, but
stuff that I need when I come to doing my summary if I
think it appropriate.




                               /MRS. McBRIEN:
      MRS. McBRIEN:   Sir, I think Mr. Catcnpole
mentioned the positions of the deceased.   I have
identified John on a number of photographs and he is
not in the same position that is put on the plans.   I
did want to bring this to your attention.   He is to the
right and on the plan he is marked, number 68, to the
left.   I have checked this very carefully and it is
absolutely correct, what I am saying.

      THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, the plans, as you may
remember, were prepared by Inspector Layton and various
other people and they were all prepared on the basis of
photographic identifications by witnesses.   In your
case I would have to look it up, I can't remember the
particular evidence, but somebody identified John and
that is where the spot was put.   If you say that is a
mis-identification, which it may have been, then we
will arrange for somebody to go through that with you,
and if need be we will produce a revised plan.   I don't
intend to put the photographs in because the whole
principle on which I proceeded at the interim Inquest
was that we were not going to use the photographs, for
     kinds of reasons which I am not going to repeat
now.   We wanted to use the plans and that is why we
used those little blue dots, if you remember, blue ones
and red ones I think we used.

     If you are saying that the plan is wrong then the
plan is wrong presumably because the identifier - I
don t know who that was, it could have been you, it
could have been your husband.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   No, it was myself.     I made a
positive identification.

     THE CORONER:   You presumably pointed at that time
to a different location?

       MRS. M c B R I E N :   No.

     THE CORONER:   Well in that case we will get
somebody to look at the plan with you.  I have got no
objection to putting another spot on the plan if the
plan is wrong.  There is no difficulty about that.   We
will arrange for somebody to see you on that and make
sure that we get our plans right, okay?

       MRS. McBRIEN:   Yes.  Although I identified John
on a   number of photographs, only one was ....

     THE CORONER:   Yes, well we are not going to have
hundreds of dots because it doesn't really matter, Mrs.
McBrien.  What we want is either, as far as the plan is
concerned, we want the last timed photograph on which
he was seen, if he was seen, alive.   It does not matter
if he was seen in 50 other photographs in different
locations.   It is neither here nor there as far as the
Inquest was concerned.   I know it is very important for
you but ....

     MRS. McBRIEN:   Yes,   it is to me definitely.

     THE CORONER:   But it is not, with great respect,
of any relevance whatsoever to the Jury.  It is not
going to alter their verdict one iota as to whether or
not he was seen in 50 different locations in the pen.
What they want to know is was he alive in pen 3 or pen
4, whichever pen it was, and where was he, and even
that is not terribly important but I think it is so
important for the families that I felt it was right
that we should do it.

     We certainly don't need an innumerable number of
plans or photographs identifying individual persons.
We would never dream of doing it in any other situation
and I am not going to do it now.  We have gone far,
     fsr beyond what I would normally do in an inquest
and I am not going any further, but if you say it is
wrong ....

     MRS. McBRIEN:   It is.

     THE CORONER:   We altered another one - do you
remember Mr. Jones?  There was a dispute, not with
regard to location but with regard to time.  We re-did
it, we re-interviewed him, he said, "I don't think I
got that identification right", Sergeant Killoch came
along, made a supplemental statement and we corrected
it.  I am very happy to do that for John as well but
what I am not happy to do is to produce 20 plans
showing 20 little dots, or 50 or however many it might
be.

     MRS. McBRIEN:    The identification that I made was
correct.   This is how Mr. Grey was brought to give his
evidence, because of the fact I made this positive
identification, but I- didn't at that time have these
plans.   I have only had the plans since we have been
sitting here.

     THE CORONER:   We will get somebody to see you
about that and we will put another spot on the correct
place, and then we will introduce that plan, okay?

     MRS. McBRIEN:   Yes.     There are two different
times as well.
     THE CORONER:   I have already told you that I am
prepared to accept the latest time but no other time.

     MRS. McBRIEN:      It is 3.04 actually.   Most of them
sre 3.02, I think.     It is 3.03 on here.

     THE CORONER:      I don't want to argue it with you
now, Mrs. McBrien.     We will get one of our Officers to
see you about that.

     MR. RUSSELL:   Perhaps I can assist.  I have spent
sometime studying the photographs and if Mrs. McBrien
was to point out to me where the.discrepancy might lie
it might either be able to support her, or to explain
how a position represented in the photograph can appear
in the relevant position in the plan.

     THE CORONER:   If you can do that and if you can
persuade me that we should have two plans, I will even
give in on that but, as I say, in the end we have got
400 exhibits already.  Just imagine if we were to
exhibit every single position of every single person on
that field, we would have thousands of exhibits and
what would it add?  Absolutely nothing.  That is where
your point comes in, I have got to be firm!

     MR. KING:      Sir, can I give you the reference for
Mr. Hicks?

     THE CORONER:     Yes, please.

     MR. KING:   It is Day 31, page 50B - if you look
around that position both back and forward, you will
find it.

     THE CORONER:   Okay, and we will arrange for a
convenient time when he is here so that we don't have
to bring him especially.  If you will let me know, or
let my Officers know, we will fit him in whenever it is
convenient.

     Mr. Payne,   I will take a decision on this.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Sir, one last point - who do you
intend to call tomorrow, please?

     THE CORONER:   We want to take Sergeant Morgan
tomorrow, hopefully not at great length; Mr. Doyle, who
we heard today; Mr. Brandwood - I think he is the
linesman and if you remember the Jury wanted him; then
ex-Sergeant Higgins; then if we can, Mr. P. Eason - he
is an ambulanceman; and right at the end Inspector
Bullas, and Inspector Bullas I want for a limited
purpose only, not to go through the whole gamut of

     Dear Sire,

                                    Re;   Ground Safety

           Following the tragic events at Sheffield Wednesday F, C, last
     Saturday, you are instructed to undertake, in conjunction with ,
     your Local Licensing Authority, an immediate review o £ ground
     safety.    This should include the perimeter fencing installed, the
     agreed capacity levels of all standing areas and the routes to and
     from the ground.

          A report should than be forwarded to The Football
     Association, stating any immediate action taken to implement
     changes and any longer term measures that you have initiated.
     You should also advise us if no changes have been found neceasstry.

                                    Youre faithfully,




                                     Chief Executive

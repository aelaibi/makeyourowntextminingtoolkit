            s t retcher      but   I did help a P o l i c e w o m a n          to help a young              lad who was

            very upset        off the     pitch.       We wa l k e d him up to the far end of the

            g round by the S p i o n Hop,          there was a first aid                       point    there.     I saw

            quite a few bodies            there    lying on the floor.



            I then went        back    down by the        pens and started to                     clear away the boards

            that were        lying about.         I then       left     the      pitch at about             1625 hours.



            Whe n    the match was       stopped,        I think        that      there        seemed to be a lack            of

            direction        to where     the fans were             s u p p o s e d to stand         inserts     three and

            four.         I saw that    the    pens    either        side were           r elatively empty.            There
C/VT"                                                                                         *
    1       was a lack of          communication,,        the Police            d i d n* t / k n o w what was h a ppening



             hen     * informed a Po l i c e S e r geant             who was          standing       next   to me on the

            pitch about a           little    b o y , he s h r ugged and               said,      "What can I d o ".

            S ome o n e   opened the gate         onto    the       pitch and          let     people    out.



            1' did    not see       anything     I consider           to be a criminal                offence.     I

            c er t a i n l y did     not see any       looting        of the bodies.



 •          I think         that a factor      in the      deaths and             injuries          caused was    the number

            of fans         that were a l l o w e d    to go        into    the       two    centre     pens.    Also the

            f ences were a c o n t r ibuting           factor,        there are             not   enough gates         in them

            and     the     ones that are      there are        not wide              enough.



            I think         that the tunne 1 should be                po 1 i c /f d    by S t e w a r d s and Police

            Officers       so that w h e n     pens    three and four are                    full    fans   can be

            d i r e c t e d around    to the    outer     pens.         T p     fences         should be taken down or

            something       safer     erected.        T here    shoj/ld be more Police                   on the

            terraces.                                           \

                                                                                                          S3121



             There    should be more           e x p e r i e n c e d medical   staff at matches.      There

             sh o u l d have    been a n n o u n c e m e n t s   earlier   to get    rid of Notts   Forest      fan

             to make        it easier to move about and be                 less    frustrating.



             I also     think    that L i verpool          should have         been given the other    end of

             the    ground.

              I am a Police Constable       in the South Yorkshire Police                      currently

              s tat i oned at Dalton.

              On Saturday the 15th of April        1989 (150489)              I was on duty at the

              Sheffield Wednesday football        ground at Hillsborough,,                   for the football

              ma tc h between Nottin gh am Forest        and         Liverpool.

              My duties at this event were to            patrol the H e r r i esR d a r e a , as            part of

              the serial    number fifty seven.

              At ^3j. 06 pm (1506^ hr s ) this same      day         as       a result ofamessage received

              I immediately attended       inside the ground at the Leppings Ln end where

              the Liverpool     supporters were situated.                  On attendance        I saw large

              groups of Liverpool       supporters on the pitch,               some of whom were            injured,

              I then attended at the first aid room where                     I collected a stretcher

              and returned to the Leppings Ln end where                     I was assisted        in
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    S795

stretchering off an injured             fan,      I then again returned to the

L eppings Ln end where         I was    again assisted       in stretchering   off an

injured fan.

Once again I returned to the Leppings Ln end where                      I assisted other

officers     in attempts to revive fans.

At 3.30      pm (1530 h r s ) this same day I saw a man who I now know to be

Carl William RIMMER       lying at the rear of the goal area at the Leppings

Ln end.      In company with a fire officer               I attended to the man but our

efforts to revive him f a iled and I placed my anorak over him.

I was then assisted          in placing the body onto a makeshift stretcher and

carried the body to the gymnasium.

At 3.52 pm (1552 h r s ) this same day life was                 pronounced extinct by Dr
  _____
TIMNEY.

At 3.55     pm (1555 h r s ) this       same day the following articles were

removed from the b o d y :

1.   One yellow metal         neck     chain with one y e 11ow metal ring       attached.

2.   One yellow metal         sovereign ring (removed from the centre finger of

     the right h a n d ) .

3.   One yellow metal         ring   (removed from the         centre finger of the left

     h a n d ).

4.   One   ’A v i a ’ wrist watch.

5.   One y e 11ow metal      bracelet.

6.   Fifteen pounds     in cash.

All of these articles were placed in a bag and left with the body

until   its arrival at        the m o r t u a r y .   At 12.20 am (0020 h r s ) on the

morning of Sunday the          16th of April          1989   (160589)

                                                     /ovSo'A
was formerly identifed by his brother Kevin Edward RIMMER.

At   12.40 am     (0040 h r s ) this same day I accompanied the body of RIMMER

to the Medical Legal Center at Sheffield.

At 1.30 pm (1330 h r s ) the same day after              certain procedures     I left     the

         body and   returned to Hillsborough.

            I am a Police Constable             in the South Yorkshire Police,         currently

            stationed at Rawmarsh Police Station.

           At 8.00am on Saturday the              15th of April      1 9 8 9 , I commenced duty at

           R a wma rs h Police Station,          I was then conveyed to the Hillsborough

            football         ground at Sheffield where after the briefing             I took up duties

            on Herries Road outside the Five Arches                  public: house.

           At 3.06pm on this same day due to a radio message                    received I attended

            inside the ground at the Leppings Lane end.                    On attending this side of

            the ground I found large groups of Liverpool                   supporters on the pitch

            some of whom appeared to be injured.

            In company with another officer             I attended at the First Aid room where

            I collected a stretcher,             I then returned to the Leppings Lane end of

           the ground where              I was assisted in stretchering off an injured

             I was assisted in removing an injured s u p p o r t e r to the First Aid r o o m .

            Upon returning to the L eppings Lane end of the ground I assisted other

             officers      in attempts to revive fans.

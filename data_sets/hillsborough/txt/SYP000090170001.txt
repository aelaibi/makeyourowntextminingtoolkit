               On Saturday 15 April            1989 <150489),       I went to the FA Cup Semi Final

               between Liveroool and Notts Forest at Hillsborough.

               I am a Liverpool            supporter.     I did not travel to the game in an

               organised party,            I got my ticket from a friend who is a season

               ticket holder.             I had a ^ 6   standi      t i ck-Pt. fnr thp Leiapings Lane.

               I travelled to the game wit                          anc                    We travelled

               to Sheffield by car

                by road works and heavy trarfic.     We arrived at Sheffield at about 14,

               20 hrs     (1420) we parked on the car park of a big store and walked to

               the ground.

               On the way to the ground we passed some police officers but not many.

               We did not witness any drunkeness or disorder on the way to the
                                                                                      PAGE      2

grouna.

I arxived at the ground at about 14.30 hrs there were no queues just a

mass of (Supple.     We stayed at the back out of the crush because we

were waiting to meet some other friends.                WeN^alked up to the shops

a nd back a g a i n . \ After about   15 minutes a P o l i c e V a n d r o v e r   came down

Leppings Lane to th^ crowd.           Over the PA Systers^they were asking

people to move back ^aX^peopie aT\the front were getting crushed.                         The
    x   ~      ' m o o MTV)       -
police^ put some horses ac\oss the road outside the outer gates to ease

the congestion.      The people near to the turnstiles suddenly went

and they then started to let people th                      towards the turnstiles

again.   While 1 w a V in the road waiting I hafd seen people climbing
         Po^- © ( S          ,
over the    1 Is to getN^jn.   There was a Policeman on top of the wall

helping thenNyLn.

As we went towards the turnstiles there were no organised queues

because the horses were only letting a few people through at a time.

I went through the turnstiles handed my ticket in.                     There were no

Police by the turnstiles they were all by the horses.                       There were no

stewards by the turnstiles.           I did not see any of the gates open other

than the turnstiles.

Once through the turnstiles there were no stewards or Police Officers

about.    All we could see was the tunnel and I presumed that was the

only way toNjo,

Uie went down thV-Hunnsl there were other people walking down but it

was not crushed.      When we got to the end of the tunnel                  it was just

chock a block we turned to the^>4^ght and went along the back wall to a

position about half way across          pen 3\and about 2 or 3 people between

us and the back wall.

We would have got into the pen aboiits^a^minute before BEARDSLEY hit the

bar.     When I was^^flxst into the pen it was quite packed and I was a bit

squashed but I was not worried.            People up above in the stand were

                shouting down for people to go back out of the tunnel because people

                at the front were getting crushed.       I heard someone shout that someone

                was dead.

                At the time^B^ARDsbSiY hit the bar there was a surge forward and I was
                               \                                                  -
 H m 5          pushed across abchii 6 feet.  At this time all three of us were

                together.

                There were people coming from the front and were being helped up into

                the stand \above.   They were saying that people at the front were being

                crushed.    We helped people up to the stand.       We helped about   10 people

                up.
                              \
                We saw a lad on the floor on his hands and knees.         We picked him up.

 An3            His face had a glased expression on it and he was not breathing very

                well.

                police in the stand above trying to stop people getting         into the stand

                                                                                    S3443

           floor.    One of the people      I saw lying on the floor was the blond

           person.     We had helped in the pen.      He was lying on the floor and as

           far as I was concerned he was blue not moving and he was dead.

           There was no one with him.         There were Police Officers about.     We saw

           some people in the yard we knew and then we left the ground at about

           13.45.    There were ^bout 2 or 3 ambulances outside the ground.

           I was not injured.       I diH^not see anything that X would consider was a

           criminal offence.

           I think that the Police were slow to react to the situation.           It

           seemed to be a long time before the first ambulance arrived on the

           pitch.
cJPh       I can understand why the police officers were put across the pitch

     8£-   initially but I think that some if not all should have been re deployed

CCMMSfsTiS down to the Leppings Lane end.
 KQ,
          .1 did not see any police officers giving mouth to mouth.

           I think that the Liverpool supporters should have been given the

           larger Kop end of the ground.

           I saw more P o 1 i ce^<ff i ce r s away from the ground as we were driving in,

           than I did by the g roih^d.       There were not enough mounted Police

           Officers.    Therbv should have been Police Officers on duty at the

           entrance to the t u n n e l .   There should not be side fencing dividing the

           Leppings Lane up into pens.

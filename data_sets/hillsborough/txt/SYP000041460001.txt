       Hillsborough Inquiry - Civil Litigation

       _____________ has asked me to acknowledge receipt of your memorandum of the
       12th October and as we see it, the situation is that you are undertaking all
       your enquiries on behalf of another agency. Therefore any request for
       statements and other material you are gathering in the course of those enquiries
       should be referred to those instructing you.   I appreciate that that may
       cause some confusion as the same information may be collected for several
       parties, but that is perhaps a dilemma for those who want the information,
       rather than you.

       To illustrate the point I am making, it seems to me totally inappropriate for
       you to agree or otherwise to give a third party information which you are
       collecting for the Prosecution Service in respect of criminal matters, and
       any request for information should be referred to that Service. Similarly
       any request for information relating to disciplinary matters should be referred
       to  the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire or the Police Complaints Authority.
       If  there are any difficulties because two parties instructing you both "possess"
       the information, then the person requesting the information should be referred
       to both of them.

       I hope this will enable you at least to avoid any difficulties.

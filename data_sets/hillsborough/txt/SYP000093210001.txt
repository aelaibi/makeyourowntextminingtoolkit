o b viously been drinking            heavily but,          due to the few numbers            of

ourselves,       man y were a l lo we d on the buses.                A few who were         diso rd er ly

were arrested.



A fter    the arrival      of the     last train,          the serial       boarded a transit         van

to   commence a public            order    patrol    in the    city c         re



About 3 pm       (1500),    we werje directed,             by West Bar Control,            to at te nd at

H il l s b o r o u g h Football    yound     where    it was    unde rs to od that         there was

crowd trouble at the Z ep pi ng s Lane                end.



At 3.10     pm   (1510),    we a r ri v ed at the Pen is to ne Ra                  'fid of the ground

We were     then d ir ec te d to stand at the               top of the             < at   the Spion Kop

end.



After a couple        of minutes,          we all walked       onto the       track and stood

facing     the   crowd at the N o r th Stand.              They were o bv i ou s ly d istressed

and were     pointing      towards        the Leppings Lane          end.     Several      shouted,

"Murderers," at us,           although,          at this    point,    I was    still      unsure about

what was happening.               Looking    towards Leppings Lane             end    I could see

lots of a c t i v it y on the terraces and supporters a pp ea r ed                        to be

spilling     onto    the   pitch.         Lots    of people a pp eared        to be mill in g about.
                                                                                           PAGE            3

As we a pp r oa c he d that    end    I was     still wit;,        2286 B EVIS -and it became

clear    that many    people were         injured          man was      thrown towards      us and

he seemed not to be
                 he breathing,                  PC
                                                P C jjH-VIS a t t e m pt e d a rtificial

,res pi ration a nd I tried to a s s i s t / b ut, after a couple             of minutes,         I

realised he was dead.           S om eb od y    came over and a n no un ce d he was         dead b y

feeling    for a pulse      in hisvTieck.         He was      then taken awa y on an

advertising       board whi ch /w as      used as a make        shift    stretcher



Events    became    quite   blurred after         this,       I can remember man y officers

giving artificial        respir a t i on but      there were      so many    people about         it

was   impossible     to he Ip anyb od y        else.



We were    then    instructed    to form a cordon along              the   centre    line of the

pitch w hich we      did.     I d o n ’t remember       how    long we stood there         but,

after a while,       the stadium emptied and              1 then spent      some time walking

a ro u n d the   pitch whilst    supporters         came up and a sked       for details      of

casualties,       lost friends,       etc.     These were all told to       congregate        in       a

small    corner whilst an       Inspector a d v i s e d       JLhem what to ao.



I then found my way outside                                    and w al k ed back to West Bar,

I went    up to the gym for          de                       went off duty about 7 .30 pm

(1930).

                  the superv is io n of Football                 supporters arriv in g       by train.

                  As far as         I recall      the m aj or it y were well         behaved and the        few who

                     As the time            for kick off          became nearer more                 fans a pp ea r ed who         had

                     o bviously been drinking                  heavily,        but    due to the few numbers                     of police

                     officers many were allo we d on the                         buses.       A few who were               disor derly

                     were arrested.

                     At about 3.0 0           pm <1500)        our serial          was directed             by West Bar          control      to

                     At about 3.10            pm    <1310)     we arri v ed at the P enistone Road end of the

                     After a couple of minutes we all wa l k e d onto                                 the track and stood

                     facing the         crowd at         the N orth Stand,             They were obv io us ly d is tressed

                     and were         pointing         towards     the Leppings Lane end.                    Several        shouted

                     ’mu r d e r e r s at us,          a l t h ou g h at this      point     I was still               unsure about what

                     was     happening.

                     Looking        towards L ep pi ng s Lane end                I could see           lots of a ct iv i ty         on the

                     terraces and supporters a pp ea re d to be spilling                                    onto the       pitch.        Lots

                     of people a p p e a r ed           to be m illing about.

                     As we a p p r o a ch e d that          end    I was still with PC 8EVIS and                          it became

                     clear that many               people were        injured.         A man was thrown towards                     us and

                     he seemed not to be breathing.

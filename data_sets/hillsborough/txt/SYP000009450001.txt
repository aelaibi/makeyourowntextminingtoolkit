on them.       I a s si st ed     in carrying one of these                stretchers.

I,    along wit h PC B ooth a t te mp te d to            locate     our    seriaiK'^e^geant     1757

that PS Burns and the other                 officers      had left the area.            It became

a pp arent    that   something       had gone wrong          but    I didn't     really have any

i dea what     it w a s .

PC B oo t h and myself          looked from the          rear of the Le£_________ ne

q uadrangle area to see             if we    could gain access             to the f ront of the

terracing.         Due   to the     large    numbers of persons             there we a t t e m p te d to

gain access        by different       means.        Whilst      doing so we were a p pr o ac h ed

fay a person jstffo said he was a doctor and wa nt ed to know where all                             the
            S'

              then e sc orted the doctor                  the    casualty area

In the meantime          some Liverpool        spectators          had started to       leave the

ground.       Most were abus iv e and some were                  t h r e a t e n i n g , some had to be

escorted from the g r o u n d .

On the steps         leading      to the seating area,             youths    leaving the ground

were    punching and kicking            ‘      '     '     sheets and shouting abuses at

the Police.

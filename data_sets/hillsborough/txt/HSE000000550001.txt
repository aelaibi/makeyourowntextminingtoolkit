 1   INTRODUCTION

 During the incident which occurred at Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989,
 two bays, 2\3 and 3\4, of barrier 124A, Fig I, were broken down. This report
 attempts to calculate collapse loads for the barrier and compares these loads
 with the pressures likely to have been generated by the crowd.

 Examination and mechanical testing of the broken barrier by staff of the
 Health and Safety Executive (HSE), revealed that the upper rail had been
 manufactured from wrought iron and was probably over sixty years old. The
 vertical supports were made from mild steel (Ref I). The tube was attached to
 the supports by straps, underneath which considerable corrosion of the tube
 had occurred.


’2   MATERIAL PROPERTIES

 Tensile tests from 2 specimens taken from the tube gave average tensile
 strength of 366 MPa, 0.2% proof stress 259 MPa and an estimated elastic limit
 of 150 MPa. Because of the considerable work hardening which occurs after
 yield in this material and the sensitivity of the yield stress to prior load
 history, there is an ambiguity about what single value of yield (or flow)
 stress should be used to calculate a fully plastic moment.

 Two full scale uniform bending tests were carried out on similar wrought iron
 tubes from barrier 129, as described in Appendix I. From the experimentally
 determined plastic collapse loads and the geometry of the tube, representative
 flow stresses, of, were determined from each test. The values obtained were
 298.2 MPa and 290.9 MPa. The difference in the two values of flow stress
 obtained by experiment gives an indication of the reliability of the material
 property input to the collapse calculations, i.e. +/- 1.2%. The average of
 these values, 294.6 MPa was used in the subsequent collapse calculations. This
 value is some 5.7% less than that obtained by using the approximation of the
 average of the tensile strength and the 0.2% yield stress obtained in a
 tensile test. An average value of Young’s Modulus, E, (in flexure) of
 190.5 GPa was also obtained from these experiments.


 3   SECTION PROPERTIES OF THE BARRIER TUBE

 Second moments of area, I, for a tube of outside diameter D and uniform wall
 thickness, t, were calculated from the formula:


                                                    (1)

 Equation (I) and the formulae which follow can be found in standard references
 (e.g. Ref 2).

 Fully plastic moments Mp were calculated as a product of the flow stress of
 and Zp the plastic modulus:



      °3[ [
 Zp=-- I -

               I - --

                                                   (2)
The general case of plastic collapse for a beam of length L is shown below:



                            w / unit length


                                                        )kfc


                                  MB
                   --             L               ,.-


where MA. and Mc are the moments at the supports and Ms is the moment at the
centre of the beam. The collapse load is

     4 x (MA + 2Ms + Mc)
Wc                                                                  (4)
              L2

The standard case we take is for the original beam built-in at both ends, i.e.
span 2\3 of barrier 124A. Denoting the collapse load for this case as wc and
noting MA = Mc = Ms = Mp, the fully plastic moment at the uncorroded centre,


     16 x Mp 16 x 3.73
wc                          12.3 kN/m
        L2         2.22


Now for the span 3\4, assuming end 4 to be simply supported, the calculation
above can be repeated with Mc = 0, and MA = MS = 3.65 kNm, giving a collapse
load of 9.05 kN/m.

For the spans in a corroded condition, the central plastic moment can be
assumed to remain unchanged, but the appropriate plastic moments in the
above table can be substituted for end moments. The following table
results:

                                          Collapse Loads: kN/m

       Original                 12.3 (2.1)                     9.05 (1.51)

       Corroded condition        9.40 (1.57)                   8.11 (1.35)

The figures in brackets are the calculated collapse loads as multiples of the
test load (6 kN/m).

9     CONCLUSIONS

9.1     Collapse loads have been calculated for the spans 2\3 and 3\4 of barrier
        124A which was broken down during the Hillsborough Stadium incident.

9.2    If the barriers had been of the original thickness at the supports, loads
       of 2.1 and 1.51 times the test load of 6 kN/m would have been needed to
       collapse the barrier at spans 2\3 and 3\4 respectively. With the reduced
       wall thicknesses as measured, these ratios fall to 1.57 and 1.35 x test
       load.

9.3     These figures have been compared with barrier loads generated from a
        ’leaning crowd’ model.

9.4     In the corroded condition for a crowd of measured density 8/sq m, the
        span 3\4 of the barrier would have been broken down by a crowd of
        approximately 6 m depth behind the barrier. A crowd of some 7 m depth
        existed directly behind span 3\4.

9.5     If a crowd density of 5.4/sq m is assumed, the same tube would have
        required about 7.5 m of crowd to break it down.

BENDING TESTS TO DETERMINE THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF THE WROUGHT
IRON TUBULAR TOP RAIL FROM BARRIER 129

AI.I     THE NEED FOR BENDING TESTS

Calculations of the loading to cause the collapse of barrier 124A requires a
knowledge of the mechanical properties of the wrought iron used in spans 2\3
and 3\4 of the top rail of the barrier.

RLSD’s Metallurgy and Materials Section conducted tensile tests on two
specimens cut from the wrought iron tube used in spans 2\3 and 3\4 of barrier
124A. However, there were reservations about the use of the results of these
tests in calculations of the collapse load of this barrier because:


(i)    tests conducted on small specimens of a material that is known to have a
       heterogeneous structure may not provide results that are representative
       of a large saple;

(ii)   the tubes that had formed spans 2/3 and 3/4 were found to be permanently
       bent when they were recovered after the incident; it is known that the
       yield stress of wrought iron is likely to be affected by its previous
       loading history, and that wrought iron is sensitive to post-yield
       strain-hardening;

(iii) bending moments introduce compressive stresses as well as tensile
      stresses into the tube; we did not have data about the compressive
      properties of wrought iron that could be applied with reasonable
      confidence in calculations of the collapse load of barrier 124A.


It was the opinion of Smith and Games that data obtained from a bending test on
an undeformed sample of a similar wrought iron tube would be likely to be more
representative than the data obtained from tensile tests on small specimens.


AI.2 SELECTION OF THE TEST SAMPLE

Barrier 129 was a six-span barrier situated in the North-West Pen (Pen 5) of the ~
West terraces. It appeared to be of a similar construction to barrier 124A and
its top rail was not obviously bent. We assisted in the removal of the
complete assembly of barrier 129 from the West terraces to RLSD’s premises.
Mr J G Tattersall of RLSD’s Metallurgy and Materials Section confirmed that
the length of the top rail selected for testing was made from wrought iron.

Determination of the yield stress of the material

The elastic bending equation is expressed as:

            M       ~ E
                                                                 (2)
            I       y R

where M is the bending moment applied to the beam
      I is the second moment of area of the cross-section
        is the fibre stress on the material of the beam
      y is the distance of a fibre from the neutral axis
      E is Young’s Modulus for the material of the beam
      R is the radius of curvature of the neutral axis at the cross-section
      considered

The second moment of area (I) for a circular section tube can be shown to
be:
           4 4
       x (D d )
I =                                                         (3)
         64

where D and d are the outer and inner diameters, respectively, of the tube

                       Mxy
from (2)        ~                                                  (4)
                          I

Equation (4) shows that as the bending moment is increased the outermost
fibres will be the first to reach the yield stress (~y) of the material. The
relationship between load and deflection will cease to be linear when the
outermost fibres are subjected to the yield stress of the material. Plastic
deformation will be initiated and will spread inwards towards the neutral axis
if the bending moment continues to increase. The outermost fibres of a hollow
circular section of outer diameter D are situated at a distance D/2 from the
neutral axis, i.e. y = D/2.

    My D
~y=-- X--              ........................ (5)
    I 2

where My is the bending moment at which yielding commences

Substituting for My from (I) and I from (3) in (5)

        8 x Wy x (L - I) x D
                                                                       (6)
                  4 4
             ~x (D- d)

where      ~y the yield stess
           Wy is the load when yielding commences, i.e. the load at which the graph
           relating force and deflection ceases to be linear


                                       -iii-
Therefore, if Wy can be obtained from the force\deflection graph, the yield
stress (~y) can be determined.


Determination of Young’s Modulus (E) for the material

                      MxR
From (2)        E                     .................... (7)
                         I

E and I are both constants, therefore R is proportional to M. Equation (I)
shows that M is uniform over the central span (I) of the beam. Provided the
loaded beam remains in an elastic condition, its radius of curvature R over
the central span will also be uniform i.e. the deflected shape of the central
span will be an arc of a circle.

From the geometrical properties of a circle it can be shown that if I >> c:

         2
        I
R ~                 ......................... (8)
      8xc

where R is the radius of curvature of the central span
       I is the length of the central span
       c is the mid-span deflection of the central span

substituting for M from (I), I from (3), and R from (8) in (7)

                              2
                2 x (L- I) x I
      = W/c x                                  .................. (9)
                          4 4                                           7.’:
                ~x (D            d)

W/c is the gradient of the elastic, linear region of the load-deflection
curve, which can be measured from the graph obtained from the bending test.
The remaining terms in Equation (9) are known constants and therefore E can be
evaluated.


Comparison of theoretical and experimental maximum bending strengths

Appendix 2 expresses the maximum theoretical bending strength (Mp) of a beam
in the form:

Mp= a[ x Zp ............................                                (I0)

a[ is a limiting constant stress which, dependent upon the properties of the
material of the beam, may be the yield stress (ay) or a ’flow stress’ (af).

Zp is a plastic section modulus, which for a hollow circular section of
uniform wall thickness (t) may be expressed in terms of its outer and inner
diameters, or in terms of its outer diameter and wall thickness.

If an appropriate value is known for a[, then the theoretical maximum bending
strength may be calculated from Equation (12) and its value compared with the
experimental maximum bending strength obtained from the test to check the
validity of the calculation.


Equipment for conducting the bending tests

We designed and constructed equipment of the type shown diagrammatically in
Fig AI.I that was suitable for installation in RLSD’s I MN (I00 tonf)
tension\compression testing machine. The equipment was designed to accept a
sample with an overall span of 2 m and a central span of Im, the objective
being to minimize the point loads applied to the tube within the constraints
imposed by:

(i)    the overall length of sample available for testing;
(ii) the loading range of the testing machine;
(iii) maximizing the length of tube subjected to a uniform bending moment
      in order to obtain representative results

A spring-tensioned potentiometric displacement transducer was used to measure
deflections of the tube. The transducer had a range of 760 mm and was actuated
by a flexible wire, the end of which was attached to the mid-span of the tube.
The transducer was mounted on the loading rig so as to measure deflections of
the central span between its loading points.

The output from the potentiometric transducer was connected to a digital
voltmeter and the assembly calibrated and adjusted to provide a direct digital
reading of displacement, in millimetres, with a resolution of 0.i mm. The
calibrated testing machine was operated on the lowest range of I00 kN, the
force being displayed in digital form with a resolution of 0.I kN. Fig AI.2
shows a general view of the assembled equipment prior to conducting a test.

The testing machine was controlled manually whilst simultaneous readings were
taken of force and deflection. Fig AI.3 shows a sample in an advanced stage of
plastic deformation. Two samples from the top rail of barrier 129 were tested,
and the force\deflection graphs obtained from the results of these tests are
shown in Figs AI.4 and AI.5.

Values of yield stress, Young’s Modulus, and maximum bending moment were
calculated for both samples of tube, using data on the force\deflection graphs
and Equations (6), (9) and (I) respectively. The theoretical maximum bending


                                   -V-
moment for each sample was also calculated using Equation (12) with aL - ay,
the yield stress determined from the same bending test.

The theoretical maximum bending moments were 15% and 16% less than the
experimental maximum bending moments obtained from Samples I and 2
respectively. It was the opinion of Smith and Games that these discrepancies
were too great to justify using the experimentally determined yield stresses
to calculate the collapse load of barrier 124A.

They decided to use a ’flow stress’ in their calculations of the collapse load
of barrier 124A. The ’flow stresses’ of Samples I and 2 were obtained by
transposing Equation (I0) into the form:

EVALUATION OF THE PLASTIC SECTION MODULUS OF CROSS-SECTIONS FROM
SPANS 2\3 AND 3\4 OF BARRIER 124A
                             by

                         A L Collins
                             and
                         D Waterhouse

A2.1   PREDICTION OF THE PLASTIC COLLAPSE OF A BEAM

Bending moments are produced on a beam by the load that it is supporting.
These bending moments are resisted by moments of resistance produced by
tensile and compressive stresses developed on the cross-sectional area of the
beam.

A beam of ductile material, with a span that is large in comparison to its
cross-sectional dimensions, will fail by plastic collapse when the bending
moment creates sufficient plastic hinges along its span to transform the beam
from a structure to a mechanism. A plastic hinge is formed when the tensile
and compressive stresses exceed the yield strength of the material throughout
the depth of the beam’s cross-section.

If the moments of resistance that are developed at the plastic hinges can be
determined, then the principle of Virtual Work may be used to calculate the
bending moment, and therefore the loading, that will cause the beam to
collapse.

Simple plastic theory expresses the maximum moment of resistance (Mp) that can
be developed by a cross-section of a beam (its maximum plastic moment of
resistance) as the product of its plastic section modulus (Zp) and a limiting
constant value of stress (or).

i.e. ~ = at x Zp ...................                      (I)

This relationship makes the following assumptions about the material of the
beam:

(i) an idealized rigid-plastic relationship exists between stress and strain,
i.e. deformation does not occur until a limiting value of stress (or) is
reached, after which large deformations are developed whilst this stress
remains constant;

(ii) the behaviour of the material is the same in compression as in tension.

The tensile yield stress of the material (ay) is commonly used in Equation (I)
when strain-hardening (work-hardening) of the material may be neglected. When
strain-hardening of the material cannot be ignored then it is customary to use
a ’flow stress’ (of) having a value between the yield stress and the ultimate
stress.

i.e. ot = Oy (strain-hardening neglected)
or ot = of (strain-hardening included)


                                  -i-
 Experience has shown that this simple plastic theory can predict the failure
 of beams by plastic collapse with an accuracy that is acceptable for practical
’purposes.


A2.2       DETERMINATION OF THE PLASTIC SECTION MODULUS

If the material of a section that is subjected to pure bending exhibits the
same ideal rigid-plastic behaviour in both tension and compression, then Zp
can be shown to be equal to the First Moment of Area of the cross-section
about its neutral axis (or unstrained fibre). Furthermore, in these
circumstances, the neutral axis will coincide with the centroid of the area of
the cross-section.

The fully plastic section modulus for a hollow circular cross section of ideal
rigid-plastic material and uniform wall thickness can be shown to be either:

        3    3
       D -   d
Zp


where D = outer diameter
and d = inner diameter



                                     ..................... (2)


where t = wall thickness

Mr J G Tattersall of RLSD’s Metallurgy and Materials Section had made
ultrasonic measurements of the wall thicknesses of the wrought iron tube that
had formed the top rail of crush barrier 124A~ These measurements caused us to
conclude that it was reasonable to use Equation (2) to calculate Zp for the
top rail in the mid-span region of spans 2\3 and 3\4 of barrier 124A. The
measured dimensions and their corresponding plastic section moduli are shown
in the following Table.

Both ends of the tubular sections that had formed spans 2\3 and 3\4 had ~
fractured; the ends of the spans were deformed, severely corroded, and had
variable wall thicknesses. It was our opinion that the variability of the wall
thicknesses rendered Equation (2) unsuitable for calculating values of Zp at
the ends of spans 2\3 and 3\4, and that these values would have to be
determined by numerical integration.

                                      -ii-
Mr Tattersall provided us with sketches that showed wall thicknesses at the
fractured ends of spans 2\3 and 3\4. We used a computer-aided draughting (CAD)
system to draw our best impression of the cross-section at each end of spans
2\3 and 3\4 before deformation failure occurred. Our re-construction of the
cross-sections are shown in Figs A2.1 to A2.4.

We used the facilities of the CAD system to assist us with the numerical
integrations. Each cross-section was divided into strips of 2 mm width, with
the exception of the last strip whose width was determined by the outer
dimension of the section. A vertical axis was then drawn in the estimated
position of the centroid (neutral axis). Each elemental area of tube
thickness, with the exception of those adjacent to the estimated position of
the centroid was successively magnified by the CAD system and then accurately
cross-hatched. The CAD system then automatically calculated the area of each
cross-hatched element.

The sum of the elemental areas to the right of the estimated centroidal axis
were compared with the sum of those to the left; the centroidal axis being in
its correct position when it divides the cross-sectional area into two equal
parts. The position of the centroidal axis was adjusted and the process
repeated iteratively until the areas to the right and the left of the axis
were equal.

Each knownelemental area of the tubular wall was then mutiplied by its
distance from the centroidal axis to obtain the First Moment of Area of each
element. A summation of the First Moments of Area for all the elements
provided total First Moment of Area for the complete cross-section. The
results obtained during successive stages of the calculation are tabulated in
Figs A2.1 to A2.4.

The plastic section moduli that we obtained by numerical integration of the
re-constructed cross-sections at the ends of spans 2\3 and 3\4 from barrier
124A are shown in the following Table.

A ’LEANING CROWD’ MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE LOADS GENERATED BY
A BARRIER

Consider a person on the nth step behind a barrier. The whole crowd is assumed
to be up on its toes, inclined forward at an angle 0, in a fashion which would
be adopted to obtain a view of an incident in front of the crowd. The
spectator is leaning forward on a support provided by the person in front and
is thus subject to supporting force Pn, from the front and to a toppling force
Pn-1, from the person behind, offset by the terrace step height h.


                                                      h = Step Height
                                                      H = Centre oF Moss Height
                                                      H’=    Push Height
                                                      w =    Step Hldth

                      Pn = mg(H/H’)tan0 + Pn-1(l + h/(H’cos0))

ie a recurrence relationship of the form:

                     Pn = A + BPn.I,         A, B constants

P0 = 0
PI = A
P2 =A+AB
P3 = A + AB + AB2

Pn -- A + AB + AB2 + ......        + ABn’l

Pn = A(Bn-1)/(B-l)                           (Sum of geometric progression)

For the person immediately behind the barrier, if the barrier is at the push
height, then clearly Pn would be transmitted to the barrier. In general the
barrier is lower than this, and the push is probably transmitted to the
barrier by bending at mid-height for the few rows of people just behind the
barrier. If this were not so, the person at the barrier would be subjected to
a large turning moment. The exact details of this force feed to barrier height
are not yet clear, but for this purpose it is assumed that Pn, where n is the
number of steps behind the barrier in question, is the force on the barrier.

If the crowd density is N/sq m, then there are Nw persons/unit length on each
step, thus we obtain the force/unit length on the barrier as:


Force/unit length



which is the expression evaluated on Fig 2. A ’lean’ angle of i0 deg has been
estimated as a reasonable value to use in the calculation; other parameters are
declared on the Figure.

It should be noted that no previous work can be found in the literature
concerning this type of calculation. Existing design rules for barriers appear
to rely on empiricism together with limited experimental testing. Caution
should be exercised in the use of this new model, which requires experimental
substantiation.

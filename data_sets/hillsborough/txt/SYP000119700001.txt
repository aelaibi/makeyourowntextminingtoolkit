             presently attached to the mounted section a| Ring Farm, Carrs L a n e ,

             Cudworth.

             At 07.30 am on Saturday 15th April             1989 I was on duty at Ring' Farm

             for the Semi Final Football match taking place at Hillsborough

             Football       ground Sheffield between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest,

             Kick off time was 3pm.

             Together with other officers          I travel led to Niagara stables Sheffield

             where at 10.30am I was briefed as to my duties for the day by

             Inspector Hand— Davis.        I was to work      in company with PC         1103 Hurman

             at the South Yorkshire Transport Depot, Herries Road to ^receive

             coaches bringing Nottingham Forest supporters and to direct them ^way

             from the Liverpool       fans a n d ^ o   th                >ther officers we re

             working on Herries Rd South diiretting t^lsTTo                     turnstiles,       in

             Penistone Rd.

             I and PC Hurman began our duties in Herries Rd at                   11.30am we were

             under the direct       command of Inspector Charles.

             For the most part the Nottingham Forest supporters were families an#

             friends and they were all         in good humou^ a n t | | ^ ^ ^ t m o s p h @ r e was    like
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           R331

  that of a Carnival.       They were all well    behaved except for one

  incident when a group of 20 tried to make their way towards the

  Liverpool end of the ground to Leppi ngs Lane.         We very quickly

  pointed in the right direction.

  At 2.40 1 heard a transmission on my personal         radio by PS 1764

  Thomas   (Mounted)   requesting additional     horses at Le ppi ngs Lane end of

  the gro und.

  During the briefing myself and PC Hurman had been directed to stand

  down for meal at 2 . 4 5 pm.     Inspector Charles was told of this and at 2

  50pm in view of the fact that all was quiet and the coaches had

  arrived he instructed us to return to the s t ab le s, we were not aware

  of the s i tuat ion at Le ppi ngs Lane.

  At the junction of Lappings Lane/Peni stone Rd North there was a large

  crowd of Liverpool      supporters making their way down Penistone Rd

  towards Le ppi ngs L a n e .   They were rowdy and hurryi ng   presumably

  because of a shortage o f t i m e , most we re carrying cans of bee r .     At

  3pm I entered Niagara stables complex when I heard transmissions on

  the radian which tole me that the situation at the ground was serious

  I immediately made my way to the Le ppi ngs Lane end of the ground.              On

  my arrival which I would estimate to be at about 3.15pm I joined PS

  1764 Thomas.     The only fans about were stood on the kerb side

  opposite the entrance to the ground and it was only 2 or 3 mins             later

  that the first ambulance arrived,         Myself PS Thomas and other

  Liverpool mounted officers then left that position to a side street.

 DRAFT REPLY

 The Association of Chief Police Officers    (ACPO)   collate the
 number of arrests made at Football League matches in England
 and Wales.     The table below shows ACPO's figures for arrests
 at home games of League clubs according to their Division in
 the 1988/89 season.     The figures do not distinguish between
 arrests of home or away spectators.     Such figures are not
 collated centrally nor are any relating to the outcome of
 these arrests.

Our Ref:   PO 08346/89




You wrote to Alexander Hesketh on 27 February to give notice of the fact th a t,
on moving your amendment (number 53) in Committee Stage of the Football
Spectators B ill on 7 March, you would be asking for s t a t i s t i c s on the numbers
of_women arrested_and convicted for fo o tb a ll-re la te d offences. I t was very
helpful to have advance notice. I appreciate th at, given your courtesy, you
   •e disappointed that the figures were not available. I shall try to" explain

Whilst i t is correct that gender is recorded when someone is proceeded
against, s t a t i s t i c s distinguishing certain types of offender by sex can only
be made available if d e ta ils are aggregated on that basis.
At the end of each football season, the Association of Chief Police O fficers
co llates from each police force the number of attendances, ejections and
a rre sts which have been made at or d ire c tly related to Football League matches
in Engxand ano Wales, on a club by club basis.

These s t a t i s t i c s serve only to give the police an overview of the scale of the
operation required and any emerging trends. For th is'reaso n they are not
broken down in any great d e ta il and they do not, therefore, show the gender of
those arrested or the outcome of the arrests.. The annual Command Paper,
Criminal S t a ti s ti c s , England and Wales, would not help as i t does not
distinguish fo o tb all-related offences as a d is tin c t category.
Alexander Hesketh has since w ritten to John Harris to confirm that i t is the
impression of both the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police
Officers th at few women are arrested fo r fo o tb all-related offences. Like
a rre sts at football matches, attendance figures do not normally distinguish
between the sexes but i t is generally accepted that men are in the large
majority of those attending football matches. That alone must substan tially
reduce the proportion of women who may be involved in trouble there.
Nevertheless, there is a considerable amount of crime committed overall by
women. I t would not be right to. put ourselves in a position where we were
unable to prevent the attendance at football matches of any women found to be
misbehaving there. There is , for example, no corresponding exemption in the
exclusion order powers of the Public Order Act 1986.



                                                      /Given vour


The Earl of Onslow
Given your i n i t i a l preference to exempt women from the national football
membership scheme, your support of the Government’s position when the poin
was debated on Report, on 10 April was much appreciated.

 I said I would write to you as soon as I was in a position to reply
 substantively to your Parliamentary Qeustion on arrests and
 ejections at football matches (Official Report, 27th July, Col 798),

 At the end of each football season the Association of Chief Police
 Officers collates from each police force the number of attendances,
 ejections and arrests which have been made at or directly related
 to Football League matches in England,and Wales.  The figures for
 the last season are now available.  Below are the figures for the
 last four seasons.  I regret comparable information is not
 available for season 1984/85.

 Also below are figures of arrests within Scottish league grounds at
 League and Cup matches during the last two seasons.  Figures of
 arrests at football matches prior to the 1987/88 season, and also
 of ejections or of arrests outside grounds, are not held centrally.

                                                   Arrests          Ejections

 1987/88
 England and Wales                                     6,106            6,542
 Scotland                                                845             N/A

 1988/89
 England and Wales                                     6,185            7,607

 These figure?, are intended only to give the police an overview of
 the scale of the operation required and any emerging trends.   For
 this reason they are not broken down in any great detail and they
 do not, therefore, distinguish the gender or age of those arrested
 or ejected.



                                                          /You will see



 Dave Nellist Esq MP
You will see from the table that the number of arrests in England
and Wales and Scotland last season were of much the same order as
the previous season, but that the number of ejections in England
and Wa.es increased by 15%.  Football hooliganism is still a
serious problem, even though these figures can only give some
general indication of its extent.

I am placing a copy of this letter in the Library of the House.

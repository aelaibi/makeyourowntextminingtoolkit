FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS: LETTER FROM CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH
YORKSHIRE

Issu e

A reply to the letter o f 16 February (at A nnex A) from the C h ie f Constable o f South
Yorkshire seeking a special paym ent o f H O grant to help m eet legal costs in a judicial
review.

T im in g

2.    Urgent.

S u m m a ry

3. The C h ie f C onstable has applied for judicial review o f his Police A u th o rity ’s
decision that it has no pow ers to fund the legal costs o f the two retired police officers
w ho are facing crim inal proceedings as a result o f a private prosecuti on brought by
fam ilies o f the victim s o f the H illsborough disaster, the H illsborough Fam ilies
Support G roup (HFSG ). A s the m atter is o f national importance to the police service,
the C h ie f C onstable has asked for the H om e Office to provide financial assistance
with the legal costs o f the ju dicial review, w hich could am ount to £50,000 each for the
force and for the authority.

4. T h e decision that the police authority had no pow ers to pay the defence costs o f the
form er officers involved in these proceedings w as taken locally by the authority itself.
Equally the decision to apply for the judicial review w as one taken by the ch ie f
constable. These were properly matters for local decision. The H om e Office w as not



M y d ocu m e n ts : s yo rk s4
involved. The H om e O ffice has given general advice lo police authorities on the
m atter o f financial assistance to officers in legal proceedings (H om e Office Circular
4/1988) but we have not expressed a view on this ease. Given this background, there
are no grounds for providing financial assistance in this case.

5. In practical terms, there is no separate pot o f police grant available I'rom which we
could provide assistance even if Ministers wanted to. In any event. South Yorkshire
Police A uthority have recently told us that they had set aside £500,000 for legal costs
in this case. The A uthority have also estimated that they will have unearm arked
reserves (general balances) o f £6 m illion as at March 1999.



R ecom m en d ation

6. That the H om e Office should not provide financial assistance to South Yorkshire
Police for this purpose and that you (H om e Secretary ) reply to the C h ie f C onstable as
in the draft at A nnex B.

C on sideration

7. The background to this case is set out in Annex C. South Yorkshire Police
authority had previously agreed to fund the defence costs o f the 2 form er officers. It
appears that they were relying on H om e Office Circular 4/1998 - A nnex D - as
authority for p a ym ent o f costs.

8. The circular w as issued last year after full consultation w ith A C PO . APA,
Superintendents Association, and the Police Federation. It w as approved by M r
M ichael. It clearly states that the powers in sections 88(4) and (5) o f the Police Act
1996 enabling police authorities to provide financial assistance to officers in legal
proceedings apply to civil p roceedings only. (The provisions in the 1996 Act sim ply
re-enact the original provisions in the Police A ct 1964). The circular goes on to say at
p a ragraph 5 that “ section 88(4) does not apply to criminal proceedings , but police
authorities m ay w ish to consult their legal advisers as to w hether they have any other
p o w e r to provide such assistance.”

9. The circular goes on to refer to section 111 o f the Local G overnm ent Act 1972
w h ic h enables police authorities to do anything “which is calculated to facilitate, or is
conducive or incidental to, the discharge o f any o f their functions1'. The circular does
not proffer advice on w hether this provision provides authority for paym ent o f
financial assistance to officers in criminal proceedings. It states that this is a matter for
the police authority to decide on the basis o f legal advice.

10. The circular did not conclude that police authorities have pow er to offer financial
assistance to officers facing criminal proceedings. Follow ing m y earlier subm ission
o f 3 February, the H om e Secretary agreed that officials should reply to the Police
A u th o rity ’s solicitors’ letter seeking clarification o f the l iO Circular 4/1 998. A copy
o f m y reply o f 4 February, w hich was cleared with Legal Advisers Branch is at A nnex
E. On the follow ing day the police authority reversed its previous decision.



M y d ocu m e n ts : sy o rks4
I 1. Against the background o f full consultation with A C P O and the other staff
associations before the issue o f HOC 4/1998. it is rather surprising to see that the
letter from John N ew ing, A C P O President, which is attached to the C h ie f C on sta b le 's
letter, describes the police authority's decision not to provide financial assistance as
being "clearly contrary to current practice and understanding’'. However. John
N e w in g 's view may well have been based on a previous Home Office circular issued
in I 987 which erroneously advised police authorities that they had powers to give
financial assistance to police officers facing criminal proceedings. A C P O should be
aware that that Circular was cancelled with the issue o f Circular 4/1 998.

 12. The C h ie f C o n sta b le ’s letter goes on to say that, if the High Court rules that the
Police Authority is correct in its interpretation o f the law', the 3 police staff
associations will seek an urgent am endm ent to legislation to give police authorities
p ow er to provide financial assistance to officers facing criminal proceedings. In your
reply you could indicate that, i f the court finds that police authorities have no clear
p ow ers to fund the legal costs o f officers facing criminal charges, yon would be
prepared to consider, in consultation with the police staff associations and the A PA,
w hether the law should be changed to provide such a power. Phis would be in
accordance with the general principle set out in Circular 4/1998 that "police officers
s h o u ld be able to carry out their duties in the confidence that their police authority
will support them, i f they act in good, faith a n d exercise their judgem ent re a so n a b ly " .

R esou rce Im p lications

13. N o im m ediate resource implications if the recom m endation in this subm ission is
accepted.

H an d lin g /P resen ta tio n a l Issues

14. M r H ow arth has seen the C h ie f C onstable's letter. He feels strongly that the
H o m e Office should not provide any financial assistance for this purpose. To do so
w ould be w holly out o f keeping with the position Ministers had previously taken and
w o u ld re-open som e o f the w ounds w hich were exposed following the Stuart- Sm ith
review o f evidence.

Judicial Review of Police Authority Decision Regarding Funding the Defence of Police
Officers Facing Private Prosecution

On 5 February 1999 the South Yorkshire Police Authority resolved that it does not have the
power to fund the legal costs of two retired police officers who face private prosecutions for
matters arising in the performance of their duties over nine years ago. The Authority acted
upon legal advice which differs from the legal advice I have received. I have applied to the
High Court in London for a judicial review of the Authority’s decision but unfortunately this
will cost both the Authority and the Force a substantial sum of money. This is a matter of
national importance and some urgency and I write to ask for central government financial
assistance to meet the legal costs involved. I will provide a little more detail in order to give
you a fuller picture.

Home Office Circulars have for many years provided advice and guidance to Police
Authorities on the way in which they should consider requests from police officers, serving
or retired, for financial assistance to pay for their defence against prosecutions, whether
they be brought by the Crown Prosecution Service or by private individuals. The very
existence of circulars implies that the Home Office perceive that the Police Authorities have
the power to pay these costs. That has always been my understanding and I am supported
in that view by the President of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Mr John Newing,
the Secretary of the Police Superintendents' Association, Mr Des Parkinson, and the
Secretary of the South Yorkshire Federation, Mr Paul Middup (please see copy letters).

In 1998 the South Yorkshire Police Authority resolved to pay the legal costs incurred by
retired Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and retired Superintendent Bernard Murray
in defending themselves against private prosecutions brought by Miss Ann Adlington,
solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG) for alleged offences arising from
the Hillsborough Stadium disaster of 15 April 1989. Miss Adlington wrote to the Police
Authority questioning the legality of such payments. The Authority took independent legal
advice which, in summary, said that the power was unclear and that, therefore, the
Authority should resolve to cease payments. If the Authority’s legal advice is correct then
many Police Authorities have been acting illegally and police officers have all been under a
misapprehension about this crucial piece of legislation.

1attach a copy of the affidavit affirmed by Assistant Chief Constable lan Daines in support
of my application to the High Court. In that affidavit ACC Daines explains the impact upon
the efficient functioning of the police service if the Police Authority’s interpretation of the
law were to be upheld. My disagreement with the Police Authority is amicable and in good
spirit and the members only came to their decision with great reluctance.

My solicitor (Peter Metcalf of Hammond Suddards) advises me that the cost of the High
Court action may be as much as £50,000 for my legal costs and £50,000 for the Police
Authority. If the High Court rules that the Police Authority is correct in its interpretation of
the law then I anticipate that the three police staff associations will all press you for an
urgent amendment to legislation. They would seek retrospective legalisation of payments
that have been made in many cases over the years and legal power to make payments in
future cases.

The legal advice received by the South Yorkshire Police Authority focuses upon Section 88
(Police Act 1996) which deals with awards and damages in civil actions caused by the acts
or omissions of police officers. The Act contains no reference to funding the cost of
defending criminal prosecutions brought against police officers. The Authority’s legal
advice is that the omission from the Act of specific reference to defence costs for criminal
actions must be construed as deliberate when read alongside the inclusion of paying the
cost of civil actions.

Because this matter is so much more important than the specific problems faced by Messrs
Duckenfield and Murray or the problems faced by South Yorkshire Police, I ask that you
                                           ' toward the cost of these legal actions.

   Mr. M. I. I. Hedges, Q.P.M., LL.B.,
   Chief Constable,
   South Yorkshire Police,

   Dear Mr. Hedges,

   Financial Support for Former Police Officers bv the South Yorkshire Police Authority

   I am aware that on 5 February 1999, the South Yorkshire Police Authority - acting on
   legal advice - decided that they could no longer financially support former Chief
   Superintendent David Duckenfield and Superintendent Bernard Murray in respect o f
   criminal charges brought against them connected with the Hillsborough tragedy.

   I have been the Joint Branch Board Secretary here in South Yorkshire for 23 years and
   I was a member o f the National Executive o f the Police Federation o f England and
   Wales for 17 years. It has always been my understanding that the Police Authority did
   indeed have foil authority to support police officers in circumstances such as this and
   my understanding o f H om e Office Circular 4/1998 is that it was supposed to
   strengthen that authority. Indeed, it is perfectly obvious that that was the opinion o f
   the Police Authority for all these years since the tragedy happened because they have
   supported officers during that time.

   I have discussed the decision o f the Police Authority with the National Chairman o f the
   Police Federation o f England and Wales, Mr. Fred Broughton, and he agrees that the
   potential morale problems within the Police Service if this decision is upheld are very
   serious indeed. Fred would have been writing to you himself today expressing the
   views that I am portraying in this letter but he has been taken ill and is unable to do so.
                                           -2-

It is so very important that police officers going about their normal daily duties - never
knowing what is going to happen next - can at least feel that they will be financially
supported by their Police Authority if, after doing their best in what nowadays is
always difficult circumstances, something goes wrong.

Whatever the strict legal interpretation o f the law may be I am quite certain that
Parliament and the H om e Office meant in the drafting and passing o f the law that
Police Authorities should be able to support officers in such circumstances.

On behalf o f all the 3000 + officers here in South Yorkshire who I directly represent
and the other 125,000 in England and Wales who I indirectly represent, I ask you
please, to take urgent and immediate steps through the courts to have this decision by
South Yorkshire Police Authority reversed.

With best wishes.

Yours sincerely^




Paul Middup, B.E.M ., M.I.Mgt.

                made by the Police Authority and the need to have this application determined

                as a matter o f urgency.



         It is my experience that there has never been any question but that a Police Authority

         has the p ow er to grant financial assistance to a police officer who faces legal

          proceedings brought in respect o f his or her conduct whilst on duty.      I k n ow o f no

          other case or set o f circumstance in which the Police Authority s power to grant

          assistance has been questioned or challenged.   As can be seen from the letter from the

          Chief Constable o f Derbyshire Constabulary, President o f the Association o f C hief

          Officers, the decision that there is no power to provide financial assistance which is the




                                                                            Jn        j 11   10U2.pcm .wd.doc
                                  0 1 9
essential   subject   matter   o f tins application is contrary to current          practice and

understanding. The resolution o f this issue is a matter o f national importance.



I am greatly concerned at the suggestion that there is no power to provide financial

assistance to police officers w h o face legal proceedings.       1   consider it absolutely vital

that officers should k n o w that i f they act in go o d faith in performing their duties that

their P olice Authority will support them in the event that they face litigation.



I fear that i f officers do not enjoy the confidence that they have this form o f support,

that w e will see defensive policing        That is, officers deciding not to act when faced

with a difficult situation in case it rebounds upon them, or officers seeking to push

decision making up the rank structure rather than taking responsibility themselves. It is

absolutely vital that officers feel confident about immediate decision making.             This is

essential to proper policing.



It is important to bear in mind that it is a particular feature o f police work that it is

 usually the most junior officers who are faced with the immediate probler s o f

 managing or dealing with violent or dangerous situations. They are at the front line, as

 it were.   T hese officers need to know that if they act in g o o d faith they will have the

 support o f their police authority in the vent that they b ecom e the subject or target o f

 litigation. It is essential to effective policing that junior officers have the confidence to

 make the difficult decisions and choices which are demanded o f them in the course o f

 their duties.



 Policing necessarily involves situations o f conflict.      Police officers daily deal with the

 unscrupulous who are well practised in taking advantage o f any weaknesses which they

 may be able to exploit.       It takes little imagination to think o f how the threat o f private

 prosecution may be used to intimidate where police officers do not have the confidence

 that they will receive police authority assistance should any such threat be realised.



 I am concerned that i f police officers cannot act in the know ledge that they will be

  supported i f they face litigation that it will impact on recruitment
12.         As a result o f the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster tragically 96 people died. The impact

             on South Yorkshire Police has been enormous.                Such is the profile o f the private

             prosecution that the wh ole Force will know o f the decision on the part o f the Police

             Authority to cease funding.           1 have no doubt that the decision will be the subject o f

             much concern within the Force, both with regard to the way that David Duckenfield

             and Bernard Murray have been treated and h o w the decision will affect all current

             officers.       Further, given the press coverage o f events, it will not have escaped any

             officer’s attention that the decision to cease funding came about as a result o f

             representations made by the private prosecutor.



 13.        The decision to cease funding has com e at a crucial stage in the private prosecution.

             The decision can only have c o m e as a major blo w to the tw o former officers w h o have

             thus far acted in the belief that they had financial assistance.       Clearly, the question o f

             whether they have funding or not has to be determined as a matter o f absolute urgency

             either so that funding can be resumed so that they can continue properly to defend the

              prosecution brought against them or so that they can make alternative financial

              arrangements.



 14.        In all the circumstances, the Ch ief Constable seeks leave to apply for judicial review as

              sought in RSC Appendix A Form N o                  86A   and thereafter, the substantive relief

              claimed.

T h ank you for your letter o f 16 February.



1 fully recognise the sensitivities o f this case and I am grateful to you lor draw ing the

present issues to my attention. 1 have noted your decision to apply for leave to

challenge the police authority’s decision that it has no pow ers to fund the legal costs

o f the two form er officers.



H om e Office C ircular 4/] 998 on financial assistance to police officers involved in

legal proceedings w as issued after full consultation with A C PO . the Police

Sup e rin te n d en ts’ A ssociation, the Police Federation, and with the APA. If A C PO ,

the other sta ff associations, or the A P A believe that the legislation needs to be

changed or the guidance needs to be reviewed, I w ould o f course consider any points

w hich they m ight wish m e to address. For the present, I have nothing further to add to

the advice in H O Circular 4/1998 and I am afraid that I cannot find grounds to justify

providing financial assistance to help m eet the legal costs o f the judicial review

which you and the police authority will incur. It was entirely a local decision to seek

judicial review. It seem s reasonable that the costs should be borne locally.

B ackgroun d

Form er C h ie f Superintendent David Duckenfield and former Superintendent Bernard
Murray o f the South Yorkshire Police were the two most senior officers on duty at the
H illsborough disaster in April 1989. A lthough no criminal proceedings were brought
against them following the inquiry into the disaster, it was recom m ended ihat both
officers face disciplinary action. D uckenfield retired from the force on medical
grounds before disciplinary proceedings could be brought and it was not possible to
continue against M urray on what am ounted to a joint charge.

2. The H illsborough Fam ily Support Group has brought a private prosecution against
both men. They face charges o f m anslaughter in respect o f two o f those who died at
Hillsborough. T hey also face an alternative charge o f wilfully neglecting to perform a
public duty (otherwise known as ‘m isconduct in a public office') based 011 the same
circum stances as the m ain allegations. Duckenfield is also charged with "perverting
the course o f ju s tic e ' in that he lied about the circumstances in w hich gate C at the
ground w as opened.

3. South Y orkshire Police A uthority had originally decided to fund the defence costs
o f M r D uckenfield and M r D ean-M urray. M aria Eagle M P tabled a num ber o f
Q uestions on this issue in the last month. She has a particular interest in this subject as
it is her constituents w ho are p ursuing the private prosecutions o f 2 officers involved.
M s Eagle asked, am ong other things, w hether the guidance in Hom e Office Circular
4/1998 applied in this case. Helen Jackson M P for Sheffield, Hillsborough also raised
the issue at Oral Questions on 15 February - Hansard extract attached.

4. The circular, copy attached, provides updated guidance to police authorities on
financial assistance to police officers in legal proceedings, and distinguishes between
officers involved in civil proceedings, criminal proceedings and other types o f legal
proceedings. The background to this was a request from A C P O and other police staff
organisations that a previous H O circular issued in 1987 should be am ended to
include retired, as well as serving, officers. From this it emerged that the 1987
guidance had been misleading in that there is no express statutory provision enabling
police authorities to give financial assistance to officers facing c r i m in a l charges. The
law enables financial assistance to be given only to officers involved in civil
proceedings. T he 1987 circular erroneously advised police authorities that thay had
pow ers to give financial assistance to officers facing criminal proceedings.

5. FIOC 4/1998 explains the statutory vicarious liability under s88 o f the Police Act
1996 for officers involved in civil proceedings, and that this does not apply to
crim inal proceedings. It suggests that police authorities may wish to consult their legal
advisers as to w hether they have any other pow er to provide such assistance, but that
it is for police authorities to decide in the particular circumstances o f a case, and on
the basis o f legal advice, w hether to m ake financial assistance available to officers in
criminal proceedings.




M y d ocu m e n ts : s yo rk s4
6. The Circular does not offer any guidance as to w hether il should apply to any
particular circum stances or type o f ease, but states the underlying principle that it is
important to r police officers to be able to carry out their duties in the confidence that
their police authority will support them . if they act in good faith and exercise their

7. We had been informed that the police authority had set aside around f50().()()() to
m eet legal costs arising from the Hillsborough disaster and the outcom e o f the Mr
Justice Stew art-Sm ith report. This funding w as to be m ade available io meet the
defence costs o f Duckenfield and Murray.        On 5 February the police authority
reversed its earlier decision and decided that it had no powers to provide financial
assistance to officers facing criminal proceedings.

8. Solicitors for Bernard M urray wrote to H om e Office on 1 February (letter passed to
P R U on 19 February) essentially saying that it w as wrong to that M r Murrav should
be left to fund his ow n defence costs or rely on legal aid. The 110 official reply o f 19
February sim ply referred to the application for judicial review and said that we had
nothing to add to the advice in the Circular.

              Dear C h ief Officer/Clerk,

              This circular:

              •   provides updated guidance to police authorities on financial assistance to police
                  officers in legal proceedings.

              • distinguishes between officers involved in civil proceedings, criminal
                proceedings and other types o f legal proceedings.

              •   replaces HO Circular 77/1987.
1.     It is important that police officers should be able to carry out their duties in
the confidence that their police authority will support them, if they act in good faith
and exercise their judgement reasonably. The follow ing guidance, w hich has been
prepared in consultation with A C PO , the Superintendents Association, the Police
Federation and the Association o f Police Authorities, should be read against this
principle.

Civil P roceed in gs


2.      Under section 88 (1) o f the Police Act 1996 which re-enacts section 48(1) o f
the Police A ct 1964, chief officers are liable for torts committed by officers under
their direction and control. Section 88(2) provides that any damages or costs
awarded against the chief officer and any costs they incur themselves (w hich are not
recovered) should be met from police authority funds.


3.     Alternatively, a court may award damages against individual police officers.
Section 88(4) o f the Police A ct 1996 empowers a police authority “to such an extent
as appears to it to be appropriate” to pay any damages or costs awarded against
officers (this includes both officers o f other forces serving in the police area under
mutual aid arrangements and special constables), any costs incurred by the officers
themselves and any sum paid in connection with the settlement o f a claim. It is for
police authorities to decide when to make assistance available, taking account o f the
circumstances o f a particular case.


4.     Police authorities are reminded that the discretionary powers in sections
88(4) and (5) o f the Act, enabling them to provide financial assistance to officers
involved in legal proceedings, apply to civil proceedings only. Sections 88(4) and
88(5) may also apply to police officers who were members at the time o f the action
which gave rise to the claim but who are no longer members.

.Criminal Proceedings

5.     Section 88(4) does not apply to criminal proceedings, but police authorities
may wish to consult their legal advisers as to whether they have any other power to
provide such assistance (whether in respect o f private prosecutions or prosecutions
brought by the CPS). In this context, they may w ish to note that section 111(1) o f
the Local Government Act 1972 enables police authorities to do anything “which is
calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge o f any o f their
functions” . The provision applies to provincial authorities (but not the Metropolitan
or City o f London police) by virtue o f Section 146A o f the 1972 Act (as inserted
by Schedule 14 to the Local Government Act 1985 and amended by Schedule 4 of
the Police and M agistrates’ Courts Act 1994). It could be argued that to allow
payment to be made to officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal
proceedings would in som e way facilitate or be conducive to a police authority’s
broad functions. For exam ple, failure to provide financial assistance could
adversely affect the morale o f the force if officers had to meet their ow n costs after
an acquittal.

6.       It is for individual police authorities to decide in the particular circumstances
o f a case, and on the basis o f legal advice, whether to make financial assistance
available to officers in criminal proceedings.

Other types o f legal proceedings

7.      Similarly, there is no express statutory authority for providing financial
assistance in proceedings brought against police officers in tribunals other than the
courts. It is for police authorities outside London (bearing in mind the
recommendations o f c h ief officers) to decide whether to make financial assistance
available to officers (either former or serving) involved in Public Inquiries and
Tribunals. P olice authorities w ill therefore need to consider whether section 111(1)
o f the Local Government A ct 1972 provides sufficient scope to enable financial
assistance to be given in any particular case. In this respect tribunals may include
certain industrial tribunals where it is clear that officers have acted in good faith in
pursuance o f their duties and the interest o f the force as a w hole is involved. It is to
be expected that, where appropriate, the service’s grievance procedure
arrangements should be exhausted before there is recourse to legal proceedings.
These arrangements are set out in Home O ffice Circular 16/93, issued 10 M arch
1993.

8.     There are specific provisions in the Race Relations A ct 1976 and the Sex
Discrim ination A ct 1975 for compensation, costs and expenses awarded against the
chief officer o f police and any sum required for settlement, if approved by the
police authority, to be paid from the police fund.

9      There is no express statutory authority for providing financial assistance to
an officer wishing to initiate court proceedings. The considerations set out in
paragraphs 5 to 7 above apply to such cases.

                      Initially    I heard the screaming and saw the             concertina

                     effect    in the     crowd.   People   started to come over the fence

                     and the Police        tried to get     them back.     Then more and more

                     star ted to spill       over the fences.       At that stage these        people

                     were   not   injured and seemed to be         lads having a joke at

                     climbing     over.

G25.   IF Y E S , HAVE YOU ANY O B S E R V A T I O N S TO HAKE ON THAT G A M E , IN THE

       LIGHT OF THIS DISASTER?



              This year was        the quietest        I ’ve known      it in the ground before

              the match and the unusual              spaces     that were      observed        in the

              end    pens of the terrace.




Q26. FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE,             HAVE YOU ANY V I E W S ON THE B E HAVIOUR OF

       THE L I V E R P O O L / N O T T I N G H A M FOREST S U P P O R T E R S AT THIS MATCH,

       <1989), CO M P A R E D WITH S U P P O R T E R S OF OTHER F O O T B A L L CLUBS?



              At about 3.3 0 pm         <1530)    the N o t t i n g h a m Forest   fans started

              to shout abuse at the Liverpool                 fans,    which made the

              s i t uation worse      on the field.

  Q S 7 . HAVE YOU A N Y T H I N G TO OFFER W H I C H YOU CONSIDER TO BE VITAL TO

           THIS JUDIC I A L           INQUIRY?



                   I believe          that     one    particular Police Officer                   (I think    named

                   Dave       Illingworth)           deserves     commendation.             He worked hard

                   throughout on the field and was                        still      sorting       through debris

                   until at         least 6.15         pm (1815).

                   The only other              crucial     part     is that       once the fans had started

                   to spill        over onto the          pitch there was a significant                      delay

                   in police atten d a n c e there.

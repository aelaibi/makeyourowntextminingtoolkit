it    is    necessary             that          when       a    large          match       .is a n t i c i p a t e d      in    the        future,

we    should       ensure             that       the       numbers             allowed          onto       the     kop    strictly              adhere

to    the    capacity             allowed.                 It       is    imperative             therefore             that     the

automatic          counting                system          is       always       in       working          order       for     ’A ’ a n d         ’B *

almost       capacity             crowds             can       be    expected.




Paragraph          S3    onwards                lays       down          the    management                r e s p o n s i b i 1 ity    very

clearly       and       is       to    be       welcomed,                since       there       have        in    the    past,        been

Paragraph          28    recommends                   the > a p p o i n t m e n t          of    a    safety        officer           and

identifies          his          duties.              I    can       o\l)J      presume          that        the    safety       officer              is

and    this    should             be       clarified                with       the    club.           Furthermore,              in     the

discussion          of       a    central             control             point       being          designated           (other           than

then       police       control),                one       would         assume           that       the     central         control            point

designated          in       respect             of       the       Sheffield             Wednesday             Ground       would         be     the

video       viewing          room          in    the       south          stand.




Paragraph          43    relates                to    records             of    tests          kept       and     examination              of     the

ground.        I am          not       aware          that          these       are       kept       by    the     club.




Paragraph          199       relates             to       exercises             of    stewards             regarding           emergency

procedures          and          I am       not       aware          that       the       club       have       ever     carried           ou t

exercises          in    this          respect.

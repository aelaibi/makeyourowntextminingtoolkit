ALL MEMBERS OF COUNCIL WHO ATTENDED THE FA CUP SEMI FINAL
AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY, ON 15TH APRIL 1989



PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL



Dear Sirs,

Our solicitors, Freshfield, have requested that all those
Council Members who attended the above Semi Final,
Liverpool V Nottingham Forest, should submit a report
including any information which you may consider
relevant, i .e. timings, any personal comments that were
made to you and your own observations.

I would stress that at this stage these reports will be
merely to provide further background to the solicitors
and if it is felt that any of the information received
should be included in any presentation to the enquiry,
you will be contacted and a statement will be prepared
for your approval.

This information is required as soon as possible.

In the event you did not attend the match but obtained
tickets for somebody else who has any relevant comments,
we shall be pleased to receive these.

Your assistance in this matter is appreciated.

Yours       faithfully



                                                                            c.c. Freshfields

TAYLOR REPORTI     POLICE ISSUES


1.   Thank you for your note of 9 February seeking comments on the
draft letter to Mr Anderton. Recommendations 54-58 are very much
within my sphere of interest.

2.   Indeed, the Radio Frequency and Communications Planning Unit
of F7 Division has made extra channels available to forces for use
at sporting and other events which will enable them to implement
Recommendation 55. A letter, setting out the details of the
channels which may be used for this purpose, will be sent to
forces this week. In the circumstances, the following could be
added to the paragraph in the draft letter on Recommendation 55:
     "The Home Office has therefore made extra channels
     available for use at sporting and other events,
     including a channel for command purposes. Information
     about these channels has recently been circulated to
     forces."


3.   The other recommendations on communications are largely for
forces, but PRSU has been working with the service on the
implications for police operations. Mr Anderton will be aware of
this, so there should be no need to make reference to it in the
letter.

     I SAW MY DAUGHTERS
     CRUSHED TO DEATH          By SONIA LEGG
     A HEARTBROKEN father who watched helplessly as his two
     daughters were crushed to death beside him summed up
     the agony o f Hillsborough last night.
       Liverpool fan Trevor Hicks was only yards from his girls Sarah, 19,
     and Victoria, 15. But the crush of fans was so great that he couldn’t even
     move to touch them as the breath was squeezed out of their bodies.
        Yesterday he said: "I've lost everything I had. I blame the police for
     this tragedy. The way they handled the
     situation was appalling."
       Ninety-four died and 170 were
     injured after a surge of fans at the
     Sheffield ground following a police
     order to open a gate.
       Distraught Mr. Hicks, from Pin­
     ner, Middx., said:
      / Sarah and Victoria were stand-
     • ing a little way from me.
         I could see they were being
     pushed, and shouted to one of the
     senior police officers that people
     were being crushed. t
        I didn’t get a very polite answer.
     Then the girls disappeared.
         Soon afterwards I saw them
     being passed on to the pitch.
        I managed to reach them. They
     were both unconscious but there                                              VICTIM: Sarah Hicks
     was no equipment to revive them.
       I tried mouth to mouth resusci­
     tation but Sarah died. .
       Then I went with Victoria in the
     ambulance. I gave her resuscita­
     tion all the way to the hospital A
     but she also died.                7

                       Emotion
       Still shaking with emotion, Mr
     Hicks slammed the police decision
     to open the gate to let a seething
     mass of 4,000 Liverpool fans into
     the already packed ground.
       He said: “I can’t believe they
     could be so incompetent. They
     didn’t realise what was going on.
       “I watched sin old man die near
     me. But they seemed more in­                                           VICTIM: Victoria Hicks

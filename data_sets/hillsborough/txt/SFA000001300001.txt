                                       INTERIM REPORT
               CHAPTER 21 - FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY SERVICES
                                                                                               7
No Fault bv the Emergency Services


296.    I say at the outset of this chapter that no valid criticism
can be made of the response by the St John Ambulance Brigade, by
SYMAS or by the fire brigade on 15 April.                        Indeed, no represented
party ventured any criticism of them.                      The only attack on SYMAS
came.from two Liverpool doctors.                   One claimed that ambulances did
not arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipment and that there
was a lack of triage.                 He was proved to be wrong in all three
respects.       Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on
15 April when he said more lives could have been saved if staff
and equipment had arrived earlier.                   Apart from being proved wrong
in fact as to the times of arrival of ambulances, he conceded in
evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives could have
been saved.         His comments on television were irresponsible.                             The
other doctor complained of the absence of defibrillators.                                     I am
satisfied      on    overwhelming       evidence         that    to     attempt       to    use   a
defibrillator on the pitch with people milling about would have
been    highly      dangerous     owing      to    the    risk     of    injury       from     the
electric charge.


297. I find that all three of the emergency services named above
responded promptly when alerted, :
                                 ;that they brought appropriate
equipment‘and that their personnel operated efficiently.


298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium,
medical facilities capable of dealing with a major disaster such
as     occurred.        To     have     in   advance       at     the       ground,        oxygen,
resuscitators,         stretchers,       other      equipment         and     medical        staff
sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.


299. What is required is a basic level of provision for first
aid,     for    professional          medical      attention          and     for     ambulance
attendance,         together    with ’ia~*System of             co-ordination with             the
                                             110
emergency services which will bring them to the scene swiftly in
whatever      numbers     are   required.            What   will    amount    to    an
appropriate basic provision for the future e.g. the equipment in
a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice.


300. On    the day,     there was no clear understanding between the
Club and Dr Purcell as to his role.                 He believed he was primarily
there to attend to the players.                   The Club regarded him also as
the   "physician      available    to   attend at       the     first   aid room    if
required", as laid down in the Safety Certificate.


301. There     was    insufficiently      close       co-operation      between    the
police and the emergency services.                   It is clear that SYMAS and
the fire brigade should have been.called earlier than they were.
However,   in view of the nature and extent of the crushing,                       the
time when police rescue began and the pathetically short period
for which those unable to breathe could survive, it is improbable
                                              I

that quicker recourse to the emergency services would have saved
more lives.


302. Finally, there was evidence that an advertising board had to
be knocked down at the north-east corner of the ground to allow
an ambulance onto        the pitch and            that at the top of the ramp
leading to the pitch the           access         for ambulances was inadequate.
There   was    also     evidence   that   thepre-match          arrangement   for
ambulances to use the two gates from Penistone Road at the north­
east end of the ground as in and out routes was frustrated by the
presence of vehicles just          inside         the ground.     In theevent, none
of these matters affected          operations.          The hoarding was quickly
knocked down.         The difficult access to the ramp was negotiated
and ambulances used one entrance satisfactorily by backing out
when loaded.

does not justify a finding that an empty cylinder was brought to
the scene.

Calling the Fire Service


18.     P.C. Bichard's call to police Headquarters at 3.13 p.m. for
the   fire   service   to bring hydraulic cutting equipment                  to cut
metal    fences   (see   paragraph      101    supra)   was   heard     by    Chief
Inspector Edmundson.       He went into the adjacent operations room
to give instructions for the message to be passed to the fire
service.  There, a temporary control room assistant was already
speaking to the fire service about a house fire.   Mr Edmundson
interrupted the call and asked the assistant to tell the fire
service that cutting equipment was wanted at Hillsborough.                    There
followed a conversation between the assistant and Miss Davies at
the fire service in the following terms

        Police            Can    we    have1 cutting gear     for   Hillsborough
                         please straight away.


        Fire Control     Just a minute, right what's the address?


        Police           Cutting equipment for Hillsborough              football
                         ground straight away.


        Fire Control     Hillsborough football ground?


        Police           Yes, Hillsborough football ground.


        Fire Control     What road is that on, do you know?


        Police           There   has    been    a major     accident,    all    the
                         ambulances are up there.


        Fire Control     What road is it on?


        Police           I have no idea, Hillsborough football ground.


                                         7
     Fire Control    What road is it on, do you know?


     Police          "Hillsborough football ground, what road is
                     it on?"  (this was said to someone in Police
                     Force Control) - "Penistone Road" (to Fire
                    Control).


     Fire Control    Penistone Road.


     Police          Penistone Road O.K.

     Fire Control    Penistone     Road,   just   a   minute   -   what's
                     exactly involved?


     Police          It's football, a big match, Liverpool v Notts
                     Forest.


     Fire Control   Yes, but why1do you want us, you said it was
                     an RTA (Road Traffic Accident).


     Police         No, no, no, major incident inside the ground.


     Fire Control   Major incident inside,        do you know      exactly
                     what it is?


     Police         No I don't, they want all the cutting          gear.


     Fire Control   For what, do you know?


     Police         Hang on a sec.


At that point Chief Inspector Edmundson intervened and spoke for
the police.   The conversation concluded:-


     Police         (Male voice) - Hello


     Fire Control    Hello, now you want some cutting gear, what
                     exactly is it for?
                                    8
        Police                There   has   been   a major    accident at
                              Hillsborough football ground where the semi­
                              final is, the crowds have forced their way
                              in, they have broken fences and gates down, I
                              don't      know exactly what it is but there are
                              people trapped.


        Fire Control          Right, O.K. leave it with us.


That conversation took 1 minute 13 seconds.                             It was published in
a     number    of    newspapers         with     strong       critical       comment     mostly
against the fire service.   The thrust of the criticism was that
valuable timewas   wastedby the fire service asking unnecessary
questions as towhere and                 why cutting equipment was required.


19.     There was a meeting of the emergency services in August 1988
to    discuss        procedure      in    the     event     of    a     major    disaster       at
Sheffield Wednesday's               ground.          It was pointed out and minuted
that "It was imperative that the Police Control give the exact
location of any fire or incident and as much detail as possible.
No senior fire officer is on duty at the match. ...                              Fire service
will attend via Penistone Road or Leppings Lane as directed by
the police".


20.     The message         from P.C.      Bichard contained all the necessary
information - Leppings Lane end, hydraulic cutting equipment, to
cut    metal     fences.             Regrettably,           it   was      not    passed       on by
Headquarters          in    those    terms.          Miss   Davies       had    rightly       been
trained    to require a precise                  location and needed to know the
problem which would face the fire service so that the appropriate
response could be made.                   In fact,       there are several              football
grounds in the Hillsborough district although clearly Sheffield
Wednesday's ground is the principal one.                         In the result, although
Chief Inspector Edmundson clarified, to an extent, the nature of
the    problem,       the    locus       which       emerged     in     the    course    of    the
conversation          (Penistone      Road)      was    not      that    contained       in    the
original message            from ground control             (ie "Leppings Lane end".)
                                                 9
Whilst on the face of the conversation the fire service may seem
to have been slow in the uptake or perhaps pedantic, in my view
the    police     ought    to    have    been more     specific.      They had     the
necessary information to be so.


21.       I am satisfied however that the delay of 1 minute 13 seconds
over      the   call,   and     even    the delay occasioned by        the cutting
equipment going to Penistone Road rather than Leppings Lane, did
not affect the outcome.  Even had those with cutting equipment
gone directly after a briefer 'phone call they would not have
arrived at a stage early enough to make cutting the fencing a
helpful exercise.


Mr Kennv Dalglish


22. When the Liverpool manager went to the control room and
agreed to make the announcement broadcast at 3.56 p.m., he says
in    a    statement      that   he     could. not    get   the    Tannoy    to   work.
Spectators could see him trying to address them and indicated to
him manually that nothing could be heard.                     An officer pressed
buttons on the machine and Mr Dalglish says he tried again with
similar lack of success.               He was then taken under the police box
to the room used by the disc jockey to broadcast pre-match music.
There, the microphone worked and he broadcast his message.


23.       Mr Dalglish was not called.            There was no other evidence
about this incident.             I accept it occurred as he described.              Why
the Tannoy could not at that time be successfully operated from
the police box is however strange and unexplained.                          Unlike the
radio, it had operated satisfactorily from the police box at the
critical times save that its messages may not always have been
heard above the prevailing noise.                    It had worked at about 3.30
p.m. when it called for medical staff.                  I can see no grounds for
criticising the police in regard to this incident and certain it
is that the brief delay in relaying Mr Dalglish’s message can
have had no significant effect.



                                            10
        32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
      with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

        33. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
      areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
      announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
      noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
      match.

        34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
      Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
      the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
*       35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
    - liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

*       36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
      ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
      spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
      concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
      rooms of each of the emergency services.

*       37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
      services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
      within the ground itself.

*       38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
      the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
      they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
*       39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
      club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

        40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
      equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
      medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

*       41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
      any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
      present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
      match. His whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
      contactable.

*       42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
      attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

        43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
      be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
      requirement of the Safety Certificate.

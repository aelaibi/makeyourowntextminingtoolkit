Dear'Lord Mayor,

I enclose a cheque collected by students and staff of this College for the
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund.

One of our students was on duty as a St. Johns Ambulance volunteer at the
Lepping Lane end and I myself was at the match at the Forest end of the
ground so I am particularly pleased that the College has made a
contribution.

I hope that some of the money will be able to go for some kind of permanent
memorial on behalf of the victims to help the underprivileged of Liverpool.
I am sure the Trustees of the Fund will be taking this into account when
they, decide-how to distribute the money.

Yours sincerely,




Principal.

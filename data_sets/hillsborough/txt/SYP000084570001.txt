    no more     than you w ou l d           expect       behind    the goal     at    such a fixture.                      As

            haired girl        in her teens.            She had died        1    can    remember      the sight       of

            was    going   to die but        there was          nothing    I could do about            it.     I can

            remember vaguely a lot of Police and an a m b ulance                               in front      of me on

            the track but        I could not           really see what was             going on.        The    game    had

            ob v i o u s l y s,topped .     I did see a          lot of    people       on the field but a ga i n              1

            was    not    in a position          to   concentrate        on what was       happening         to them.

            Soon after       I felt       that    spaces were          opening    up behind me were            people

            were     getting   out a l t h o u g h     I was     still    t rapped at the front wit h              dead

            behind assisting          and a           supporter    tried to pull me            back from the

            fencing.       By this        time        I was able       to move my u p p erbody but my           legs

            were     trapped by the weight              of dead        people    lying aro u n d my feet.

            I heard this supporter                    say to the Police, "Leave             them there        dead h e ’s

            a l i v e ” and by moving        some      of the     dead    I was able       to ease myself away                 I

            asked     the Police      if I could help and they said                      1 w ould     be better

             st anding      back out of the way             I tried to get           through the     fencing      onto

             the track       to look for my friends               but they said         I c o u l d n ’t get    through

             and that my friends w o u ld                probably be out        in Leppings Lane.              1 w a 1ked

             back across       the     terraces and sat down in the                   tunnel and started          to

             cr y .

             A short while         later     I saw                           outside    the tunnel      in the

             c o u rt y a r d at the   back    of the stand.            We    left    the ground and w al k ed

             along      the main     road    towards      the    car.    AT    that    time we met H e n r y / C la r ke

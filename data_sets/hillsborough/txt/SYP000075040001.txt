           I am PC905 B U T L E R , I am stationed a t Doncaster Police Station o n

           Rota      1.     I have been there since 6 March 1989 (060389).

           On Saturday 15 April             1989 (150489),          I started duty at D .H .Q .,

           Doncaster, at 8.30 am             (0830).        I was in Se r ial 24.            The Serial

               Sergeant was PS D0L/(N and the PC's in the Serial were BR O O K S H A W ,

           WARl), SOWERB/, CLIFTON, and BOWEN.
                  . -^ y    _____
           At 8.45 am (0845), we boarded the coaches to take us to Hillsborough.

           Ours was the double decker bus.                      There were several           in the convoy.         We

           arrived at the Ground at 9.30 am (0930).

           On arrival we went to the N Stand where the briefing                                    took place at

           10.00 am (1000).           We were seated in our Serials. Serial                           24 was

           about halfway up the stand.                  When it was over we               had our packed meal.

           When the briefing was over we made our way by foot to the area we were
                                                                                        PAGE       2

               to patrol.     Serial 24 had responsibility to patrol     in pairs in

               Middlewood Rd, from Minto Rd to Hillsborough Precinct to maintain

               order and prevent any clash of supporters and to pay special attention

               to shops, and in particular,      licensed premises.    ^ q                 5*^ I

     -         At this time I was in company with PC606 BOWEN.         His name is not on

               the Serial Order;    I understand he was a replacement.

^              On the walk from the Ground I noticed that the area was busy,           traffic

               and shoppers.     During the course of the morning we were approached by

               fans from both sides who wanted to know where the Ground was or where

               they could find a pub which was open.         One group of middle-aged Notts.

               Forest fans asked us where they could get a meal;        they had tried the

               various   public houses   in the immediate area but none were open.

               As the morning progressed we      saw a steady increase in the passage of

               fans from both sides through      the area.    A group of girls,   possibly in

               their late teens or early twenties,        carrying plastic bags containing

               cans,   one of them was holding a large,      less than full,    plastic cider

               bottle,   asked us where the toilets were;      there were about four or five

               in the group.     On dne of our journeys through the shopping area there

               was a group of jovial youths taking photos of each other near the coin

               operated childrens    play machines.

               Quite   late on in the morning    as we were on our way around the

               precinct,    on the bottom edge   of our area fans were going in both

               directions.     Mostly they serried to be in good humour.       Fans from both

               sides were asking us which way it was to their entrance point for the

               game.

               Towards midday there was a steady progression of fans on foot and in

               cars up Middlewood Rd towards the Liverpool entrance.            I recall seeing

               one group of youths sitting on a low wall drinking a bottle of wine

               and eating bags of chips;     this was opposite Minto Rd.

               As the afternoon drew on I saw,numbers of Liverpool fans who I believe
                                                                        PAGE      3
                                                                        S1930

by their    conduct had been drinking.     Shortly before the game, about

300 yards after the traffic lights at the bottom of Middlewood Rd,

three or four youths    crossed the road towards us, the worse for drink?

one of them began walking up the middle of the road.           His friends took

charge of him and they went up towards the stadium.

Shortly before 3.00 pm <1500) we were asked on a lot of occasions by

Liverpool fans where the match was,       or how far was it.    Many of these

fans   looked as though they were the worse for drink.

At about 3.00 pm (1500) we heard that there had been some trouble at

the game,    so we started to walk up towards the stadium along with the

rest of our Serial and Serial 25.        Then a transit van pulled up with

room for 5.     I got in and travelled to the stadium in this way.        When

we got there at first we were told to stand-by,       then to get out,    by

which time the rest of the Serial had arrived and assist in crowd

control.     We were at the Leppings Ln entrance.

At this time there was a steady trickle of fans, a lot of whom were

upset.     Soon after this increased greatly.     Many of them were clearly

upset and 1 was asked on a number of occasions how many were dead, and

did I know what had happened in there.        As well as being upset, many

of the fans    coming out of Leppings Ln were abusive and unco-operative

when they were asked to move away from the road in order to allow

ambulance/fire brigade to pass.

I stayed at Leppings Ln until about 4.45 pm (1645) when we were

instructed to resume    patrol.   I was in company with PC FINNERTY at

this time.     We arrived back at the Ground at about 5.15 pm (1715).

When we got there we we re told to form a cordon to stop people going

into the gym.     Whilst there I was told by the Control Officer to take

charge of body 16.     However, when I had located it, the Control

Officer told me it had already been dealt with.

From there I went to the N Stand for debrief and then to Claywheels

         Ln.    Here we had a meal    in the mobile   canteen,   then boarded the

         transport for D.H.Q.    I went off duty at D.H.G. at 7.45 pm (1945).

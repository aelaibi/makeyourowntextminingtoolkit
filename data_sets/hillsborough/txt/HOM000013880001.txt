           Dear Mr Addison
           HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER : COMPENSATION CLAIMS
           In my two previous letters I have made reference to the uninsured compensation
           liabilities which might arise from impending civil actions against the Chief
           Constable in relation to the Hillsborough disaster.
           Unfortunately although half a year and more has elapsed since the date of the
           disaster, the size of this liability remains a matter of conjecture.
           Nonetheless I am now in the course of preparing a budget for submission to the
           Police Authority in December. Within this budget, provision will have to be
           made for the above costs on the best information that is available in the new
           year in order to raise sufficient money from the precept on the district
           councils.
           The Authority has instructed me to write to you to enquire under what
           circumstances and to what extent the Home Office will consider giving further
           special assistance to the Authority in meeting what could conceivably be a very
           substantial burden.
           I should be grateful for a reply to this enquiry before the end of November so
           that the Police Authority can have some feel of the possible size of this one
           item when considering the rest of the budget for the coming year.
           Yours sincerely

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER : COMPENSATION CLAIMS

Thank you for your letter of 27 October asking under what
circumstances and to what extent the Home Office will consider
giving further special assistance to South Yorkshire Police
Authority in connection with uninsured compensation liabilities
which might arise from impending civil actions against the Chief
Constable.

I am afraid that it is not possible for me to give any very helpful
guidance at this stage. We would of course consider a request for
special payment in addition to the normal police grant at any time.
But since the level of grant was raised to 51% only one such
payment - that already agreed for South Yorkshire following
Hillsborough - has been made.   I can therefore give no indication
whether a further application would be successful or not.

The two criteria which loom largest when we consider requests for
special payment are (a) whether the size of the expenditure is such
that to meet it would involve the police authority in such huge
costs that the viability of the police force would be put at risk
and (b) whether the commitment could have been foreseen (and so
budgeted for).

The problem with compensation liability following Hillsborough is
of course that, although the size and timing of the commitment are
uncertain, the likelihood of the commitment arising'is foreseeable.
We would therefore expect the police authority to make provision
for it in its precept and budget, and if the timescale were
extended the impact of this might well be spread over more than one
year.  I appreciate that there are difficult and complex issues to
be taken into account here but they cannot be avoided and, apart
from their being the police authority's responsibility, the
authority are in a better position than we are here to answer them.
While, therefore, I do not wish to close the door in advance on any
future application from your authority, I have to      say that our
expectation would be that it would have taken steps to cover this
contingency from its own resources (including the grant it receives
from the Government).

I have taken your references to the precept and to the budget for
the coming year as meaning that the authority do not foresee any
payments arising in this financial year.    If, however, there were
any question of costs arising during this financial year on a scale
which seemed to the authority to call for further central
government help, we would require an estimate of the costs involved
and of how much would be recoverable from your insurers in order to
consider any application for a special payment.         However, no
guarantee can be given as to the outcome of such an application.
I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful at this stage.

    I see that from today's press that South Yorkshire Police propose
•   to pay compensation, possibly amounting to some £50 million^to
    surviving victims and relatives of deceased victims. The reports
    implied that the payments would be out of insurance monies.     I
    hope this is correct, although a letter from South Yorkshire
    Police Authority on 10 August referred to their having total
    insurance cover of £8.5 million. If it is not insurance monies,
    I do not see where the money is to be found from. I cannot see
    that compensation payments should qualify as expenditure on which
    police grant is payable®and I imagine that FD1 would see no
    reason (other than political) for the Home Office to make a
    contribution to the costs under the heading of a special payment
    out of a cash limited vote.

    Although FD2 were provided with a copy of a letter of 10 August
    from the Police Authority in which it warned that it might have
    to make provision in closing its account for the year for damage
    in excess of insurance cover, we have not been consulted since
    by Police Department, nor were we forewarned of the present
    announcement.© As far as I know, the only mention to Ministers
    of the possibility of South Yorkshire having to pay compensation
    out of its own funds due to under-insurance was contained in a
    minute which you sent to Mr Walters of 29 September.          No
    suggestion was made about how much the Home office would respond
    to a request for funding in such circumstances.

    I do not know whether FD1 have been approached since then. But
    I should welcome any clarification which Police Department can
    provide about the source of the proposed compensation.




                                                                                                 N A NAGLER

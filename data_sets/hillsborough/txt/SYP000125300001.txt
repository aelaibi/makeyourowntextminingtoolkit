Q52

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO.

Q53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THE POLICE WERE VERY SLOW TO REACT.    THERE SEEMED A TOTAL LACK OF

COMPREHENSION BY THE POLICE AS TO WHAT WAS GOING ON.     I SAW POLICE   ARRESTING

THE FIRST FANS WHO CLIMBED OVER THE FENCE TO GET OUT OF THE CRUSH.      I ALSO   SAW

POLICE TRYING TO PUSH FANS BACK INTO THE PENS ONCE THEY’D GOT OUT.      THERE

SEEMED NO ORGANISATION, EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED APPEARED TO BE ON THE FANS

iftlATIVE, THE POLICE JUST JOINED IN.

WHEN I SAY "FANS INITIATIVE’ I MEAN THE RIPPING DOWN OF FENCES, THE TEARING

DOWN OF HOARDINGS TO USE AS STRETCHERS & THE FERRYING OF THE DEAD & INJURED.

IT WAS THE FANS WHO INITIATED THIS, NOT THE POLICE <& PULLING PEOPLE OUT INTO

THE SEATS BEHIND).

I NEVER SAW A STEWARD ALL DAY.

I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE DID NOT REALISE THE MIDDLE PENS WERE FULL

AT 1430. <1430)

THERE WAS A TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER 1430 <1430) ASKING PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE

T ^ P E N S TO MOVE FORWARD TO ALLOW PEOPLE AT THE BACK IN.

THE POLICE/STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE REALISED THE PENS WERE FULL & EITHER CLOSED

OFF THE TUNNEL OR DIRECTED PEOPLE AWAY FROM IT (REALISED FROM EITHER THE CLOSE
CIRCUIT TV OR FROM THE PITCH).

THERE WAS SO MUCH ROOM IN PENS 6/7 COMPARED TO T H E/)MIDDLE PENS.

 d UI   YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 JUST THAT    NO ONE DID ANYTHING SOONER, I MEAN WECOULD         SEE THAT THE TWOPENS

 (3 & 4) WERE PACKED OUT AT 2.30 PM (1430).

 WHAT TIME    DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 5.00 PM (1700).

 I COULDN’T BELIEVE THE NEWSPAPER REPORTERS THROUGHOUT ALL THAT WAS GOING ON

 INSIDE, NONE OF THEM WERE HELPING PEOPLE, THEY WERE MORE INTERESTED IN TAKING

 PHOTOGRAPHS AND I’LL NEVER FORGIVE THEM FOR THAT.       BEFORE THE GAME STARTED

 THE GATES TO THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE

 SHOWN PEOPLE TO THE OTHER STANDS.

 THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF STEWARDS.       ALSO IT WAS JUST THE AMOUNT OF POLICE

 THAT CAME FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GROUND AND THEY FORMED A LINE RIGHT THE

 W £ ACROSS THE HALFWAY LINE, IT’S JUST THEIR FIRST PRIORITY SEEMS TO BE

 HOOLIGANISM.    I JUST THINK THAT THE AMOUNT OF THEM THAT THERE WERE, COULD HAVE

 HELPED MORE WITH THE FANS THAT WERE IN TROUBLE INSTEAD OF DOING NOTHING.          I

 JUST WISH THE GAME HAD BEEN STOPPED OR DELAYED FOR 1/2 (HALF) AN HOUR WHILST

 EVERYONE GOT IN.

 I SAW A STREET TRADER IN LEPPINGS LANE HAVE HIS STALL KNOCKED OVER AND SCARVES

 AND OTHER GOODS STOLEN BY FANS BEFORE THE MATCH.         INSIDE THE GROUND, I SAW AT

 LEAST TWO FANS HIT POLICE OFFICERS,
                                                                               PAGE

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS      ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION INITIALLY, BUT NO-ONE KNEW WHAT WAS

HAPPENING.      ONCE PEOPLE REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING, THE POLICE AND OTHERS

WORKED TOGETHER TO KICK THE FENCING DOWN AND CARE FOR THE INJURED.

 IN RETROSPECT, I THINK IT WAS RKHjT Tq OPEN THE OUTER GATE TO PREVENT

 Ii^URIES AND/QR DEATHS OUTSIDE THE GRQJUND.    I THINK THAT WITH SOME WARNING

TC) STEWARDS AND POLICE INSIDE THE GROUND, A CORDON COULD HAVE BEEN PUT ACROSS

THE TUNNEL.     LOTS OF LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS DIDN’T HAVE   TICKETS.    IT MAY HAVE

HELPED TO DELAY THE MATCH, TO ALLOW LATECOMERS       INTO THE GROUND SAFELY.   A LOT

OF THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS HAD BEEN DRINKING,       AND WENT TO THE GROUND ATTHE

LAST MINUTE, JUST BEFORE THE MATCH WAS DUE TO START.

             I am a single man and live at the at^ove address with my F iancee.

             My home is situated                                              [the Leppings Lane

             entrance to Sheffield Wednesday / % Football Ground.




             On Saturday 15th April           1989 (13041989) I was at home but intended to

             leave and visit relatives at            a.bo/At 3.00pm <1500).

             I was aware that this was the date of a semi final F.A. cupfootball

             match at Sheffield Wednesday's football ground between Liverpool and

             Nottingham Forest so decided to leave leaving the                 house until   after

             the visiting fans had got to            the ground.

             At a              OQaffi (0700) I woke up and looked out of my
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S39S

        wearing red and white shirts and scarvej/i       I was surprised at such an

        early arrival and after this I went J ita c k to bed.    I got up at about

         1.00am <1100) and remained in m y /Living Room m ost of the time

        between 11.00am (1100) and 2\45/m (1443).

        During this time I saw large numbers of f ootiyfl 1 fans going past my

        front window.    Many of these were drinking/Trom cans of beer but all

        were quiet and seemed happy and jovial .       I saw some fans sit on the

        wall at the front of the house eating chips but no-one was causing

        any problems or making excessive noise.

        At about 2pm (1400) the traff i c travelling along Leppings Lane came

        to a halt.     I looked outside and coyld see that this was as a result

        of a large crowd that had gathers'® around the entrance of the

        grqund.    The traff ic began\to/(ove af ter about 10 mi nutes.

           about 2.50pm (1450) I left home.       I went out of the front door and

         lanced up towards the ground.       I could see that there was a large

        crowd outside the front of the ground.       There was no sign of any

        queues leading to the turnstiles. A he crowd stretched back as far as

        the small grocery shop next to thfe ground and onto the road.

        A y this time faps were still ar/iving at the ground and walking down

         eppings Lane.

        I only had a quick glance and could not say if there was any pushing

        taking place.    However,    I believe   that toomany fans obviously    left

           too late getting to the ground        to allow time to get through   the

        turnstiles.

        Normally most fans are into the ground before 3pm <1500) but there

        seemed to be far more outside than normal.In fact I have never seen

        such a large crowd at this ground in the           /ears I ’ve been living
        here.

                                                                                IGNED

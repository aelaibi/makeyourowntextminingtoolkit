            Dear- Sir,
            HiIIstjorough"Resumed' Inquests                                                       TSrNovember 1990                                        ,
            l a m grateful for your letter-of the 31 October 1990, tiie contents of which we
            note. "•
            I would take this opportunity to clarify with you that Lord Justice Taylor's,
            report will not be used'in evidence unless matters .of fact can be agreed between
            all representatives.
            I note that statements are being prepared to he used as “scene setters"*. This
            seems to be an-excellent idea'artd.l would be most obliged to rcceive copies of
            those statements in due course.                                  .
            I am aware that, you wore to re-consider the question of circulating a list of
            proposed witnesses. This would be of Immense benefit to me in view of my
            general interest on behalf of.the officers of Federated rank as a whole, and I
            would be obliged to receive such a -list at your earliest convenienceshould •
            you take the! view, that such a course of action is appropriate.
            Finally, -I can confirm that Miss-Andrea Addleman of Counsel will beattending,
            the Inquests, instructed on behalf of this firm.
            .Yours faithfully.

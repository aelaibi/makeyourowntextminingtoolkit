of     supporters.                  I      saw      that       elements         of    the m o u n t e d s e c t i o n we re

This       was       to a l l e v i a t e          pressure          on t h e       turnstiles.

Soon       after          I arrived             outside           the     g ate     it w a s     opened          to a l l o w       me     to

being          forced against                   the      gates        because        of    the      pressure           of    the       crowd.

and      pull        h er     to    safety.              She      was     in the      region          of    11-14 years                old.

people          as    I could              and      I saw         another         Police     Officer who               had b e e n        on

themselves.                  I saw a m ou nt e d                  officer         with     his      horse        against          a w a ll ,

The    area     outside         these        gates     became          clear       of    supporters.

A   short     time     later          I was     called        i n to    the    ground,           through          t he     concertina

When     I got       into       the    ground        I saw       a great          many    supporters, Police                         and

I initially           started           to    pull    people        over      the       front        fence       as     they

clambered        out.           I then       saw another            officer         run t o w a r d s           enclosure            1

went     into    the      enclosure            1 stand across                to    the        fence       which        divides

enclosure        2 and 3 where                 I saw      it was        not       possible           to    enter        this

enclosure        without          making        some      space.

I then        entered        enclosure          3 and was              immediately aware                   t hat       some     of       the

situation,

I then        requested and                   received aid           from 2 other              supporters           in t his

stand and            started          to      pull     bodies       away      from      the    fence       where        we    laid

them       on the         terracing            behind        us.     Those       not     unconscious              were       lifted

straight            over       the    side         fence     into    enclosure           2 where         a Police            Sergeant

< name      and      number          not      kno wn)      was     organising           a team       of h e l p e r s .

I then        helped           to    p a ss    unconscious           bodies        across       t his      fence        at    one

time       I attempted               to    give      artificial           respiration           to    one m a l e        person

but    because            of    the       crowd      of    people        stepping        on m y s e l f     and     the       body         it

was    not      really          possible,            so    I passed        him across           the      side      fence         also.

I must        have        passed          between         15-20     persons        across       t hi s     fence        s om e

conscious            but m a n y          unconscious.

Once       t hi s    area       had       been      cleared,        1 l e ft     enclosure           3 and        was

immediately               deployed            at    the    opposite        end     of    the    ground          restraining

Liverpool            supporters               who    had     run    to    the    Nottingham Forest                  Stand

(Spi on Hop)              and       was    part      of    the P o l i c e      link     across       the       pitch.

Before        I left           enclosure            3 an     o bj e ct    hit    my     helmet       which        I was

wearing,            it w as         a man's         wr i s t w a t ch a n d     it a p p e a r e d    to    have        been

thrown        from        the       upper      terracing.            I did       not     recover         t h is    item.

Shortly        after           this       1 wa s     deployed        outside          Leppings        Lane        entrance            in

the a l l e y        running          between          the    ground and           the    r iver      where        numerous

injured        and        dead       people         wre    l aid    on    the    floor        and    on s t r e t c h e r s

awaiting            ambulances.

A Police            message          was      passed       over     loudspeakers              asking       the     crowd         to

remain        in the           ground         so    emergency        vehicles           could       remove        the    injured.

1' w a s    then         deployed          outside         Leppings        Lane       gates     holding           back       the

crowd,       who         were       leaving         the    ground,        so a m b u l a n c e s     could        carry       out

the i r t a s k s .

A   number          of    fans       verbally abused                us   when      they       left    the       ground.

             states:
1,   I was born on the 23rd July 1964.   I am 24 years old.
2.   I joined the ambulance service on 6th October 1980 as a

     Cadet at Dun^ford House, Wath where I completed two years

     training before moving to Parkway Ambulance Station on the

     5th or 6th October 1982.     I moved to Barnsley Ambulance
     Station, where I am now based, in January 1984.

     I attended the compulsory residential six week training

     course and obtained the Miller Certificate qualification.

     On Saturday the 15th April 1989, I was working the 0900 to
     Ho
     ^ 3 0 hours day shift.

     The second crew member was                  .         was the

     driver throughout the day and I the attendant.

             and I had attended the Keresfor^F Day Centre on a
     routine transfer of a patient to the Barnsley District

     General Hospital Casualty department.     We were waiting for
     the patient and watching television.    At approximately 1505

     hours           and   I saw on television the incident at

     Hillsborough Football Ground.   The patient at the Day Centre

     had been made ready and was loaded onto the ambulance.      We

     were making our way to the Hospital when we .xecejjZBjti—»

     message£from Control to proooed to the Hillsborough Football

     Ground where there were crush injuries.   Control ordered all

     vehicles proceeding to Hillsborough to switch to the ERC
     frequency.

     We arrived at Barnsley District General Hospital Casualty

     department, reported to Control who instructed us to clear
     the Hospital as soon as possible.                      and I took the

     patient into Casualty and handed the patient over.                     We
                                   A   (Kbiom.           ( a tw o           i/3
     returned to the vehicle, I r-adiood Control and -reported that

     wo wore proceeda^f to the Hillsborough Football Ground.

     Control advised that there were crush injuries and possible

     fatalities.   I went into the rear of the ambulance and made

     ready my equipment to save as much time as possible when we
     arrived at the Football Ground.



8.   We travelled swiftly towards Hillsborough.          We joined the Ml
     and left at Junction 36 travelling along the A61 to Wadsley

     Bridge where the Police had cordoned off the road and along

     Penistone Road towards the Football               Ground.      Control
                                                                     <sF
     instructed us to report to the gymnasium entrance                     the

     ground. The police directed us from Penistone Road into the

     gymnasium entrance which is marked green on the plan
     attached to this statement.        As we were arriving I saw an
     ambulance driven by                   leaving the ground.

     drove the vehicle in and the scene that greeted me when the

     rear doors of the vehicle were opened was chaotic.               There

     were many people seeking assistance and several casualties

     were laid on the ground.                    and I were marshalled by

                   who instructed us to attend casualties who were

     at the Penistone Road side of the Spion Kop.                   left me

     at this stage and he carried out checks on casualties in the
     area.   I attended one casualty who was in the recovery
     position on an advertising hoarding board. He was bluish,
     unconscious,     his breathing was noisy and difficult and a

     portex airway had been               inserted.            There were                   police

     constables and fans around him.              I made a quick check of the

     casualty and I immediately knew I had to do something very

     quickly.      The police constables and fans helped move him

     into the ambulance.      I wanted to get this casualty into the
     ambulance to give him oxygen. I cannot remember the time but

     I presume we arrived quite early in terms of the timescale

     of the incident.      The casualty was placed on to an ambulance
     cot.      When on the cot I attempted to remove the portex

     airway to carryout a finger sweep.                   I was unable to remove

     the airway.     His jaw was tightly gripping the airway and
                                  OlttM   T H £ ~ M /S T O ^ V A A zO   S A S /jS    t- T
     was in a spasm.        'V ™r indicated to me that the casualty

     needed oxygen.     The cot was lifted into the vehicle.                                Oxygen
     was on hand and I remember a police woman asking if she

     could     accompany    the    casualty.             She      had       apparently

     resuscitated this particular casualty three times.                                          I

     believe her number was 3315.                       returned to the vehicle

     with a casualty.                 wanted to load a second casualty

     onto the vehicle and I agreed he should do this.                               The second
     casualty was loaded.

9.   I put the first casualty (P 1) on 15 litres per minute of

     oxygen.     The woman police constable climbed into the rear of

     the ambulance and I showed her how to keep Pi's airway free.
               was in the rear of the vehicle showing fans how to
     give oxygen to the second casualty (P 2) who was also in the

     recovery position.      The fans helped give P2 oxygen until I
         took over and carried out a check of P2 to make sure there

         were no obvious Injuries.       P2 was gasping for air and

         arching his back which suggested to me that he was suffering

         from internal injuries.   I returned to PI and tried again to
         remove the portex airway.     The airway would not come free

         and I used suction to clear the airway passage of mucus and
                          fgO M A f&msfo T Z>M&Uk -
         traces of bloody     PI was still a bluish colour. He had not

         been receiving oxygen for any length of time and I was not

         surprised to see him still blue.
10   .                marshalled the ambulance out of the ground into
         Penistone Road and          drove towards the hospital. The

         ambulance was escorted by a police outrider and travelled on
         red using the blue flashing lights and two tone horn.

11.      I carried out a light reaction test on PI.    The reaction was

         slow which indicated to me he was still short of oxygen

         although his pupil dilation in each eye was equal.                I was

         only too well aware that both patients were desperately ill.
         P2 was still being attended to by the fans in the rear of
                                                              A u l ig u t '
         the ambulance and I asked them if they were feeling well .

         They told me that they were fine and I insisted that they

         should keep the oxygen mask on P2's face.

12.      I continued to carry out tests on PI to check his response.

         I carried out nail bed tests and pupil light reaction tests.

         PI was not responding in the first few minutes to the oxygen
         and I thought that there must ob^ineuaiby be something else
         wrong with him.    I carried out a further check and didn't
                                                      Oi& iS c g H
         discover any apparent injuries to his h e a d ^    I checked his




                                     4&o
      pupil light reaction after several minutes and I noticed

      that there was an improvement.        They reacted to light much

      faster than on the first occasion I had carried out this

      test.    PI was still biting hard on the airway and I again
      used suction to clear the air passage.

13.   The ambulance arrived at the Northern General Hospital

      Casualty department,       the back doors opened and P2 was

      removed first from the rear of the vehicle.            I carried out

      a further pupil light response test on PI whose response was i\c

      instantaneous.       I told the woman police constable who
      appeared to be very relieved at this.             I stayed in the

      ambulance whilst             handed over P2 to the Casualty
      department staff.

14.   Someone,    although I cannot remember who helped me with PI

      and he was transported into the casualty department.             The

      WPC followed me and PI.      Whilst in casualty department the

      patient PI spat out the portex airway.          I told the WPC this
      was a good reaction.   The WPC was obviously distressed and I

      tried to comfort her too.

15.   PI was wheeled through to the resuscitation room.           The sight

      in the resuscitation room was horrendous.             There were no

      spare cots and after a minute or so a spare cot was found.

      PI was transferred onto a hospital cot and I passed all the

      details about his condition in the ambulance to a doctor

      (male) and I told him of the improvement in his status

      during     the   journey   and   on   arrival    at   the   Casualty
      department.
16 .   I looked for the ambulance's cots but they had gone missing.

       I collected two other cots and returned to the ambulance.                     I
       radioed Control who Instructed                              and I to return to

       Hillsborough               and    use     Channel     3.             drove   to

       Hillsborough on red.                      We left the WPC at the Northern

       General Hospital.
17,    We arrived at the Penistone Road gymnasium entrance and
       queued behind other ambulances who were also waiting to gain

       access to the ground.                     We were there for quite a while

       perhaps fifteen minutes.                   Whilst we were waiting I could see

       fans pouring out of the ground spilling onto Penistone Road.

       After a short time Station Officer Paul Eason asked

       and I for the body bags in the ambulance.                         We were only

       carrying one body bag and I gave that to                                     We
       moved up the line of ambulances and Paul Eason approached
       the vehicle and told                          and I that the system to gain

       entrance into the gymnasium area was now to drive past the

       exit and reverse into the ground.                     Ao our "voM.olc—wac being

       that the patient had dislocated knees. I arranged a lift for

       the patient onto the ambulance                     and I then showed him how to
                              Z&Vii&H&ZJT'
       use the entonox mack which administer a painkilling gas.                      A

       man on foot approached the ambulance.                      He had blood running
       out of his left ear.                 The police were accompanying him.       He
       was on his feet conscious and although he was walking I was
       concerned about blood running from the ear.              I sat him down
       on the ambulance and whilst he was sitting down an ambulance

       man was brought to our vehicle.             He had been attacked by a

       fan and was placed on the vehicle and                   and I were told

       to leave the ground and go to the Northern General Hospital.



18.    I radioed Control and informed Control we were leaving the
       ground with      three patients           for the Northern General

       Hospital.    Control instructed us not to go to the Northern

       General Hospital and to drive to the Royal Hallamshire

       gain access to the hospital.           When we arrived at the Royal
       Hallamshire Hospital there were press men and T.V. cameras

       recording the incident.         As we waited to be attended to we

       could see there were lots of empty cots in the area and
       there were many casualties,             and many doctors,      nurses,

       porters,    policemen and people not in uniform attendingto

       them.   A doctor took charge of our casualties.               We handed

       over the casualties and passed over all the information to
       him.    The casualty with the splintered legs was wheeled
       away.

19.    I radioed Control to report clear at the Royal Hallamshire.

       I was   told     that   we were      to    stand   by   at   the   Royal
       Hallamshire.
        Severn-*—

                      the Standards and Efficiency Officer to transfer
         a patient from Ward F2 to the King Edwards Hospital.                                   I
         contacted                she gave details of two patients to be

         handed over at King Edwards at about 1830 hours or 1845
         hours in the evening.
21   .   We radioed Control to inform them we were clear at the King

         Edwards Hospital.      Control ordered us back to our base.                      We

         drove back to our base, arrived at 1900 or 1905 hours and we

         left the station at 1910 hours.
22   .   The call sign of the vehicle was bravo 1101.
23.      I am aware of the Major Incident Plan.

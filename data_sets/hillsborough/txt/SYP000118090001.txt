Our    terms of r ef e re n ce was the sea rc hi ng                   of fans     coming through

t urnstiles A ~ G at the                 rear of the West Stand,              L ep pi ng s Lane    end

inside the ground for alcohol,                       weapons,        etc.

We were        in p os ition at           11.15am.

Several        fans    had started drifting              into       the ground by this          time and I

noticed that           there was about            six fans in the           centre n or th     pen.

F r o m then until a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2p m there was a gradual                    increase of

fans     coming       into     the ground.         The m a j o r i t y were good h um ou r ed and

friendly.           There was       no problems at this stage but                     I did notice a

number       of s up po r te r s    outside       the t ur ns ti le s a tt em p ti n g to enter            the

gr ou nd with ou t a ticket.                  I saw m o n ey o f fe re d to several           t urnstile

operators w he n            I was   present.         W h e n that happe ne d the fans did an

a bout     turn and m i n g l e d w it h the other                 s upporters who were        q ue ueing i

S t a n d also to s u p er v is e a number ©f                 fans.

Between Spm-2.30pm               it was obvious         there was a f a i r ly large number of
fans outs i de the t ur ns ti le s without                               tickets.           During        this time                       I was

paying        particular a t t e n t i o n to the t ur ns ti le s whe n it became apparent

that a number of o p er at or s were                               taking    payment.                I the re fo re              flitted

no real        problems at this time-

Ab ou t 2 . 3 0 p m there was a large number of fans                                        coming        t h ro ug h the

turns ti le s m a n y of w h o m had been d ri nk i ng but were                                        not drunk.

Several        cans of beer and                            lager had bee n    ’binned*               in the          litter basket

apparent.

been        i n c reased tremendously.

Our     serial          Inspector,                   Inspector White was            not      present from 2 . 3 0 p m and

I did        not see him until                              about 3.30pm.

I was        unable to estim at e                          the number    of fans on e nt ering the ground

2 . 3 0 ”2.45pm.         There a p p e a r e d to be a number          of fans having       d if fi cu lt y

getting        through the turn st il es            because    of the sheer weight          of the

supporters.             I did not          consider the seven t urnstiles a de qu at e             for the

velum® and           I, did notice tur ns ti le        "G* w h i ch was       the one closest to

that     it was a double              t urnstile w h i c h was      se pa ra te d by a dividing

w o o d e n partition.            B o l t e d on to the   p a rt it io n was     large woo de n blocks

d ir ec t ly facing            the t urnstiles      to prevent illegal           entry.    The sheer .

weight       on this       p a rt it io n had d is t or t ed   it    an d the blocks had jammed

a ga in st     the    turn st il es ma ki ng them inoperative.                 A number of fans had

climbed over            or under         the turns ti le s at the       point.

T he re also a p p e a r e d to be some d i ff i c u l t y w it h t ur nstile             *A * .     A

police offi ce r who was on duty outside                       turnstile       *G* was    in danger        of

gett in g      crushed         a nd   I pulled him over        the turnstile      into    the ground.

I was s ub j ec t ed           to thre ats and o b sc en it ie s       from a number of Liverpool

fans who were             s ho ut in g     "Get fucking out there and get s om e th i ng done

before       someone gets killed".                Their m oo d was a gg re ss iv e a n d         it was

obvious        they had been drinking.

A large number             of a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 0 fans had    climbed over the

perimeter wall             pnto the t urnstile         roof.        Several    were   caught and

ejected.           W hi ls t   eject in g one of these fans             I saw a f a t t i s h L iverpool

s up porter had a bundle of ticket                    stubs    to one of the fans on the

tur n s t i l e    roof who       in turn threw them d ow n to the               crowd at the other

s ide of the          perimeter wall.

A b o u t 2 . 4 5 p m Gate      *€*      o pened and about     f ifty fans burst t h ro u g h the

gate.,       I ran to the g^te wit h PC               1278 L a n g and m a n a g e d to secure           the

gate    together w i t h the stewards.                    ,

Despite        losing      radio      contact    I was aware        that the s i t u a t io n was being

w o u l d have been e j e c t e d n or ma l ly for their a tt it ud e             caused through

drink but the* s i t u a t io n at this s tage was not                    practicable.

S u d d e n l y * G at e    ’C ’ a p p e ar e d to burst o pe n again a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.50pm-*

2 . 5 5 pm a large          number       of fans   ran t h ro u gh   into the    centre tunnel        of

the L ep pi n gs L an e end.

It w as noti ce ab le at this time that                    the sit ua ti on had q u ie te ne d down

considerably.

S h o r t l y a fter 3p m there was a r a di o /t a nn o y message               that all     officers

were     requi re d on the* perimeter               track.

I took my serial              onto the        perimeter    track     via the    rear of the Police

Control       into the S o u t h S ta nd and over             the wall.        I i ns tr uc te d them to

stay together as a serial                    beca us e of the        number of Police      officers

who were on the field at that time an d                         I went straight        to perimeter

fence at Pe n 3.               I saw a l a r g e b unch of       people    piled on top of each

other a g ai ns t          the wall a nd up agai ns t         the s ec ur it y fencing.           The No.

3 Gate was         par ti al ly open and had been w e d g e d by a number                  o f bodies.

It was a pp ar e nt          that the s i tu at io n was serious at this stage and

s pe ed was essential.                   I was unable to get through the gate                because of

the bodies,          therefore,           I climbed onto the s ec ur it y fencing an d pulled

several       fans f rom the mass a nd over                the fencing together w i t h my

serial.        The m a j o r i t y of these a p p e a r e d      in shock      but were    conscious.

I then went          to the gate w i t h Chief S u pe r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit w he re w ith

d if fi cu lt y m a n a g e d to         pull a number     of bodies a wa y from the gate

  D u r i n g the w hole ’incident           eh the field      I was hot s ub j ec t ed to threats

  or a buse        but   I; did see a number of flare ups m a in l y by fans who had

  been d r i n k i n g an d wer e w a n d e ri n g about aimlessly.              This was

  understandable           under    the circumstances.              I did see a number         of coins

  being t h r o w n onto the         field.

  A    lot of P o l i c e officers,          S t . Johns Ambulance,        were e ng a ge d        in

  resuscitation.            M i n y w e re   shouting    for oxy g en w h ic h was not

  forthcoming.

  I ni t i a l l y m y feelings       were of f r us t r a t i o n because I was unable                 to    get

  to the       people     because     of the secur it y fencing.             Perh ap s if I could

  h a v e , we m a y have        been able to save a lot more              lives.      The actual

  gates were w h o l l y         inadequate     si m p l y because     there was      not en ou gh and

  the ones w h i c h are          there are too small.

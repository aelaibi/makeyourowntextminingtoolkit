               On    Saturday              15 A p r i l      1989            <150489)           I went           together          with     my      girl    friend

                                           to    the     Semi           Final           between        Liverpool             and       Nottingham          Forest

               held      at     Hillsborough                 F o o t b a 11             G r o u n d , Sheffield.

               We    arrived              at    the    ground               at    around        1430           (1430)       to    1435    <1435)          hours

               and      went        into        the    Leppings                  Lane     entrance.

               My    girl        friend          went     with              one    of     my    friends              into    the       North     Stand.

               There       was        a    large       number               of    supporters               in    the    entrance          to     the      ground

               but      I got         to       the    t u r n s t i 1e , with               everyone             pushing.

               There       was        two       Policemen               t h e re a n d         one     shouted          “ If      you    d o n ’t    stop

               pushing,             I am        going     to           shut       the     gate."

               I eventually                    got    in a n d          then        saw     supporters                climbing          over     the      wall    by

               the      turnstiles               to    get         in.           They     were       shouting           to       the    Police       to    open

               the      gates         or       people     would              get        killed       in        the    crush       outside.

                                                                                                                                  S3600

At    around       1440       (1440)          I saw       a    gate       which       I now    know       to     be    Gate       'C *

opened       for       a matter          of       seconds.           I again          saw    the    same       gate       opened         at

about       1455       hours       (1455),

I didn't          see    who       opened          it    but    there       was       Stewards        and      Police        by       it.

I eventually             found          my    seat       in    the    West       Stand.        I was          looking        down       at

Gate       4 and       this       was    just       after       the       game    had       started       when        I saw       fans

being       let    out    of       the       gate       by    a Police      Officer,          and      then        within         a

matter       of    seconds          he       told       t h e m to   get    back       into         the       pen a n d    shut        the

gate.        I cannot             describe          the       Policeman          at    all.

The    next       thing       I    remember             was    fans       climbing          over    the       perimeter           fan,

and    one       particular             fan       standing       on       the    hoarding          pulling        at      the     mesh.

A    Police       Officer          went       over       to    this       lad    grabbed       him       around        the      neck        and

threw       him    to    the       ground.              After    a    short       time       the    Police        Officer

realised          what    the       lad       was       trying       to    do    and then           s t a r t e d to      help        the

fans       rip    the    mesh       away.

My    criticism          is       the    lack       of       response       on    the       part    of    the      Police         to

requests          by    the       fans       to    give       them    assistance,             and     also       there       lack        of

c omrnuni c a t i o n .

A    lot    of    Police          officers          were       just       standing          around       as     if a f r a i d        that

if    they       did    anything,             they       would       be    reprimanded             later       rather        than

using       their       own       initiative.

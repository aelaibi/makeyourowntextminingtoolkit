Dear Sirs,
Hillsborough Inquiry
Thank you for your letter of 7 August 1989. It
helpful that in Lord Justice Taylor's view the.*oice of
venue could only be said to be causative if the ^eppings
Lane End was incapable of being successfully policed,
did not believe that to be so.
In these circumstances we agree with you that it       J*®11
be the case that claims will not be pursued ^inist o
clients despite the written submission °f Counsel for th
bereaved and injured. If they        o u r clients will of
rniirse consider with your clients the line to be taKen.
In this connection we would be grateful                 SSn
us copies of any correspondence or documents passing
between yourselves and the solicitors to the families and
notify us of developments.

Yours faithfully,




For the attention of
Herbert Smith

INFO      » OUTSIDE THE GROUND IT WAS TOTALLY DISORGANISED, THE POLICE WERE
              TRYING TO GET PEOPLE INTO QUEUES BUT JUST MADE IT WORSE, I GOT
              INTO THE GROUND AT ABOUT 1445HRS THROUGH THE TURNSTILES AND IT
              WAS FULL THEN. WHEN THE GAME KICKED OFF THERE WAS JUST ONE SURGE
              OF PEOPLE FROM BEHIND. THE ONES AT THE FRONT TRIED CLIMBING OVER
              AT FIRST POLICE TOLD THEM TO GET BACK THINKING IT WAS A PITCH

INFO      » AS WE APPROACHED THE GROUND WE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS NO
            ORGANISATION COMPARED TO LAST YEAR - THERE WERE HARDLY ANY POLICE
            ABOUT. THEY OPENED THE GATES AND EVERYONE JUST RUSHED IN. WHEN
            THE MAIN CRUSH HAPPENED I WAS ABOUT TEN FEET BACK FROM THE FRONT
            BARRIER. I JUST GOT MINOR CUTS TO MY HAND. I COULDN'Y SEE THE
            PITCH, BUT I COULD SEE LADS CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT FENCES AND
            POLICE PUSHING THEM...

BACK INTO THE PEN. I COULD SEE BODIES LYING ON THE FLOOR ABOUT SIX FEET IN
FRONT OF ME. I'VE STILL GOT MY TICKET - NOBODY CHECKED IT. I THINK THE POLICE
WERE OUT OF ORDER SAYING THAT THE FANS WERE LOOTING AND SUCH - I ONLY SAW THE
FANS HELPING THE INJURED AND CARRYING PEOPLE AWAY AND SUCH.
I WAS WITH MY MATES?

THE WALL AND THE FENCE AT THE BACK . BY THE TIME OF THE KICK OFF IT WAS STILL
ONLY A THIRD FULL. FIRST THING I SAW WAS PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE TOP ONTO
THE PITCH. AT FIRST I THOUGHT THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG BECAUSE THIS HAD
HAPPENED AT THE DERBY MATCH AT ANFIELD THIS SEASON. I ALSO SAW PEOPLE BEING
PULLED TO THE SEATS UPABOVE. IT WAS CHAOS THEN . AT 3:15PM THE POLICE CAME
ONTO THE PITCH BUT DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO, THEY WERE JUST STANDING
THERE THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY GUIDANCE. I DIDNT REALISE THAT PEOPLE HAD DIED.
PEOPLE WERE COMING ONTO THE PITCH INJURED AND RED AND BLUE FACES. THIS HAD
AMK1APPENED WHILST I WAS ABOUT 20 FEET AWAY FROM IT . I SAW 2 OR 3 PEOPLE
SHOUTING ABUSE BUT THE POLICE GOT THEM OFF THE PITCH.

CONCERNED, I MANAGED TO GET TO THE LEFT OF THE GOAL BUT COULDN'T CONTROL

GIRLFRIEND                        ( 20)                        LIVERPOOL
FRIEND
IT ALL SEEMED TO START OUTSIDE THE GROUND IN LEPPINGS LANE, THERE APPEARED TO
BE TOTAL LACK OF POLICE SUPERVISION AND NOBODY CHALLENGED ME TO SEE IF I HAD
GOT A TICKET LIKE THEY USUALLY DO AT CUP MATCHES LIKE THIS, I GOT INTO THE
QUEUE FOR THE TURNSTILES AND NOTICED THAT THE GATES HAD BEEN OPENED BY THE
POLICE AND THAT THEY WERE DRAGGING PEOPLE THROUGH TO GET THEM OUT OF THE
CRUSH OUTSIDE THE GROUND. TOGETHER WITH MY GIRLFRIEND WE MADE OUR WAY
THROUGH THE TUNNEL AND INTO PEN 3. IT WAS FULL THEN BUT THERE WERE NO
STEWARDS TO DIRECT US TO THE OTHER STANDS WHICH WERE EMPTY ON THE OTHER SIDE.
WE STARTED OFF AT THE BACK FIRST OF ALL BUT AFTER A SHORT WHILE I FOUND
MYSELF ABOUT THREE YARDS FROM THE FRONT OF THE TERRACE. I BEGAN TO LOOK
ARflttND AND NOTICED THAT PEOPLE WERE TURNING BLUE AND THAT ONE MAN HAD
DlSrPED DEAD TO THE SIDE OF ME. MY GIRLFRIEND FAINTED AND HAD TO BE PULLED
UP AND CARRIED OVER EVERYBODYS HEAD TO GET HER OUT OF THE WAY AND SHE WAS
PLACED ONTO THE PITCH. I COULD NOT MOVE AND HAD TO STOP WERE I WAS. THERE
WAS TOTAL CONFUSION, PEOPLE WERE PANICING AND WERE TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE
STAND. I HAD TO STOP IN THE TERRACE UNTIL MOST OF THE PEOPLE HAD CLEARED
OUT. THERE WERE BODIES ALL OVER THE PLACE AND PEOPLE HAD TURNED BLUE. I
EVENTUALLY MADE MY WAY OVER THE FENCE ONTO THE PITCH TO FIND MY GIRLFRIEND.
MY FRIEND         HELPED THE INJURED AND MOVE SOME OF THE DEAD FROM WHAT I
COULD GATHER.
WE HAD TO MAKE OUR WAY HOME ON THE TRAIN AS      STOPPED BEHIND TO HELP OUT.
AT NO TIME WAS THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM USED AND IT APPEARED THAT NOBODY HAD
A CLUE AS TO WHAT WAS GOING ON. AT FIRST IT LOOKED LIKE THERE WAS A FIGHT
GOING ON.

THE TUNNEL WHICH IS THE ONLY OBVIOUS ENTRY TO THE TERRACE. ONCE IN THE CENTRE
PENS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOVE TO THE OUTER PENS WHEN THE MIDDLE GETS FULL, SO
THE PEOPLE ARE EFFECTIVELY TRAPPED IN THERE. WHEN THERE WAS AN INFLUX OF
PEOPLE AT ABOUT 1450HRS THEY ALL HAD FULL TICKETS, INDICATING THEIR TICKETS
HAD NOT BEEN CHECKED. I ALSO FELT THAT THERE WAS CHAOS BECAUSE NO
ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE HEARD TO INFORM PEOPLE OF THE SITUATION, AND ONLY 1 OR 2
AMBULANCES WERE ON THE PITCH WHEN THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE TO SAVE
THE BODIES HAVING TO BE CARRIED SO FAR.
I WAS WITH MY BROTHER                                      LONDON. TEL:

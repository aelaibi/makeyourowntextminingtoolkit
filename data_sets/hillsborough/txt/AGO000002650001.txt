HILLSBOROUGH PUBLIC INQUIRY

1.    You will be aware that former Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, who was
in charge of policing at Hillsborough on 15April 1989, is facing a private
prosecution for manslaughter.

2.     I though that I should let you know that Mr Justice Collins (Counsel to the
Inquiry), Peter Whitehurst (Assistant Solicitor to the Inquiry) and I (Solicitor to
the Inquiry) have been approached by Mr Duckenfield's solicitors (Winckworth
Sherwood). I enclose in this connection copies of Winckworth Sherwood's letter
to me of 12 November (with its enclosures).

3.    You will see from this that Mr Justice Collins and Peter Whitehurst have
already given statements and that I have now been approached with a view to
being interviewed and giving a statement. Subject to my checking the file, any
statement which I gave would be along similar lines to that given by Peter
Whitehurst.

4.   I would propose to respond positively to Winckworth Sherwood's letter, but
thought that the Home Office would wish to be aware of these approaches.

5.      A copy of this letter (with its enclosures) goes to Stephen Parkinson.

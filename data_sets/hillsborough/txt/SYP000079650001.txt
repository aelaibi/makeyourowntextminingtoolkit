               This    statement       is about           the    incident at Hillsborou>                    ootball      Ground,

               I became aware of having                    to attend the F^r              Semi Final        by the usual          and

               with    details       of O f f icers        in my o^mmand and               finally a full Operational

               Order    was sent       to me with           copies        for      the two S e rgeants who were              to

               work with me.           Mr first/fask was                  to attend a pre-brief               for    Inspectors

               and above , in the Nprth S tand at the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y G r o u n d at                          10.

               00 am on F r i d ay yf 4t h April                1989    ( 140489) , the order            stated that         full

               them by Divisional                  mail   previously.             These    documents       can be       produced

               by me    if required.

               9.00 am    (0900)       Friday         14th April          1989       (140489)
                                                                                                                 S2391

             On this      date     I came on duty at R a w m a r s h Police S t a t i o n and                in company

             of my     colleague..      Inspector John N e w e y from this station,                        we travelled

             to H i l l s bo ro ug h S ta di um and took           up a position         in the N orth S tand of

             the    ground where        briefings        normal ly l^erke place.

             A public address           system was         us       o speak      to the a s s e m b l e d     Officers

             The    principle address            to t g r o u n d      commanders        was      given by Chief

             S-u pe ri n t e n d^e n t D u c k e n f ^ I d who spoke      from   p r e - p repared notes w h i c h

             were    in effect       reiter a t i o n of the w r i t t e n operational               plan.     The whoj j r *

             of the     o pe rat iwial     scenario was           related to us         clearly and with

             emphasis      on the     public      safety aspect.            I made a few briej^notes                 on the

             w r i t t e n order    in reJL-at'ion to where          to collect        radios/''meals and

             the ground before           dis e m b a r k i n g   passengers.        I was        told what    to do

             before,     during and after            the match.           In particular           to have     both my

             Just    before      12 noon     (1200)      that     date,    Inspector N e w e y and myself             took

     wit h    some    cons i d e r a b l y heavy verbal           traffic.          I found no reason to use

     the     radio myself as most                of my commu n i c a t i o n had to be done

     v e r bally     to the officers             in my command without               radio     contact,        in fact

     I had only to respond to the                      radio     twice,      once    to    locate myself           for

     did this by public              telephone.           Most    of the      radio       traffic      that    I can

     remember was about              the       location of travelling               groups     of fans and

     trouble       spots    elsewhere           in Jtffie city.       Generally       I found the           radio

     i m e rrneaia'te times,            vehicular         traffic       e v e n t u a l l y gave way to

     c o n s i derable     foot    traffic         in Herries Road,           several       walking        fans

     reported to me that               buses       had dropped them off as                 far away as

     Burngreave        Road some 2 to 3 miles                  further awa y         than the        1 to 2 miles

     we were a lr e a d y dis t a n c e d          from the ground.            Most       of the enquiries            from

     N o t t i n g h a m fans were about            how to get back           to Burng r e a v e Road after

     the match.

     It was     quite apparent             that a proporati on of t h f ^ o t t i ngham fans were

        also     thought      it was a pitch         invasion.

    d uring      this       stage,       the extent        of the disaster was                  now known to

    jeering and             chanting abuse at e v e r y o n e .                  On^tftis   basis,      I myself went

s u pervise         the    crowd    i n Herries R o a d »            Unf o r tunatejty we         had a r r i v e d      in

a bus and           I had no idea where my serial                       was,y<fe were all well

 ispersed by now.                  In view of this,             at 5y3 Q        pm (1730)       we were       given an

order     to    regroup          in the N orth S t a n d good decis i o n at just                            the    right

time.      We       re-grouped and sat downrfor a spell,                              everyone was          distressed

but we were all willing                    to kej*p going.              It is at this           point       that my

direct     involvement with thj^ event ceases.                                 I. was a p p r o a c h e d    in the
                        I
s tand    by Inspector Coop^f with instructions                                from S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    Bate;

to gather           together a /earn and to go to B a r n s l e y M o r t u a r y to set                           up a

body     reception f a c i l i t y .            I called together a group of R a w m a r s h

Officers        present / . n the stand,               they were a m ixed group                    but at     least       I

knew most           of t/em.        The    sit u a t i o n was       exp l a i n e d to sixteen Officers

that we had Another                 grim job and they were                    given the option not to go,

they felt that              it was       better    to have an objective,                    and we all went              to

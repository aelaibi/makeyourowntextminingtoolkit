Insp        Charles          of    this       fact          and    at       2.50pm,           in    view       of    the       fact             that    all

the     coaches          had       arrived             and    the       majority              of    the    Nottigham                   Forest

Supporters              were       in    the       ground,          he       instructed              us    to       return             to       the

stables.               I must       stress             and    be    most           emphatic          about          this       point,             that       at

this        moment       in       time       both       ourselves                and     Insp       Charles          were          not          aware       of

the     situation             already          developing                   at     LEPPINGS          LANE.           Whilst             entering

the     junction             of    Leppings             Lane/Penistone                    Rd       North,       there          was          a    large

crowd        of    LIVERPOOL             supporters                making           their          way    down       Penistone                   Rd

towards           Leppings          Lane.              They         were         in a     rowdy          mood,       and       a       hurry,

because           there       was       only       a    few         m i n u t e s to          K.O.        There       was          a    s t ro ngsmell

of    alcohol           eminating             from          the    large           crowd,          many    fans       were             carrying

cans        of    beer/lager,                and       due    to    the          vast     amount          of    people             it       was

impossible              to    arrest          any       one       person.

At    3 pm,       I was       entering             the       Niagara             complex           when    I heard             a       radio

transmission                 to    the       effect          that       a    serious           situation             was       developing                   at

Leppi'tigs         Lane       turnstiles                involving                person        being       crushed,                and          that

immediate              assistance             was       required.                  In    view       of    this       PC    Gillott                went

             I    remained       at    Niagara      due    to      the     fact      I was      riding      a    young      horse.         The

             horse    was    involved         in    only     it's         2nd   football         match,         and    I   felt     that

             under    the    circumstances            and       the       seriousness           of   the    situation          it    would

             be    unwise    not       to   involve       h e r.      I    remained        at    Niagara         stables

             throughout          the    incident,         and      was     in   no   way     involved           or    attended       to

             Leppings       Lane.

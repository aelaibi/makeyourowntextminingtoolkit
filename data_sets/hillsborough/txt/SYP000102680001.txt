                I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police, stationed at
                Hammerton Road Division.
                At 9.30am on Saturday, 15th April, 1989 I reported for duty at the
                Sheffield Wednesday Football ground.                                               In company with Mrs. Drabble
                civilian clerk I was stationed in the souvenier shop at the Nottingham
                Forrest end of the ground.                                         I booked in lost and found property
                prior to the match starting.                                                When the match was officially called
                off, I returned items of property to the Nottingham Forrest supporters.

                I returned to Hammerton Road with the remaining unclaimed property
                and owrked in the front office until 7.30pm when I went off duty.

          drove        straight            into      the are a to t h e / r e a o         of the Cantilever           S tand and

           .mmediately adjacent                           to the g^mr.              /here Police         briefings are

          onto      the      pitch.

          T o g ether with the other                         drivers       of the    personnel         carriers     I went       into

          the Canti l e v e r Stand where                          I saw that s u pporters             on the Leppings           Lane

          terraces           had          began to flood onto the                   pitch.          I saw that a number of

          officers           had          formed a line across               the     pitch.         One man     came up to me

          and said            *somebody *s got                crushed.5

          As    I looked towards                     the     crowd on the        pitch      I saw that        some o f f i c e r s

          from       the      line which had formed across                          the    pitch were      running       out     of

          s up er vi s o r y officers with us.                         In view of this we waited a shoru while

          and then saw bodies                        being        brought    out of the         crowd on m a ke-shift

          stretchers.                 I went         to the        rear of the C an t i l e v e r Stand and together

                was    carrying the hoarding               on which the boy was                laid looked straight

                across at me and said words                     to the effect         “This     is your         fucking     fault,
D£/n-p

                cotninued to carry the hoarding                      to an area where               other       bodies were

                being     laid to rest outside                  the gymnasium.          I helped to             carry out more

                bodies as they               came off     the    pitch.

                Eventually         I found myself at an entrance                      to the    rear of the stand

                                                                                                                          s o rne

                 in     i c a n ■„s „       However     they were    calm and concerned about                             ian whom

                neither      of them           new.

                 I could only find one supervisory officer,                             Inspector Scarfs who was

                trying     his     best       to get Ambulances           into the      ground.              There were    not

                s ufficient Ambulances                  to deal with the sheer            number of casualties.

                Many    fans were wandering                around    in a dase         others were             extremely upset,

                many    venting their anger at                   police    officers.

                 I took    it upon myself               to bring my vehicle            into the                    p/and     1oaded

                up with about 6 or 8 casualties                      together with 3 SI

                members,       two of whom were             only children but            nevertheless were

                 r e n d e r i n g f i r s t a i d to the       casualties.       Inspector B ca rf e a r ra ojfe d a

Inspector Scarfe.                T^i/s supervisory officer            detailed me with various

transport       duties     one of which was to ferry                 relatives and friends                      of

then missing         persons       to H am me r t o n Road Police Station.                   I tra v e l l e d

from the ground through heavy traffic,                        together with another                     unmarked

van.     As    I passed H i l l s bo ro u g h Park      I was       ’c r a w l i n g 5 at slow speed

b ehind an orange          coloured Ford Transit              van    containing Liverpool                      fans.

The    van was a Hire            van from Liverpool       but       I do not       recall         the

r e g i s t r a t i o n number    or Hire    company.     This       vehicle was           packed with

youths aged between               18 and 25 years       of age all         of whom were drinking

cans    of    ’Miller L i t e ’ lager.         As    I drew    closer       to the vehicle               several

of them noticed that               I was a Police       officer and they began shouting

and making       obscene         gestures    out of the back window.                   Several          of the

relatives and friends who                  I was    carrying were          crying and          continually

as k i n g q uestions about          if they would be able             to find tneir               relatives/

friends.        Many of the         occupants       in my vehicle were women.                      Suddenly

the    fans    in the Ford Transit            in front a p p e a r e d to         realise who            I was

carrying.        The m a j o ri ty of them stopped shouting and making                               obscene

gestures       but two or three            continued.     Eventually            I arri v e d at

H a m m e r t o n Road Police S ta t i o n and set down the                 re l a t i v e s / f r i e n d s    there.

I continued to transport                relatives and Police               officers        from the ground

at the direction of               Inspector Scarfe       until       I was      relieved of my duties

at    1.10am retiring            from duty at Sam Su n d a y         16th April          1969.

It was apparent          from my observations            at the ground when                  I a r r i v e d that

many    of the supporters            had been consuming             intoxicants.             As    I moved

about    in the      crowd many        people were      shouting       obscenities at Police

o f f icers and were         blaming       them personally,          not    realising          that m any of

them had arrived after               the    tragedy had occurred.

I w ould      like   to point       out that       not everyone       I saw had been               consuming

                 Of the d e c eased        persons that    I dealt with,         I am able,     from    photographs

                 and video,          to identify one.



                 I recall       being     in the tunnel    area near        to the gym n a s i u m w h e n a group

                 of football          supporters approached.            They were     carrying an extremely

                 large man on an a dv er t i s i n g      hoarding.         1 remember     the man was wearing

                 very baggy denim jeans,           and either           one or two suede     shoes.      His   face

                 was     covered with either a shirt              or T shirt w hich was        light    coloured.

                 The shirt was           being wor n by the man and had been             pulled up over        his
                                                                                                                       PAGE      2
                                                                                                                       S d 2 i8A

                face



                I pulled the shirt                  back and     could see        the man's      face was     blue.        I

                checked for             signs     of    life,   but    could find none.            1 assisted       to carry

                the     stretcher          for a short way and then directed the football

                supporters              carrying       the stretcher       into the gymnasium.



                The most memorable                  feature about         this man was his size.

                man     I now know to be C hr is t o p h e r E D W A R D S              (38).    I believe      this      to be

                the man that                   refer    to above.

                 I have viewed a phot o g r a p h of                  clothing wor n by C h r i s t o p h e r E D W A R D S on

                 13th April             1989    (130489)     (Ref NA 38)         (Exh            ) and the jeans and

                shoe      shown on this             p hotograph are similar              to the ones that          I have

                 previously described.



                 I have vjiewed a video                  tape   (Ref V R M / 2 ) (Exh               ) and at tape

                 lying      on the floor            covered     partially        by a black      sheet.      You    can see

                 the m a n ’s T shirt              pulled up and the top of his jeans

                 and the manner                in w hi c h   it is worn,       is very similar         to the      body    I have

                  made reference to.   I. believe                     this to be the body of              the {Tian that       I

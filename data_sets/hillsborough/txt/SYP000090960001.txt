Q 1VI



The     radio       coverage     of the    situation at H i l l s b o r o u g h stated       initially

that there          had been >ar' pitch      invasion by Liverpool            football       fans and

play had been            i nterrupted for seven minutes                but had re-started.            By

3 .35    pm    (1535/3    the tone      of the broadcast         had    changed and on hearing an

appeal        on Z fte   radio    for off    duty Police Offic er s          to at te nd at

H a m m e r t o m R oad Police Stat io n        I went      in my own car to that            police

               arriving at 3.45           pm (1545)    that    date.



On arrival          I went     into the     canteen and s u pgxvised          the efforts of

several        se rgeants      to detail who had a r i ^v ed at the             police station and

formed them           into    s erials,    detailing j/fha.% vehicles were available and

identifying           the vehicle       drivers.    /The only sergeant              that   I can

actually        recall       is W oman Serqeajn; S MI TH of Doncaster Division,

the ground from L ep pings Lane.

Once     inside    ths ground       I saw several          of/ricers atte mp ti ng          to    provide

cover for a number            of bodies w hich w^re                lying   by the     perimeter      fence

All were male and a pp e a r e d to be / n               their 2 0 5s and 3 0 ' s.              Rather    taken

a back    I spoke     to a young male y c o n s t a b l e , who was              unknown to me,          and

a sked him how many bodi.es w/re there.                         He    told me eleven and that

there were many mores in the                gymnasium.             1 made my way to the elevated

Police Control           pyzSint and as      I reached the            steps     I met my    colleague

Supe r i nt/fndent B AT ES who         server's w ith me           in D Division.          He    briefly

went V nt o      the Control       R o o w f I believe       to make       our    presence       known,    and

we both went        to the gynynasium w here             I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y 60 or 70

bodies     lying    in rows fn the floor.

Some     time    later,    I cannot      exactly     r e c a l j f w hen but it must have been

a r ou n d 6 pm    (1800),       I organised all         1/ e      m any junior     officers       into the

debrief     their     officers and make           aot    lists       of their      personnel       and what

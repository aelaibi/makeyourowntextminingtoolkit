We a r r i v e d    in .Sheffield at a b o u t / t w e n t y      past     two    (142Q0.          We    had been

d el ay ed    by traffic and           roadwo/ks.          The    coach was also            s t op p e d just

o utside S h e f f i e l d by fthe        pj/lice who s e a r c h e d us for alcohol                and they

also    checked our t ic w



We f in a l l y     parked up at about            twenty       past    two.        It was    near a large

brewery and          it took       us about 5 to 10 m in ut es             to walk        to the ground.

We made       our own w ay from the              coach to the ground.                 I did see

Live rp oo l       supp or te rs    near a railway s ta ti on and a G at e wa y s u p e r m a r k e t .

They were          drinking    from beer j ^ R s         but    no o n e was      drunk.



We got to the outside                of the grouniy at about               half    past two        (143Q).

We all       had tickets      for entrance/B.             W he n we got        to the g r ou n d         we

looked       for a sign w i th e ntWfice B.               We found        entrance A a nd entr an ce

C but e ntrance B was               not   in' b et we en these         two w h i ch   I thought          it

w ou ld be.          At first we went            to t ur ns t il e s    for the West S t a n d          seating

t u r ns ti le s w hich     I think was          entr an ce A.          We were aski ng         for entrance

B.      We were told          it was      next    door    so we had to go back out of the

gates a nd we e ve nt u a l l y saw entrance B.                        Out^fcie this entr an ce               there

we re n.o queues         just a mass        of peopl e |outs j/dfe these t u r n st i le s              trying

to get       in.                                           i_



When    I    was in this a re a there was a m o u n t e d                p o li ce ma n   right    in     the

m iddle      of the      crowd.       It s^rnid he was k n oc ki ng               into    people.             I can

remember as well            that     there were        poli ce me n by the         tur ns ti le s       outside

the g round just           standi/ng there.              While    I was w a it in g        to go    in 1 saw a

gate    near to t|^e V i e / t       S t a n d seating     t ur ns t il e s   open ed a nd some

I e v e nt ua ll y got to the turn st i le s at entra nc e B and went                             t h ro u g h and

h an de d my ticket       in.         When    I went      t h ro u gh the t ur ns t il e s        I saw

p olicemen searching            some fans        inside         the g round but           I w a s n ’t searched.



As soon as we got             in I saw a sign w ith B on                   it.         This was a bo ve a

tunnel     w hich went        under    the middl e of the stand.                        I could see the

pitch t hrough the tunnel.                    E v e r yo ne     s eemed    to be going t ow ar ds and

th ro ug h this       tunnel.         I d i d n ’t see any          police       or stewards at the

e ntrance      to this tunnel.



I w a l k e d t hrough th i y 'Xtunnel w ith no problems.                             W h e n I got    to the end

of the t u n n e l .      'pnere was a dividing                  b a rr ie r dividing         the terr ac e         in

half    the    Q-fowd/tQ the       right      of the barrier              s ee me d    packed.



When    I came out of the tunnel                 I was        still w i t h my friends

and                                          We went to our              right and down the terrace

to about       three q uarters         of the way             back from the front             of the terrace.

At this       point    I was    by a barrier          I       then saw some            other people who         I

know further on down the terrace.                             I w a l k e d a r o u n d the    barr ie r a nd

made my way towards             them.         I ended up about a quarter                      of the way back

from the front of the              terrace.           At this           time the       crowd was       pushing

f orward      towards      the fence at the front                 of the terrace.                The    crush was

getting worse          some of the j>€tfpTe           were       being     t urned a r ou n d by the           crush

a nd were      facing a way f/om the             pitch.            I was     being      pushed f ur th er and

f urther      towards      tbe fence at the front                 of the terrace.                This was       just

before     trie kipK:off.         There         was a supp or te r          in front of          me and       I was

being    pushed       right    up,a ga in st     him.          W he n    I was    pushed      right     up

a gainst      the f e n c e / f^m an ag ed to put my arms                 up and hold onto the fence

I was t r y i i ^ g ^ J ^ p u s h back.        This       supporter was           in b et we en me a nd the

fence and his face was                being     pushed        into the fence.               He was

 and sho ut in g at me and              people a r o u n d me tried to                  push back      to give him

 some     room but     it was      impossible.

                                                    the    colour of his face                    changed blue.

 I thought        he was    dead then.             After a while           I felt          the     pressure     of the

 crush ease a little and                 it seemed        like    people were falling                  over     b eh in d

 me as       if s omething       had    collapsed.          This m an who had been                    in front      of

 me s eemed to slip down to the ground and                           I lost sight of him.



 I w o u l d d escribe      this man as           being    in his     late/(eens w it h short                   blonde

                     West Derby.               I just thought a bo ut                  pulling m yself        up on

 rail in gs     someone     pulled me out of tjyg crush onto the                              pitch.        I c a n ’t

 think wh et he r      it was a po 1 i cer&an/o r supporter.



 When     I was on the         pitch I was h aving           d i ff i c u l t y        brea th in g   I was

 It was an a s t h m a      inhaler.



 When     I had the      inhaler        I i»ient back      to the t e rra;?^to help                   I went w it h

 kick     the fence      in,     but the fence w o u l d n ’t go                 in.      T he n    I saw some

I then        ran with some                  other    suufporters a nd got            some a d v e r t s i n g    boards

to help        carry the              injured yj^eople.              We   c ar ried   people     to a gym         in the

ground.             When we got              t^Kere someone was              saying    'Injured to the             left,

dead to the           rightf» /              W h en we had taken the first                  injured      p erson we

went     back       to help again.                    I went       b ackwards    and forwards a number                   of

times.          Some       police were               just       standin g a r o u n d a nd were gett in g           in the

way.          I helped              carry    injured        people and        I also     helped     carry some

people who           I think were dead.                          There was a lot of dead^/^nd injured

people        in the gym.

I do not know the            iden ti ty of the youth,            and do not know whether             or

I would have        been standing           just behind this youth.            I also        recall the

C!n P h o t o g r a p h ic Print    (Refs P R3 /F/27A)        (Exh             ) I can identify

myself a s s isting        other fans        to carry an      i nj ur ed /d ec ea se d   person over

the    pitch on an ad ve rt is in g          hoarding.      I am shown on the extreme

left of the        picture,        half wa y up the frame.



I am on the        nearside        of the hoarding,        ie.    nearest    the    camera and am

w ear i n g white       trainers,     light blue denim jeans

                                            my right arm     is e x tended behind          me.

I mm e d iately    in front        of me    is a man wearing a light brown               leather

jacket.                                *



I do not know the            identity of the        person on the stretcher and he

cannot      be seen on the          picture.     I carried several           people on

hoardings,        but    cannot     recall    any desc ri pt io ns     of   persons or       clothing.

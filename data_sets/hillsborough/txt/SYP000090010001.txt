              I o bt ained a ticket           for the SWii Final                to be    played on S a t u rd a y    15th

              April      1989   <150489),       between Liverpool               and Notts Forest        from Anfield.

              It was £6 for Leppi ng s Ln terrace.

              On the morning          of the m a t c h I left my house at about                         am    ( 1000)   in

              am    (1030).

              We stopped at Hearts head Services and then went                               straight    to Sheffield?

              we arri ve d at about            1 pm   (1300),       and    parked       in a street     not     far from

the   railway station.                 We all went              to the/Galfe P>r£>lie House                for a drink.

We all      left the Pub at about 2.1 5                         pm    ( 1                    wa lk ed towards     the

ground.        On    reachi ng the            turns t i l e s ^ t j y ^ ' r e       was a mass    of    people all

trying      to get      into      the ground.              Other years Police were                      checking

tickets      further        back      the     street       but this year                they did not       check

anyonjr and all           the     people made            their way to the turnstile are a w KTch

      v e r y /cp /o w d ed .     I only saw two                policemen             there one on         hprse and

                            saw anot he r P o l i c e me n on top of the                         turnstile at first

S.toppi         Ttfople climbing              up but then helping                      them up because        of the

 crush.
4k;______
I was     pushed a ro un d a bit                  in the      crush and              lost    contact wit h all my

mates.       I went thro ug h a                   turnstile,          giving          up my ticket.        At this

point     it was about 2.30                  pm    <1430)      an d     I did not see any gates                 open

except      the     turnstile.          After        going        through the turnstile                  I went    down

the   tunnel   to the terrace.     I have been to / h e ground before and knew
                   C a t     T            i^ i£ z js jr /
where     to go.  I w al ke d down the tunnel w l V h p y i any trouble, but when I

got to the          terrace       it was          jammed wit h fans.                   I moved to my       left a

little and          could not move any further,                          taut I could see from there.

The   players were              not out at this              time and               it was getting more and more

jammed by the minute.                   People were               talking about               it getting     jammed and

crushed.

The   teams       came out and              people star te d shouting and jumping about

before      this     people were            telling        people        to move            back because     there was

no room but no one                paid any attention.

The match kicked off and Liverpool                                hit the bar.                I was    pushed forward

and the      crush got worse,                 but     I was       in no trouble.                People    in front of

me were      shouting           for    people at the back                   to move back but they

c o u l d n ’t because more             people we re coming                     down the       tunne/.     People

giving      them a boost              up.     I saw people              climbing a y tble h k r Lmeter fence
                                                                                                           P AGE       3

    ar ou nd the     pitch at          first       1' thought    it was a pitch invasion and did

    not    realise what was             happening         or how serious        it was.

    I then g o t up into the                 stand above the Leppings Ln                terrace and helped

    other    people up.           I did not see any of the friends                      I had     come    to the

    m atch with.

    On    looking    out towards             the       pitch   Icould see    people     being     treated and

    others who a p p ea r ed           to    be dead.

    l saw                          and                            on the     pitch and decided to go

    down    to see    them.        I knew that                    w ould be     concerned about

           who was    in the       terrace s o m e w h e r e .       I saw      and              having an

    argument w ith a P o l i c em a n who had got ho 1d of                                   I lost sight of

    them then,       later       I got       into the      pitch after meeting                           a man     I

    knew.     The Police w ou ld not open a gate                        so we wa lk ed along and           climbed

    out where       the   fence had been ripped away.

    We wal ke d along        the       pitch but         could not find                 or            or anyone

    we knew.        I did not          help carry any bodies across               the     pitch       or assist

    any    injured as there was plenty of                      people    helping.

    After about       half an          hour about quarter           to four     (1545),      I left       the

    ground with any          lad       I knew and made my way back               to my car.All           the

    passengers were          there          except                                              and

                                              was also missing,           but after      sometime,        they all

    turned up except             for

    We used a telephone                in a nearby house           to ring home,        and then the

    Police a p p ro a ch e d us asking                 us why we were       hanging around.           We told

    them we ware          looking       for             and they d ir ected us to H a m m e r t o n Police

    Stat ion.

    We made     enqui r i es at the Police Stat ion and Boys Club but                              could not

    find             Because       of this we decided
                                               decided to rinq
                                                          ring                          home and      it was

    then we     found out         he had been             injured and- was      in Hospita!

    In my opinion          the    Police m an power a p p e ^ e d          to   be in    the w rong       place

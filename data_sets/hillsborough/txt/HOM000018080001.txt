                           Dear Mr Whalley

                           Following a circular from the Football League dated 26 April 1989,
                           please note that it would not be our intention, at this stage, to place
                           a written submission before Lord Justice Taylor in respect of the
                           Hillsborough Disaster enquiry.

                           However, should Lord Justice Taylor wish to compare the facilities
                           at Hillsborough with those of any other ground in the North of
                           England, we would be delighted to welcome him to Elland Road.

                           Furthermore, as Leeds United played in the last semi-final at
                           Hillsborough not involving Liverpool (and therefore were allocated
                           the Leppings Lane Stand), we would be pleased to discuss the measures
                           taken for that match in April T987, if required.

                           If Lord Justice Taylor wishes to take up this invitation, please
                           do not hesitate to contact me.

                           Yours sin cerely

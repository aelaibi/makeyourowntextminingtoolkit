        Dear Sir

        I was    appalled by the news of the tragedy at Sheffield, which I
        first   heard   yesterday  morning  in  the  States,  prior  to my
        departure   for   the UK later in the day.  I was even more shocked
        and   distressed when I saw the newspaper accounts of the incident
        upon my arrival here this morning.

        I am    an  architect    who   has for 25 years specialised in sports
        construction,   having    been   involved as a designer or consultant
        on  11   of 15 stadia constructed in the United States during that
        period.     I have been actively involved in the UK for over five
        years   and  have recently become registered by the ARCUK.     We are
        currently   engaged   in   the design of three facilities in the UK,
        including   the arena and velodrome for the City of Sheffield, the
        National Arena in Birmingham and the Londondome.

        I have been asked on several occasions to address groups such as
        the  RIBA   and   the Sports Council at their Recreation Management
        Conference   on the subject of stadium and arena design.    At these
        and   other     opportunities  I have    stated  publicly  that  the
        existence   of   standing  terraces  was   the single most hazardous
        practice I have observed.

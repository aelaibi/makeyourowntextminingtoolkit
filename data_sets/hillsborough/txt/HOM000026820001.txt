Dear Graham/

As requested/ I have pleasure in detailing below a brief
history of events concerning the all seater stadium at
Highfield Road.

Work was carried out throughout the Summer of 1981 to convert
Highfield   Road  into an   'all  seater'   stadium  for  the
commencement of the 1981/82 season.   The ground capacity was •
set at 20/500.

The Club received enormous criticism from lifelong supporters
for implementing the all seater scheme and we therefore
decided to re-open a standing area immediately behind the East
Terrace seats for the start of the 1983/84 campaign.       The
capacity for this area was set at 2/000 with admission
restricted to Members only. The Ground capacity was therefore
increased to 22/500.

In January 1985/ during an F .A. Cup tie against Manchester
City/ over 400 seats from the East Terrace were ripped out by
visiting supporters and used as missiles against the Police.
Following this incident and due to the fact that many visiting
supporters were unwilling to sit on open seating, it was
decided that the seats on the East Terrace would be removed
during the Summer of 1985.     As we were, in addition, still
receiving constant criticism from our own supporters, a
decision was taken to divide this Terrace into standing
accommodation for both home and away supporters.     This area
now accommodates 7/544 home supporters; 2/800 visitors and has
an overflow section for 960.        The Ground capacity has
subsequently increased to 29/800.


/Cont'd
2nd June, 1989



R.H.G. Kelly/ F.C.I.S.



Even now we     continually receive requests from our own
supporters to remove the existing seats from the Sky Blue
Terrace which   is uncovered and also from the West Terrace
which is partially covered.      It was in fact the Club's
intention to remove the seats from the Sky Blue Terrace during
the current close-season and support had been offered from the
Football Grounds Improvement Trust for this work. However/ in
the light of the Hillsborough disaster, we decided to await
the outcome of Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry.

During the past eight years we have generally found that
supporters are unwilling to sit on open terracing/ basically
because the climate in this Country is unsettled.    When we
play matches    in cold or wet conditions we notice     that
supporters choose to stand up for the entire game in these
areas.

We also found during the all seater period that we were only
able to accommodate approximately 2/000 visiting supporters in
the area allocated to them. On numerous occasions/ therefore/
visitors obtained tickets for areas allocated to our own
supporters and consequently confrontations occurred.      This
resulted in making the policing of the stadium very difficult.

I trust that this information will be of help to you       and
should you require any further assistance/ please do       not
hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely/




Graham Hover

                                  SUMMARY

Conversion to all-seated stadia would mean an overall loss in capacity of 197,316.

The average attendances for each club, with one exception (Liverpool), were within the
projected all-seated capacity figure.

The projected all-seated capacity would have been exceeded at 66 matches during the
1988/89 season as follows:-

 For the Attention of Mr. J.D. Dent

 Dear Sirs,

 We refer to your request for assistance to establish probable costs for the
 conversion of existing standing capacities to seating at Football League Club
 grounds.

 From our discussion on the subject, we understand your awareness of the wide
 range of approach available to solve the practical problems at each of the many
 locations. For the purpose of this exercise, therefore, we have attempted to
 arrive at reasonably acceptable constants for both capacity conversion and
 probable seat installation costs.

 The maximum number of standing spectators on a properly constructed and equipped
 (crush bariers etc.,) terrace is 54 persons per 10 square metres. The maximum
 number of seats to be fitted per square metre we would estimate being marginally
 less than 3 No. with allowance for re-arranged gangways and the like.

 Therefore, for any existing terrace currently certified for maximum or near
 maximum crowd density to be converted from standing to seating, a factor of 30/54
 (say 55 per cent) should be applied to current standing capacity.

                              E.G. Terrace (standing)                                     10,000

                                       10,000            x 55 per cent
                                            *            5,500 seats

 There is available a considerable choice of seat in quality and function.
 Supply, deliver and installation prices begin at circa £14.00, given optimum
 terrace profiles for individual manufacturers. Generally, the ideal conditions
 referred to are newly constructed with a particular manufacturers requirements in
 mind.  In the situations we are considering, there are many terrace profiles to
 which seat cradles would of necessity have to be adapted. Consequently, it is
 unlikely that an average of much less than £20.00 per seat (installed) will be
 obtained throughout as an average price. To this figure must be added an
 estimate of probable cost for the removal of crush barriers, re-arrangement of
 gangways, new handrails where required and possible terrace incline adjustments
 in situations not involving major re-construction. Our suggestion would be to
 add £15.00 per seat for these elements, giving an overall figure of £35.00 per
 seat for the purpose of this exercise only.

                                                                                                                        Cont'd....

Close scrutiny of the figures for individual clubs - especially these in the
lower divisions - gives rise to an understanding that in practice there may now
be a need for contraction of spectator capacity as opposed to merely filling
the existing spaces with seats. The licensing authorities would have to be
satisfied in such instances that whatever measures may be proposed in this
regard can be seen to be permanent; not simply the erection of fences or
barriers. The cost in each case may vastly differ one from another but in our
view it would be unwise at this stage to assume that such costs would be far
less overall than seat installation.

We turn now to the question of cover to existing open terraces. The cost
implications for this element alone, on a nationwide basis, is unlikely to be
less than £100,000,000.00 if all existing uncovered standing capacity becomes
covered. Design criteria is essential, as you will appreciate, for any wholly
reliable estimates of cost. However, we have attempted in this instance to
give an idea of 'global' cost based on past projects assumed to be similar.

             for perhaps 1,000 seats.

             perhaps 10,000 - 12,000 spectators
             (as at the Penistone Road End of
             Hillsborough).                            £1,300,000.00

Extrapolation of these figures alone, with a significant number of clubs
requiring whole sides or ends covered and very few not requiring corner
infills, leads us to the belief that between £80m - £100m would be required.

In summary, we would suggest that the seating costs for all four divisions
could amount to circa £30,000,000.00, and that in addition, were cover to be
contemplated in all situations, £100,000,000.00 could be the probable further
requirement.

Introduction
This background paper explains the roles of the Football Trust and Football Grounds
Improvement Trust, and describes the main objects of their grant policies.

The Appendices contain details of grants paid to League clubs and international
grounds. As will be apparent from reading the text, the Football Trust has a responsi­
bility for helping football at every level in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and as a
consequence there are well over 1,000 other schemes in respect of which the Trust
has paid or promised grants. Readers who would like further information about these
should contact:

g          a k in d for 3,455 spectators. T he instruction given to M r Je n k in s’ firm was to
            produce a new stand w ith seats for approxim ately 3,000 spectators. In fact, th e new
           stand provided seats for 3,162 spectators. The stand was designed to take seats and
           seats w ere fitted. It was a m a tte r agreed betw een th e parties to this appeal th at for
           tax purposes these seats w ould in any event be regarded as "plant'* q u alifying for
           capital allowances.

           playing field is th e C ricket Field stand, p roviding seats for 4,419 spectators, w hich
           was com pleted in 1969. At the o th e r e n d are o pen terraces for standing spectators.
           The covered terraces opposite th e B runshaw Road stand and th e open terraces at the
          end o f th e playing field opposite th e C ricket Field stand can accom m odate
C          approxim ately 28,000 to 30,000 standing spectators so th a t th e capacity o f th e T u rf

           access to th e different spectator areas, £ 1-20 to an adult for adm ission to the terraces,
           £2*20 to an a d u lt for a seat in th e Cricket Field stand, a n d £ 1 -9 0 for a seat in the
           B runshaw Road stand. Separate entrances are provided to each part. A p art o f the

              ‘4. D r R D Iven, a director o f th e C lub for fifteen years and the C lu b D octor for
           thirty, told in evidence o f th e effect on the C lub's fortunes o f the loss o f the
           B runshaw Road stand for tw o and a h a lf seasons, the p eriod d u rin g w hich the
           dem olition o f th e old stand and the construction o f th e replacem ent stand was
           taking place. H e regarded this period as the w orst ever in his experience o f the
g        Club. H e described the players as, in effect, losing th e ir bearings w h en a green
           hoarding was erected dow n the side o f th e playing field w here th e stand had been.
           It was d u rin g this period th at the C lu b ’s team was relegated to th e second division
           in the Football League. Since the new stand had com e in to use he reckoned that the
          C lub was h o lding its ow n in the m a tte r o f gates as com pared w ith o th e r second
          division clubs. Gates w ent u p and dow n. C u rre n tly th e general tendency was for
f          gates to go dow n. T he gate was affected by the standing o f a visiting chib and by the
          standing o f the C lub's ow n team . Seats w ere provided in the replacem ent stand
          because there had been seats in the old stand. T he Football League im posed no
          req u irem en ts regarding th e provision o f stands o r seats. Seats w ere, how ever,
          necessary if the C lub was to function as a top-rate club. Gates w ere affected by the
          facilities provided for spectators at a football g ro u n d .

              ‘6. [Counsel] for th e C lub, argued th at this was a su m expended for repairs o f
          prem ises occupied for the purposes o f the C lub’s trade w ith in th e m ean in g o f
          paragraph (d) o f section 130 Incom e and C orporation Taxes Act 1970 a n d as such, a
          sum to be deducted in c o m p u tin g the a m o u n t o f the C lub's taxable profits. He
          referred us to the fam iliar passage in th e ju d g m e n t o f Buckley LJ in Lurcott v W akely
h        t r W heeler1, w here it is p ointed o u t th at “R epair is restoration by renew al or
          replacem ent o f subsidiary parts o f a w hole”. T he relevant w hole in the present case
          was, [counsel] a rgued, the football stadium at T u rf M oor, com prising th e playing
          field and th e stands and terraces provided for spectators. Just as th e replaced

        m en tio n ed . W e noted w ith respectful sy m p ath y th e co m m e n t o f Foster J in W ynne-
       Jones (Inspector o f Taxes) v Bedaie Auction L td', th a t it is difficult, if not im possible, to
       spell o u t a n y one test from th e cases. Support can, how ever, in o u r view , be fo und
        for these relevant propositions: (i) Each case has to be decided on its o w n particular
        facts: e g th e Whieldon Sanitary Potteries case2 a n d th e Bedaie Auction case1, (ii)
        W h eth e r w o rk done represents “repairs” tu rn s o n identifying “th e e n tire ty ”: the
        Samuel Jones case4 a n d the Whieldon Sanitary Potteries case2, (iii) W hat constitutes
        "th e e n tire ty ” is a com m ercial a n d business p roblem . Is th ere a single profit-earning
        u n d e rta k in g , a single profit-earning en tity ? See th e Samuel Jones case4 a n d Hodgins
        (Inspector o f Taxes) v Plunder & Poliak (Ireland) Ltd*, (iv) T he replacem ent o f a
        subsidiary u n it w ill be a repair in relation to th e w hole profit-earning e n tity unless
        w hat is done goes beyond being th e m ere replacem ent o f so m eth in g th a t was there
        before a n d constitutes an extension a n d im p ro v e m en t: see th e Plunder & Poliak

                    O n th e facts w e find th e S tadium to have been the profit-earning en tity , the
        prem ises occupied for th e purposes o f th e C lu b ’s trade to w hich paragraph (d) o f
        section i j o itfe rs. T he actual playing field to g eth e r w ith th e su rro u n d in g stands
        a n d terraces was w here, to use a colloquialism , it all h a p p en e d : the spectators paid
        th e ir m o n ey to occupy th e stands a n d terraces so th a t th ey m ig h t w atch th e players
        on th e field and, as spectators a n d supporters, participate in th e m atches p u t on by
        th e C lub. W e find th e stadium , as w e have defined it, to be th e prem ises a n d the
        stand to be physically, com m ercially a n d functionally an inseparable part. O n th at
        footing it seem s to us th a t th e replacem ent o f th e B runshaw Road stand qualifies as
        “repairs o f prem ises” a n d w e so hold.
            ‘ i j . As to th e contentions th a t because o f its size a n d im portance th e cost o f
        replacing th e stand constituted capital e x p en d itu re a n d th at because o f the
        differences in th e stand th e reconstruction a m o u n te d to an alteration o f a n d
        im p ro v e m en t to th e prem ises, th e follow ing poin ts appear to us to be relevant:
        (a) N o evidence was before us as to h ow th e cost replacing th e B runshaw Road stand

       In 1972 a new stand was designed. It was designed to go nearer th e football p itch
a w here th e concrete terraces stood, th ereb y leaving a space betw een the back o f th e stand
    an d B runshaw Road w hich could be used as a ‘safety reservoir’ for th e crow d o f spectators
    in case o f em ergency. T he concrete terraces w ere therefore rem oved, a n d for a tim e th at
    side o f th e p itc h was b o u n d ed by a green-painted hoarding. D u rin g this period th e club’s
    fortunes declined. It was relegated to th e second division, a n d gates w en t dow n. T he
    directors a ttrib u te d this to th e d isorientation o f players faced by a hoard in g w here
jj previously there had been h om e supporters. Be th a t as it m ay, in the latter h a lf o f 1974
    the new stand was erected. T he stanchions su p p o rtin g th e ro o f are m ade o f reinforced
    concrete, a n d th e ro o f a n d terraces are o f precast concrete.
       A fter th e n ew stand had been designed th e directors decided to m ake use o f th e area
    under, a n d p a rt o f th e area a t the back of, th e stand to house a directors’ suite, office
    accom m odation a n d a social club. H ow ever, it is c o m m o n g ro u n d th a t this add itio n is
c not an integral p art o f th e stru c tu re o f th e stand, w hich could have been b u ilt, a n d indeed
    was originally designed to b e bu ilt, w ith o u t th e added building.
       T he stand was designed to take seats, a n d seats w ere fitted. T he expense o f fittin g the
    seats has been allow ed as a d eduction for tax purposes o n th e gro u n d th a t th ey are p lant
    qualifying for capital allowances u n d e r th e Finance Act 1971, s 41. T he old stand
    provided accom m odation for 3,455 spectators; th e new stand provides accom m odation
 fj for 3,162. T he C ricket Field stand can accom m odate 4,419 seated spectators, a n d the
    open terraces opposite th e B runshaw Road stand a n d opposite th e Cricket Field stand
    together accom m odate betw een 28,000 and 30,000 sta n d in g spectators. D ifferent
    charges are o f course m ade for access to different p a n s o f the g round, ra n g in g from
    £ 1 2 0 for access to th e open terraces to £ 2 90 for access to the B runshaw Road stand.
       There are tw o m ain questions in th is appeal. The first is w h e th er the erection o f the
 e new stand was a ‘re p air’ o f prem ises occupied by the club. T here is a subsidiary q uestion
    whether, if it was a repair, the cost o f re-erecting the stand was nonetheless o f a capital
    rather th an a revenue nature. T he very experienced Special C om m issioners decided
    these questions in favour o f the club. From th e ir decision the C row n appeals. The
    second question, w hich arises only if th e erection o f th e new stand was e ith e r not a
    ‘repair’ o r was a repair w hich o u g h t to be charged to capital and not to revenue, is
 f whether the e x p en d itu re was e x p en d itu re on the provision o f plant for the c lu b ’s trade,
    attracting a \oo% first year allowance u n d e r s 41 o f the Finance Act 1971.

     Thefirst question
       Section 130 o f the Incom e a n d C orporation Taxes Act 1970 provides th a t in c o m p u tin g
     the am ount o f profits or gains to be charged u n d e r Case I o r Case II o f Sch D—
ff          ‘n o su m shall be deducted in respect o f . . . (d ) any su m expended for repairs o f
         prem ises occupied . . . for the purposes o f the trade, profession or vocation, beyond
         the su m actually expended fo r those purposes . . . (g) any capital em ployed in
         im provem ents o f prem ises occupied for the purposes o f the trade, profession or
         v o c atio n . . . ’

^ These provisions operate negatively; th at is to say, they are restrictions o n an im plicit
  right to deduct su m s e xpended^or repairs, b eing, o f course, su m s w hich w ere w holly and
  exclusively laid o u t for the purposes o f the trade, profession o r vocation. T he deduction
  is not to exceed ‘the su m actually expended for those purposes’. The effect o f those
  words, as I see it, is to lim it the d eduction to su m s actually expended d u rin g the relevant
  year o f assessment and to exclude a p p o rtio n m en t o f su m s subsequently expended b u t
j attributable to repairs w hich m ay have accrued over a period.
     The first qu estio n is th u s w h e th er the erection o f th e new B runshaw Road stand was
  a ‘repair’ w ith in para (d ). In answ ering th is q uestion it is im p o rta n t to bear in m in d the

         awav th e fum es o f th e furnace w hich provided steam for a colliery was replaced by a new

     I) on th e old. But th a t was not th e g ro u n d , o r at least th e o nly g ro u n d , on w hich
         Rowlatt J decided th e case. H e said1:
                  ‘T his was a factory c h im n ey to w hich the gases and fum es, a n d so on, w ere led by
               flues and th e n w e n t u p th e ch im n ey . It was unsafe a n d w ould n o t do any m ore.
               W hat th ey d id was sim ply this: T hey built a new ch im n ey at a little distance away
               in a n o th e r place; th ey p u t flues to th a t c h im n ey a n d th en , w h e n it was finished, they
     c         sw itched th e gases fro m the old flues in to th e new flues a n d so u p th e new
               chim ney. I do n ot th in k it is possible to regard th at as rep airin g a subsidiary p a n o f
               the factory. I th in k it is sim ply hav in g a new one. A nd th ey had th e m b o th .
               Perhaps th ey pulled do w n th e old one; perhaps th ey kept it, because th ey th o u g h t
               it was an artistic th in g to look at. T here is no accounting for tastes in m an u fa ctu rin g
                circles. A nyhow , th ey sim ply b u ilt a new ch im n ey a n d started to use th at one
     d          instead o f th e old one. I th in k th e c h im n e y is th e e n tire ty here and th ey sim ply
                renew ed it.’
          The decision o f th e C o u rt o f Session in Sam ud Jones & Co (Devonvale) Ltd v Inland
        Revenue Comrs3 stands in sharp contrast. T here th e taxpayer com pany carried on the
        business o f processing p aper in a factory. A ch im n ey w hich earn ed away th e fum es from
      B furnaces w hich heated boilers w hich in tu rn produced steam for th e factory becam e
        unsafe and h a d to be renew ed. To avoid in te rru p tio n in th e w o rk o f th e factory a new
        chim ney was b u ilt w hile th e old rem ain ed in use. But b o th th e old and new chim neys
        were part o f th e stru c tu re o f th e m ain factory block. The com m issioners fo u n d : Seen
        from inside th e b u ild in g , th e b o tto m p art o f th e ch im n ey resem bles a p illar w ith t he ro o f
         running into its sides.’ T he com m issioners held th a t they w ere b o u n d by th e decision o f
      f Rowlatt J to h old th a t th e construction o f th e new c h im n e y was not a repair. In
         reviewing th at decision th e L ord President o f th e C ourt o f Session (Lord Cooper) said :
                    ‘It is no p art o f o u r d u ty to review th e decision o f R ow latt, J„ as applied to th e facts
                 in the O 'G rady case1, b u t, so far as th is case is concerned, th e facts seem to m e to

       T here is one o th er case 1 should m e n tio n as it is referred to in th e case. In Wynne-Jones
. (inspector o f Taxes) v Bedaie Auction Ltd1 th e taxpayer com pany carried o n business as
    auctioneers o f cattle. It purchased a n auction m a rt co m prising livestock pens, stalls, a
    small office b u ild in g a n d a cattle ring. T he rin g was sm all in area (1,820 square feet)
    com pared w ith th e w hole (som e 23.000 square feet), and was largely reb u ilt. A ro o f w ith
    a ventilation system was p u t over th e e n tire ring, w hich had previously been partly
    open. Foster J rejected an a rg u m e n t th a t th e w hole property occupied by th e taxpayer
    com pany had been repaired. H e said2:

           can be sustained.'
  »
        In the present case th e Special C om m issioners reached th e conclusion th a t th e erection
     of the new B runshaw Road stand was a repair by th e follow ing steps. In para 11 o f th e
     ctafgH case th ey set o u t four ‘relevant propositions' w hich they deduce fro m th e cases to
     which 1 have referred. They are as follow s: ‘(i). Each case has to be decided o n its ow n
     particular facts': a n d they refer to th e Whieldon4 a n d Bedaie Auction1 cases, ‘(ii). W h eth er
  f work done represents "repairs" tu rn s o n id en tify in g “th e e n tire ty "'; a n d they refer to th e
     Samuel Jones5 a n d Whieldon* cases, ‘(iii). W hat co nstitutes “th e e n tire ty ” is a com m ercial
     and business p ro b lem . Is th ere a single p rofit-earning u n d ertak in g , a single profit-
     earning e n tity ? ’: and th ey refer to th e Samuel Jones5 a n d Hodgins v Plunder & Pofw*6
      cases, ‘(iv). T he replacem ent o f a subsidiary u n it w ill be a repair in relation to th e w hole

      they refer to th e Plunder & Poliak case6.
         In para 12 th ey state th e ir conclusion in th e follow ing term s:

               O n th e facts w e fin d th e S tadium to have been th e profit-earning en tity , the
            prem ises occupied for th e purposes o f th e C lub’s trade to w hich paragraph (d) of

         ‘repair’ o f any larger en tity , w h e th er identified as the w hole prem ises occupied by the
      g club for th e purposes o f its business o r as the field a n d su rro u n d in g stands a n d terraces
         alone. As I have said, in reaching the co ntrary conclusion th e Special C om m issioners in
         m y ju d g m e n t placed too m u ch stress on the passages in th e ju d g m e n ts o f Lord C ooper
         in Samuel Jones' a n d o f K ingsm ill M oore J in Plunder & Poliak 1w hich I have cited. In
         speaking o f th e c h im n e y as ‘physically, com m ercially a n d functionally . . . part o f an
         "en tirety ”, w hich is th e factory’, Lord C ooper should not be taken as laying dow n a
      £ principle th at the renew al o f p art o f w hat can be seen as physically, com m ercially and
         functionally a profit-earning w hole is p rim a facie a repair. He was concerned to
         em phasise th at on th e particular facts o f th at case th e c h im n e y was a necessary and
          integral part o f a larg er en tity w hich was repaired.
             As I have reached the clear conclusion th at the erection o f the new stand was not a
         repair, th e fu rth e r qu estio n w hether, if it had been a repair, it could nonetheless have
      g been ex p en d itu re o f a capital n a tu re does not arise for decision. It is also a question
         w hich can only be asked on the hypothesis, in m y ju d g m e n t false, th at th e erection o f th e
         new stand was a replacem ent o f part o f som e larger w hole. It w ould I th in k be
         undesirable th at I shou ld express any o pinion w hether, if th e hypothesis had been well
         founded, the ex p en d itu re w ould have been ex p en d itu re o f a revenue o r capital n a tu re ,
          having regard to th e interval betw een the erection o f the old stand and the erection o f the
      Ij new stand, a n d to th e e n d u rin g n a tu re o f th e new stand.

           The second question
              Counsel’s alternative subm ission for the club was th at th e new B runshaw Road stand
           was ‘p lan t’ attra ctin g a first year allowance. It was, he said, a stru c tu re w hich discharged
           the function o f plant, like the dry dock considered by th e H ouse o f Lords in Inland
       j Revenue Comrs v Barclay, Curie & Co L td1. T he fun ction it discharged was, he said, to
           position spectators so th at they could see the gam e, th a t bein g w hat they had paid th e ir
           entrance m o n ey for. He relied o n the fact th at the cost o f th e seats fitted in the new stand
           had been agreed to be plant, and likened th e stand to th e w ater tow er in M argrett
           (Inspector o f Taxes) v Lowestoft W ater and Gas Co*, w hich th e m ajo rity o f th eir Lordships
           who heard the appeal in the Barclay, Curie case3 considered should have been held to have
       j been plant. H e stressed th at th e Special C om m issioners had foun d that the stand w ould
           have been unsuitable for use by standing spectators, and th a t the seats w ould have been
           useless w ith o u t th e stand.
              I cannot see th at any inference can be draw n from these findings o f the Special
           Commissioners, o r from the fact th at first year allowances have been agreed on the
           footing th at the seats w ere plant. It is freq uently the case th at a b uild in g is designed and
        „ constructed in such a way th at it can conveniently accom m odate the plant used in a

                          INSPECTION VISIT TO NIMES FC, FRANCE


                                       30 MAY, 1989




         Inspection Party:  Glen Kirton (Football Association) Chris
         Whalley (Football League) Richard Faulkner (Football Trust) Alan
         Bennett (FLESA) Bob Perkins (AMA)



         The party was met by a large delegation representing the club,
         the Municipality of Nimes and Ets Gargini, inventors and
         manufactureres of the automatic fence system, the inspection of
         which was the purpose of the trip.

         The following information was ascertained:

             1 The stadium had been built on a green-field site by the
         municipality.   It belonged to the municipality.   The cost of the
         enterprise had been some 170,000,000 FF (£16,000,000).    The
         stadium was used for Rugby as well as Soccer.    There were, on the
         site, four sport/exhibition halls.   The ground had been opened in
         February of this year.

            2 Security at the ground was in the hands of the club and the
         police but a representative of the municipality was at each game
         and had the power to overrule the club in matters of public
         safety.

             3 The accomodation consisted of two seated stands plus a
         terrace behind each goal, capable of converting to bench seating.
         The capacity, with standing, was 28,000.   With seating only,
         22 ,00 0 .

            4 The party was given a demonstration of the automatic fence
         system.  The system consists of a series of interlocking gates.
         The first gate can be opened by the pressing of a button in a
         control room.  The second gate then opens automatically, followed
         by the third, and so on. At Nimes, there are six separate
         sections, all of which can be addressed separately.   Each section
         opens totally in less than a minute.  In the case of electrical
         failure, the system is opened just as swiftly by hand.


                                         -1-
   5 The total cost of the system at Nimes was 1,000,000 FF
(£95,000).

   6 Ets Gargini were looking to find a partner in England to
help promote their product.  They would find a manufacturer in

England if the volume of demand warranted it. An entire system
could, however, be transported to England inside two lorries.

   7 The fences have been tested to a load of 220 kilos per metre
(150 lbs per foot. )

   8 The shape, height and construction of the fences can be
changed as required.  FC Koln in Germany have purchased a system
made of plexiglass.  There has been no need in France to produce
fences of a lesser height than that seen at Nimes, because it is
not acceptable by French safety regulations for terracing to
finish below the level of the pitch.

The party attended a match on the ground in the evening between
Nimes and Brest.   This was a promotion play-off game in the
French Second Division.   The atmosphere was tense as the home
side needed to overcome a 3-0 deficit from the first leg.    There
was much foul play and violence on the field and considerable
disorder among the standing section of the Nimes supporters.
Towards the end of the game, the fencing in front of these fans
came open.  It was later claimed that this had been opened,
contrary to instructions and practice, by a security man who
wished to gain access to the terrace.   The system did have fixed
gates specifically for this purpose.   The fencing was quickly
closed and no-one gained access to the pitch.   At the end of the
match, one or two supporters subjected one of the fences to some
heavy kicking.   It did not give way.

A debriefing meeting was held by the party the following day and
these conclusions were drawn:

   1     The system was impressive in its context.   It would need to
be tested in English conditions to assess its practical worth in
England. * In particular, it would need to withstand the corrosive
effect of the damper English climate.   It would also have to
comply with English safety standards.   (For example, the test
load of 150 lbs per foot that the fence had withstood would have
to be increased to 400 lbs to meet the requirements of the Guide
to Safety at Sports Grounds. ) It was also felt that the
electrical system would have to be reversed in England to make
the system fail-safe.   In other words, the system would be
expected to open automatically if the electrical supply failed.
(NB The system at Nimes has its own back-up generator).



                                -2 -
   2 While the system apparently combined the dual requirements
of safety and security, its success still depended entirely on
human beings making the right decision as to when the gates
should be opened.  It was also vital for provision to be made in
the system for access by the police and stewards to the terraces.

   3 It was felt important that an experiment should be arranged
in England if possible.  The FA and the Football Trust would look
at the possibility of bearing some of the costs of the
experiment. As the installation of a pilot scheme would be of
considerable commercial value to Ets Gargini, they also should be
expected to bear much of the cost of such an experiment.

   4 The party would not be recommending the system to clubs at
the expense of others.  There was no intention to imply that
existing fencing was inadequate.  The purpose of the visit had
been to examine alternatives to existing systems for those
building new grounds, installing new fences or replacing existing
fencing. There was no intention to prejudge any findings that
Lord Justice Taylor might arrive at.

             IDENTITY CARDS FOR FOOTBALL SPECTATORS


                 A REPORT TO THE PRIME MINISTER




At their meeting with The Prime Minister and colleagues held on
1st April, 1985, the football authorities were asked to consider
a number of issues connected with misconduct among football
supporters. The Prime Minister attached particular importance
to the consideration of proposals which had been put forward
for the introduction of a national Identity Card system for
those wishing to attend football matches. She asked the football
authorities to give the matter urgent attention and to report
back to her on the subject within six weeks. This document
constitutes that report.

We have approached the subject from three angles:

1   The practicalities involved

2   The desirability of such a scheme in the purely practical
    terms of whether or not it would produce better behaviour.

3   The effect on football of such a scheme.


1 PRACTICALITIES

The Football Association and The Football League have received
much correspondence over the years from members of the public
advocating the introduction of a national Identity Card system.
The fact that so many people have privately and independently
conceived of the same solution to the hooligan problem has led
both The Football Association and The Football League to give
careful consideration to these proposals.

More recently, a number of companies have made approaches,
offering to supply identity cards, in some cases accompanied by
sophisticated checking systems. The football authorities have
looked carefully at all of these proposals and have met
representatives from some of the companies. Demonstrations have
been arranged at Lancaster Gate. A list of the 19 companies
who have approached The FA is appended. (Appendix A)
In assessing the various proposals, the football authorities
have been mindful of the following considerations:

1    Where, when and by whom would cards be issued? At football
     grounds, police stations, or from a central office? Would
     a card be issued as a one-off, for a period or for an
     indefinite length of time?

2    Could supporters write for cards, or would they be
     required to make personal application?

3    Would cards carry a photograph and would supporters need
     to prove identity before issue? Would the issuing authority
     have the right to refuse to issue a card, and under what
     circumstances?

A    What information would be carried on the card? Name and
     address, age, sex, etc?

5    Would cards be applicable to all matches, or could a
      selective system be applied?

6    Who would pay for the costs of establishing the system and
      on-going costs? Would the card-holder be expected to pay
      a subscription and/or administration fee?

7    What would be the legal and practical implications of
      refusing entry into a ground to a non-card holder? Who
     would bear the cost of the extra police required to
      supervise turnstiles?

8    Under what circumstances might a card be confiscated?
     Would the police have the power to search for and remove
     cards from football supporters - or ordinary citizens -
     apprehended away from a football ground? Who would decide
     whether an offence was football related?

9    Could a system be evolved to prevent supporters whose
     cards had been removed from re-applying under a false
     name?
                                                      \
10   How many cards would need to be produced? A recent survey
     by Target Group Index (Appendix B) has indicated that as
     many as 5.7m people attend at least one football match
     of some description during the course of the season.

11   Would the system be operated by the football authorities,
     by the police or by the company providing the service?
     Would one company or more be involved?
12   Should admission to football matches be by identity card
      only? If so, cards would have to be issued not only to
      spectators, but also to Directors, Executive Box guests,
      Officials, Stewards, Referees and Linesmen, Players,
      Press, Photographers, TV and Radio Personnel.

      If this were considered unreasonable, an agreed list of
      exceptions would require compilation.

13   Which matches would the system apply to? Proponents of
      such schemes clearly intend matches in the Canon League
      to be included, together, no doubt, with games in the
      FA Cup and Milk Cup. But what is intended in relation to
      International matches, club games against foreign sides,
     matches overseas, reserve and youth team matches?

14   How far down the pyramid of football should the scheme
      extend? There are 40,000 clubs registered with The Football
     Association. Only 92 take part in the Canon League - and
     4 of these are Welsh. If a scheme was to apply only to
     Football League clubs, how would it deal with the common
      situation of a match in the FA Cup involving one team from
     The Football League and another from outside it?



2 WOULD IDENTITY CARDS PRODUCE BETTER BEHAVIOUR?

The introduction of a universal Identity Card system will only
show benefits in terms of improved behaviour if the potential
miscreant is likely to be caught, if his card can then be removed
and if it is then impossible for him to obtain a new card by
other means.

It is the contention of the football authorities that the scale
of the effort which would be required to police an Identity Card
scheme would be enormous in terms of the likely return.

The practical considerations listed above give, in our view, a
clear indication of the problems involved. A scheme that fudged
any of these important issues would undoubtedly lead £o abuses
and to widespread contempt among those whose behaviour it aimed
to control.
There is also the very real possibility that the need to check
people entering football grounds would produce irritation, leading
to misbehaviour from a wider section of football supporters than
those currently likely to cause trouble and to confrontations
with the police which might attract politically motivated elements
from outside the game. Potential trouble-makers refused entry to
a ground might be tempted to cause disturbances in the vicinity,
thus deflecting police manpower away from the ground.
While these might be seen as short-term drawbacks to be
tolerated in the interest of finding a long-term solution to a
difficult problem, there is the strong possibility, as we shall
examine in the next section, of permanent damage being done to
the game of football in the meantime. There is also absolutely
no guarantee that the hooligan will not go and perpetrate his
misdeeds elsewhere.


3 THE EFFECT ON FOOTBALL

It seems possible that the technology exists to establish a
nationwide Identity Card system. Given sufficient finance and
manpower, it is possible that such a system could be made to
function. We do not believe, as a result, that there would be
a significant improvement in behaviour. We are convinced, however,
that the short-term effects of the introduction of compulsory
identity cards would lead to long-term damage for the game of
association football.

If we examine the statistics of football attendance, we find
evidence that something less than half of the people attending
Canon League matches on any one Saturday are regular supporters
of the staging club. With aggregate attendances running at
400,000+, this means that little more than 200,000 spectators
per Saturday are regular attenders. As clubs play at home once
every two weeks, we may assume that there are some 400,000
committed supporters. If the Target Group Index survey is to be
believed, that leaves some 5.3m people who are not regular
supporters of a Football League club, but who do, at some point
during the season, go and see a football match. Travelling
support may be fairly assessed at around 50,000 per week - an
estimate based on an average of 1,000 per Canon League match.
As this is the section of football followers from which a high
proportion of trouble-makers come, then for every hooligan we
attempt to control through an identity card, there must be at least
100 well-behaved supporters and for every committed fan, there are
more than 14 "casuals."

It is our contention that forcing all supporters to go through
the process of obtaining identity cards would alienate a very
substantial proportion of the well-behaved and non-committed.

It should also be noted here that many clubs now derive much
needed income from spectators from overseas. Arsenal, for
example, are visited at each home match by more than 1,000
fans from Scandinavia, and there is no evidence of misconduct
involving these supporters.




                           -4 -
Many supporters who would applaud any measures taken to
rid the game of the damage inflicted upon it by a minority
of spectators would nevertheless not register because of
philosophical objections to divulging personal information
which might find its way onto a circularised computer list.

Many companies providing substantial sums to clubs through
the hire of Executive Boxes would be reluctant to continue
an association with the game if their guests, who vary from
match to match, were required to obtain cards.

SUMMARY

Football is beset by the problem of hooliganism and the
football authorities are committed to giving open-minded
consideration to any ideas aimed at providing a solution.

Many clubs have already instituted or considered instituting
limited membership schemes for their supporters, often at
some expense to the clubs concerned, and the football authorities
fully support their efforts. Many grounds already have family
and/or season-ticket enclosures. It is a certainty that this
trend will continue. Some clubs, with a higher than average
percentage of regular support, may become "Members only."

It may be that clubs will be able to secure dispensation
from any future all-fencing measures by ensuring that certain
sections of grounds are reserved for card-carrying members.

The football authorities and the clubs, however, are convinced
that a nationwide Identity Card system would do little to solve
the underlying problems manifested through football hooliganism
and that its introduction could well have a seriously adverse
effect on association football as a spectator sport.

A meeting was recently held between The Football Association,
The Football League and the following clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea,
Derby County, Leeds United, Leicester City, Luton Town,
Manchester United and Millwall. Those present at the meeting
unanimously concurred with all of the opinions statedxabove.

                         REPORT OF THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE

                       WORKING PARTY ON MEMBERSHIP CARDS

Introduction


1.   The first request for the football authorities to consider a national

     membership scheme was made by the Prime Minister at a meeting in Downing

     Street on 1st April 1985. called following serious incidents of crowd

     violence during cup matches at Chelsea and Luton.     The suggestion had

     also been put forward in the Government's Official Working Group report

     on Football Spectator Violence in August 1984.



2.   The Football Association, after consultation with the Football League,

     responded to the Prime Minister's request by submitting a report which

     concluded that a "nationwide identity card scheme would do little to

     solve the underlying problems manifested through football hooliganism,

     and that its introduction could well have a seriously adverse effect

     on Association Football as a spectator sport."




3.   The final weeks of the 1984/85 season then, however, produced two further

     appalling incidents of spectator violence - at Birmingham City on

     11th May, and in the Heysel Stadium in Brussels on 29th May 1985.     A

     further meeting with the Prime Minister took place on 12th June, and

     it became clear that the Government was determined to see far more

     effective means introduced of controlling spectator access to football

     grounds.



4.   ?he Football League Working Party, under Hr. Graham Kelly's chairmanship,

     was established as a direct response to the Government's request.




                                     - 1 -                         Continued/2.
Continued/2.




5.   Supporters of a national membership or identity card system (the two

     terms are virtually synonymous, although we understand there is

     considerable sensitivity about the concept of "I.D." cards) received

     a powerful boost following publication of Mr. Justice Popplewell's interim

     report on 24th July 1985.   The Working   Party was   bound to pay particular

     attention to his recommendation that "urgent consideration be     given by

     football clubs in England and Wales to    introduce a membership system

     so as to exclude visiting fans.”




6.   On 30th July 1985 the football authorities again met the Prime Minister

     and senior ministers.   It was agreed that the following steps would be

     taken in concert:




     a)   The Football League agreed to consider a membership card scheme

          and recommend it to clubs, concentrating in the first instance on

          the first and second divisions.




     b)   The Football Association agreed to consider enforcing a membership

          card scheme through the use of disciplinary powers.




     c)   The Government would introduce in the proposed Public Order Bill

          a provision for exclusion orders on football offenders, provided

          that this would be enforced through the membership scheme.



7.   At the meeting the Government offered the assistance of the Central

     Computer Telecommunications Agency to the League’s Working Party.

    After a preliminary meeting with the Chairman, the C.C.T.A. compiled a

    confidential feasibility report which was presented to the fourth meeting

    of the Working Party on 22nd August 1985-

The Scale of the Problem


 8.   English professional football is fighting for its life.   The damage

      inflicted upon the game by the violent activities of a relatively small

      number of individuals who attach themselves to football, and take advantage

      of the opportunities it presents for criminal activity, is incalculable.

      Declining gates, loss of sponsorship income, reductions in advertising

      revenue are all due, to a greater or lesser extent, to the perception

      that football and violence are inextricably linked.   This has been

      underlined by a recent opinion poll conducted by Market and Opinion

      Research International and published in the Sunday Times on the

      18th August 1985.



 9.   The behaviour of English fans abroad*- those attached to -club sides

      playing in European competitions, and to the England national team -

      besmirches the reputation of our country in the eyes of foreigners, and

      also contributes substantially to the poor image of the game at home.

      The lifting of the U.E.F.A. ban on English clubs competing in European

      competitions depends on the action taken by the football authorities

      in the 1985/86 season and the results achieved.



10.   The Working Party wholeheartedly support the efforts being made by all

      political parties to take legislative steps to help tackle the problem,

      and are conscious that, whilst there is undoubtedly an underlying social

      malaise in Britain which could well manifest itself in other sports and

      social activities if we were successful in ridding football of spectator

      violence, the football authorities are expected to do their utmost over

11.   We recognise that we are no longer able to put forward the argument (if

      we ever were) that football spectator violence is a matter solely for

      the law enforcement agencies, not for the game.   Neither can we fall

      back on statistics which demonstrate that crowd disorder takes place

      at only a tiny minority of the 2,500 competitive fixtures involving

      Football League clubs (only eight Football Association Commissions in

      the 1984/85 season).   It requires crowd violence at only one Luton Town

      versus Millwall or Chelsea versus Sheffield Wednesday cup tie, or one

      Birmingham City versus Leeds United League fixture to destroy the results

      of all the patient work undertaken by the game through the year, and

      at the end of last season football had all these to contend with, plus

      the terrible loss of life in the Heysel Stadium and (unconnected with

      hooliganism) the Bradford City fire tragedy.

Objectives for a Membership Card Scheme


12.   The Working Party was asked to consider how the membership card scheme

      could contribute towards tackling the problem.   One objective would clearly

      be to use cards to exclude those individuals whom football clubs did

      not wish to admit to their ground, e.g. those who had been convicted

      of causing violence at, or on the way to or from matches; those who

      offended against club rules, such as taking part in racist or obscene

      chanting (both utterly offensive behaviour, rightly condemned by

      Mr. Justice Popplewell); and those who infringed the new alcohol

      legislation.




13-   A further, perhaps equally important, objective of membership cards would

      be to encourage the creation of a more friendly and amenable environment

      at football grounds including, for example, the establishment of family

      areas, accommodation set aside for children and young people, possibly

      special sections for minority groups such as the disabled, as well as

      areas for other accredited home supporters.




                                      - 6 -                       Continued/7.
Continued/7.



A National Membership Scheme


14.    Many football clubs have in recent years carefully considered how to

       attract desirable groups of spectators, such a families and children,

       to attend their matches.     (It is a misconception to speak of "getting

       the families back" - a football ground was traditionally a male enclave

       where the only family group attending were father and son.)



15 •   To this end, accommodation has been set aside for these groups, and often

       admission to them is controlled by the use of membership cards.     (The

       Working Party invited clubs to submit details of the schemes they had

       in operation).




16.    In addition, numerous clubs have established supporters' membership

       schemes, open to individuals of good character who are not eligible for

       membership of family or children's schemes, and for season ticket holders.



17.    Safety of Sports Grounds Act regulations lay down strict guidelines for

       segregation of rival supporters, and these structures greatly facilitate

       the creation of reserved areas for members of particular schemes.     At

       many clubs, facilities have been specially improved to cater for these

       groups, particularly refreshment kiosks, lavatories, additional seating

       and so on.



18.    A particular benefit of schemes of this sort is that the club and its

       supporters can be confident that in those areas of the ground where

       admission is controlled by membership, the likelihood of disorder is

       minimal.     If offences do occur, membership is withdrawn and the individual

       banned from the ground.



                                         - 7 -                       Continued/8.
Continued/8.




19*   The task of clubs and the police in implementing bans would be greatly

      enhanced if a legal system of exclusion orders were in force.     We were

       impressed by the view of the police that improved intelligence procedures

       should allow for an effective level of enforcement.   Additionally, such

      orders provide security for the customers concerned in helping to keep

      existing support and attract new business.




20.   The question of away travel is one which exercised the minds of the Working

      Party.   We were conscious of Mr. Justice Popplewell's view that the extent

      of violence caused through clashes between rival groups of supporters

      was such that the time had now arrived for away fans to be excluded

      altogether.   We received details of some outline proposals by clubs to

      bring this about in their own grounds through restricting admission to

      home supporters only, but we noted that none has in fact taken this step

      for the season which has just commenced.




21.   We also took account of the view that a ban on away travel would be hard

      to implement, unless it were backed by a new Act of Parliament and enforced

      by a level of police activity such as occurred in the attempt to prohibit

      the movement of pickets during the mining dispute.




22.   Given that football is 'on probation' for this season, we believe    that

      every attempt should be made to introduce arrangements which will    obviate

      the need for banning away supporters from attending matches.



23.   It is thus necessary to consider how a membership system could help solve

      the away travel problem.   The answer clearly lies in building on the

      success of the individual club schemes, and extending the privileges

      which membership confers at home matches to away games.   To achieve this

                                       - 8 -                         Continued/9..♦.
Continued/9.



      will require a high degree of compatibility between one club's scheme

      and another's.




24.   The first step, therefore will be for all clubs to have a membership

      scheme, the basic principles of which will be common to all.    In our

      view these should cover




      a)   The categories of membership (e.g. season ticket holders, families,

           young people and/or children, accredited supporters, etc.)



      b)   The specification of the membership card.




      c)   A photograph on the card and a duplicate held by the club (except

           for season ticket holders for whom this may not be necessary).




      d)   The length of time for which a card is valid.   We recommend that

           they should be renewed each season.



      e)   The information about the applicant to be supplied on the form

           requesting membership (e.g. full name, address, date of birth).



      f)   Agreement with the clubs on the proportion of the ground capacity

           to be covered by membership arrangements.   We recommend that this

           should normally be not less than 50?.



      g)   In view of the fact that some clubs are contemplating the introduction

           of electronic readers at turnstiles, it will be important to see

           that the electronic data on cards (presumably in the form of a

           magnetic strip) also conforms to a common standard.

                                      - 9 -                       Continued/10....
Continued/10.



25.   To ensure that these criteria are complied with, we recommend that the

      Football League issue guidelines to all clubs to be included in the

      arrangements, thus establishing the concept of a 'Football League approved

      membership scheme'.    Clubs should be encouraged to provide reserved and

      safe accommodation at their ground for away supporters who are members

      of approved schemes.




26.   Whilst we do not recommend that every match should be 'members only',

      for reasons we explain below, we believe it would be possible through

      the use of reciprocal membership arrangements to reduce the likelihood

      of crowd disorder at difficult games by insisting that not only are these

      'all ticket' but also that tickets are to be sold to members only.       We

      envisage that in due course, as membership schemes gain increasing

      acceptance, more and more areas in football grounds become reserved

      enclosures, to which only 'home' members, or 'away' members are admitted.



27.   We do not see a need at present for the membership records for all schemes

      to be stored in a central computer.   It will, however, be necessary for

      clubs diligently to circulate 'blacklists' with photographs of persons

      expelled from membership and banned from grounds.   This information should

      be made available to the police as well as to other clubs.    (If such

      individuals are the subject of legal exclusion orders, they would, of

      course, be committing a criminal offence if they tried to gain admission).



28.   It may be possible eventually for every ground to be equipped with

      sophisticated electronic equipment to scan cards as they are presented.

      We hope, however, that it will never be necessary to refuse admission

      to persons of good character, who for whatever reason, are not members

      of the home or away team's scheme (the so-called 'casual' supporter, who

      perhaps only attends a handful of games in a season, or likes to visit a number

                                      - 10 -                       Continued/ll....
Continued/11.




      of clubs, or who has conscientious objection to being in a membership

      scheme).




29.   The implications for football of such a draconian step go far beyond

      the financial loss which clubs would undoubtedly suffer as throughout

      this report we have taken the view that no proposed measure should be

      rejected on grounds of cost; ridding the game of spectator violence will

      bring football and the country a reward which far exceeds the forseeable

      burden which any of the ideas for membership schemes may impose.



30.   Having taken the view that   'casual' supporters should not be excluded

      from all matches (but recognising that an increasing number of difficult

      games will become 'members only' and 'all ticket') the Working Party had

      to consider how they should be catered for.




31-   It is plainly unacceptable to create, in effect, a 'hooligans enclosure',

      where all the 'ne'er-do-wells', and those expelled from membership schemes

      congregate.   Indeed, there must not be 'no-go' areas at football grounds -

      places where ordinary decent people are frightened to watch from - as

      the whole purpose of what we are seeking to achieve is to improve the

      total environment at matches.




32.   We recognise that this is a difficult problem, but the solution may lie

      in the enhanced ability of the police to recognise and apprehend or exclude

      known trouble-makers, especially through the widespread use of closed

      circuit television and video recordings.   Legally enforced exclusion

      orders would clearly have an important part to play as well.




                                      - 11 -                      Continued/12.
Continued/12.



The C.C.T.A. Report


33.   The Working Party much appreciate the help it received from Mr. Skinner

      and the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency.     The C.C.T.A.

      Report provided invaluable information on how a national computer-linked

      scheme could work.




34.   Whilst some members of the Working Party were sceptical as to the

      feasibility of certain of the findings, (for example, the ability of

      a turnstile operator to turn away a group of individuals holding invalid

      cards five minutes before the start of a match, and with a large queue

      behind them), we were satisfied that the technology exists to permit

      the introduction of an all-embracing national scheme.     Whilst there are

      obvious - and very substantial - cost implications for individual clubs

      (up to £100,000 each) and for the football authorities (in financing

      the national computer data base and the necessary on-line capability),

      we do not reject the C.C.T.A. proposals on the basis there is no money

      in the game to finance it.




35.   Our deliberations were much influenced by the view of the Sub-Committee

      on Hooliganism at Sporting Events of the Association of Chief Police

      Officers, some of which were contained in a letter to the Chairman of

      the Working Party on 16th August 1985.   In particular, the inability

      of the police "to pass information held confidentially by them about

      suspects or offenders, or to verify identification or determine the

      suitability of applicants" seemed to us an important issue.




                                     - 12 -                        Continued/13.
Continued/13.



36.   As the benefits of a complicated and comprehensive scheme along the lines

      of that proposed by the C.C.T.A. did not appear to be overwhelmingly

      greater than the national scheme based on individual membership at clubs -

      bearing in mind the many potential objections to it and the enormous

      cost - we do not feel able to recommend it at this stage.




                                     - 13 -                       Continued/14.
Continued/14.




Conclusions


37.   The Working Party concludes that it is possible to establish a national

      membership card scheme for Football League clubs which does not require

      extremely expensive computer-based electronic equipment at each ground,

      or which totally excludes away supporters or decent football fans who

      are not members of schemes from the great majority of matches which are

      expected to be trouble free.



38.   We recommend that the Football League urgently draws up guidelines for

      'inclusive' membership schemes (following the advice given in paragraph

      24 of this report) with a view to ensuring their compatibility with one

      another and at the same time providing guidance, with the help of the

      C.C.T.A., to clubs wishing to instal electronic equipment to check cards.




39.   We recommend that the Football League introduce regulations requiring

      clubs to establish areas of their grounds for the use of members, with

      normally at least 50 per cent of the ground's capacity reserved for this

      purpose.




40.   We recommend that the Government includes in its proposed Public Order

      Bill a provision for exclusion orders on football offenders, to back

      up membership schemes, and for clubs and police to redouble their efforts

      to prevent undesirable non-members from entering their grounds, including

      the circulation by clubs of blacklists of banned persons.



41.   The Working Party believe that if these recommendations are followed

      the system introduced will comply with the agreement reached between

      the Government, the Football Association and the Football League at the

      Downing Street meeting on 30th July.     The national membership card scheme

                                     ~ I1* -                       Continued/15....

      should impose little financial burden on clubs, and indeed provide some

      commercial opportunities for them as' a result of their obtaining more

      information about their customers.



     The successful operation of the scheme will, in addition, provide a measure

      of security and reassurance for the decent supporters who continue to

     be the backbone of English professional football, as well as a

     demonstration to U.E.F.A. and F.I.F.A. that English football is determined

     to put its house in order.

1.   INTRODPCTIOK

     This report presents the results of the first stage of our Study into how
     to implement a National Membership Scheme covering all 92 Football League
     Clubs. The requirements and principles of the Scheme were set out in the
     Report of the Minister for Sport's Working Party which was given to us on
     November 7 1988. Chapter 1 summarised the requirements and is included as
     Appendix A.

     Our terms of reference were to indicate practical timescales for the
     Scheme's implementation and in particular recommend whether a scheme could
     be implemented by the start of the 1989/90 season. In addition, we were to
     indicate in outline how implementation should be approached, the order of
     costs which might be needed, and say how we would proceed with subsequent
     stages of the work.

     Our main task in this first stage has been to determine timescaler. and
     therefore we have concentrated on identifying the key issues which will
     effect most the speed at which a scheme can be introduced:

     o   to identify the problems which clubs will face in ensuring the safe,
         efficient entry of spectators and coping with the financial impact we
         visited 8 football league clubs (as well as talking to a number of
         others) and reviewed behind the scenes procedures and observed
         turnstile operations. The clubs visited (Arsenal, Liverpool, Wigan,
         Oxford, Reading, QPR, Tottenham, Luton) were both large and small,
         some with computer systems, some with partial membership schemes and
         one with a full scheme already established, although it does not allow
         away supporters.

     o   we also held discussions with representatives of the Football League,
         Football Association, Police, Home Office and Department of
         Environment to examine the associated legal, policing and
         administrative issues

     o   we reviewed the technology and systems options by interviewing a
         cross-section of 15 computer manufacturers, system suppliers and
         consortia

     We wish to record our appreciation to all those interviewed for their
     co-operation and positive approach to our questions. A summary of the key
     issues identified is given in Section 3.

     Section 4 reviews the advantages and disadvantages of the available
     technology.

     Section 5 sets out how the implementation strategy should take account of
     the key issues and available technology.

     Section 6 addresses in more detail how quickly a scheme can be implemented.

     Sections 7 and 8 give some rough indications of the costs and revenues that
     may be anticipated from the scheme.

     The next section summarises our overall conclusions and recommendations.
                                                                                    2


2.   MANAGEMENT SUMMARY

     2.1   Timescale

           Our main task has been to recommend a practical timescale for the
           National Membership Scheme. Our overall conclusion is that full
           implementation should not take place before the latter half of the
           90/91 season and that it may prove necessary to delay until the start
           of the 91/92 season.

           However, much can be done by the Minister for Sport's target date of
           Spring 90 to put into place many of the basic elements necessary for
           the full Scheme to go into operation. By that time all clubs could be
           operating membership schemes for most fans or on a 100% basis, but not
           necessarily using fully computerised card readers or a national
           referral file. Casual supporters might still be allowed but in
           limited numbers and would not receive the advantages of club
           membership. Movement to the full system would have to wait for the
           final approval of the Football Membership Authority (FMA) that all
           grounds met their inspection criteria.

           Our project plan together with description of the main tasks is given
           in Section 6. The key milestones ares

           -     Supplier(s) Selection                              July 1989
                  End of Prototyping and Requirement Confirmation   December 1989
                  End of Pilot Testing and Decision to Implement    April 1990
                  Begin Partial Operation                           August 1990
           -     Full Operation                                     Early 1991 or
                                                                    August 1991

           It must be emphasised that the programme of work assumes early
           decisions on resources to progress the project plan as the deadlines
           are tight.

     2.2   Strategy

           We have recommended a strategy (described in Section 5) which will
           enhance the chance of successful implementation of the Scheme. It
           requires:

           1.!   Proving reliability of technology and systems through a carefully
                 planned programme which tests whether the Scheme will work in
                 real life.

           2.    Enabling continued flexibility for local police and clubs to deal
                 with offenders and difficult situations whilst meeting laid down
                 national standards.
                                                                              3


      3.   Phasing in the basic elements of the national scheme so that:

           -    technology and systems can be tested in increasingly
                difficult live situations
           -    club management, turnstile operators, stewards and police
                 can develop experience and test procedures
           -    the national scheme management and referral files can be
                developed and tested
           -    clubs are given time to cope with the initial financial
                 impact which is likely to be detrimental
           -    spectators can become familiar with holding and using cards

      4.   The Football Authorities and clubs to get behind the concept of
           club membership and promote the positive benefits that are
           beginning to evolve in some clubs.

      5.   Football to do even more to Attract back to the game 'desirable'
            spectators in larger numbers. As well as promoting the positive
           benefits referred to above, the chances of the Scheme becoming
           successful will be enhanced by a determined drive by The Football
           Authorities to eliminate other undesirable aspects of the game,
            raise its entertainment value and once more make football the
           national sport to be proud of.

2.3   Key Issues

      The detailed development of the Scheme must deal with how to:

      o    minimise turnstile process time and the queuing problems that
           will occur in large crowds close to kick-off and keep them within
            acceptable limits
      o    fund the Scheme, bearing in mind its costs and the potential
            severe initial financial impact of losing casual supporters
      o    ensure the application process, card validation and issue meets
            the Scheme's requirements within acceptable turnaround times to
            spectators
      o    deal with offenders or suspected offenders both at matches and
            subsequently
      o    keep within manageable limits the size of the referral file and
            still enable sufficient protection against lost, stolen and
            forged cards and pass backs on match days

      These are described in more detail in Section 3.

2.4   Technology

      We have examined the technology available and Identified six options
      (described in Section 4). This review showed that no one supplier was
      able to demonstrate conclusively at this stage that their technology
      or approach could satisfy the total requirements of the National
      Membership Scheme. The most suitable suppliers now need to be
      shortlisted against a detailed Statement of Requirements and a test
      programme set up*
                                                                           4


2.5   Financial Implications

      We have also presented in Section 7 a rough initial evaluation of the
      financial impact of the Scheme, using a variety of different
      technologies and scenarios. The figures contain a number of estimates
      which need considerable further evaluation but indicate the size of
      the task ahead. The most significant cause of uncertainty is
      membership fee income as the fee to be charged for the period of
      membership and the overall effect on gates is not clear.

      Section 8 also lists a number of revenue raising ideas which need
      further evaluation and also the development of a marketing strategy by
      The Football Authorities and League Clubs.
                                                                                    5


3.   THE KEY ISSUES

     To develop the most practical and effective way of implementing the
     National Membership Scheme we needed to identify the issues which were
     critical to effective implementation and consider their impact on
     implementation timescales. To do this, the following activities were
     carried out:

     o      we reviewed the range of conditions and circumstances at clubs within
            which the Scheme must operate

     o      using the basis of the Working Party Report, we began to examine the
            detailed steps in the membership process from time of application
            through use at ground, to dealing with offenders, and considered the
            likely difficulties and loopholes.

     o      we also took into account the available technology, systems and
            supplier's ability to cope with the requirements of the Scheme and
            combat the difficulties and loopholes (see also Section 4).

     The following is a summary of the more important difficulties the Scheme
     needs to cope with:

     3 .1   The Cost of Introducing The Scheme Including the Likely Initial
            Loss of Casual Supporters

            Clubs generally felt there would be a significant reduction in crowds
            on the introduction of the Scheme.

            All clubs (with the exception of Luton who have a members only scheme)
            claimed a substantial proportion of casual supporters, often at least
            one third of the total gate. Some clubs in the London area have a
            large number of foreign visitors and tourists which exacerbates this
            problem. Luton also admit to a significant fall in gates due to loss
            of casuals initially, although crowds have risen since.

            In addition, clubs will need to finance the setting up of the Scheme.
            For many small clubs this could be a very serious problem. The means
            of funding will need further careful consideration, including the
            availability of grants, and the timing of payments to allow for tax
            and cash flow.

            Offsetting these costs will be potential revenue from commercial use
            of the membership list. From the experience of clubs using their
            existing membership lists and from discussion with commercial
            organisations we do not yet know whether it will be possible to
            recover enough revenue from these activities to offset the complete
            cost of the Scheme.
                                                                               6


      Our financial model in Section 7 gives some rough indications of costs
      and a range of possible revenue generating activities Is discussed in
      Section 8.

3.2   The Effect on Crowd Flow Through Turnstiles and Queues Around
      Kick-off Tiie

      3.2.1   Factors Affecting Crowd Flow

              Turnstiles are generally narrow with little space for the
              spectator to pass through and in some cases access to
              turnstiles is also relatively limited. At periods close to
              kick-off there will often be large queues.  It is the norm for
              up to a half the spectators to arrive in the last twenty
              minutes prior to or the ten minutes after kick-off.

              In general delays close to kick-off time pose a serious threat.
              Whilst at games with small crowds this may not be a major
              problem, even minor delays at big games will lead to much
              longer queues with a high risk of unrest developing amongst
              those waiting.

              The present expected rate of flow into the ground is dictated
              by the Safety of Sports Grounds Act. The Guide to the Act
              anticipates that "it is unlikely that the maximum notional rate
              per turnstile would exceed 750 persons per hour". This is
              equivalent to approximately 13 per minute or 1 every 4 seconds.
              This establishes the extreme limit to the response time of the
              access control system, although an acceptable realistic limit
              of 2 seconds must be met due to the other actions necessary
              when entering the ground.

              Therefore, within this response time limit, the complete
              transaction of electronic reading and validation must be
              undertaken. This is described in detail in Appendix C - Steps
              in the Membership Process. The key technical issues which
              might affect the ability of the system to respond within 2
              seconds are:

              -   a card misread error rate of 0.5 “ 2% must be allowed for;
                  existing systems at club grounds fall within this range

              -   in large grounds there may be up to 100 card reading devices
                  trying to communicate simultaneously within the club system
                  (at least one club has already experienced this problem)

              -   portable card reading terminals will need to be able to hold
                  the complete referral list (including lost and stolen cards)
                  and check that list for each card read; for cabled systems
                  this list will be held on the club system and will need to
                  be searched for each card read
                                                                         7


        -   to use the match attendance members list for post-match
            commercial activity, every card member will need to be
            entered onto a computer file held on the club system

        -   anti pass-back of cards measures will need to be operating

        -   if the card is invalid the stewards/police will need to be
            informed of the status of the card.

3.2.2   Practical Experience of Clubs

        Our observations at games confirmed the additional time to pass
        through swipe readers is generally around two seconds, with a
        total time of around five seconds including cash payment. This
        could have a significant effect on queue lengths near kick-off
        time at games with big crowds. The impact needs further
        careful consideration and can be simulated using computer
        models. Push/pull readers appeared to give turnstile operators
        the chance to take cash simultaneously. This should also be
        studied further.

        It should be remembered that no club has yet had the additional
        complications posed by a 100% scheme including away supporters,
        or the requirements to check card entry against a referral file
        of invalid cards.

        At Luton Town where there are fully automatic turnstiles (at
        one end) with fans inserting the cards, the flow of spectators
        was much slower than where turnstile operators inserted the
        cards. This was combatted by separating cash payment which
        takes place at another turnstile.  It is also worth noting that
        the Luton system does not necessarily keep out away supporters
        which were strong in number at the match versus Arsenal.

3.2.3   Alternatives

        Two other alternatives need consideration:

        (1)      attracting spectators into the ground earlier to reduce
                 the peak before kick-off would lessen the problem.
                 However it will not be easy to change the habits of
                 large numbers of people developed over many years.
                 Additional attractions or facilities prior to kick-off
                 will probably be needed if this option is to have much
                 effect.

        (2)      minimising cash taking at the same turnstile as cards
                 are validated. This is similar to the scheme at Luton
                 Town but it is only possible at grounds where space
                 allows. A more effective way may be to increase
                 substantially the amount of credit card sales of
                 tickets. This is happening at Tottenham.
                                                                            8


3.3   Processing of Application Foras and Card Issue Turnaround

      3.3.1   Collection of Application Forms

              It was recognised that currently many clubs have been handling
              their own membership application process and we consider that
              this should continue. However if this was the only route for
              applicants to submit their forms then an additional obstacle
              would be placed dn the way of potential members. We also
              consider that a nationwide collection agency together with the
              clubs would probably provide the way of collecting the forms
              and handling the initial verification.

              Therefore discussions were held with the Post Office on the use
              of 18,000 offices as a collection agency for completed forms as
              well as League Clubs. Two major areas of difficulty arose:

              -   legislative powers will need to be granted to the Post
                  Office to enable it to perform this role for a
                  non-Government body

              —   in the majority of cases, application forms will need to be
                  accompanied by two recent photographs. An increase in the
                  siting of photographic booths near League Clubs and Post
                  Offices will be needed. Also a check will have to be made
                  that the photographs accompanying the application form are
                  an acceptable likeness to the applicant - the applicant will
                  have to apply in person

      3.3.2   Meed for Sophisticated File Search Techniques

              To ensure that troublemakers cannot obtain a replacement or
              duplicate membership card, fairly sophisticated searching and
              matching techniques will need to be offered by the central
              systems before registration. Example of the technique include
              the ability to be able to identify that J. R. Smith and
              J. Smith residing at the same address may be the same person.

      3.3.3   Investigation Procedures

              Also, since it is likely that it will be a criminal offence for
              an applicant to supply false information when making an
              application, procedures for the identification of these
              Individuals and further investigation, possibly leading to
              prosecution, will need to be defined.

      3.3.4   Processing Initial Volumes

              The volume of applications to be processed and membership cards
              to be produced are two of the major activities which will
              influence the ability to accept members into the Scheme
              quickly.
        It has been estimated that eventually up to 5 million members
        will be required to maintain football crowds at their present
        levels. This will mean that at least half of that number will
        probably try to obtain a card before the Scheme can be
        operational. The most optimistic estimate for the production
        of cards (from one potential supplier) is 5,000 per hour.
        Using this figure would mean that 60 days (8 hours/day), would
        be required for the production of 2.5 million cards.

        Also, it has been further estimated that each application form
        would take 1 minute to key the data in. Using this figure, to
        maintain the card production speed would need 87 keyboard
        operators for that 60 day period operating an 8 hour day.

        Further problems could arise due to the delay between
        application form completion and the spectator receiving the
        card.  It is unlikely that this delay will be less than 3-4
        weeks during the initial high-volume period. Card issue at
        clubs will not be possible unless the use of temporary cards is
        acceptable to the Government during this period. However this
        would raise additional processing and checking problems.

3.3.5   Postal Application

        Because of the need to verify the applicant's details by
        checking the proof of identity, proof of address and
        photographic likeness, we consider that it will not be feasible
        to use postal methods for membership application, unless the
        use of referees as for passport will be acceptable. This may
        have a major impact on the number of applications.

3.3.6   Renewal of Membership

        Eventually the membership period will lapse and it will be
        necessary to set up a simple procedure for the member to renew
        the membership. This will require careful design to avoid
        fall-off in membership at this point.

Referral List Preparation and Speed of Access

3.4.1   Hotification Process

        The notification process to the FMA will need to be defined and
        made operational before the Scheme begins in order to capture
        as many of the names of troublemakers as possible. These
        procedures may require changes to the existing notification
        procedures eg Exclusion Orders.

        This will impact on the work load of the judicial process,
        police, league club and other sporting bodies such as the
        management of non-League grounds (Wembley) and other sporting
        venues since the success of the Scheme will depend upon
        exclusion of the perpetrators of sporting related offences.
                                                                         10


3.4.2   Referral List Size

        Various estimates for the size of this referral list have been
        produced. The credit card companies experiences In this area
        are valuable and further discussions with these organisations
        will be necessary. For the performance and costing estimates
        In this report, we have assumed that 1% of the total card
        population per annum will be entered onto the referral list
        with a further 4% of the card population per annum for other
        reasons such as stolen or lost cards. This would lead to a
        staggering 200,000 membership numbers transferring to the
        referral list per annum for a membership of 4 million!
        Hopefully this will prove to be an over estimate or possibly
        ways found to reduce the number (see 3.4.4).

        An alternative approach Is to look at numbers of arrests and
        ejections. According to reports there were 6147 arrests in
        1987/8 and 10% more reported ejections (say 13,000 arrests and
        reported ejections).  If all were entered on the file over 5
        years, this could add 65,000 names to the file. This excludes
        ejections not reported In the past and other reasons such as
        lost, forged, stolen.

3.4.3   Legal Issues

        There are also a number of legal Issues which will need to be
        addressed In addition to the current draft legislation. We
        have briefly examined some of these issues but further detailed
        work will be necessary. From our meetings with the Government
        Departments responsible for drafting the legislation, we
        understand that these issues will be addressed by them. The
        FMA will need to maintain close contact with these Government
        Departments.

3.4.4   Possible Methods to Reduce the Size of the Referral List

        Instead of recording on the referral list all lost/stolen cards
        at the time of notification by the spectator or in the case of
        passed back cards at the time of multiple use, the system could
        post-match process the spectator entry file. This process
        would search for multiple entries on that file to indicate
        whether the card had been used more than once at the same
        match. The card could then be invalidated centrally and the
        authorities alerted that a possible offence had been committed.

        The spectator entry file can also be compared with the
        stolen/lost card file which would be held separately from the
        referral file and updated regularly from the central system.
        This comparison would identify whether any reported lost/stolen
        cards had been used at a match and if so arrange to transfer
        the membership number to the referral file. This would lead to
        an indefinite ban, the inference being that the card is being
        used to enter grounds illegally and might be used again.
        These two post-match processes would be likely to considerably
        reduce the referral list and reduce the communication
        requirements, both of which Increase the capability of the
        turnstile devices to respond within the 2 second time limit.

        However, using a post-match process will mean that the possible
        offence will go undetected the first time it is committed.

Dealing with Invalid Card Holders at Turnstiles

3.5.1   Invalid Card Procedures

        Turning back spectators with invalid/no cards through large
        queues may not be straightforward, particularly when a
        proportion of mis-reads/malfunctions will take place. These
        are likely to lead to protests by spectators who in some cases
        may be genuine members.

        The alternative to turning away people with invalid/no cards
        would be to let them in and have then interviewed/detained in
        special areas on the ground side of turnstiles. Whilst this
        will be possible in some cases, ground modifications will often
        be needed.  In other cases space will not allow modification
        without major structural change and spectators will need to be
        escorted to areas away from turnstiles.

3.5.2   The Investigation/Detention Process

        Additional support from stewards/police may be needed at the
        turnstiles to handle any invalid cards identified. This will
        require local discussion between the club, stewards and police.
        At this stage the following points are important:

        -   if the system identifies an invalid card, then the spectator
            presenting that card could be allowed to pass through the
            turnstile before being apprehended or could be turned back.

        -   if the spectator is allowed to enter the ground then the
            system will need to alert the authorities inside the ground
            at the point of entry. There will need to be a method to
            visually inform the authorities of the problem and identify
            the turnstile entry point preferably without alerting the
            spectator.  (Some existing systems use flashing lights).

        -   an investigation/detention area will need to be available
            for each block of turnstiles. This will need to be able to
            hold several spectators at any one time undergoing
            interrogation/investigation. The area will need to be
            equipped with a standard terminal linked to the club and
            possibly the national system in order to carry out the
            investigation. This may be located at a central point at
            the smaller clubs.
                                                                         12


        -   manning levels of stewards/police will need to be determined
            by local consultation.

        -   if it is identified at this point that a criminal offence
            has been committed, then the police detention procedures
            will take over from that point.

3.5.3   Liaison Between Clubs and Police

        At all clubs visited there was excellent liaison with police.
        However, the procedures for dealing with problems will differ
        depending on match circumstances and physical conditions at the
        ground as well as the views of local officers as to how best to
        deal with different situations.

        Generally clubs and police felt that few serious problems were
        now occurring within the ground as a result of the measures
        that have been taken over the last two years (ie. segregation,
        more policing/stewarding, CCTV).
THE TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE

4.1   Review Process

      Over the past 18 months many organisations have approached the
      Football Authorities and the Government Departments concerned with a
      variety of technical and commercial offers. These amounted to more
      than 60 companies and included the majority of the credible suppliers
      of this type of technology. A separate conanercially Confidential
      Appendix contains more details on each of these organisations.

      The process by which we evaluated these options was to Invite selected
      organisations to prepare (and present in certain cases) a statement on
      their capabilities to undertake this project. We provided them with
      an outline of the system requirements and the likely evaluation
      criteria we would apply to the eventual procurement process. These
      are contained in Appendix B together with detailed descriptions of the
      options and the results of this process.

      The purpose of this process was to provide:

      o    An in-depth review of the technology options available and, more
           importantly, the risks factors involved in this project

      o    A review of the capabilities of potential suppliers

      o    Opportunity to feedback and receive ideas from interested
           commercial organisations

      o    Identification of the wider technical, organisational and cost
           options.

4.2   Summary of Results

      Our overall conclusion was that no one supplier was able to
      demonstrate conclusively at this stage that their technology or
      approach would satisfy the total requirements for the implementation
      of the National Membership Scheme

      However each of the technology options reviewed did show different
      advantages and disadvantages over each other.

4.3   Summary of Advantages/Disadvantages

      4.3.1    Bar Code

              This is the simplest technology offered and much experience of
              card production techniques and bar code use exists particularly
              in the retail environment. The incidence of failure at
              turnstiles appears to be the lowest and with the additional
              security features described in Appendix B would provide a high
              enough level of security. The main disadvantages to the use of
              this technology would be the need to link every terminal at the
                                                                          14



        turnstiles to a central club system by cables with the inherent
        problems, such as breakages, vandalism etc. It also means that
        the hardware/software system at the club would need to be
        powerful enough to provide the response times needed at the
        turnstiles (perhaps up to 90) while searching through large files
        (referral lists, anti-pass back files etc).

        However, this option would mean that some of the existing
        Investment in club systems might be saved for reuse. Also
        systems could be supplied by many companies if national
        performance standards are defined.

4.3.2    Magnetic Stripe

         This option has very similar attributes to the bar code option
         except that the reliability of the stripe is slightly worse
         than bar codes and there is a need to replace the cards
         regularly to avoid this error rate increasing to unacceptnble
         levels.

         Also the ease with which unshielded magnetic stripes could be
         changed (an encoding device can be bought for £750) makes them
         a greater security risk than bar code cards. An example of
         this would be. if a supporter is banned and his card not
         confiscated then it could be altered to another membership
         number and the card reused; there is no check at the turnstiles
         whether the membership number has been issued.

4.3.3    Read/Write Magnetic Stripe

         This option has a shielded magnetic stripe together with an
         area for writing data to it at the turnstile.   It obviously
         increases the security of the card and enables anti-pass back
         measures to be effectively implemented. However it still
         suffers from some of the same problems of communication with a
         club system that the previous two options have.

4.3.4     Smart Card

          The Smart card options have the greatest numbers of features
          available for all the options and appear to be the most
          flexible. However, they are very new technology to the UK and
          are only now being used on some retail/financial trials but
          they are becoming common place in Europe and a lot of interest
          is being shown worldwide. This lack of proven implementations
          and possibly cost will be their biggest disadvantages.

          One of the best ways of describing their capabilities is to
          consider them as many different cards in a single card package.
          The uses of multiple cards cover:
                                                                         15



        -   credit
        -   debit
        -   cheque book
        -   electronic purse
        -   notebook
        -   access control
        -   personal, lifestyle data on spectators
        -   medical data
        -   ticketing

        However, for the requirements of the Membership Scheme, it is
        likely that (at least initially) only one or two of these card
        uses would be required with several of the others being
        additional facilities that some clubs might require to handle
        ticketing, promotions, car parking etc.

4.3.5   Contactless Smart Card

        This Smart card can be read by placing it on top of the reading
        device installed at the turnstile without insertion or swiping
        through the reader.  It offers all the features of the standard
        Smart card described previously with the added advantage of
        speed of reading/writing due to the "contactless" reading
        method. An additional feature allows the card to be read in
        any orientation of the reading device.

4.3.6   Contactless Radio Frequency Card

        The main advantage over the others (excluding the Contactless
        Smart card) is the ability for the turnstile device to read
        cards from a distance of up to 12 inches. This would mean that
        the card holder would hot need to present the card to the
        turnstile operator but just have it on his/her person at the
        turnstile.

        The remainder of the operation would be similar to the bar
        code/magnetic stripe option.

There are also differences in the relative costs of the cards.   (See
Appendix D ) .
IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

Previous sections reviewed the key issues that need to be addressed, the
steps in the process, the technology available and began to identify
potential loopholes. This section takes into account this background and
defines how to proceed in broad terms. It does not attempt to detail all
the mechanics, rather it establishes some key features which are
fundamental if the scheme is to be successfully implemented.

The Keys to Successful Implementation

5.1. Reliability

      The Scheme must be based on well tested, proven technology including
      the cards and readers used, the software links to club computers, and
      the links to the national system. It is important to note that no
      club has yet used a card system under the conditions and requirements
      stipulated in the Working Party Report.

      In particular, there needs to be stringent pilot tests to demonstrate
      that:

      o   card application and issue procedures work effectively with large
           numbers of forms to be processed

      o   equipment and software is reliable under all conditions

      o   turnstile process times are within satisfactory limits

      o   club central computers can process the necessary volumes   of data
           at satisfactory speeds

      o   the linkage between club systems and the central system works
           effectively

      o   accompanying procedures to deal with problem spectators are
           defined with sufficient precision for stewards and police

      To minimise risks, encourage competition and innovation, and allow for
      certain clubs having more sophisticated requirements, it is desirable
      that the Scheme should not be dependent on just one computer supplier.
      However, national standards should be laid down which state precisely
      the level of performance and reliability that all clubs must comply to
      and be responsible to the FMA for their achievement.

5.2   Flexibility

      The means of dealing with offenders (people without valid cards) must
      allow for local ground and specific match conditions, for example,
      crowd levels, access to and space behind turnstiles, ability to adapt
      the stadium to build interview/detention areas. As long as national
      standards are met, flexibility should be given to local police and
      clubs for dealing with ’offenders’ and potentially difficult
      situations.
                                                                                17

5.3. Phasing

        To introduce the Scheme without considerable testing at clubs will be
        extremely risky, contrary to normal practice in implementing systems
        of this complexity and, in our view, inadvisable. There are
        compelling reasons why the timescale for implementation will need to
        be much longer than envisaged in the Working Party Report.

        The following are some of the key areas where additional time will be
        required if the benefits to football are to be realised and the risk
        of provoking problems through the failure of technology, systems and
        procedures are to be minimised.

5.3.1     Technology and Software

          -   as indicated above a variety of tests are needed to be
              progressively carried out under match conditions

          -   establishing a national referral file and testing the use of this
              at clubs, including the impact on read times and spectator flow
              through turnstiles

          -   allowing time for experimentation and different suppliers to
              prove themselves and meet a common standard

5.3.2     Club Management, Stewardlng and Policing Procedures

          -   virtually all clubs are inexperienced at dealing with card based
              systems, on the scale now being required

          -   clubs will together with their agents or general collection
              agencies have to set up the administration to deal with large
              volumes of applications forms, card issue and maintain the
              membership scheme on a continuing basis

          -   clear procedures will need to be developed to deal with all
              likely difficulties/loopholes. These need to be built on
              practical experience rather than just on a theoretical basis

          -   ground modifications may have to be carried out at many clubs
              e.g. building detention/interview areas

5.3.3     National Scheme Management

          -   FMA will need to build up its staff, procedures and experience in
              coping with problems, and issue of referral lists

          -   allowing time for the legislation to be enacted and the full
              requirements of the Scheme to be defined and agreed
                                                                               18

5.3.4   Funding/Financing

        -   each club will need to determine its own implementation plan and
            the finance that will be required

        -   the faster the implementation the greater the likely loss of
            casual supporters to the game

5.3.5   Spectators

        -   time needs to be allowed to change habits and build up a 'card
            holding culture*. Many spectators will not be used to using
            cards

        -   current schemes show that even with experience spectators still
            use cards incorrectly causing delays e.g. they use out-of-date
            cards or insert cards upside down, wrong way round

        In summary, whilst reliable technology and systems are vital to
        successful implementation, other aspects of related club management,
        policing, and allowing time for spectators to become familiar with
        the essentials of the Scheme and the use of cards are vital before
        full implementation takes place.

5.4.    Positive Benefits to Headers

        The driving force behind the Scheme's introduction has been the
        desire by the Government to combat hooliganism but people generally
        wish to join a club or membership scheme for positive reasons
        because they will see real benefits.

        To many people the Scheme's introduction   may be seen as a slur on
        their character, even though this is not   the intention. To overcome
        this, the Football League and individual   clubs will need to focus
        their energies on promoting the positive   benefits to their members.
        Some clubs are beginning to do this.

        Such benefits could include:

        o   cheaper tickets/admission
        o   ensuring safety without heavy policing/stewarding
        o   dismantling of 'caged areas'
        o   provision of better facilities
        o   pre-match/post match lounges, restaurants or entertainment
        o   discounts on purchases at club or local shops
        o   the chsnce to meet players and club management
        o   becoming more involved with club activities
        o   members competitions
                                                                            19

5.5. Link to Other Improvements In the Gane to Attract
     the Desirable Spectator

    The success of the scheme will depend upon whether football can
    eliminate the hooligan element and begin to attract back to the game
    the 'desirable' spectator In larger numbers.

    As well as promoting the positive benefits referred to above, the
    Scheme will be enhanced by the Football Authorities making a
    determined drive to eliminate other undesirable aspects of the game
    and raise its entertainment value, for example:

     o   reducing the still common obscene chanting (through tougher
         police/club action)

     o   minimising the abuse of the rules by players and teams such as
         the professional foul, time wasting, the deliberate slowing down
         or obstruction of play particularly at free kicks, the constant
         use of the offside tactic, arguing and shouting at referees
         (through experimenting with rule changes or allowing tougher
         interpretation by referees)

     o    improving dilapidated stadia and providing more up to date
          facilities for fans (through stronger licensing and inspection,
          or perhaps through the greater use of funds or trusts)

    Whilst we do not pretend these are easy issues that will be solved
    quickly, particularly with the need to comply with FIFA, the
    resolution of these difficulties would go a long way towards
    encouraging fans and the population at large that football is
    determined to win through and restore itself as the national sport to
    be proud of.
                                                                                 20

6.   IMPLEMENTATION TDflSSCALES

     The Government have stated that the National Membership Scheme is to be
     implemented during the 1989/90 season. This timescale has been
     investigated in depth during the study period and we have produced an
     outline project plan (over page) which we consider is feasible but is
     dependant on the following key areas:

           -   early decisions are made to proceed with and resource the
                implementation of the plan
                suppliers can meet the criteria/requirements of the Scheme
           -   clubs can adapt to the changes needed
           -   spectators will accept the changes
           -   legislation can be introduced during this session   of Parliament
           -   police/courts will provide the informationrequested    on known or
                suspected hooligans in order that the FMA can organise their
                exclusion
           -   the FMA is constituted and has the power to manage the Scheme
                fully
                the technical and organisational risks are reduced to acceptably
                low levels

     6.1   Summary

           We consider that introducing the Scheme during the 89/90 season is
           impossible due to the volume and timing of the workload required.
           Indeed introduction during the 90/91 season is only just about
           possible and will rely on the meeting of very tight deadlines over the
           next two years.  It would be more realistic to think in terms of 91/2
           and provide sufficient time for thorough testing and enable clubs,
           spectators, police to gradually become familiar with the different
           elements of the scheme before going live on the full national scheme
           as envisaged in the Working Party Report.

           Scheme Phasing

           The outline project plan is broken done into 4 main areas:

           °    Supplier(s) Selection and System Procurement
           °    Pilot System
           °    Club Representatives
           •    Central Management

           The detailed plans are shown on pullouts at the end of this section
           which can be reviewed together with the remainder of this section.

     6.2   Supplier(s) Selection and Systems Procurement

           A separate commercially Confidential Appendix contains details of all
           the organisations which have expressed an interest in supplying
           services, systems or technical advice to the Football Authorities on
           this Scheme over the past year. This list still continues to grow at
           the time of going to print and will make the selection and procurement
           process a lengthy, time-consuming one. However, we have outlined the
           major activities for this area and estimated the timescale for them.

6.2.1 AY Report Agreed with Football League/FA

        Our report will be presented to the full Football Management
        Committee and FA representatives for approval and to agree the
        next steps.

6.2.2   AY Report and Present to Clubs/FA

        Once the report has been agreed, it should be circulated to the
        Football League Clubs and FA and arrangements made to formally
        present to these bodies and receive feedback on the proposals.
        We consider that the best way to achieve this would be by
        inviting club representatives to regional meetings. At the
        meetings, AY and the Football League will present the report
        and also provide general advice to the clubs on how they should
        be preparing for the Scheme's introduction. A mechanism for
        the answering of all questions raised by the clubs before, at,
        and after the meetings will need to be put into effect.

6.2.3 Develop Statement of Requirements (SOR)

        This document will describe in detail the requirements of the
        Scheme in order that both the clubs and the potential suppliers
        can understand the likely operational requirements of the
        Scheme.  It will expand on the Working Party Report and will be
        divided into three main areas:

        -       Club Requirements
        -       Central System Operation and Management
        -       Other Service Requirements e.g. applications form handling
                at Post Offices or other collection agencies

        It is not expected that this will be the definitive statement of
        requirements since it is unlikely that the legislation will be
        enacted by then and much discussion on the detailed working of
        the Scheme will be continuing. However, it will be in
        sufficient detail to start the selection process.

6.2.4       Ap>ree SOR with Football League and Football Association

            The SOR will need to be agreed by the Football League and FA
            who are the two organisations who are likely to form the FMA
            before the selection process can be started. The remainder of
            this section will refer to this group as the FMA.

6.2.5       Develop Invitation to Tender (ITT)

            The ITT will be developed in parallel with the SOR and will
            define and describe the process for the selection and
            procurement of technology and services. Included in the ITT
            will be:

            -   Selection Process
            -   Evaluation Criteria
            -   System Acceptance Criteria
            -   Contract Terms and Conditions
                                                                        22

        -   Prototyping High Risk Areas to prove the
            Technology/Performance
        -   Pilot System Proving Overview
        -   Outline Implementation Timetable

6.2.6   Brief Suppliers

        With the large number of potential suppliers, we will prepare a
        short presentation on the SOR and ITT and invite potential
        suppliers to that presentation. They will have the opportunity
        to ask questions and to take an ITT and SOR to reply to by the
        bid date. Time will be made available during that process
        (perhaps 3—4 days) for the answering of Initial questions.

6.2.7   Suppliers Discussion/Receive Bids

        A deadline for the submission of bids will be set and suppliers
        will be given an opportunity to discuss the ITT/SOR with the
        FMA and advisors. This will be by appointment only. Also
        during this period, the detailed evaluation criteria will be
        agreed by the FMA.

6.2.8   Shortlist Suppliers

        Once the replies to the ITT have been received and evaluated, a
        shortlist of potential suppliers for each of the areas
        described in the ITT can be decided. The unsuccessful
        tenderers will need to be contacted and an informal debriefing
        of their bids offered.

6.2.9   Shortlisted Suppliers Evaluation

        Detailed discussion will now need to take place with each of
        the potential suppliers. This will involve visits to the
        organisations, visits to reference customers/sites, contract
        negotiations, support contracts, development plans, prototype
        development and evaluation etc.

6.2.10 Select Supplier(s)

        The successful suppliers will be informed and the detailed
        plans for the subsequent stages agreed. Contracts will need to
        be prepared and exchanged and the next stage commenced.

6.2.11 Prototype Planning

        Depending on which suppliers are successful, there will be a
        number of areas Where the risk of failure is too high to be
        acceptable. There will also be a number of a r e a s where the SOR
        will need further development as a result of the previous
        month's discussions at various levels. In order to reduce
        these high risk areas (and possibly to identify further areas
        of high risk), the suppliers will be contractually bound to
        demonstrate that their proposal will satisfy the requirements.
        This is deemed to be the prototyping stage and will require
        rigorous planning, particularly to define the criteria for
        success and failure. It may also be necessary for the FMA or
                                                                            23

            league clubs to provide data, support and facilities for the
            prototyping process.

      6.2.12 Prototype Development

            The suppliers will develop their prototype systems to address
            the high risk areas and to demonstrate and measure the results.

            Some of the high risk areas have been outlined in Appendix B.
            The most notable of these are:

             -   queuing times must remain within acceptable limits

             -   the club system/turnstile equipment must be able to check
                 that a membership card on the referral list can be accessed
                 in reasonable time; the referral list size will need to be
                 checked

             -   anti-pass back measures can be successfully implemented

             -   multiple applications and other anti-hooligan checks can be
                 successfully introduced and the level and sophistication of
                 these checks confirmed

      6.2.13 Prototype Trials

             The prototype trials will need to be conducted in a controlled
             environment defined by the FMA and their advisors and will need
             to demonstrate conclusively that the criteria for success has
             been achieved for each of the high risk areas.  It will also
             need to be shown that the semi-artificial environment in which
             these prototypes are operating can be successfully translated
             to the real world in which they will have to operate.

      6.2.14 Prototype Evaluation

             An in-depth evaluation of the prototype will need to be
             undertaken and the lessons learned fed into the review and
             confirmation of requirements.

      6.2.15 Review/Confirm Requirements

             The original SOR will need to be reviewed in-depth and the
             experience of the procurement process, supplier discussion and
             prototyping considered before the requirements are confirmed.
             This is a vital step in the selection/procurement process and
             will be used as the main vehicle for contract negotiation.

6.3   Pilot System

      We consider that, in addition to the prototyping of the technology as
      outlined previously, it is vital that a pilot scheme is devised to
      demonstrate that:

      -    the technology can operate in the real world of league club
           football
                                                                            24

-       the operating procedures are defined and tested prior to live
        introduction

-       the police/stewarding procedures will operate effectively

        the effect on queuing is satisfactory

-       the investigation/detention procedures are operable

-        the back-up procedures to be used in the event of system failure
        are adequate

-       the cards are suitably resilient and durable

        all other time-critical operations are acceptable

This will require the full co-operation of the clubs, police,
stewards, operators and the public to ensure success. The following
stages are necessary:

6.3.1     Pilot System Planning

          To demonstrate that this will operate in a wide variety of
          situations, we will need to carefully plan the pilot scheme
          operation. We anticipate that several matches will be needed
          and the following situations covered:

          -   partial membership entry (possibly one end of a ground)

          -   full membership entry

          -   at a small club

          -   at a large club

          -   with a small crowd

          -   with a large (90% capacity) crowd

          We will also need to simulate some of the problems that are
          likely to be encountered such as:

          -   problems at the turnstile caused by undesirables trying to
              enter

          -   attempts to pass back the cards

          -   using "lost” cards

          -   using "stolen" cards

          -   using "forged" cards

          These areas will need considerable thought and planning to
          achieve an acceptably close level of simulation to enable
          useful operational information to be produced.
                                                                           25

      6.3.2   Pilot System Development

              The supplier(s) will have to develop and test the system for
              the pilot running. We anticipate that this will only cover the
              club and turnstile system.

      6.3.3   Pilot System(s) Installation

              With the full co-operation of the clubs concerned. The pilot
              system will need to be installed in the clubs. This may
              require the cabling of turnstiles* the installation of a club
              system, the training of police, stewards, turnstile operators
              etc. Obviously, the amount of work involved will depend on a
              number of circumstances such as if the supplier already has a
              system in operation or if the club selected has access control
              equipment installed and we will have to ensure that no existing
              regulations were compromised eg. Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

      6.3.4   Pilot System(s) Operation

              This will have to be carefully co-ordinated and we will need a
              team of observers inside and outside the ground to provide the
              feedback necessary to gain useful information from the
              exercise.

      6.3.5   Pilot System(s) Evaluation

              There will need to be full debriefings of the people involved
              in the pilot running, the observers and full diagnostics from
              the computer systems produced to assess the success/failure of
              the operation. After debriefing from each match, modifications
              to the procedures may be necessary before the next match and we
              will need to allow enough time for this process.

      6.3.6   Decision for Full Implementation

              After the pilot tests, a decision will need to be made by the
              FMA to go ahead with full implementation at all League grounds.

      6.3.7   System Installation

              Following a decision to implement, the detailed Club plans will
              be actioned and the installation work commenced. As a result
              of the pilot scheme some changes may be required to those plans
              and to the systems.

6.4   Club Responsibilities

      6.4.1   Consultation

              Following our initial presentation to the League Clubs, we will
              need to be in touch with them to ensure that all their concerns
              and fears are being considered and the opportunities which will
              develop from this Scheme can be exploited by the clubs for
              their benefit and for the whole of football. This consultation
              process will probably commence with the regional meetings and
              we may need to formalise the process to ensure that all these
              views are considered.
                                                                         26

6.4.2   Plan/Develop Club Implementation Plans

        There will need to be an implementation plan devised for every
        club covered by the Scheme. This will be an iterative process
        which should commence before the suppliers have been selected.
        Initially, we will be producing a guide to help the clubs start
        this process. The process should continue whilst the detailed
        requirements are confirmed.

        Initially, these plans will need to cover:

        -    simulating the effect of the Scheme on process and queue
             times

        -    possible ground changes

        -    recruitment policy e.g. stewards, administration staff

        -     installation advice (ensure ground plans are up-to-date,
              turnstiles have adequate lighting, power etc)

        -     likely changes to existing systems

        -     consideration of the Scheme in longer term planning

        -     financial planning and funding

6.4.3   Plan Ground Changes

            The clubs use the Summer rest period to carry out any ground
            changes. This might cover office accommodation, investigation
            areas, new turnstiles, etc.

6.4.4   Begin Ground Changes

        It may be in the Club's interests to spread any ground
        modifications.  It is possible that changes can begin at the
        end of 88/89 season.

6.4.5   Develop Club Operational Procedures

        Local discussion with the police and club management and
        employees will be necessary to help define the local procedures
        which will need to be put into place for effective operation of
        the Scheme. Obviously the detailed procedures can only be
        devised when the detailed requirements are known and we
        anticipate that will occur during the 89/90 season.

6.4.6   Training

        Once the operational requirements are known, a training
        programme can be developed and the operators, stewards, office
        staff etc trained to operate the scheme. This will not be
        possible until after the full implementation decision has been
        taken.
                                                                           27

6.5. Central Management

    The operation and management of the scheme at the centre has several
    major streams:

     6.5.1   FMA

             This Body will need to be constituted and the rules of the
             Membership Scheme devised for approval by the Secretary of
             State. Several views have been expressed on the role this Body
             will play ranging from the operating company responsible for
             the complete scheme in every club, to the Advisory Board who
             will let the contract for the Scheme, to a commercial company
             who would operate the complete Scheme. Obviously the role and
             responsibility will need to be defined with the eventual
             legislation in mind. The likely relationship of the FMA to
             other organisations is shown in the chart at the end of this
             section.

     6.5.2   Marketing Strategy

             To maximise the potential revenue from the introduction of the
             Scheme, the Football Authorities will need to develop a
             comprehensive marketing strategy in line with the opportunities
             from the Scheme. We foresee the commercial department of the
             Football League leading this activity taking into account the
             FA's ideas.  (See Section 8 for further details on Revenue
             Generation).

     6.5.3   Police/Court Consultation and Other
             Statutory Requirements

             For the Scheme to operate effectively, there must be a process
             agreed for the notification to the FMA of the
             undesirable/hooligan element currently in football. This will
             require extensive consultation with the police and judiciary in
             order to define this element and ensure that a channel is
             opened up to transfer this information. The registration of
             the Scheme under the Data Protection Act will have to be
             carefully investigated during this process (we have contacted
             the Registrar and will be meeting him shortly).

     6.5.4   Government Consultation

             The passage of legislation through the Parliamentary process
             will require the involvement of the FMA and its advisors to
             ensure that all the issues in the Bill are considered in full.
             The two Government Departments directly involved are,
             Department of Environment and Home Office.
                                                                           28

6.5.5   Central Systeai

        The requirements for the central systems to collect and manage
        the National Membership Register will be detailed during the
        SOR and ITT processes. Following the evaluation of the
        suppliers, the successful organisations will be required to
        provide a detailed implementation plan for its development,
        installation and operation. For the purpose of this outline
        plan, we have assumed that the following activities are the key
        areas to be addressed though we recognise that some of the
        options offered by suppliers might not require them.

        -   Procedures Definition

            The various options for the collection of application forms
            and the full application process will need very close
            examination and selection. During the study we have
            examined two major options:

            -      Post Office Counters Ltd. handling the application
                   forms

                   Individual clubs handling the application process, as
                   in several of the clubs visited

            Other options obviously exist such as Banks, Building
            Societies and will need to be investigated in depth during
            this phase.

            With all these options detailed handling procedures for the
            different types of application forms (new card, change of
            address, replacement etc) will need to be defined and
            payment mechanisms agreed.

        -   Central System—development

            Unless a very good fit with an existing membership scheme is
            found, then the system will need to be developed by a
            supplier to a specification agreed by the FMA. This will
            cover the validation, registration, card issue, enquiry
            processes together with the processes to handle the
            operation of banning undesirables, lost cards, stolen cards
            etc.

        -   Central System - Installation

            If the system is being procured from a supplier then the
            installation will need to undertaken. Since this is likely
            to be a large system it may involve building alteration,
            power supply changes, communication lines, cabling etc.

        -   Central System - Begin Communication to Clubs

            We anticipate that the procedure for notification of
            undesirables will be operational by this time creating the
            referral file for communication to clubs. This will be
            preceded by communication tests in both directions with 92
            clubs.

6.5.6   Membership

        Continue Club Membership Schemes

        Most of the clubs already have very active membership schemes
        and these should continue to be promoted during the 89/90
        season and the maximum numbers of members attracted through
        this route.  It is hoped that further incentives to join the
        schemes will be generated from the marketing strategy.

        Transfer to National Membership

        One of the major issues raised by clubs concerned the possible
        loss of their own club members to a National Membership Scheme
        and hence the loss of contact with them. This potential
        problem has been recognised and it appears to be the intention
        to allow clubs to still retain contact with their own members
        despite the National Membership number to be given to each
        member.

        Central System - Membership Enrolment

        The Club’s existing membership schemes will provide a useful
        starting point for the registration of National Members.

6.5.7   Promotion of National Membership

        We consider that it is vital to promote the Scheme for a
        complete season when the football supporter is watching the
        games. Various methods will need to be used:

        -   programme advertising
        -   more and better incentives to join
        -   press and media coverage
        -   "SUPPORT FOOTBALL” campaigns
        -   widen the appeal to other section of the public
            (see Section 5)

        We expect that the National Membership card issue will begin
        during the 89/90 season.

6.5.8   FMA Ground Inspection and Licensing

        The FMA may be responsible to the Secretary of State for the
        inspection of football grounds and the granting of licenses for
        grounds which pass this inspection. Detailed procedures for
        this inspection will need to be agreed with the Secretary of
        State and will probably include ensuring that:
                                                                                 30

              -    access control equipment installed at turnstiles operate as
                   per agreed specification

              -    Club systems are capable of handling a capacity crowd and
                   maintaining an adequate level of performance.

              —    Club procedures handle a predefined invalid card level from
                   the access equipment.

              —    procedures and equipment for communication to the Central
                   Administration System for the receiving of the referral list
                   can handle the enquiry load to a predefined standard

              —    the Membership system at grounds do not contravene existing
                   safety and other operational requirements.

6.6   Scheme Operation

      6.6.1   Initial Operation

              The initial operation can commence at the beginning of the
              90/91 season but in a limited way. Options for this limited
              operation will depend on the particular circumstances at the
              Club and may include a small percentage of casual non-member
              support being allowed into a controlled area or cards being
              visually checked rather than machine-read. This is for the
              following reasons:

              —    The grounds will need to be inspected and licensed before
                   being "accepted" into the National Scheme.

              -    with the decision to implement being made as late as April
                   1990, the time available for installation and testing at
                   grounds will be limited and it is unlikely that all grounds
                   will be ready by August 1990.

              --   it is unlikely that full training can be carried out in time

              -    operational procedures at all grounds will need to be tested
                   and possible modified.

              However we expect that the card-carrying public can begin to
              use their national membership cards for entry into grounds
              wherever possible and the national referral list can be
              developed.


      6.6.2   Full Operation

              Once all grounds have been inspected and licensed, the
              change-over to full operation can happen. We expect this to be
              in the latter half of the 90/91 season or the commencement of
              the 91/92 season.

                 of the        °? WaS calculated usln8 an initial fall-off of 20%
                 to football th anfaVerag® entry Price of £3.50. The total cost
                 l u S J      E                     1 th6Se aSSUmP tions could be £59

      7.2.2        Revenues

                 Offsetting these costs will be the additional revenue raised
                                                  activities     . P„ 86ible


                For example, assuming these achieve the following levels:

                      a membership fee of £5 for 5 years membership

                      a reduction in police costs of 20Z (after a first year
                      Increase of 10%) - yielding £2.4m over 5 years

                                               proP°rtlonal to the number of members at
                                  of £2 profit per member over 5 years (card

                     merchandising the remainder)

               The additional revenue would amount to £26 million.

  7*2.3       Net Cost or Surplus

        There may be a number of ways to turn this into a surplus:

        (1)    increase the effective membership fee per annum by
                increasing the fee and/or reduce the membership period.
               A figure of at least £11 for 3 years membership was
               needed to produce a surplus for all technology options.

        (2)    increase membership levels. However this has most
                effect for the bar code and magnetic stripe cards which
               have a lower unit production cost.

                To break even with a membership fee of £5 for 5 years
                will require the following levels:

                       11.8 million for bar code cards
                       17.8 million for magnetic stripe cards
                —      never ) The unit production costs of these cards
                -      never ) and handling costs exceed the possible
                       never ) revenue

        (3)    Raise more revenue through commercial activities.   To
                break even with a membership fee of £5 for 5 years and
                3.4 million members will require the following profit
                per members:

                       £12 for bar codes
                       £13 for magnetic stripe cards
                       £14.5 for RF card
                       £14.8 for R/W magnetic stripe
                       £15.2 for Smart card
                       £15.7 for contactless Smart card.

        Although the Smart card options cost more than the other
        technologies over the 5 year period, they will enable some
        administrative savings in areas such as season tickets and may
        enable promotions. These are not included in the model.

        The further discussions with suppliers will review how their
        proposals will affect these costs and revenues.

7.2.4   Charge/Match

        An alternative to a fixed membership charge would be to levy a
        charge per match on spectators or combine both approaches.

        The following examines various alternatives of recovering all
        costs over 5 years only for the cheapest technology» allowing
        for the policing and commercial benefits:
                                                        Required Charge
                                                           Per Hatch
                                                          (excl. VAT)



         (1)   No membership charge, assuming loss             52p
               of casuals (as above)

         (2)   No membership charge, assuming no loss
               of casuals                                      17p

               Membership charge £5 for 5 years, 3.4m       No charge
         (3)
               members, no loss of casuals                  required


         (4)   Membership charge £5 for 5 years,               35p
               including loss of casuals

Financing/Funding

During our discussions with suppliers, a very wide range of options
were offered for the financing/funding of the scheme. The options
include:

     purchase of the system and operation by the FMA
     leasing and lease purchase schemes
—    bureau operation for the central system with clubs purchasing
     their own systems
     install and run the system at no cost to the FMA or clubs but
     with marketing rights to the membership list

Detailed discussion will need to take place with the suppliers, FMA
and clubs before a recommendation on the preferred option can be
given.

Consideration should also be given to availability of grants or other
Government funding to assist with the introduction of the Scheme.
REVENUES

At this stage only preliminary consideration has been given to the revenues
that might be raised from the scheme's introduction.

There are a wide range of possibilities:

8.1   Membership Fees

      A direct charge can be made to fans for obtaining a membership card -
      figures suggested range from nothing (to encourage fans to join) to
      £5.  (In the financial model, referred to in Section 7, we included a
      charge of £5 for a five year period).

8.2   Card Advertising

      Sponsors may be attracted to fund the issue of cards.   This is already
      done by some clubs.

8.3   Hardware/Software Suppliers

      Some companies have suggested they may be willing to fund the
      implementation of the scheme either fully/partially in return for
      other benefits e.g. control of the mailing lists, charge on membership
      cards, free advertising.

8.4   Selling/Renting Mailing Lists

      A variety of organisations may find the national mailing list or club
      mailing lists attractive, particularly targeted elements e.g. 15-30
      year olds. These organisations could include:

           -    sports and leisurewear clothing and equipment manufacturers
                video companies
                specialist holiday companies
                other sporting organisations/venues
           -    sponsors
                companies holding executive boxes
                direct mail companies
                publishers
                 sports magazines

      Initial enquiries with users and sellers of mailing lists have
      indicated a range of £30 to £60 per thousand for rental (one-off use),
      with the upper figures being achieved for targeted lists.

8.5   Merchandising

      For the first time clubs, The Football League and FA will have
      available the means to market products directly to the fans. Some
      clubs are already successfully exploiting this opportunity using the
      mailing lists generated by the partial schemes in operation.

8.6   Competitions

      Members could be interested in competitions staged at grounds on match
      days, or at other times particularly if attractive prizes are offered.
      These could be either National or Local.

I   8.7   Identify New Added Value Ideas

          For the first time football will have a demographic profile of its
■         customers. This provides the opportunity to carry out further
          research on customer needs and market new ideas directly to fans.


I   8.8   Marketing Strategy

          A marketing strategy needs to be developed by the League to cover;


I         -    the development of ideas mentioned above

          -    companies interested in capitalising on the commercial
I              possibilities

          —    guidelines to clubs over how to handle mailing lists,
               particularly the preservations of rights of ownership and linkage
I              to the National Scheme

          -    co-ordination of National initiatives

I         This strategy will need to take into account clubs initiatives in
          generating additional revenue and indeed encourage further
          experimentation.

     a)   Admission of spectators to a designated football       match     will   only   be
          permitted if:

          -     the spectator produces a valid membership card for checking at the
                point of entry to the ground; and

                the ground   on   which   the   match   is   to be played is covered by
                licence

     b)   The Scheme will be a national one administered by a Football Membership
          Authority;  information about all members will be held on a central
          computer

     c)   A member will be entitled to only one card which will indicate the club
          which he, or she, supports and qualify him, or her, to attend any
          designated match

     d)   The Scheme will apply in England and Wales but consideration should            be
          given to its extension to Scotland and Northern Ireland

2.   MEMBERSHIP OF THE SCHEME
     — -------------- — — — —                                            (Chapter 2)

     a)   An application should involve:

          -    a standard application form
          -    proof of identity
          -    proof of address
          -    a photograph
                                                                         (paras 3-6)

          The football authorities disagree with the need for a photograph.

     b)   Membership cards should include:

          -    member's name
          -    photograph
          -    membership number
          -    date of expiry
          -    name of the club nominated
          -    member's national football allegiance
          -    they should be readable electronically and valid for two or three
               seasons only                                     ,      _ ,
                                                                (paras 7-13)
     The football authorities consider that membership should be           valid   for
     ten years.

c)   Exemptions from membership:

     -   no general exemptions for paying British spectators
     -   limited temporary membership for accompanied foreign nationals
     -   clubs to make special arrangements for guests, hospitality boxes and
         groups such as parties of school children, accompanied children in
         family enclosures and disabled people in designated areas with
         special access
     -   non-spectators should not be subject to the scheme
                                                             (paras 14-21)

d)   Criteria for withdrawing      or   withholding    membership   from    hooligans
     should include:

     -   mandatory criteria imposed by legislation linked to conviction for
         football-related offences, involving bans of two or five years
     -   discretionary criteria operated by the Football Membership Authority
         who will decide whether to impose bans and for how long
                                                             (paras 22-28)

     The football authorities consider that mandatory criteria should apply
     to convictions for all offences of violence against the person.

e)   Two new criminal offences should be created:

     -   false application for membership
     -   for gaining or attempting to gain entry to a ground without a valid
         membership card
                                                             (paras 29-30)

f)   The football authorities consider there is a need for the two further
     criminal offences indicated in the body of the report. There should be
     a requirement for a member of the Scheme to produce his/her membership
     card for inspection
                                                            (paras 31-32)

b)   The Scheme should not apply to matches between non-League teams
                                                                    jpfis.il
c)   Matches between League clubs and non-League clubs should be designated
     but the Scheme should allow initially for admission of non-members
                                                             (paras 4-6)

d)    The Scheme should      be monitored by a           small part-time inspectorate
      employed by and        responsible to the          FMA or another agency (or the
      Secretary of State)
                                                                        (para 14)

NOTIFICATION OF OFFEHCES
                                                                (Chapter 5)

In operating discretionary criteria to disqualify from membership those
whose behaviour is unacceptable, clubs will need to receive information from
the police about those who are being ejected from the ground, and about
those who are being arrested for an alleged criminal offence committed on
the club's premises
                                                                (par,j J I
For the mandatory criteria imposed by the legislation to work properly, the
FMA must receive information about convictions for football         related
offences. The Working Party recommends:

1.   the question of whether      an   offence   is   football related should be
     determined by the courts

2.   the Government should initiate discussions with the courts, the Crown
     Prosecution Service and the police to determine the most efficient
     means of notifying convictions to the FMA
                                                            (paras 5-12)

The Government should determine with the police and the football authorities
suitable arrangements for ensuring that troublemakers are not admitted to
the Scheme at the outset. An early Government announcement should make it
clear that past behaviour will be taken into account in deciding who shall
be disqualified from membership
                                                            (paras 13-16)

TECHNOLOGY AND TIMING
  ~“                                                         (Chapter 6)

a)   The Government representatives and the police are satisfied that the
     technology is available to implement the scheme. The main elements
     should be:

     (i)     a computerised central register
     (ii)    a computer at each club
     (ill)   card readers at turnstiles, to be portable if possible
                                                             (paras 1-11)

b)   Membership cards are to be readable electronically.   The       options,   on
     which the Working Party has not drawn conclusions, are:

     (i)     barcode cards
     (ii)    magnetic stripe cards
     (iii)   smart cards
                                                                (paras 12-17)

c)   The new technology may also provide opportunities for the clubs       to
      improve their own administrative procedures and for marketing
                                                             (paras 18-19)

     The football authorities are not committed to these views and the
     Working Party agreed that, until the consultants report and the views
     of the commercial advisers had been received, these must remain matters
     of judgement

Description of Options Available

We identified six major types of technology options which have the potential to
satisfy the basic requirements of the Scheme - (The features of each option are
shown in table Bl).

1.   Bar-coded cards

     These were offered by several of the organisations and usually were
     specified as being high quality laminated card with a photograph on the face
     of the card and a bar code on the rear.

     Base card

     For security purposes, the base card for this option would need to be
     produced as a high quality, "near — Banknote" level printed document. This
     could include:

     -    banknote quality paper (with water mark or often security features)
     -   special inks
     -   special Football League commissionedpattern    design
     -   lamination at high temperature tobond      the plastic with the fibres of
          the paper to stop the separation of the laminate by either manual
          methods or solvent injection

     Photograph

     A range of techniques for the inclusion of a photograph onto the card were
     promoted by companies. These ranged from:

     -   use of standard photograph
     -   laser engraving techniques
          photograph digitisation    (including   retention of digitised image for
          later visual matching by police etc)

     Bar-code

     For security reasons, a standard bar code will probably not   be   sufficient.
     The following ideas were received:

     -    incorporate multiple check sum algorithms into the standard bar code
          information when encoding
     -    obscure the bar code with an opaque stripe incorporated into the
          laminate which can be read only by an infra-red bar code reader. This
          will help prevent the unauthorised reading of the bar code or the
          photocopying of it for fraudulent use.

     A standard method for encoding the bar code number will be sufficient.

2.   Magnetic Stripe cards

     This was the commonest option offered by a number of the potential suppliers
     and conforms to the usual credit card standards. Similar options were
     available for the base card and photographs, as in the bar code option.
     A standard magnetic stripe can hold up to 1000 bits (up to 100 characters)
     of information in its high density form.  It is capable of being "protected"
     to eliminate the possibility of changing the number of an invalid card to a
     valid card and the use of encryption techniques on the number can also be
     employed. However, the technology does have the drawback that the encoded
     number does deteriorate overtime and with        use.   This would mean that
     regular replacement of the cards is necessary to avoid the increasing
     reading error rates which would occur if the cards were not replaced.

     The major users of these cards, banks, credit companies normally operate   on
     a two year life time for their cards.

3.   The Read/Write Magnetic Stripe Card

     This option was offered by one of the suppliers to overcome the problems of
     same—day, same ground reuse of the card (commonly known as "pass-back").

     This is a secure magnetic stripe card which consists of several tracks. One
     track can contain the permanent, secure membership number plus any other
     data which would be held on the card. A second track is then made available
     for reading and writing of data from the turnstile equipment at each
     presentation.   Such information could be gate number, date, match number
     etc.   The turnstile equipment would then be programmed to warn the
     authorities if a card was represented        at a turnstile   reader on that
     particular day or at the same match without the need       to reference the
     central file collecting the membership numbers       (see later). The usual
     process for apprehending the presenter could then be carried out.

     However, it was noted that the speed of production of these cards would be
     slower than bar code production but faster than the "smart card'      option
     which also has this ability.      It was also noted that the supply of these
     cards was linked to one manufacturer, Thorn EMI, who produce their cards
     under the trademark "water mark".

4.   Smart cards

     The "Smart card" option was proposed by two companies who produce their own
     type of card.

     The first system was based on an existing product which is heavily used in
     France and other European countries and is under trial  in this country.
     This card contains a microchip to which contact is made when the card is
     Inserted into the reader by contact pins.

5.   Contactless Smart cards

     The second system was based on a completely new product and is currently
     under trial at Loughborough University. This card also contains a microchip
     but in this case, connection for reading/writing is made without physical
     contact with the reading head. Also the card is usable in any orientation
     on the readers which can be mounted beneath a counter.       An example of
     packaging in the form of a key-fob rather than credit card was demonstrated.
     For Smart cards the microchip contained enough memory to store the basic
     data required    as well   as additional data to      reduce the    on-line
     communication to a club system during the critical time of turnstile
     validation (see Turnstile Operation). The storage capability of these cards
     obviously offers a wide range of additional features well beyond the basic
     bar code or magnetic stripe cards e.g. season ticket, car park access key,
     payment systems, group entry.

     The standard package can hold a photograph as before.

6.   Contactless Radio Frequency cards

     This option proposed by one consortium and is based on a high security card
     containing an electronic code number read by a proximity reading device.
     This code number is contained in a credit card package (slightly thicker) in
     a transponder    device.   This transponder is activated by a reading device
     situated up to 12 inches from the card. When the card is within range, the
     code number is read and does not need any internal power source. Reading
     devices can be mounted inside the turnstile (for further details see the
     Confidential Appendix).

     The standard package can hold a photograph as before    and   operates   as   the
     standard magnetic stripe or bar code card operates.

7.   Other Options

     Several other    options  were investigated some already in use as access
     control systems but arenot considered to be viable for the full scheme by
     their suppliers.




             }
Risk factors

In order to evaluate each of the technology options, we identified and scored a
number of risk areas which are shown in Table B2. These are based on the key
technical requirements and are summarised as follows:

1.   Referral list access

     This is the ability to access the referral list of membership numbers with
     an acceptable response time (less than 1 second). This referral list will
     contain all banned members, lost and stolen cards and any cancelled, deleted
     or withdrawn membership numbers. Its size will be directly proportional to
     the length of the membership period at which point a part of the membership
     number will change and the turnstile system software will recognise that
     generation of card     and reject all other numbers as invalid. The size of
     the referral list is estimated to increase at the rate of between 2—5% of
     total membership per year (and based on figures received from major credit
     card companies; 200,000 per year on 4 million membership)

2.   "Anti-pass back" Measures

     The system must be         capable of implementing effective anti 'pass-back
     measures to eliminate     the fraudulent multiple use of a card on the same  day
     at the same match.        The response time to implement these measures must not
     be affected.

3.   Adequate response times

     The response time to perform all the validations necessary (see 1 & 2) at
     the turnstile must     be maintained during the match entry       time   and
     particularly the critical peak time of entry to the ground (up to 30 minutes
     before to 10 minutes after kick-off time). This response time must be in
     line with the Safety of Sports Ground Act guideline of 750 per hour.

4.   Security

     The security   of   the    card to fraudulent copying or misuse e.g. photograph
     replacement.

5.   Pata collection

     The ability to collect and use data for purposes other than the main      access
     control requirement. Examples of these include:

     -    season ticket date
     -    match attendance
     -    ground attendance
     -    ticket control
           ticket allocation
     -    promotional events

6.   Communication problems

     Systems which require the cabling of grounds have a greater potential for
     problems than those systems which allow the turnstile equipment to operate
     in a stand-alone environment.
7.   Durability

     The durability of the access card and its ability to withstand wear and tear
     will be a major factor in the ability to maintain an acceptable ingress rate
     into grounds.

8.   Implementation

     The need to implement the system quickly on 92 league grounds has already
     been identified as an important requirement.  It is therefore vital that the
     technology option chosen is proven in similar environment to that in which
     it will need to operate.

9.   Flexibility

     Modularity of system construction will become an important factor in the
     ability to further enhance the basic system beyond access       control.
     Enhancements are likely to cover the areas of:

     -    ticketing
          commercial activity
     -    more efficient administration

10. Reliability

     The reliability of the system will be linked to the ability to ensure
     consistency of reading of the card and the ability to continue to provide a
     service (albeit degraded) in the event of failure of a component of the
     system.   One example of this would be the ability to replace a defective
     reading device without interrupting the service.

11. Multiple supply

     It will not be desirable to be put into a position where a technology is
     only supplied by one organisation. Also we have considered the possible use
     of the current equipment which some clubs are using and whether it would be
     possible to re-engineer them for the technology option.

          2. check previous card history (lost, stolen, destroyed etc)
          If any discrepancy identified, notify police authorities   of    the
          false application for possible criminal action

          3. Proceed as for new member to issue card but identify previous
             membership details
          4. Invalidate previous membership details indefinitely

Step 11   For application type

          -   Renewal

          1. Proceed as for replacement card

Step 12   Distribute member lists to nominated clubs at regular intervals

STAGE 2 - REFERRAL LIST

COURT/POLICE/CLUB

     Step 1    Undesirable identified:

               -   existing exclusion orders
               -   football related offence
               -   police notification of ejection
               -   club undesirable

     Step 2    Stolen/lost   card   notified     to   Football Membership Authority
                (probably via the clubs)

     Step 3    Removal of ban by appeals procedure etc to be notified to Football
               Membership Authority

     Step A    Football Membership Authority notified with:

               - membership number, if known
               - name and address
               - reason for notification

2.   CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION (FMA)

     Step 5    Notification of undesirable from official     body

     Step 6    Referred list update

               - identify member, if registered
               - if not registered, create "dummy" entry for use if the person
                 applies for membership
               - update member entry with banned period
               - distribute referral list to clubs at regular intervals

     Step 7    Notification of stolen/cost card

               - proceed with list update with indefinite      banned period    as    in
                   Step 6

     Step 8    Notification of removal of bans

                - proceed with referred list update with removal of ban as in
                  Step 6

     Step 9    Regularly check for time-lapsed bans

                - proceed with referred list update with removal of ban as in
                  Step 6

     Step 10    Distribute the referral list to clubs on a regular basis (at least
                12 hours before a qualifying match)

3.   CLUB

     Step 11    Receive the referral list from the Central System for use      at     the
                next match
MEMBERSHIP LIFE CYCLE

STAGE 3 - TURNSTILE ENTRY PROCEDURES

1.   SPECTATOR

     Step 1      Present card to turnstile      operator      with money, ticket, season
                  ticket, match voucher etc

     Step 2      Spectator arrives without     card   (lost    or   forgotten);   steward
                  informed to investigate

2.   TURNSTILE OPERATOR

     Step 3      Operator receives card from spectator with money, tickets etc
                  (some clubs wish to handle ground entry separately from taking
                  money, tickets)

     Step A      Operator organises the electronic reading of card

     Step 5      System performs card entry validation procedure:

                 -   card not on referral list
                 -   card not been presented previously    at thatmatch on   that day
                 -   membership current
                 -   entry at "wrong" turnstile

     Step 6      If card entry validation procedures are passed, then an indicator
                  ("green" light) passes the card and the spectator allowed to enter

     Step 7      The following error conditions can occur:

                 1. Card cannot be read:

                 - notify stewards to investigate
                 - spectator enters under escort or is refused entry and directed
                   to a central investigation point

                  2. Card used previously on that day at that match:

                 - notify police/stewards for action
                 - confiscate card; spectator allowed      to enterunder escort

              , 3. Card on referral list:

                  - notify police/stewards for action
                  - confiscate card; spectator allowed to enter under escort

                  4. Membership not current:

                  - notify stewards to investigate
                  - spectator allowed to enter under escort

                  5. Entry attempted at "wrong" turnstile

                  - spectator refused entry and directed to right turnstile
3.   STEWARD/POLICE

     Step 8    Notified by turnstile system or operator:

               - card cannot be read
               - steward interrogates club central system with membership number
                 to identify member; if successful, member allowed to enter or
                 remain in ground and entry is noted (need to get replacement
                 card)
               - card used previously or card on referral list
               - police/stewards to investigate circumstances and arrest or
                 eject, if appropriate
               - membership not current
               - steward interrogates club/central system with membership number
                 to identify member; discretionary entry could be allowed

     Step 9    Investigation of arrival without card:

               - steward interrogates club/central system for name and address
                 match (spectator to provide proof of identity and address) if
                 valid member, then discretionary entry could be allowed; if not
                 valid member, then entry is refused

4.   CLUB/CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION

     Step 10   Enquiring facilities to be available for membership investigation:

               - club system for their own members
               - central system for member of other clubs
STAGE 4 - ENQUIRY

1.   SPECTATOR

     Step 1      - enquiry facilities to be made available under         the   Data
                   Protection Act for personal enquiries.       This should only be
                   allowed on production of membership card or recognised proof of
                   identity. A search fee will be charged and facilities should be
                   available at clubs

2.   STEWARDS/POLICE/OFFICIAL BODIES

     Step 2      - official searches of the membership database will be allowed for
                   the following reasons:

                 - checking membership details
                 - unreadable cards
                 - checking referral list

3.   CLUB/CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION (IMA)

     Step 3      - facilities for membership register searches to be available at
                   all clubs.  It is likely that the club system will hold their
                   own membership register (copied from the central system on a
                   regular basis)

                 Search facilities to include search by:

                 - membership number
                 - member name
                 - member address
                                                                            APPENDIX D

FIKANCIAL MODEL

This appendix of the report describes an outline cost/benefit model we have
developed for the Scheme based on the various technology options:

1.   Basic assumptions

     Table D.l contains a list of the model parameters used            in   this    full
     financial model and is based on the following assumptions:

     Ground modifications

     It is likely that each ground will require some modification in terms of
     additional investigation areas near turnstiles, office      accommodation
     Changes, enquiry areas etc. We have assumed a cost based on the number of
     turnstiles at the ground.

     Extra Stewards

     Extra stewarding per match   will   be   required   to   handle   problem     cards,
     enquiries etc.

     Postage

     As an additional address validation check, the card, when ready, should be
     posted to the spectator's address.

     Stationery

     Application forms will need to be printed and be made available at many
     different points. The Post Office offered to carry stocks of forms at each
     of their sub and main offices.

     Key-ln

     The basic keying in of data will take a considerable time and we have based
     this cost on commercial rates obtained from professional keyboard operators
     support companies.

     Post Office/Club Handling

     This cost was based on the quotation received from the Post Office. We
     also carried out a costing exercise for a club handling the procedure with
     Its own staff which indicated that the estimated cost per form would be
     within the Post Office estimate. This is shown in Table D.2.

     Communication Costs

     Regular communication between the central system and each club will               be
     required for the distribution of the referral list and for enquiries.             An
     estimate of these costs per match per club ha£ been used.
Central System Link to Clubs

Modem links will need to be established between each club and    the   central
system.

Installation

A standard Installation cost has been assumed and Is based on a percentage
of the capital cost of the system at both club and the central system.

Central System

Based on knowledge of the types of system required and suppliers estimates,
we have estimated the cost of the central hardware and software.

Years

We have based the cost model on a 5 year cycle. This Is considered to be a
realistic life cycle for equipment of this type In regular use.   However,
there are two factors which may affect this period:

1.      the very intermittent use of the turnstile equipment (once a week   for
        a season for 2-3 hours) and

2.      the environment within which the system will need to operate

Replacement cards

This parameter coversthe percentage    of cards which will need      to be
replaced per   year.   This will cover the lost/stolen cards as well as the
damaged cards which will need replacing.     The experience of the major
credit card companies have provided useful guidance in trying to estimate
this area.

Referral file

A parameter to represent the number of members who will have a ban     imposed
on them by the Football Membership Authority.

Card changes

The maintenance of the membership list will need to be considered when
estimating the costs for the system.    These changes will not normally
result In any changes to the information held on the card but will require
updating of the membership register. Changes such as address, name, sex,
club allegiance etc. It is anticipated that it will be very difficult to
keep the register up-to-date and incentives to make the member remember to
change his/her address will be needed e.g. regular magazine etc.
Maintenance

The estimate of the maintenance cost for the system both at the centre and
the clubs has been based on standard supplier maintenance percentages of
capital costs.

Financing

This parameter is based on the standard rate for commercial borrowing. It
allows for 15Z interest charge on half the total capital costs and assumes
capital will be repaid over five years. A full cash flow model allowing
for all costs and revenue time phasing needs to be developed in due course
to estimate more accurately the finance charge. Also a full financial
analysis will need to be performed to evaluate the various options proposed
in Section 7.3 on funding.

Members multiplier

To arrive at a realistic figure for the likely membership numbers, we have
used a multiplication of the current average attendance as a guide.    This
has allowed us to vary the membership to assess the effect on the financial
model.

Number of turnstiles

The current turnstile count has been used as the basis   arid   10%   added   to
allow for ticket office requirements and spares.

System operations

There will be an annual system operation cost to run the central system.
We have allowed for a small number of staff.

Number of clubs

There is likely to be considerable variation in the size of system required
at each club.     In order to allow for this in the model we have estimated
the system size on the basis of the number of turnstiles and average
attendance.

Contingency

A value per club needs to be allowed for unforeseen costs.

Membership fee

The fee and length of time over which the membership if. valid will depend
upon the outcome of the legislation process and the commercial decisions.
Both of these will considerably affect the financial viability of the
Scheme.

Project management/advice

This parameter uses standard project management and professional advice
percentages of total cost to provide some guidance on the likely cost.

Average attendances

We   have based these parameters on last season's attendances.    They provide
the basis for the calculation of likely membership.
2.   Description of the Model

     a)   Cost Model

          From our discussions with potential suppliers of systems and services,
          we have been able to estimate average unit costs for the different
          types of technology. These are shown in the table below:

     Technology Options Unit Costs (£)

     Technology     Card Cost   Terminal at     Ground           Small      Large
     Options                    Turnstile       Communications   System     System



1.   Bar Code          0.50          600.00         7500.00      25000.00   50000.00
2.   Magnetic          0.50          500.00         7500.00      25000.00   50000.00
     Stripe
                       1.50          700.00         2000.00      20000.00   40000.00
3.   R/W Magnetic
     Stripe
                       4.00          400.00         2000.00      20000.00   40000.00
4.   Smartcard
5.   Contactless       4.00          200.00         7500.00      25000.00   50000.00
     Smartcard
                       2.75          534.00         7500.00      25000.00   50000.00
6.   Contactless



          Using these unit costs and the cost parameters described in Table Dl,
          a detailed cost model was built.

     b)   Benefit model

          In order to estimate the potential financial benefits which football
          may be able to take advantage of, we have concentrated on four areas.

          (i)       Membership fee

                    A range of options on the fee level and membership period can
                    be input to the model.  (Further work will be required to gauge
                    the most appropriate fee and period considering costs,
                    technical requirements and referral file size)

          (ii)      Reduction in police costs

                    We have assumed that these will increase in thefirst years   but
             '      there should be savings in subsequent years as the
                    troublemakers are excluded from football

           (iii)    Commercial benefits

                    This is likely to be directly proportional to the number of
                    members attracted to the Scheme and we have used £2 per member
                    over five years as an example in the model
(iv)   Gate receipt reduction

       An allowance for lost revenue in gate receipts due to the
       reduction in attendance by casuals- has been included. This
       model has taken a value of 20% for the first season and reduces
       that value by 5% each season
                                                                 Table D1

                                                                      Table D.2
Example of club carrying out application form/card administration

Assumptions     -   80,000 members
Members        -    40,000 forms    in June, July, August, first half (say in 10
                    weeks)
                     then 20,000 August, 2nd half and September (6 weeks)
                -    then 500/week for next 40 weeks ■ 20,000

Process time/member

                     review application form/check details
                -    verify acceptable member
                     handle payments
                -   key in data
                     produce card
                -   issue/post card

Time to handle say 10 minutes/card (not allowing for problem handling)
One clerk handle 6/hour
Assuming 8 hour day x 5 days/week ■ 240 cards/week (say 250) ■ 2,500 in
10 weeks
Peak close season load will require at least 16 clerks, probably more when
times for transferring documents, postage, peaks and troughs etc are allowed
for.

Costs                                                   Year 1 - Costs £

(assuming salary £500/month)

say 20 clerks for 3 months                                   30,000
  + 12 clerks for 2 months                                   12,000
  + 6 clerks for ongoing maintenance etc (7 months)          21,000


                                                             63,000


In addition there will be other costs such as:

       -   other employment costs
       -   supervision
       -   equipment costs
       -   space costs
           post/courier etc
       -   (higher staff salaries may be needed in some cases)

This compares to:

Introduction

This report presents the findings of our investigation into the effects of ID cards on queueing at
Football League grounds.

The objective of the study was to simulate queueing delays in a typical difficult situation that the
scheme would have to deal with. We chose a mid-week evening match, the Arsenal v Liverpool
Littlewoods Cup replay on 9th November, 1988. The final attendance at this match was a capacity
crowd of 54,029 with three to five thousand people locked outside.

We concentrated on people arriving at the Clock end of the ground. Data was provided by Arsenal
F.C. for this area serviced by a total of 17 turnstiles.

We analysed the following scenarios regarding people arriving at the ground:

■   what actually happened (people taking 6 seconds to proceed through a turnstile)

■   the effects of an extra one or two seconds added to turnstile time to allow for card reading
    time

■   the effects of an additional delay of 20 or 40 seconds for problem cards (banned, expired or
    unreadable), assumed to be 4 % of the total arrivals
Conclusions

Any delay caused by membership cards may increase queueing times substantially and many
people may not be admitted until well after the scheduled kick off time.

■   The maximum queueing time, which occurs about 15 minutes before the scheduled kick off,
    would increase by between 6 and 25 minutes (i.e. from 12 to between 18 and 37 minutes)

■   The extra time required to admit everyone would increase by between 16 and 48 minutes (i.e.
    from 11 to between 27 and 59 minutes)

The following table and graphs present the output for each of the turnstile times that were
modelled:

We cannot determine which of the above scenarios is most accurate until the procedures have been
decided and trials at matches have been carried out, but we believe the estimates above cover the
likely range of possibilities.

Appendix - Simulation Model

The model has been developed using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet package on an IBM personal
computer. The inputs are as follows:

■    number of arrivals per minute

■    number of turnstiles operating

■    normal turnstile time

■   percentage of problem cards

■   problem turnstile time

The findings in this report are based on the assumption that the same number of people would
attend a similar future game, arriving at the same time as they do now, regardless of
implementation of an ID card scheme, i.e. it ignores the possibility of lower attendances or earlier
arrivals.

We estimated the initial queue and the pattern of arrivals for each minute after the turnstiles
opened based on the available data, with a peak between 30 and 15 minutes before scheduled kick-
off. We assumed that the arrival rate is evenly spread between each of the 17 turnstiles modelled,
and that all of the turnstiles would be open when required.

We observed from the data that the turnstile time during the peak of arrivals was 6 seconds, i.e. 10
per minute per turnstile. This figure has been used as the "normal" turnstile time, with no delays
when proceeding into the ground. We have simulated turnstile times of 6, 7 and 8 seconds, with
additional different delays of 0,20 and 40 seconds for problem cards, as we do not know which type
of card will be used and hence the time to admit someone through a turnstile. We have not
allowed for any possible congestion (e.g. when questioning potential offenders or from major
computer delays over and above the one or two seconds)

Using the above inputs the model calculates the number of people arriving and served in each
minute and hence the number of people still queueing and the time spent queueing.
INTRODUCTION
                                    INTRODUCTION


In April 1987 Peat Marwiclc McLintock, on behalf of the Football League,
coaai.ssi.oned Market i Opinion Research International (MORI) to conduct a poll
among the football-minded public.        The objective of the study was to measure
the degree cf support for membership schemes governing admission to part or
all of league football grounds, and co indicate the lively impact of such
schemes on attendances.


It was decided to carry out the poll in three locations on 3 and 9 Xay 1987,
coinciding with the last league programme of the *986-87 season.         The
locations were designed to give a spread of geographical position, type of
club and supporter; the three, all of wheat hosted a league game on 9 May,
were:


        Nottingham        (Nottingham Forest vs.     Newcastle United)
        Huddersfield      (Huddersfield Town vs.    Miiiwali)
        Watford           (Watford vs. Tottenham Hotspur)


The defined target audience was men with at least some interest in football.
Within that, the sample was divided into two main categories:


         i)    "fans", defined as tnose who attend league football at least once
                       or twice a year


        ii)    "interested", defined as those who attend league football less
                             often, but watch on television


On the basis of other MORI survey data from late 1986, quotas were set to
ensure a representative sample of each category by age, social class and
location.     The "interested" sample was interviewed on 8 and 9 Hay; "fans" only
on aatch-day, 9 May.     A proportion of the "fans" sample was made up from
visiting supporters.     All interviews were carried out face-to-face by trained
interviewers of MORI Field and Tab.       A copy of the questionnaire is appended
to this report, as is a detailed profile of the sample.
The target number ox' interviews was 900, comprising 300 in each location.            In
face the target was exceeded, with 953 completed interviews as follows:


       Nottingham                   321               "Fans"                   *78

       Huddersfield                 313               "Interested"             475

       Watford                     Hi                                         ___

                                   953                                         953



Interpretation and Publication of Findings


Ail figures In this report are percentages, based on the full sample except
where otherwise stated.     Where percentages do not sum to 100, this is due to
rounding, multiple answers or to the exclusion of "don’t fcnow" categories.


It should be borne in mind       that the findings do not represent the views of the
general public as a whole.       The survey is based on a purposive sample      of male
"fans" and "interested", and is representative only of their views.


Because the study is based       on a sample rather than a census, the data are
subject to sampling tolerances.      The size of thesample and       of the percentage
under consideration^are the main factors determiningthe magnitude           of sampling
tolerances.   We may say with 95%confidence that       the "true" figures lie within
the following intervals    frcm our survey figures:


                                                   Level of finding
       Sample size                               101 or 90*      301 or 701     501
       1,000 (total sample)                           *2              *3        *3
         500 ("fans" or
                 "interested")                        *3              ^4        *4


Our standard terms and conditions apply to this, as to all studies that we
carry out.    However, we would like to point out that no press release or
publication of the findings of this survey shall be made without the advance
approval of Marieet & Opinion Research International (MORI).         Such approval
will be withheld only on the grounds of misrepresentation of the findings.
SUMMARY
                                 SUWARY


The concept of membership schemes has widespread appeal to the foctball-
minded public.   Almost two-thirds (65?) are in favour of such schemes.


The most important reason for favouring membership schemes is the belief
that they can reduce the hooligan element in crowds, and thus make
grounds more attractive for families.


The 29? who are not in favour of membership schemes believe that they
would deter the occasional or impulse supporter, and that schemes would
be "too much hassle".     There is also concern that away supporters would
be restricted, that hooliganism would not be controlled, and that
attendances would be reduced.


Football fans' attitudes suggest that attendances would r.ot be reduced by
membership schemes.     Just over a quarter (275) say such schemes would
make them personally more likely to attend games, twice the number (1 Ujj)
who say that membership schemes would make them iess likely to go.


Membership schemes would have most effect on the cver-35s (making 335
"more likely" to attend, 95 "less likely") and on family men (3^5 "more
likely").


Among young people and regular atter.ders at league games there is a
closer balance of cpinicn.    However, no group is overall less likely to
attend games as a result of membership schemes.


By a factor of two-to-one, it is thought that membership schemes would
attract more people to league football.

G4   Is' you probably know, it has bees suggested that football clubs introduce
     ■eabership schemes for admission to part or all of their ground for

1.       INTRODUCTION


1.1      Background


         On    13th May       1985,    the then Home Secretary,            the Bight Honourable Leon
Brittan,       appointed Mr      Justice        Popplewell     to undertake     an   Inquiry with      the

following terms of reference:


         "To inquire, with particular reference to the events at Bradford City
and Birmingham Football grounds on 11th May, into the operation ot the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975; and to recommend what if any further steps should
be    taken,    including any          that may be necessary under            additional powers,        to
improve both crowd safety and crowd control at sports grounds."


         The Popplewell reports, as they have become popularly known, engendered
debate on a wide variety of issues, one of them being membership schemes. The
idea    that     membership          schemes     could   be    used   to    combat   football      related
hooliganism,          though    not    newly     propounded     by    Popplewell,    was     given   fresh

impetus by his report.


         As     part    of his        Interim    report,   presented       in July   1985,    Mr   Justice
Popplewell made a number of recommendations aimed at preventing hooliganism at
football grounds.             One of these, in the section entitled 'Preventing hooligans

entering the ground' (6.48), stated:


           "I therefore recommend that urgent consideration be given by football
clubs in England and Wales to introducing a membership system so as to exclude

visiting spectators."


           In his final report, presented in January 1986 after a further period
 of reflection, including taking into account responses to his recommendation
 and also the lessons arising from the Heysel Stadium disaster (38 people dead,
 some 400 injured at the European Cup Final between Juventus and Liverpool in
 Brussels)       on    29th    May     1985,    Mr   Justice    Popplewell     modified      his   original

 standpoint somewhat as follows (4.126):
         "In my Interim Report             ....     I suggested that clubs could keep                 'away'
spectators away if they were so minded.                   I did not then recommend this as the
only scheme, nor do I do so now.                  It is to be hoped that a membership scheme
which    still    allows   casuals     to enter         the   ground will         be   the   first   step   in
trving to secure greater peace and harmony at a football match".


         He then concluded          (4.128):


          "I recommend that         consideration should continue to be given to some                       form

of membership scheme for Football League clubs in England and Wales."




          In   the   light     of   this     recommendation,          as   part    of    their    continuing
initiative       against   hooliganism,           and   following     consultation with           Government
Ministers, the Football League decided, in March 1987, "to commission a study
by     independent    consultants       to     report     on    the    scope,      costs,       benefits    and
disadvantages        of    a   reciprocal         membership      scheme      to       combat    hooliganism
embracing all 92 clubs."             Peat Marwick McLintock were selected to carry out

the study.


          This report is the end product of our work in undertaking the study.



 1.2      Terms of reference


          The Terms of Reference for the study were agreed at the meeting between
 Philip Carter and Andy             Williamson of the          Football League andJohn Calvert,
 Gordon Mousinho and Roger Hardacre                 of Peat Marwick McLintock at                 Goodison Park

 on 5th May, 1987 and were as follows:


                  to make recommendations on the scope of a reciprocal membership
                  scheme which has the specific objective of combating hooliganism,


                  to evaluate the order of costs for implementing and operating such ;

                  scheme, and


                  to identify the benefits and disadvantages, including those accruin

                  to the clubs, arising from such a scheme.
         In   looking   at    the    feasibility       of    schemes      some    constraints    were    to

apply.
         These were chat:


         -    schemes covering 100% of the ground would not beacceptable,
         -    schemes must cover all 92 league clubs, and
         -    schemes must cover all matches involving league                         clubs.


1.3      Conduct of the engagement


         Following      the    meeting     to    establish         the    Terms      of   Reference      the
engagement was carried out in three phases.


1.3.1    Fact Finding


         In   this   phase we       engaged     in   a programme         of   tact   finding    and    ideas
testing, which included:




               visits     to     20      selected       clubs      for        discussions      with     club
               representatives and police liaison officers,


               discussion with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO),


         -    collection of data from clubs responding to the                        Football League's
               letter of the 5th March, 1987, giving guidelines on the
               development and implementation of membership schemes to meet the
               50Z of home capacity requirement for season 1987/88,


               discussion       with     the     Sports      and    Recreation        Division    of     the
               Department of the Environment,

        -   discussion with the Professional Footballers’ Association,


            discussion    with       three    suppliers       of    computer       systems      offering

            controlled access to football grounds,


            analysis of results from a survey carried out by MORI on behalf of
            Peat Marwick McLintock on Saturday                     9th May,     1987,    to   ascertain
            public attitudes towards a reciprocal membership scheme, and


            reading and analysis of a wide variety of published literature on
             the topic of football hooliganism and measures to combat it.


        A full list of our sources is given as Appendix I.


1.3.2   Identification    of    cost,      benefits     and      disadvantages      of   a— reciprocal

        membership scheme


        From the facts and opinions collected during Phase I, we developed a
policy framework for reciprocal membership schemes in consultation with the
Football League, ACPO, Government representatives and two League clubs.                             This

involved:


             refinement        and   clarification          of     objectives      of    a    reciprocal

             membership scheme,


             identitication,         evaluation       and     comparison      of    different      scheme

             options in terms of benefits and disadvantages,


              examination of the role of the membership identifier, and


              development       of   the     policies    needed      to   implement       the    selected

              scheme.

        1.3.3    Reporting


                 In this report, following the Management Summary in Section 2, we have
        developed our arguments in a progressively selective manner.                       In Section 3, we
        have    concentrated on the nature and            extent of football related hooliganism
        and have    examined the major initiatives currently being taken to combat it.
        With this perspective, in Section 4 we focus on membership schemes in general,
        examining how the League has arrived at the requirement for membership of 50%
        of home capacity for season          1987/88.       We    examine   the validity of the major
        arguments    against membership schemes and develop our own arguments on their

        effectiveness.


                 In Section 5 we concentrate on the particular problems of reciprocity
        before     examining    several   reciprocal        scheme     options       and     presenting        our
        recommendations.       In Section 6 we develop the rules required tor the scheme
        before    examining    the   technology    issue.        Finally,   we    look at        the   costs   and
        benefits associated with the recommended scheme.


                 We presented our draft report on 15th July,                     1987.     Following further
        discussions    with    yourselves,    we    are     pleased    to   present        our    final   report
        detailing our findings and recommendations.                  Following a period of digestion
        by all interested parties we will make presentations as necessary to discuss

        our findings.

2.    MANAGEMENT SUMMARY


       In considering the feasibility of reciprocal membership as a means of
combating hooliganism associated with football, we have made our objective the
derivation of a system that will reduce, to zero eventually, the potential for
disturbances    at,    or    in     the   vicinity     of,   and   during     travel    to,     football

matches.


2.1    Conclusions


       Our principal findings are that:


               football related hooliganism has achieved                     social problem       status

               since the mid 1960's (section 3.1),


               there is no systematic and comprehensive measure of the nature and
               extent of the problem (section 3.3),


               hooliganism        is    generally under      control within         football     grounds

               (section 3.3),


       —       however, most people we interviewed felt that there was still a
               hooligan problem that needed resolution (section 3.3),


               the    average       first   division     club     attracts   a hard      core    type   of
               hooligan numbering around 200 (section 3.4),


               up to 50Z of a football crowd,                   consisting of under 35 year old
               males,       could      potentially    join   in    and   escalate      disturbances     if

               sufficiently incited (section 3.4),


               a wide range of anti-hooligan initiatives have been applied to the

               problem (section 3.5),


               nonetheless,         whilst    hooliganism may        currently be        under    control
               within grounds, the potential for trouble still exists

                (section 3.6),

                                                     - 6 -
the   cost   of    policing     football      is   causing     concern     amongst   the
police and government authorities,(section 3.7)


the   perceived     threat     of   hooliganism      is    a major   reason    why   the
public are staying away from League football (section 3.7),


the idea of membership schemes as a means of combating hooliganism
has been in existence for a number of years (section 4.1 - 4.4),


for season 1987-88 clubs have to attempt to designate 50% of home

capacity as membership areas (section 4.5),


the Luton Town        scheme    is a particular response             to a particular
problem      and    is   unlikely       to    have        an   effective     nationwide
application (section 4.6),


the view that membership schemes will combat hooliganism simply by
excluding the troublemakers is too simplistic (section 4.7),


any membership scheme which holds itself up to be                        the answer to
hooliganism' may well be the subject of concerted attack by the
hooligans and thus discredited at an early stage (section 4.7),


 reciprocal membership          schemes      can help to combat hooliganism by
being the central part of a long term strategy aimed at attracting
 well behaved spectators to the game and developing amongst members
 a sense of involvement with and investment in the club                         (section

 4.7),


 there    are     a number    of    arguments      against membership        schemes   in
 general which need to be overcome (section 4.8),


 clubs have no clear idea on the meaning of reciprocal membership

 (section 5.1),
              a reciprocal membership scheme must meet a number of objectives

              (section 5.3),


      —       two reciprocal membership scheme options stand out from a number

              considered (section 5.4),


      —       the    debate   over    the    requirement      for high             technology         has   often
              blurred the membership scheme issue (section 6.3),


      —       extensive computerisation             is not a prerequisite of a successful

              reciprocal membership scheme (section 6.3),


              public      reactions     to    the        concept       of    membership          schemes       are

              favourable (section 6.4),


      —       reciprocal      membership          schemes     will          have     to     be        'marketed
              effectively to the public to make them successful (section 6.4),

              and,


      —       the    police   and    trained       stewards    will         be     crucial       in    enforcing
              reciprocal membership schemes (section 6.5),


2.2   Recommendations


      Our principal recommendations are that:


               the concept of reciprocity be initially kept as simple as possible

               (section 5.1),


          •   the    longer   tens aim       of    the    League       should be          for    a    reciprocal
               membership      scheme       which    has     all       away      supporters           as    members

               (section 5.5),


               as    an   interim     step,       implement        a   partial        home,       partial      away
               membership scheme for season 1988-89 (section 5.5),




                                                    - 8 -
a general          framework for reciprocal membership             schemes    should be
drawn up (section 6 .1),


the        Football     League   be    proactive        in   leading,     directing     and
co-ordinating the introduction of reciprocal membership                           (section
6 . 1) ,


policies on the role of the membership identifier should be drawn
up (section 6 .2),


agreement          on   standardisation        of     membership        identifiers     and
controlled access            systems should take place as            soon as possible
(section 6.3),


partial reciprocal membership                 schemes    should be      in place by the
first Saturday of the 1988/89 season (section 6.4.2), and


all        clubs    should   train     and    equip     their   stewards     up    to   the
standards in the Popplewell Report (section 6.5.3).

3.     THE HOOLIGAN PROBLEM ASSOCIATED WITH LEAGUE FOOTBALL


       In       this   section     we   examine          the    history        and    extent    of   hooliganism
attaching       itself to football.              In doing so we have four objectives.                       These

are:


       —         to assess whether hooliganism is still a problem in football,


                 to define who we mean when we talk about 'hooligans',


       —         to examine the range of anti-hooligan initiatives in force at the
                 present as a general background to membership schemes, and


                 to outline the major issues arising from any continuing attachment

                 of hooligans to football.


3.1    The development of hooliganism associated with football


       Hooliganism associated                with        football has          been    so    frequently    in     the
public eye        during the past twenty years or so, that most people in the United
Kingdom are aware of its existence.                           That hooliganism             is neither new,        nor
peculiar to either football or British society, has been demonstrated by Mr
Justice     Popplewell       in Chapter          5     (5.1    - 5.19)    of his       Final     Report.     It    is
 important      that   this point       is       clearly grasped.              It is not       football    that is
 creating       hooligans.       They    already         exist    in     society       but     are   attracted     to
 football       because    it   offers       a    regular,       convenient          and    frequent     forum    for
 hooligans       to meet     and   engage         in    their    activities.           This     report    does    not
 address hooliganism per se, but hooliganism associated with football.                                          It is
 hooliganism in this context that we refer to in the rest of the report.


           As     John     Williams,         Eric        Dunning         and     Patrick        Murphy     of     the
 Sir Norman Chester Centre for Football Research at the University ot Leicester
 have shown ('The Rise of the English Soccer Hooligan', Youth and Society, Vol
 17, No. 4, June 1986), hooliganism has only achieved social problem status in

 England since the mid-1960’s.




                                                         - 10 -
        During the 1970’s hooliganism became more organised and less spontaneous
and   the   1980's    saw   the   emergence    of   named   hooligan    gangs     such       as    the
"Intercity Firm" at West Ham, the "Casuals" at Chelsea and the "Service Crew"
at Leeds.


3.2     What is hooliganism?


        Hooligan behaviour consists of committing one or more of a number of
criminal offences.      For a legal definition of these we can refer to the Public
Order Act of      1986 which reorganised the common law offences of riot,                         rout,
unlawful    assembly and affray.        The Act also forms part of the Government's
response    to    hooliganism     associated   with   football   as    it    includes    sections
specifically dealing with football related offences.


        Offences covered by the act may be summarised as:


                 fighting, throwing missiles,


                 threatening behaviour,


                 threatening, abusive and other provocative language or signs, and


        -        acts or language intended to stir up racial hatred.


        These are legally defined as football related offences                   if they occur
during any period relevant to a prescribed game, while travelling to or                       from a
game, and up to two hours before the start of a game and one hour afterwards.


        After taking into account         the legal definitions contained within the
Public Order Act of 1986, and the views given to us by clubs and police, we
regard hooliganism as behaviour which causes or leads to crowd disturbances
and   incidents associated with a football game, whether                    the behaviour         takes
place in or around a ground or away from              the ground,for example,           in    a city

centre or at a motorway service station.
3.3      The extent of hooliganism


         Mr Justice Popplewell stated in his Final Report                              (5.20), "One of the
problems confronting anyone enquiring into the problems of hooliganism is the
total lack of any reliable statistics."


         For a number of years the police have maintained figures of the number
of    arrests    during       the    season       at    particular      grounds.       Unfortunately    such
figures are not necessarily meaningful in that:


                they do not always distinguish between those arrested inside and
                those arrested outside the ground,


                 they    do    not       always        subdivide     offences      into   categories,      for
                example, violence, drunkenness or drug related,


                 the number         of    arrests may         not   indicate     the   extent    of violence
                because during crowd disturbances police may have                            to spend more
                 time defending themselves than arresting hooligans, and


                 policing policies vary around the country in relation to ejection

                 rather than arrest.


         Since     the    publication           of      the    Popplewell       report,    the    police    in
particular       have    sought          to   improve      the      collection     and    dissemination     of
statistics on the nature and extent of hooliganism in football.                                   However we
feel that there is, as yet, no systematic and comprehensive measure of the
nature and extent of hooliganism.


         The majority of club officials and police liaison officers we spoke to
agreed that, in the two years since the publication of the Popplewell report,
improved policing procedures involving greater inter-force liaison and the use
of close circuit TV, has lead to the greater control of hooliganism inside
football grounds.         However, as Popplewell noted (5.34):




                                                        - 12 -
       "A distinction needs to be made, however, between violence which occurs
inside the ground and violence which occurs outside the ground.                       There is a
good deal of evidence that as the art of controlling a crowd within the ground
increases and the physical constraints are improved, so the problem is simply

transported from inside to outside the ground."


       The majority of club officials and police liaison officers we spoke to
were in broad agreement with this view point.               Greater control of hooliganism
inside grounds has not removed the problem irom football.                 Despite the lack of
a systematic and comprehensive measure of hooliganism, it became clear in our
discussions that most people interviewed felt that there was still a hooligan

problem that needed resolution.


3.4    Who are the hooligans?


       Both     the   documents    referred     to   in   Section   3.1   and   the    police   in
discussions, have identified a hard core kind of hooligan, described in the
documents as "fighting crews" or "super hooligan groups", and referred to by
the police as "generals and troops".             These are small in numbers and police
and clubs generally estimate them to be up to 200 strong in an average first
division club.        They attend games with the specific objective of confronting
and fighting opposing spectators and the general objective of causing trouble.


        These    'super hooligan      groups'    have     a proportionately     greater    effect
 than their numbers suggest because of their ability and propensity to provoke
 disturbances amongst, and incite to riot, others in the crowd.                  In the opinion
 of the police, the people most likely to respond to provocation, incitement,
 or attack by aggressive reactions are groups of males under 35.                       Surveys of
 crowd profiles have shown that males under 35 form nearly 50Z of an average
 football crowd, therefore incitement of them to hooliganism can quickly turn
 into a full scale riot.          Although they are not part of the ’fighting crews',
 being normally well behaved and interested                in the game    they are attending,
 they possess the greatest potential for causing widespread crowd disturbances
 and from their ranks tend to emerge successive generations of                    'generals and

 troops'.
3.5      Anti-hooliganism initiatives


         Almost as soon as hooliganism associated with football began to develop
into a perceived social problem in the mid                  1960's,    suggestions       for dealing
with    the   problem began   to    be    put    forward,    ranging       from   the   abolition   of
football, to the reintroduction of National Service, to advocacy of draconian,
and, in many instances, medieval forms of punishment.


         The more logical initiatives have focused on dealing with hooliganism

in a number of distinct, but related ways.


3.5.1     Pre-match and en-route to and from the ground


         Measures used to prevent hooliganism in the build up to, and after, the

match include:


                liaison between the club and the police to discuss the strategy

                for the particular match,


         —      the appointment     for    each    club of    a police       liaison     officer    who
                organises   policing       arrangements       and     is     instrumental     in    the
                collection and distribution of intelligenceconcerning spectators,


                changing kick-off times, for example to midday,


          —     changing venues of matches, and


          —     close   escort,    to    and    front the   game*     of     away   spectators      from
                railway stations and designated coach parks.


 3.5.2    Inside the ground


          Measures used to prevent hooliganism inside the ground include:


                segregation of rival supporters,




                                                 - 14 -
                 erection of physical barriers to prevent pitch invasions,


                 use of 'sterile' areas, and


                  the virtual banning of sale of alcohol at matches.


    3.5.3    Preventing hooligans from entering the ground


             Measures   designed     to   prevent     hooligans         from    entering    the    ground

    include:


^            -    all-ticket matches,


                  search of spectators as they enter the ground,


                  exclusion orders.        These    are    a new sanction,           authorised by     the
                  1986 Public Order Act,          and in force from 1st August 1987, which
                  enables magistrates        to    issue   a banning         order   for   three   months
                  against     an   individual     convicted   of    designated        football     related

                  offences, and


                  Luton Town's 'home only' scheme, first operated in 1986/87, which
                  allows only registered Luton Town supporters and accredited guests

                  into the ground.
)
    3 .5.4   Identification of troublemakers


             Measures to help identify potential and actual troublemakers include:


                   the use of dosed-clrcuit           television,        funded by grants from the
                   Football    Trust,     which    acts    both    as    a     potential   deterrent    to
                   hooliganism and as a means of monitoring crowds,


                   the use of travelling stewards by the away club,


                   increased intelligence flow between police forces,



                                                   - 15
              the   use   of    travelling         'spotter'      plain     clothes    and   uniformed

             police, and


              the use, match after match, of the same police personnel as far as
              possible     in   order       that    they    may     build    up    extensive      'local
              knowledge' concerning hooligans.


3.5.5    The 'hearts and minds' approach


         Various schemes have been tried by football clubs, including:


              Leicester City's Members Plan, aimed initially at creating 'safe'
              areas within their Filbert Street ground, which also conferred on
              members     financial     and   spectating        advantages with        the    idea    that
              gradually more and more people would be attracted to the plan and
              the size of the safe areas could be extended,


              the "Football in the Community" programme, piloted by six Northern
              Clubs     with    the   aim     of    defusing      trouble     by   increasing        their
              spectators'        (and       particularly          their      younger      spectators')

              commitment to the club, and


         —    the approach adopted by a number of clubs of encouraging a good
              spectating        atmosphere         linked      strongly      to    increased         family

              attendance.


3.6      The success of the initiatives


         The effect of these initiatives               on hooliganism can only be assessed
qualitatively, because,          as   we    mentioned       above    (section      3.3)   there      is   no
consistent, league-wide measure of hooliganism.                     Each police force has its own
policy    of when to intervene,            and whether or not          to make      arrests    or     eject
unruly spectators.        Opinions also differ on the borderline between inoffensive
high spirited chanting and the offence of provocative or threatening language.
         Despite the lack of a consistent and meaningful measure,                           the general
belief amongst clubs and their police liaison officers is that the hooligan
problem is under control within the ground.                     Nevertheless disturbances can and
do    still    occur,   and    the potential         for confrontation between home           and    away
spectators still exists both within, and more particularly, outside grounds.


          As Mr Justice Popplewell observed when discussing the Birmingham City
riots (Interim Report, 6.15), "                        what is quite clear, and it emerges with
startling clarity from what happened at Birmingham,                         is that notwithstanding
all the precautions which are taken, which include preventing drink being sold
in the     ground,      policing      to and from the station,            the provision      of    special
trains and the segregation of spectators, trouble still continues."


          We believe that, two years on from Popplewell, trouble associated with
football matches can, and does still occur.                      A major reason for this, in our
opinion       is that    the majority of the anti-hooligan initiatives are aimed                        at
controlling, rather            than    eliminating       hooliganism   associated     with    football.
If, therefore, a control mechanism is faulty at any given time, the problem

may erupt.


3.7       Current issues


          The     1986/87      football       season    concluded    with    hooliganism      apparently
under control within football grounds.                    However, the debate on the problem was
as energetic as ever, and two issues were brought to our attention as causing
 concern.       These    are   the     cost    of   policing    football matches      and    the    public

 perception of hooliganism.


 3.7.1    The cost of policing football matches


           In 1984/85 the total charge for police attendance at all League matches
 was     £2,411,300      (£136     per    1000      spectators).     In     1985/86   the    charge    was
 £2,647,600 (£165 per 1000 spectators).                   In 1986/87 it was £3,062,039 (£176 per
 1000 spectators).            The clubs do not have to meet the charge                 in full as the

 Football Trust contribute 35Z of this cost.




                                                       - 17 -
          The charges are made to the home club for police attendance within the
ground only.       The cost of any additional police deployment in the vicinity of
the ground at or around the time of matches is borne from public funds.                                 The
Government estimates total (that is football related, inside and outside the
ground)      football     policing    costs    for    the      London    area    to   be   as    much    as
£8 million per season.          As an example of the clubs'                contribution, one club,
Chelsea,     estimate     that they pay between           5 and       7 percent of the true total
policing costs for each of their home games.


          The police themselves are concerned that policing of football is both
absorbing a disproportionate amount of their operational budget and is making
for   less    than optimum use        of   scarce    policing         resources.      Additionally,      we
understand     that      the Audit    Commission     is     currently      investigating        the   whole
question of costs of policing football.


3-7.2     Hooliganism and the public


          Hooliganism at football grounds             is still a prominent concsrn amongst
the British public.         This has been indicated by public opinion polls, the most
recent of which was a poll of 953 members of the public interested in
football, commissioned by us from MORI as part of this feasibility study and
conducted     on   the    8th and 9th May       1987.          The poll was      primarily about        the
public's attitudes to membership schemes and deliberately avoided any prompts
or references to hooliganism.              Nevertheless,         in an open question inviting a
discussion about why the interviewee held an opinion about membership schemes,
62Z of those in favour of membership schemes (which formed 65Z of the sample)
volunteered comments about            controlling     hooligans,         and    11Z of those against
membership      schemes      (which   formed    29Z       of    the    sample)     also    talked     about

controlling hooligans.


          The high proportion (44Z) of the total sample which voluntarily brought
up the issue of hooliganism at grounds, indicates that even by the end ot the
1986/87 season,          hooliganism is still towards             the forefront of the public's

perceptions about the game.
         This        was    also        indicated       by     an    earlier       MORI      poll        in    October         1986
commissioned         by     the    TODAY        newspaper.           In    contrast         to    the     May       1987      poll,
hooliganism was a topic for discussion prompted by the questionnaire.                                                    In this
poll,    in     answer       to     a     question       on        the     image      of     football,          68%      of     all
interviewees chose the response that there was "a lot of violence in grounds."
More significantly 54% of relevant interviewees said that they watched league
football less often than a few years ago, and of these 39% (by far the largest
single percentage) volunteered the reason that this was due to hooliganism.


         This is a noteworthy result because attendances at League games have
been falling steadily and significantly.                                 The Football Trust's figures show a
fall    in     attendance          of    52%     from    the        late     1950's.         In    the        1958/59      season
attendance       was       33.6     million.          Despite            occasional        reverses           throughout        the
period       since    then the trend has                 consistently been downward.                           Attendance        in
1986/87 was          17.4 million,             which     was       one     of   the    years       when       the    trend was
reversed, being 5.5% up on the previous,                                  1985/86,      season.          However,          1985/86
was the season following the 1985 incidents at Heysel, Bradford and Birmingham
when the public attitude towards football may have been at its most negative.
Therefore the reversal of the trend                            in        1986/87 may not be              significant.            It
does,    in fact,          represent a drop of 400,000 spectators                                 from season            1984/85.
Although       hooliganism          is     by    no    means        the     only      reason       for    the       decline      in
attendance       it    is a significant                 one.        Football clubs may be missing                          out on
large numbers of potential spectators as long as the general public continue

to associate hooliganism with football.


3.8          Summary


             In this section of the Report we have seen that, despite the lack of a
systematic       and       comprehensive measure                    of    the nature         and    extent          of   football
hooliganism,          all indicators are that, whilst disturbances inside the ground
are     currently          under    control,          the      potential         for       widespread          trouble        still
exists.        Furthermore, whilst the police and clubs estimate                                         that the average
first division club only has around 200 people associated with it who belong
in     the    'super       hooligan'        category,          a     large      proportion         of     the       crowd,       can
potentially participate in disturbances if incited.
4.       MEMBERSHIP SCHEMES


         In this section we examine the recent history of membership schemes as

a means of combating hooliganism in order to:


               examine     the        development        process       leading      to     the      League's
               requirement for 50% of home capacity to be devoted to membership

               schemes,


               establish ways in which we believe membership schemes can combat

               hooliganism, and


         —      examine arguments most often propounded against membership schemes

                in order to test their validity.


4.1       Background to membership schemes


          In his Interim Report, Mr Justice Popplewell recommended that football
clubs     in   England    and     Wales    give       urgent   consideration         to     introducing       a
membership system so as to exclude visiting spectators.                           As he observed in his
 Final    Report   (4.107);       "No     other       recommendation       has    given     rise     to    such

discussion or indeed criticism."


          In fact, the idea of membership cards, schemes or systems as a means of
 combating     hooliganism      by     means     of    controlling      access      to    the    ground      was
 propounded well before           Popplewell,         but was,     until    the    early     1980's       either
 generally ignored or opposed by the majority of League clubs,


 4.2      Football spectator violence


          Commenting      on    the    above    situation,       the    Official         Working    Group     on
 football spectator violence set up by the Department of the Environment, noted
 in 1984: "The idea of limiting admission to football grounds to supporters'
 club    members   has     been       discussed       before   and     rejected     on     the     grounds    of
 practicability, in particular that the delay in verifying membership cards at
 the     turnstiles    would      itself       lead    to   frustration      and     possibly       violence,

 especially if ticket holders were refused admission."
         Tne Official Working Group went on to state that advances in computer
technology     had     rendered       such    arguments        redundant         and     that,     following
resolution     of    cost   and   operational      issues,      a    membership         scheme     could    be

implemented:


         "The basic principle would be that access to football grounds would be
limited to members of a recognised supporters' club or a national supporters
club.      Enforcement        would     be   through      an     electronically           read      (at     the
turnstiles) membership card.             Membership would be withdrawn from anyone found
guilty of offences of violence associated with soccer:                           the 'readers' would be
programmed     not    to accept       lost   or withdrawn       cards      ...    Such    a    scheme     would
require a central national computer record system, with on-line terminals at
the grounds,        so that offenders from one club could not go to another and so
that casual supporters could be admitted ad hoc".


         It must be stressed that the above scenario has not been tested in a
live situation and that in our opinion it is by no means clear that such a
scheme      would     overcome        potential    and     practical           difficulties         such     as

verification delays at turnstiles.


4.3      The events of 1985


           Serious crowd trouble at Luton and Birmingham towards the end of the
 1984/85    season,     the    Heysel    Stadium    tragedy         of   May     1985    and     Popplewell's
 Interim Report of July 1985 brought membership schemes to the forefront of the
 Government's        anti-hooligan       strategy      during        the       summer     of     that     year.
 Initially,    the Government propounded a national membership                            system which        in
 order to exclude hooligans, would have to cover the whole ground.


 4.4       The Football Leaguefs position


           Such a radical departure was firmly resisted by the Football League.
 However,     the Management Committee            set up a Working Party                 to consider       their
 position on membership schemes.              The Working Party reported in September 1985.
 The report stated that the main objectives for a membership scheme were:




                                                  - 21 -
        "i)        to use cards to exclude those individuals whom football clubs did
                   not wish to admit to their ground, for example, those who had been
                   convicted      of    causing    violence        at,    or    on    the     way      to    or     from
                   matches;      those who offended          against      club       rules,     such as taking
                   part in racist or obscene chanting...; and those who infringed the
                   new alcohol legislation, and


        ii)        a    further, perhaps      equally       important,          objective            of membership
                   cards would be to encourage               the creation of a more friendly and
                   amenable environment at football grounds including,                                for example,
                   the    establishment       of   family    areas,       accommodation              set    aside    for
                   children and young people, possibly special sections for minority
                   groups such as disabled,             as well as areas              for other accredited

                   home supporters."


        Noting that in the preceding few years many clubs had sought to attract
more desirable          groups     of   spectators    by means           of    family areas,               supporters
membership         schemes and the like, the report stated that:


        "A particular benefit of schemes of this sort is that the club and its
supporters can be confident that in those areas of the ground where admission
is   controlled          by    membership,     the   likelihood          of    disorder         is    minimal.        If
offences do occur, membership is withdrawn and the individual banned from the

ground".


        The report duly took note of Mr Justice Popplewell's recommendation to
restrict admission to home supporters only, but concluded that "every attempt
should be made                to introduce    arrangements which will                 obviate         the need        for
banning away supporters from attending matches".                              The Working Party considered
how membership systems could help solve the away travel problem and stated

that:


          "The answer clearly lies in building on the success of the individual
club schemes, and extending the privileges which membership confers at home
matches       to       away    games.    To   achieve       this    will       require      a    high        degree     of

 compatibility between one club's scheme and another."



                                                     - 22 -
         The     report     outlined       basic    principles         which      would      be     common    to    all
schemes and recommended the concept of a 'Football League approved membership

Scheme'. The Working Party stated:


          "Clubs should be encouraged to provide reserved and safe accommodation
at their ground for away supporters who are members of approved schemes ....
We   envisage       that     in    due     course,        as    membership        schemes         gain    increasing
acceptance,         more    and     more        areas     in     football         grounds      become        reserved
enclosures, to which only 'home' members, or 'away' members are admitted."


          In the view of the Working Party such schemes would not cover the whole
ground,    though potentially troublesome matches could be                              'members only'.             Nor

was extensive computerisation thought necessary:


          "The      Working       Party    concludes           that   it    is    possible        to     establish    a
national       membership         card    scheme    for        Football     League     clubs       which     does   not
require     extremely         expensive         computer-based             electronic       equipment        at     each
ground,        or   which     totally       excludes           away   supporters          or      decent     football
spectators who are not members of schemes from the great majority of matches

which are expected to be trouble free."


          Finally, also in the conclusions:


          "We recommend that the Football League introduce regulations requiring
 clubs    to     establish        areas    of     their    grounds         for   the   use     of      members,     with
 normally      at   least     50 per       cent    of     the    ground's        capacity      reserved      for    this

 purpose."


 4.5      The present position


           Following          the         report,          the        Football         League            issued,      on
 30th September,           1985, guidelines to clubs in setting up membership schemes to
 achieve the 50% criteria.                 However, the guidelines stated that:




                                                          - 23 -
       "Itis      not    envisaged       that     clubs     should    automatically          attempt       to
designate membership areas specifically for away supporters                              although in the
fullness    of    time    it   might     be     possible    to     incorporate     into    the    scheme    a
reciprocal arrangement for visiting members".                        Crucially, no timetables were

laid down for implementation.


        The      guidelines       met    with     little    response        from   the    league    clubs.
However,    by    the    end of    the    1985/86    season the        general     climate    surrounding
hooliganism had changed to the extent that in a meeting between the League and
the Prime Minister on July 16th, 1986, the Prime Minister did not specifically
refer to membership schemes as part of the initiative against hooliganism, but
focused more on improved policing and closed circuit television.


        However, the issue of membership schemes was brought to the forefront
once    more during the summer of 1986 by Luton Town's decision to introduce a
100%    homemembership scheme for 1986/87, and other pre-season incidents such
as   trouble     on a cross-channel ferry.                The Government       indicated      through      the
Minister's Working Party on 5th August                      1986    that    they were      still pursuing
membership schemes vigorously. Consequently the Football League,                              in November
1986, reported to the Minister for Sport on progress made on various issues
concerning hooliganism raised since the end of the 1984/85 season.


           Both the League's Working Party and the Popplewell Report recognised
 that all clubs already operated various means of controlled or identifiable
 access which could form the basis of membership schemes, such as season ticket
 holders and family enclosures.                 In addition, the enclosed areas designated for
 visiting      spectators      are      controlled        enclosures       designed      specifically      for

 identifiable groups of spectators.


           The League      further stated that clubs had submitted                       to them detailed
 reports showing that 50.8% of average attendances (not capacity)                                fell within
 the category of controlled access.                 In conclusion, the League reaffirmed their

 opposition to 100% membership schemes:
         "The League do not feel that a comprehensive national scheme covering
all    spectators        is    either       a practical        or   suitable       solution.            This       view    is
supported by the Association of Chief Police Officers,                                   the F.A., the P.F.A.,
F.L.E.S.A. and the Football Supporters' Association.


         The Football Association concluded that                            'the nationwide identity card
scheme would do           little       to solve       the underlying problems manifested                            through
football       hooliganism        and       that    its   introduction          could well         have        a    serious
adverse effect on Association Football as a spectator sport.'


         Clubs have,            in conjunction with              their local police,                generally dealt
with    large crowds perfectly adequately.                          With       the additional burden                 that a
comprehensive scheme would impose, however, clubs could not be guaranteed to

do this.


          In     fact,        there    is    unanimous         concern     that       such    a    scheme          would   be

counter-productive and would worsen the problem.


          Of course,           even a comprehensive              scheme would not deal with problems
which    occur     outside        football          grounds.        It    is    abundantly         clear       that       many
troublemakers do not                  even enter or seek to enter grounds.                           It would          seem,
 therefore,      that whilst not              advocating such a scheme                  the only all-embracing
 system which       could        be used       to combat        all      torms of hooliganism would be                          a

 Government-backed national identity card.


           However,       the     League       restated        their     commitment      to       pressing         clubs    to

 build on existing membership schemes as follows:


           "We    propose        to    issue       new guidelines          to   clubs,       not   on    the basis          of
 membership       cards,        but    on     the    basis     of   achieving         controlled,          identifiable

 access.


           We propose, as a next step,                     to aim for 70Z attendances.                      Whilst this
 may    take     some     considerable             time   to    achieve,        the    experiments         referred          to
 earlier will provide valuable experience and may help accelerate the progress

 we are looking for.
       We    propose    that       members   of      the   sub-committee          of   the     Working      Party
referred to later should visit grounds with a view to furthering progress on

membership schemes."


       At    a further meeting          between        the    League      and    the Government            on    the
23rd February,      1987, an approach was agreed for season 1987/88.                                The agreed
action required was set out in a letter from the Football League to all 92
League Clubs dated 5th March, 1987 and is as follows:


       "i)    All clubs are asked to develop and                         introduce membership schemes
              for specific designated areas of their grounds by the beginning of
              the     1987/88 season.          These areas should be reserved for members
              only.      Non-members         would     not    be    admitted.          The    schemes       should
              cover at least 50% of each ground's capacity as determined by the
              conditions of the ground's safety certificate.                            Clubs which cannot
              attain 50% should identify the percentage they can meet.                                      Advice
              may be obtained from Andy Williamson re points of detail.


       ii)    Clubs who feel that they are unable                        to meet the requirements for
              50% Membership Schemes will be able                        to make representations to a
              Special Committee consisting of representatives                                from the League,
              The      Football        Trust        and      independent         advisors.           If,        after
               discussion,         it is agreed by the Special Committee,                          the club and
               the local Police that they are unable to meet the 50% requirement,
               then    the    Club will        be    expected       to    show    that       they    are    taking
               adequate      alternative measures.                 Should       this be      the    case,       their
               position will be accepted by the Government.                             If the Club is not
               able to convince the Conmittee, they may become liable to a charge
               under F.A. procedures for failing to implement the recommendations

               on Membership."


        Subsequently         the    target     for    membership         was    altered       to    50%    of    home

 spectators' capacity.
4.6      Other membership initiatives


         Luton Town's decision to introduce a 100% home members only scheme for
the    1986/87    season was one             club's    initial response            to their own particular
hooligan       problems        and   local     geography.        Whilst       it       is    recognised      by     the
Government,       the    police,       the    clubs     and    the     football        authorities      that       this
approach by no means offers a universal solution, media reporting of the Luton
scheme    and    the    conflict       between        the   club's     arrangements,           and    the    Football
League and Football Association Cup competition rules have tended to obscure
that recognition.          Banning of 'away' spectators and membership schemes appear
to be firmly,          albeit not          inextricably,       linked    in the public psyche.                 Recent
decisions       by Colchester United and Torquay to follow the Luton example                                         can

only serve to strengthen this link.


4.7       Membership and hooliganism


          At    first    sight membership             schemes    seem     to be        the perfect method             o£
combating        hooliganism.           Anyone    found        committing         an        offence   or     behaving
disagreeably        has        their       membership       withdrawn        to    exclude       them       from     the
membership area and that is an end to the trouble.                                 All that is required are
appropriate systems, probably electronic and computer based, to allow members

in and exclude non—members.                   The problem is solved.


          However,        as    David       Phillips,       Assistant        Chief      Constable       of    Greater
 Manchester Police and Senior Officer in ACPO explained to us:


           "Whoever thinks that the problem of football hooliganism can be solved
 by excluding a few hooligans, even if they are the ringleaders, is living in a
 dream world.           There are          two major problems.          Firstly few people realise how
 clever and organised the football hooligans really are.                                      More often than not
 the     ringleaders       are       not    directly        involved    in    the       violence      but     will    be
 directing operations from the seats.                         Sometimes they are not present at the
 match at all.           Secondly,          it is not just a few hooligans                     that represent         the
 potential problem. For example, at the Birmingham -vs- Leeds match there were
 literally thousands of spectators incited to a point where they were behaving
 like animals and displaying a frightening capacity for resorting to violence".
         That     today's hooligans have the willingness and ability to penetrate
any membership scheme has been well documented by Patrick Murphy, Eric Dunning
and John Williams in their work "House of Cards', the Development of Leicester
City's Members Plan",(pp 85 - 86).               In this,     they postulate how a gang of
hooligans     could arrange         to penetrate and/or discredit a scheme designed                 to
allow only members into a ground.               The police in their discussions with us
                                                                                 \
have continually stressed how organised the hooligan gangs are.                         It is clear
that    their     degree   of   organisation has    at     times   surprised    even    the   police

themselves.


         Thus any membership scheme designed to combat crowd disturbances solely
by     excluding        hooligans     and   subsequently    heralded     as     'the     answer     to
hooliganism' may well make the problem worse by:


                  presenting itself as a tempting target for hooligans to disrupt,

                  and


          -       antagonising well behaved spectators to the extent that they stay
                  away from games and thus increase the proportion of trouble makers
                  within a reduced football crowd.


          In our opinion, therefore, the more any membership scheme holds itself
out to be the general solution to hooliganism by dint of excluding hooligans,
the more likely it is to be a target for attack by the hooligans.                        Our belief
is strengthened by the complementary argument usually advanced that the only
membership scheme that can be offered as the general solution to hooliganism
is a total one covering 100Z of the ground.                Though not empirically tested, we
believe that at this stage of football's development, total membership schemes
may lead to more, rather than less, hooliganism.


          We are aware chat the Luton experiment is capable of being held up as
an     argument    against      our   theory.   However,    the    crucial    point    here   is   that
Luton's scheme is a particular response (a ban on all non-Luton supporters) to
a particular problem            (a very high risk of hooligan incidents at Kenilworth
Road) and which has been successful to date due to a wide number of factors,
not least being the town's geographical position, which has made policing and



                                                - 28 -
enforcement       of     the    scheme        relatively       straightforward.         Additionally,       we
suspect    (though it is impossible to prove)                    that the hooligan element amongst
supporters      of     rival    clubs    have       tended   to view Luton with         'tolerance'     as a
'one-off'.       If, however, the same element were 'banned' from all away matches,
their reaction may well be less benign.


          As    the    Sir Norman       Chester       Centre    for    Football     Research   states   (The
Luton Home Only Members Plan : Final Report, pp 90-92):


          "It    is     difficult       to      imagine      clubs     like    Arsenal,     Liverpool       and
Manchester United,             for example,         favouring    the sort of restricted membership
scheme which now operates at Luton.                     For one thing, the practicalities of such
a scheme at major clubs are open to doubt.                            Manchester United,       for example,
recently estimated that it would have to issue in excess of 100,000 cards to
cover the club's members pool.                   Liverpool claims 250*000 spectators attend at
least one game at Anfield each season... London clubs would almost certainly
argue, too, and with some justification, that a membership scheme like Luton's
could simply not operate                in a situation where grounds are so close                    to each
other and where spectators of different clubs are sometimes drawn from the

same areas.”


          How then, can membership schemes help to combat hooliganism?                               Central
to our argument is the contention that any such schemes will not focus solely
on   enforced exclusion of the hooligan.                       While the membership identifier would
clearly be used to try and exclude those individuals whom football clubs did
not wish to admit to their grounds, this could not be the main rationale for
the membership scheme.              Rather, membership schemes should, we recommend,                         be
viewed     as    part,     albeit       the    most    Important       part,   of   a   strategy    aimed    at

attracting well behaved spectators to the game.


           Thus the main objective of a membership scheme would be to facilitate
 the creation of a more             friendly and amenable atmosphere and environment at
 football grounds.             In order to do this, clubs must demonstrate that properly
 administered and developed schemes will provide members with real benefits.
 In doing so they must aim to increase members' sense of involvement with the
 club     and   therefore        reduce       the    potential    of    the    member     toward   disorderly
behaviour as well to increase his interest and investment in subduing the same
sort of behaviour when it manifests itself in others.


         Nor   should      the membership       scheme     be    aimed   solely     at       family   groups,
older     spectators or         'missing'   spectators.          If the scheme       is to work to its
tullest potential,         it must also be          'sold'       to as large a proportion of the
under 35 males in the crowd as possible in order that the total environment of

the match is improved.


          It is in this positive way              that a         membership    scheme can be made           to
work.     However, in our view, it is unlikely to do this on its own.                          Attracting
spectators is harder than excluding spectators.                      Therefore a membership scheme
must be part of a package of measures, designed to attract, develop and retain
well behaved spectators because the most satisfactory, effective and lasting
measure    against      crowd    disturbances       is,    as,    for    example,    Watford      F.C.   will
testify, a willing crowd and consequently a good crowd atmosphere.


          It must be       stressed      that   this   is a long         term measure.         Watford   took
something approaching ten years to turn their games from ones played in what
they describe      as      a   "tense    atmosphere"       to ones       played     in   a    "friendly but

competitive atmosphere".


          A startling illustration of the kind of atmosphere at a game that may
well turn the fortunes of football around is described in an article published

in "The Independent" on 30th May 1987:


          "Theother side of the coin,                  though, sends the spirits soaring.                 Ten
          days    ago, Dundee United            lost   the UEFA Cup final           to IFK Goteburg on
          their      own       ground.      Their         supporters       paused        to     absorb      the
          disappointment,         then raised their hands to salute the Swedes; I swear
          there was hardly an exception in more than 20,000".


          We recommend that the creation of that kind of atmosphere be no longer
 left to chance.         The alternative, of adopting a 'do nothing' approach would,
 inour    opinion,result        in   a   continuing       decline         in   attendances        against       a
 backdrop of ever increasing policing costs in order to control hooliganism.



                                                   - 30 -
           We are of the opinion that a membership scheme would be a constructive,
    positive       and,    above   all,   significant     component   of   an   overall   strategy   to
    ensure that the right kind of spectator attends home and away games.


           This strategy could consist of many components, including:


                     the     'Football    in the Community’ programme being          run as a pilot

                     scheme in the North West of England,


                      links with local schools,


            -        'meet the players' events,


                      organising non-football events for the community such as parades,

                      outdoor parties,


            -        sponsoring local initiatives, and


            -         open days.


            It is not the purpose of this report to go into these in detail, but we
    wish   to show how a membership              scheme   can be complemented by other          actions
    designed       to promote      the    club   in particular and football        in general   in the

     local community.

     4.8       Arguments against membership schemes


               Any membership scheme has to overcome a number of arguments against its
     implementation. The most persistent of these are that:


               —      membership is not part of the football tradition,


               -      membership will deter casual support,


                          clubs' finances will be hit by membership schemes,




                                                      - 31 -
              police will override membership to prevent 'lock outs', and


              membership will delay entry at turnstiles.


        These are discussed in more detail below.


4.8.1   Membership is not part of the football tradition


        Apart    from season ticket holders,       football has   traditionally been a
game based on informal or unplanned attendance.             The majority of spectators
arrive at the turnstile, pay cash and are let in.             Although a spectator may
well have allegiance to the team it is not a formal one, nor does it imply

regular and frequent attendance.


        A membership scheme implies a different kind of relationship, both for
the club and the spectator.       Therefore an education process will be needed for

both participants to make membership work.


        To help both participants come to terms with a membership scheme,             it
should build on those schemes already run by the club which are effectively
membership,     although not    recognised   as   such,   and are part of the   football

tradition.      Such schemes are:


                season tickets,


                specialist spectator clubs, (for example, juniors)


         -      supporters' clubs, and


         -      travel clubs.


         In addition, we see the introduction of membership for 50% of ground
 home capacity as a valuable step in the process of educating spectators, who
 would not normally fall into any of the above categories,            in the concept of

 membership.

4.8.2   Membership schemes will deter casual support


          Possibly the greatest fear that clubs have regarding membership schemes
is that they will discriminate against 'casual spectators'.


          Virtually every club we spoke to estimated that between 30-60% of their
average       home    gate was made       up of       the   'casual    spectator',        that    is one who
attended       infrequently,        maybe only once or less,               a season,      on average.       For
example, Liverpool told us that over 50% of their support comes from locations
over 40 miles             from the city and       that up       to 250,000 different people visit
Anfield       every       season.     Wrexham     estimated         that    they    had    a     hardcore    of
approximately fifteen hundred supporters and that 35-40% of their home gate
represented casual support.


          We recognise the very real fear that clubs have over the effects of the
loss of casual support.               "After all, we're a business and membership schemes
are one more barrier to our potential customers", was a popular argument.


          However it is important to note that :


          -      unless the membership scheme proposed is a 100% one, there will be
                     areas of the ground to which the casual spectator can go,


                     casual     spectators     should,      if accompanying        a member,       be    allowed

                     into the members' area, and


          -          in   the   longer   term we       feel    that    successful      implementations        of
                     membership     schemes     has      the    potential     to    increase       supporters'
                     commitment     to   the   club    such     that   any revenue        lost    from    casual
                     support     could    effectively          be   recouped       through       the    benefits
                     accruing to the club from the scheme.
4.8,3    Clubs' finances will be hit by membership schemes


         Membership schemes may well require a large initial investment for such
as   ground    modifications,        promotion,       stationery    and     computerisation.         Many
clubs may      therefore not be able to afford                the set up and running costs of

effective schemes.


         In order to counter this argument,                   it is necessary for any proposed
scheme    to begin with           the 'lowestcommon      denominator';       that    is   it   can      be
afforded with only reasonable outlay.                  We recognise that the most significant
investment is likely to be in the area of ground modifications.                           Therefore any
scheme proposed would have to strive to keep these to an acceptable minimum
level.       Additionally membership         schemes     in    themselves    can be       reasonably be
expected to generate additional income by such measures as:


                entrance fee,


         -      sponsorship,


                advertising, and


                    encouraging higher expenditure on club products such as souvenirs.


         Membership        schemes should         also   alleviate        clubs'    running     costs   by
reducing the need for a heavy police presence in the long term.                            As discussed
 above    (section 3.7),          the prospect        of being    charged more       realistically for
 policing      is    at   least    as much   of   a      threat    to   a   club's    finances       as the

 implementation costs of a membership scheme.


 4.8.4    Police will override membership schemes


          In discussions with the police the following points were consistently

 made regarding membership:

                                                                                                                      this


                      subject to a degree of control, rather than have them 'roaming the

                                                   of being able to fill up compounds in sequence.


1 3             In such cases the police may override the restrictions on access for
      members for the sake of public order.                       For two clubs visited, Leicester City
      and Newcastle United,             this is a tactic the police will not use.                              They have
      found   that     in    the    long      run   it   is    better     to   honour       a membership           scheme's

            Additionally, it is likely that as the public become educated in some
of    the    difficulties      of   membership     schemes     their   attendance   patterns    will

change.


4.9         Summary


            In   this   section,    we    have   seen   that    membership   scheines   have    been
proposed as a possible solution to the hooligan problem for a number of years.
However, during this time, a major weakness of membership schemes is that they
have become associated with the concept of exclusion of the troublemaker and
therefore        with   100Z   of   the   ground   being     subject   to membership.     We     have
recommended       the development of a different emphasis for membership schemes.
The most effective way for a membership scheme to combat hooliganism,                          is for
it to attract so many well behaved members into its fold that hooligans find
little scope for their activites.
5.       RECIPROCAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEMES

         In the letter to clubs, dated 5th March,                         1987, referred to earlier in
this report, the Football League stated that they would "commission a study by
independent        consultants            to      report        on        the         scope,         costs         and
benefits/disadvantages         of    a    reciprocal         membership         scheme    embracing          all    92

League Clubs."


          Reciprocal membership           means       that    spectators        who     are    members       of     the
visiting club will enjoy similar club benefits at away matches as at their
home    club.     Membership    for       away    spectators         is proposed         on    the    basis        that
whilst it is not away spectators who necessarily cause trouble at matches, it
is     their    anticipated    or    actual       presence         that    creates       the    potential           for

trouble.


          In this section, we examine reciprocal membership schemes in order to
assess whether       they can overcome             this problem.           We    then set objectives                for
reciprocal       membership     schemes          in   the     light       of    this     examination          before
examining schemes that come nearest to meeting these objectives.                                      Finally, we

select our preferred option.


 5,1      Perceptions of reciprocal membership schemes


          When    introducing       the    element      of    reciprocity,         we    have    found        in    our
 discussions      that   the   clubs*          perception     of     reciprocal        membership        currently

 involves scenarios of either:


                  100Z of ground capacity being covered by membership,


           -      nationwide identity card schemes,


           -      the necessity for extensive and complex computer based systems,



           or some combination of the three.
         We take a simpler view of reciprocity.              As its most basic level, any
reciprocal      membership    scheme must    allow      a supporter ot     Club     A,   who    is    an
accredited member of an approved membership scheme run by that club,                            to be
admitted to a membership area at Club B, space permitting, when Club A are

playing away at Club B.


          All other variations on reciprocal membership                 follow from this basic

level.     Such variations might include:


                admittance to matches not involving Club A,


                nationwide schemes,


          -     computerisation,


          -     segregation and desegregation, and


          -      percentage of grounds to be covered by schemes and others.


          However, before examining these variations we must be clear as to what

a reciprocal membership scheme is expected to do.


5.2       Reciprocal membership and away spectators


          The    police,      the   clubs   and   Leicester University        sociologists           have
 highlighted the fact that it is not necessarily the away spectators who cause
 trouble, but rather it is their anticipated or actual presence that creates
 the     potential   for     trouble.   Police    and    club tactics    so   far    have      been     to
 segregate spectators in the ground,              create   ’sterile’ (empty)        stands between
 the     away and home       spectator areas and escort visiting spectators to or from
 the     grounds as faras is practicable.          The objectives are to prevent               home and
 away spectators from meeting and inciting each other by their proximity into

 fighting or other disturbances.
        These        solutions have     achieved a degree of success                    to date.      However
they are combative solutions which contain trouble but do nothing to attempt
to remove its potential.             Hooligans are still present amongst the spectators,
probing for weaknesses amongst the police and the clubs' defences.


        A graphic demonstration of how even an apparently properly segregated
crowd, bounded by sterile areas, can incite themselves into a riot is provided
by the police video of the Birmingham City -v- Leeds United game.                                     At     this
game hooligans within the Leeds                    spectators were able to incite most of the
Leeds crowd into fighting which in turn gave impetus to the Birmingham City
hooligans       to    create    their   own    disturbances.             Eventually     the      police    found

themselves handling riots at both ends of the ground.


          Responses      to    the   potential          trouble    caused   by   the     presence     of     away
spectators have included banning away spectators as discussed in Section 4.6
above and, in a solution unique to Leeds United, making away attendance ticket

only.


          These solutions are based round the premise of combating hooliganism by
excluding hooligans. However as we discussed in Section 4.7, we believe                                       the
most    effective       and    lasting way         to    combat    hooliganism     is    to      encourage    the
attendance of well behaved spectators.                        If the contingent          of home and away
spectators       is    overwhelmingly     made          up   of   well   behaved    spectators        then    the
potential for trouble at their meeting zones will be reduced.


          Therefore a membership scheme must cover both home and away spectators
 to encourage well behaved spectators to attend both home and away games.                                           A
 reciprocal      membership      scheme       is    a    logical    extension      of   a    home   membership
 scheme    in    that    it will     allow     the       control    of    both   sets       of   spectators     at
 football games, without 'punishing' by exclusion a visiting club's spectators.


 5.3      Objectives of reciprocal membership schemes


          From our discussions with the club and police, we recommend that any
 membership scheme is designed with the following objectives.
             to run within or alongside other initiatives to promote the club
              in the community,


      -       to improve the disciplinary methods available to the club and the
              police by creating a new sanction suitable for dealing with that
              level of offensive behaviour judged to be below that which comes
              under the scope of the Public Order Act 1986,


              to provide enough benefits to attract all types of spectators such
              that the profile of a typical football crowd is gradually changed,


              to increase spectators' commitment to the club,


              to reduce the role, and therefore costs, of the police in the long
              term   by   introducing   a    club-based         means   of     controlling      and

              filtering its spectators,


      —       to improve    the   general   image    of   football      in the community        and
              demonstrate   that    football   clubs      are    taking      the   initiative    in

              overcoming problems, and


              to exclude known hooligans and their replacements from the ground.


5.4   Consideration of scheme options


       In this part of our work we considered a number of membership schemes.
Brief descriptions of them and their related advantages and disadvantages are

given in Appendix 2.


          In our opinion,   two schemes currently stand out as worthy of further

investigation in that they:


              build on the 50Z of home membership scheme being introduced for

               season 1987/88,




                                            - 40 -
               provide a measure of control over both home and away spectators,


               are flexible enough to cover the preferences of most spectators,


               can   be   modified      in   an    evolutionary     process     as    the   clubs   gain
               experience of operating reciprocal schemes,


               are suitable to start a voluntary education process both for clubs
               and spectators      into the operation and requirements of membership
               schemes,


               enable     the   clubs    and      spectators   to   form   a   closer more         stable
               relationship which in the long term should benefit both, and


               share the responsibility for membership between both home and away
               clubs.


        They both share the disadvantages of:


               creating a greater potential               for lock outs of non-members where
               there is still capacity left in the membership areas, and


               increasing the number of categories of spectators to control and
               filter.


        These two schemes are briefly described below.


5.4.1   IQOZ Away, partial home membership


        This    scheme     requires      all      away   spectators   to   be    members      of    their
football clubs' home schemes, thereby taking into account the existence of the
home membership scheme as required by the Football League.                           It is illustrated
in Diagram I on page 45.


        The scheme has advantages of:


        -      requiring minimum ground modifications as existing visitors' areas
               become entirely membership, and
                giving the visiting club maximum supervision over its own

                supporters.


          It has one serious disadvantage,                  in that it encourages visiting non
members to infiltrate home non-member's areas.                       However, this can occur at the
moment    if   away     spectators     decide       that     they    want     to    infiltrate             the   home
''territories''.        The    difference      is    that    at     present        they    can        be   actively
encouraged to congregate in the visitors' area.                           Furthermore, the police have
the relatively mild sanction of ejecting them from the home areas it they do
infiltrate     leaving them to move            into     the away area.              With       this    scheme     the
police would have           to eject      'away'     non-members          from the        ground       altogether,
leaving them outside.


          We   recognise       that   this    is    a difficult       problem,          because       we    are not
suggesting that away non-members be allowed into the home non-members area.
This would clearly be unacceptable as it leads to the creation of                                          'hooligan
pens'    or    'no     go   areas.'     For    this     scheme       to    provide        maximum          benefits,
effective policing and steward:.ng would be vital in order to recognise and
exclude ’away' non-members for the home 'casual* areas and to prevent those so
excluded from causing trouble.


5.4.2     Partial away, partial home


          This scheme allows away spectators to be either members or non—members
and     also   takes    into    account      existing       home    schemes.       It     is    illustrated        in

Diagram 2 on page 46.


          The group would be divided into four main areas,                                away members,          away
non-members, home members and home non—members.


          The scheme has the advantages of:


          —     providing the club and the spectators with flexibility over the

                 division of the ground,


                 permitting modification as operational experience requires,



                                                    - 42 -
              enabling a visiting club               some measure          of control over             its away

              spectators, and


              allowing     complete        freedom    of    choice        for       the    spectators    as    to
              whether or not they want to attend games as members.


        It has two potential disadvantages in that the police arid club stewards
would now have      to control     four categories of spectators and,                           in comparison
with   the   scheme    described      in    section        5.4.1,    has        a    lower     capability       of
controlling    hooligan     behaviour       by     means    of    club-based              sanctions,    in    that
banned members from both clubs simply go into the non—members areas.


5.5     Selected options


        The 100% away scheme is our long term recommendation.


        This is because:


              it is aimed at controlling a discrete and identifiable section of
              the crowd,     that     is, all away fans.                  In our opinion if all away
              fans are subject to membership the potential                                 for hooliganism is

              reduced,


               it reduces the area of the ground requiring extensive policing.
               Practical experience of membership schemes currently in operation
               indicate    that    in      those    areas    of     the    ground where          admission      is
               controlled by membership, the likelihood of disorder is reduced,


         -     it does most towards discouraging non-members from travelling, if

               effectively enforced, and


               it     enhances   and makes more            attractive           existing home membership
               schemes because in order to travel away, the spectator must be a

               member of the home club.


         However, we recognise          that implementing the                   100% away        scheme may be
 difficult for clubs, police and spectators as the next step.                                 This is because:
                there is little opportunity to educate the public in the concept
                of 100% away membership, and


                the police may face operational difficulties if, as a result of
                the     lack    of   education,        or    because      of    a   concerted    effort     by
                hooligans and other non-members,                    the     introduction of     the scheme
                creates        several     lock-outs         of     large       numbers   of     travelling

                spectators.


         Therefore, we recommend that the partial away scheme be introduced in
season        1988/89   as     a means    of    further       educating spectators, clubs          and     the
police    into the concept of 100% away membership, with a view to                              introducing
this at an appropriate later date, probably season                          1898/90.


         In    preparation       for     League   wide       100%     away       membership     schemes,    we
recommend that a series of pilot schemes should be run during 1988/89.                                   These
could take the form of selected matches, selected clubs, selected geographic
areas, and would need to be planned and carried out with the full approval of
the police.       This approach has had approval in principle from the Association

of Chief Police Officers.


5.6      Summary


         Our major        conclusion       in   this    section      is     that    reciprocal membership
schemes can be effective in combating hooliganism, provided they meet specific
objectives.       There are two schemes that can meet                          these objectives and have
clear Advantages for football clubs.                        One scheme, the 100% away membership,
has the greater long term potential for combating hooliganism, but may well be
too difficult to implement as the next step.                           We recommend that the partial
home, partial away scheme should be adopted for season 1988/87.

6.      DEVELOPING THE SCHEME RULES

        Discussions thus far on membership schemes demonstrate that there are
potentially as many permutations and combinations possible as there are clubs.
When   these are added to the variations                  in suitable     technology,       the logical
conclusion is that there is a risk,                 perhaps a certainty,           that without        some
central direction 92 unique              and possibly        incompatible    schemes will develop
which would militate against effective reciprocity.


          In   order    to   prevent       this    happening,      we     recommend      strongly       the
development     of     specific     policies      and    a   general    tramework     for      reciprocal
schemes in order to allow clubs flexibility whilst avoiding anarchy.                              In this
section, we outline those policies which, in our opinion, will facilitate the
orderly    development       of    reciprocal      membership      schemes    so    as    to    gain    the
widespread approval of the League,                the clubs, the police, the Government and

perhaps most importantly, the football supporter.


6.1       General policies for reciprocal membership schemes


          In our opinion,         these policies should form the general framework for

 the initial development of reciprocal membership schemes:


                there should be one membership scheme per club to cover both home

                and away attendance,


                standard     core      rules   for membership      should be       set regarding         the
                definition        of    offences,       disciplinary      actions,       withdrawal       of
                membership and the transmission of related personal information,


                clubs will own, promote, administer and enforce their own schemes,


           -    multiple membership should be allowed,


                withdrawal of membership                from one   club   for disciplinary         reasons

                 automatically withdraws membership of other clubs,
                membership will not guarantee admission to home or away                            games,


                the Football League        should act          in a supervision,            direction       and
                co-ordination role in order to ensure club compliance,


                membership areas should be made more attractive for spectators
                than non-membership areas,         either by price,               enhancedfacilities,
                other benefits or a combination of these,


                the segregation of        home    and     away       spectators should still apply
                except under close supervision for example in family areas,


                police    and    clubs must   accept      the       general     requirement         not     to
                override membership restrictions when dealing withlockout                                 of non
                members when capacity is left in the members'                     area,


                membership      should only be    granted           after   adequate        identitication

                has been furnished,


         —      group    membership should       not      be         allowed     to    companies,           tour
                operators or other organisations,


         -      members should be allowed guests,


                members    should    be   held   responsible          for   the behaviour            of    their

                 guests, and


                 reciprocal      membership      should        be    presented        as    the    means         of
                 attracting well behaved spectators to the game and not heralded
                 as the solution to hooliganism.


         These policies will need to apply to every league club.                                  In order to
ensure       this, the    Football   League will        need        to extend    its       current    role       in
promoting membership schemes by acting as a national co-ordinator providing
leadership and direction to the clubs and developing schemes in conjunction




                                                 - 48 -
with the clubs.         It is likely that this role will become a permanent one in
order to ensure that clubs are following the general framework in developing
and administering reciprocal membership schemes.


6.2       The role of the membership identifiers


          A member needs an identifier, in order that the club and its agents can
distinguish members from non-members.                  The physical form of the identifier is
secondary in importance to its role.                   The identifier would primarily be used

to:


          -     purchase tickets,


          -     gain admission,


          -     identify holder      in case of        a disturbance,and


                identify holder for analysis of attendance patterns, if

                technology were involved.


          The   identifier    must       be   convenient,    easily    checkable,   renewable    and

linked to the holder.


6.2.1     Policies for membership identifiers


          We recommend that the policies below for membership identifiers should
be developed to ensure the clubs' membership systems are compatible with each

 other:


          —     there    should     be   a    common    format   for   the membership   identifier
                 containing    at    least      a   photograph    of   the legitimate   holder   and

                 membership logo.


                 identifiers used with high technology systems should be capable of
                 being used at clubs which do not have the necessary technology and

                 vice versa,
           there must be common standards developed regarding high technology
           systems such that the identifiers of Club A using System X can be
           used at Club B which uses another system,


           the membership identifier should be marked as the club's property
           and surrendered upon request to the police or other agents of the
           club,


           the     membership    identifier     should    be   posted    to thelegitimate
           holder when an application for membership has been successful,


           membership lists and details must              be maintained and kept up to
           date by the clubs,


      -    the membership identifier should be used both to buy tickets in
           advance and to gain access to the ground, and


           rules     relating    to   behaviour   anddisciplinary       action     should be
           written clearly on the application             forms and rule book.


6.3   The technology issue


       Football clubs with large attendances or potentially large memberships
may well face the following problems with reciprocal membership schemes:


               the last minute arrival of a disproportionate number of spectators
            wanting rapid entry into the ground,


               administering and updating a list of many thousands of members,


       -   issuing thousands of membership identifiers, and


       -   recognising legitimate members and valid membership identifiers.


       For such    cI uds   a computerised ticketing and rapid access system may be
appropriate.     Indeed,    a   number   of   clubs,   including   Luton   Town,   Tottenham
Hotspur,    Derby       County    and       Plymouth   Argyle     either    have     in    place,     or       are
implementing       such    systems.         Conversely many clubs may            find     a technological
solution     neither       cost    effective         nor    beneficial.         Provided      clubs     using
computerised systems can use their identifiers at clubs without the technology
and vice versa, we see no requirement to impose computerised systems on all 92

clubs.


6.3.1    High technology Systems


         The issue of membership schemes and computerisation is an emotive one.
During     our    discussions,         we    have   found    that      people   have      perceptions      that
membership       schemes       can only      operate with       the    introduction of sophisticated
technology.         In turn, the same people have perceptions that the sophisticated
technology is necessarily expensive, complex and difficult to use, potentially
unreliable       (especially      at    critical moments,           for   example,      10 minutes      before
kick-oft) and generally not worth the investment.


           In our opinion, neither of these perceptions stand close scrutiny.                                   As
we have indicated (6.2 above), as long as agreement can be reached on a common
 format for the membership identifier, and as long as it can be used with equal
 facility in manual or computerised modes, clubs without computerised systems
 can use their identifier at the grounds which are computerised and vice versa.


           We cannot stress too highly the need for early standardisation on the
 format of       the    identitier.          We visited     three     suppliers of        controlled access
 systems.        One of these had a plastic key as the identitier.                           Another had a
 plastic card with a magnetic stripe, while the third had a plastic card with a
 bar code.       Currently four different clubs use the three different systems.                                 It
 takes     little      imagination      to visualise        several more        clubs     installing       a    few
 different       types    of    system so       that   only clubs with          System A     can use       their
 identifiers        reciprocally,           while   clubs with        System B use        their   identifiers
 successfully          for matches      between themselves.             However,     clubs with       System A
 will be unable to use             their identifiers when visiting clubs with System B.
 The problem must be addressed before many more clubs install access control

 technology.

         As to cost, initial outlay does appear to be high, but even this could
be    considered relative.       As an example, we can build up                    typical costs        for
installing systems at one club as follows:


         Assume an average 50 turnstiles per club.                 10Z (5) of these will be for
away supporters.        Assume   that only half         (25) need be computerised                  to cover
both home and away members on the partial scheme recommended in 5.5 above.


         A   club   can either       have    its   intelligence     located    at    the   gate      in an
identifier reader or centrally by a computer in the administration office.
Table    1 below     shows    some    cost    estimates    for    both     these    technology        based
systems.


      TABLE 1.      COST ESTIMATES FOR TWO TYPES OF TECHNOLOGY MEMBERSHIP SCHEME

      (including mounting                            I unit of Controller, 4 readers

       and cabling)                                  and 1 interface unit

     x 25 Turnstiles *       £50,000                                  7 units                  ■    £21,000



      Membership                                     Cabling for ground say                         £15,000

      Stationery ■           £2,000                  Membership stationery                     ■     £2,000

          maximum            £52,000                               maximum                          £44,000




          This would provide a very basic entry-level system.                       If one can assume
that a club installing such a system has the capability to attract a minimum
of 8,000 members (Luton have 30,000, Manchester United are aiming for 35,000)
at    £5 per   season, it can reasonably be               argued    that     the investment in           the
hardware and software only can be almost fully recouped in the first season of

operation.


          Of course the entry level system can be added to in many ways with                             the

 associated estimated costs as follows:
               computerise remaining turnstiles              (£50,000),


               install ticketing software and hardware                 (£20,000 - £30,000),


               install electronic full-height turnstiles                       (£6,000 per turnstile),

               and


               purchase central mainframe computer and link up all clubs

               (£500,000).


        The point here        of course is that each additional                    step        can be    taken
incrementally and will bring its own benefits.                      For example, no one we spoke
to failed to see the value of keeping an up-to-date members list for marketing
purposes, or of being able to analyse attendance patterns, or of linking the
technology used for access to other areas of the club's operation, such as the

club shop.


        The figures we quote are very much 'worst case' figures in that they
represent    the high research and development                costs       incurred        to date by       the
suppliers.      Each     of    the     suppliers        stated      that        prices     would        reduce
substantially (though it was hard to predict by how much) if a great number of
clubs   (for    example,      the    majority      in    Divisions         I     and     II)    decided     on

computerisation.


        Our cost      estimates      came    from discussions with              three     suppliers.        The
CCTA has     also    researched      the    technology     issue,    at    the     request       of    the DOE
Sports and Recreation Division.               It has provided a detailed breakdown of the
costs of all the components in a 60 turnstile system, and estimates the total

costs to be £75,000 per game.


        Finally, we estimate that, for our                  'average'       club to computerise all
turnstiles, including full height electronic turnstiles (at £6,000 by far the
most    expensive      component      of    the   system)     would        cost        £500,000       including

implementation and training costs.

6.3.2    Manual Systems


         These    would    involve,   at    a    basic    level,   recording    systems    in     the
administrator’s office to develop and maintain the membership lists, receive
applications      and     remittances,     post    off    membership    identifiers      and    note

withdrawn or banned membership from other clubs.


         At the turnstile to a membership area, a steward or other agent of the
club would need to check, or appear to check, membership identifiers. Police
officers could highlight people on whom a specific membership check should be

made.


         If there is potential for queues to build up, these checks should take
place before the spectator enters the turnstile.                    One club, Leicester City,
gave a good example of how to do this.                  Its security staff patrol the outside
of the ground before kick off and do a simple visual check that all the people
in a queue for a members' area possess membership cards.                       Those that do not

are redirected to the non-members' entrances.


         The     ticket    office   would       check    the   membership   card   for    sales    of

 seats in membership areas.


 6.4      Selling the scheme


 6.4.1   Demand among spectators


          We found substantial support for the principle of membership schemes in
 the survey we commissioned from MORI as part of our work.                     The survey was of
 football spectators divided almost equally between regular football spectators
 and these football supporters who never attend live League games.                       When asked
 directly, :>5Z of football spectators and 75Z of non-spectators said that they
 were in favour of membership.             The survey suggested that attendances would be
 improved by membership schemes.                Just over a quarter (27Z) of all asked said
 that    such schemes would make           them personally more        likely to attend League
 games, twice the number (14Z) who said that membership schemes would make them

 less likely to go.
           The survey also suggested that membership schemes would encourage                                          the
current     profile of crowds to change,                      as they would have most effect on the
attendance of the over 3 5 ’s (33% "more likely" to attend, 9% "less likely”)
and   on    family      men    (34Z       "more    likely").           Among      young     people       and    regular
attendees at League games there was a closer balance of opinion.                                        However, the
survev suggested that no group is overall less likely to attend games as a

result of membership schemes.


           If   these       intentions       remained          firm,       then    membership       schemes          would
attract more spectators than they deterred.                                This matches       the experience of
Derby      County     who     estimated      that        their      gate       increased    by    57.    due    to     the

installation of a membership scheme.


           Football     clubs       may    find     that       membership         schemes   will        bring    in    new
spectators,         since     the   demand        for    schemes       from non-spectators              may     be    more
significant than the demand from current spectators.


6.4.2      Timing and introduction


           We   recommend       that      reciprocal membership                 schemes be       in place        by    the
start ot        the   1988/89       football       season.          Experiences with         current membership
schemes have shown that to obtain maximum response, publicity should be given
to their introduction as early as possible.                             In fact it should be possible to
run pilots of the partial reciprocal membership scheme towards the end of the

 1987/88 season.


           We    recommend      that       the    design       of    clubs’ own membership                schemes      are
 finalised       by   the     end    of    March        1988    with       a   sustained     publicity          campaign
 commencing during January 1988.                        Pilot schemes and games should be organised
 towards the end of the season in order to gain experience.                                      Membership should
 be   sold in the final months of                       the    1987/88 season for the              1988/89 season.
 During the summer of 1988 any necessary ground moditications should be made.


            All clubs should aim to start and enforce their schemes by the first

 Saturday of the 1988/89 season.
6.4.3    Publicity


         The publicity campaign should be designed                 to encourage both current
spectators        and   non-football   attendees    to become members.         Therefore   it   is
important        that the club does not limit the campaign to leaflets around the
ground and Tannoy announcements.            Amongst measures available to clubs are:


         —        letters to season ticket holders,


         —        advanced programmes with inserts sold in high street newsagents,


                  poster and leaflet distribution during the season around the

                  ground, its locality and city centres,


         —        local newspaper comment,


                   local radio, newspaper and TV advertising,


                   school visits, local working mens' club visits, and


                   national   advertising on    the      radio,   newspapers   organised by     the

                   League and individual 'figurehead' clubs.


 6.4.4    Benefits for members


          Membership must        be    attractive   to    spectators   to be   successful.      Any
 combination ot the following benefits could be offered by the clubs in their

 schemes:


                   better travel arrangements,


             —    closer stewarding to ensure orderliness,


                   significant ditterential pricing to attract spectators to

                   membership,




                                                - 56 -
              protection by excluding hooligans from going into the non-members

              area,


              priority in buying tickets for those games, judged by a club as
              'high risk' or 'popular' and as a result, made all ticket,


              better viewing environment, fewer barriers,


              better refreshment facilities,


              closer contact with football 'heroes'; players, managers,


              discount on souvenirs, programmes, and


        -     exclusive newsletter,


        The   benefits     to   be     offered   will       be     largely dependant       on    local
circumstances,      but   there must    be   some     and   they     must   be    tangible.       In   a
reciprocal membership       scheme     a   key benefit        in    itself is     that   the    general
'benefits     for   members'    areconveyed      to    away      games.      In   the    100%     away
membership scheme the major benefit to spectators of any club scheme is that
it allows     attendance at that club's away fixtures.                    Membership must not be
saddled with potential deterrents,           such as making the least popular part of
the ground the only membership compound.              If a club feels it must do this then

more benefits will be needed to sell membership.


6.5     Enforcing the scheme


6.5.1   Practical Problems


        There are a number of practical difficulties in enforcing a membership

scheme.     They include:


        -      identification of miscreants and their offences,


               reclamation of membership cards,
               recognition of banned spectators,


               prevention of deliberate and hostile infiltration of membership

               areas, and


        —      ensuring fairness and allowing remorse.


        Overriding     these     problems   relies   on quality      stewarding both         by   the

police and direct employees of the club.


6.5.2   The role of the police


        To make a reciprocal membership scheme work to best effect the police

should have two main roles.          They should:


        -       continue    to    bear   major   responsibility       for    dealing       with   the
                recognised hooligan groups, or 'generals and troops', by means of
                intelligence      gathering,     covert   operations        and    other    policing
                tactics.    In our opinion these groups are too sophisticated and
                organised to be countered effectively by anything other than good

                professional policing, and


                act as the agents of the club in stewarding around the ground and
                in town entry points such as railway stations.                    In this role, the
                practice of using local constables to keep an eye on queues and
                the spectators milling around the ground should continue, as this
                is   the most     effective way of recognising         local trouble makers.
                The constables should be empowered by the rules of the membership
                scheme     to    contiscate    taeabership    identifiers         from   misbehaving
                spectators and pass the identifiers straight back to the club, who

                can then decide on the appropriate sanction.


            The practice of using police         'spotters'    for   'away'       spectators should

 also continue, to allow recognition of known trouble makers.
6.5.3   Effective stewarding


        In his    Final   Report,      Mr    Justice       Popplewell made         recommendations      on

training stewards and said that they:


        "should   be   adequate        in   number,       physically    and    mentally      capable    of
        performing     their duties,         effectively deployed,         effectively supervised
        and readily identifiable" (Recommendations 7,10 and 12).


        It is clear from the responses to the League's letter to clubs on the
5th March, 1987 that stewarding has been improved.                     Many clubs have:


               briefing   and    training         sessions    organised       at   least     3 times    per

               season by the police,


        —      stewarding equipment such as radios and tabards, and


               written instructions for stewards.


        Some clubs have gonj further by organising                     'away' game stewarding and
appointing a full time Chief steward to train and supervise part-time staff.
However, we have encountered criticism of some clubs which either still have
poorly trained and motivated stewards, or refuse to accommodate visiting club

stewards.


         We recommend     that    the duties         of    stewarding    include policing         queues,
 turnstiles and membership areas to ensure that members are allowed access, and
 that   this   policing   is    done    at    both    'home'    and     'away'      games.    Clubs    must
 co-operate to allow effective joint               stewarding.


         All clubs     should also train and equip                their own         stewards upto       the
 standards implied by the Popplewell reports.                    The role of stewarding is             still
 regarded by some as an unimportant                part of managing a football game.                   It is
 not.    High quality stewarding             is   one of      the key ways         in which a club       can
 control its spectators.          In view of          this,    and in view of         the current wide
 variation in the quality of stewarding, it may be appropriate for the League

 to install assessment procedures for clubs' stewarding.
6.5.4   Appeals procedures


        It is inevitable that some spectators will either teel wrongly accused
or want to come back into the membership £old after a period of remorse.            To
accommodate these, a club should institute some form of appeals procedure to
consider the severity and nature ot the offence, review the evidence if needed
and allow the offender to rejoin the scheme.       This should be a matter for the
club in consultation with the police rather than the courts and should be kept
simple, using, for example a panel made up of club officials and police, who

meet regularly.


6.6     Administering the scheme


        Administration   should    have   the   following   roles   in   a   reciprocal

membership scheme:


             issuing membership identifiers and collecting subscriptions,


        -    organising communications both to members and non—members,


        —    ensuring the provision of members' benefits,


             organising publicity,


         —    organising 'away' travel for members,


              liaison with the police and stewards over the supervision of
              members and exclusion of banned members,


              setting up disciplinary proceedings and actioning them, and


         -    further developing the scheme to make it more attractive to non

              members.


         It is likely that effective administration of the scheme would require
 a member of the football club's staff dedicated full-time to the task.

                               the reciprocal membership scheme is building on the clubs'
                      'home' membership schemes.                  We are only concerned with the analysis
       of the additional costs and benefits of extending                              'home' membership schemes

I      into reciprocal schemes.

                                          cost      areas     of        reciprocal    membership        schemes       could




I                       modifications          to   the     'away*       spectators'      area to create visiting


I
                        members' areas,


                         cost of providing membership benefits for away spectators,

I                        the employment of 'away' stewards for policing and security of the

I                        members,



I                -       travel arrangements for 'away' stewards.


                 The level of costs would vary for each club.                                  For example some clubs
       may     find    that   their   existing        facilities           for   'away'    spectators        do not       need
        further       sub-dividing       into member’s and non-member’s areas.                          For      these,    the

I       costs    of    ground modifications               should        be minimal.
        increase the level of ’away’ stewarding to offer their members the benefit of
                                                                                          Some     clubs     may wish       to



I       extra security and protection.                    Furthermore some clubs may wish to offer other
        benefits, for example discounted travel arrangements, to their members.

        individual       clubs’ arrangements,                it    is     difficult       to    provide      a   definitive
        example of the costs of reciprocal membership.                               However,      in Appendix III we
        have calculated, albeit after making some arbitrary assumptions, the scale of

I
                                                              - 61 -

I
I
costs a club could face for providing an increased measure of security for its
'away' members by employing special 'away' stewards.


          If this club is in the fortunate position of not needing any ground
modifications, and decides that increased security at away matches is the only
benefit       it   needs   to   provide      then     its    costs     of    implementing         a    reciprocal
membership scheme on top of an existing home membership scheme'could be as low

as £1300 per season.


6.7.2     Benefits


          We   have recommended          that   reciprocal membership                  schemes    are built      on
existing       'home'   membership       schemes.          Many benefits          of    a   reciprocal       scheme
would already accrue from the home scheme.                       However, additional benefits could

be:


                   to make a     'home'    membership scheme more marketable                          to a club's
                   spectators    b y ‘ enabling       it    to    offer     some       advantages       of   'home'
                   membership    at      'away1 games,           for   example         closer     stewarding        of
                   members for greater protection and security,


                   to allow a club to gain some income via membership subscriptions
                   from those spectators who only attend its 'away' games,


          -        to enhance sponsorship opportunities by enabling a club to offer
                   to potential advertisers a wider, possibly national,                                exposure to
                   their advertisements           than the local exposure a home only scheme

                   implies,


                   to lower the policing costs of 'away1 spectators, and


                   to increase 'away1 attendance.


          The      first   three    of    these     benefits       apply     directly        to    a   club's   own
 reciprocal membership             scheme.      The    latter      two      are    benefits       passed     onto     a
 'home' club by a visiting club's reciprocal membership scheme.



                                                      - 62 -
         It is difficult to put a tangible value on these benefits.                             The first
in the list above cannot be valued as it is increasing the marketability of an
existing     scheme.     The       second benefit only           applies to     clubs with         extensive
support in distant geographical locations.                       If, for example, a Northern club
has many of supporters in London, who only                        attend when it plays         in London,
then, if an additional             1000 people pay a membership          subscription of £2, it is
an extra source of revenue for the club.


         The benefit of enhanced sponsorship opportunities is entirely dependant
on a club's negotiating ability, and the benefit of reduced policing costs is

dependent on a club's circumstances.


         As a means of estimating the affect on attendance in Appendix III, we
have    applied    the predictions of          the May          1987 MORI poll       to    a sample    club.
Whilst we have had to make some arbitrary assumptions, in our calculations in
Appendix III, we can say that if the predictions of the MORI poll actually
occur then away attendance will increase and produce a significant increase in
revenue that could be measured in thousands of pounds per season.


6.8      A timetable for progress


         This report         is due      to be published on the 31st July,                  1987, one day
before the start of the 1987/88 football season.                        In order to have reciprocal
membership schemes in place by the start of the 1988/89 season, a timetable
must    be   developed       and   adhered    to    during      the   1987/88   season.       We    strongly
recommend      that    the    League      assumes    a    proactive     role    in   this    process.     To
facilitate this, we recommend that the development of reciprocal membership be
designated as a priority project with a project manager and project team.
We are of the opinion that this, rather than a committee-based approach, would
offer maximum opportunity for success.


6.8.1     Project Tasks


          As   a   guideline,       we    envisage       that   the   League,   and       subsequently    the

appointed project team, would need to:

set up a project team,


agree a timetable and the resources required,


agree and detail League-wide policies,


monitor the schemes for home membership during 1987/88 and prepare
modifications to upgrade them to reciprocal membership schemes,


agree with       individual     clubs    their administration, marketing and
management       skills   profile      and    assess   what   managerial       help    and
training they need to implement their schemes,


approach likely sponsors            for reciprocal schemes            and investigate
the probability of grants from the Government, Local Authorities
and business,


draw up plans with each club for the design and implementation of
their own scheme, ensuring League-wide compatibility,


agree standards for computerised controlled access equipment,


invite   submissions       from     manufacturers       for    the    review    of    high
technology equipment, set demonstration dates, test the equipment
against an agreed set of League wide standards,


publish guidelines to the clubs about the suitability of equipment
to assist them in selecting systems,


organise     a    programme      for     clubs    to   recruit       and   train      their

stewards,


select   clubs      tor   the    pilot       schemes   for    reciprocal    membership
during 1987/88 season, in collaboration with the police,

possibly     chargeable,      to    help    them     implement     the    membership

schemes,


agree a national promotion plan, that would make suitable use of
the publicity      around national         football    events    such    as   the   F.A.

     Eight membership scheme formats were considered for the Football
     League as part of our research. Their summaries form this
     Appendix.


     From these schemes,   examples 6 and 8 emerged as the most suitable to
     meet the needs ot football in the U.K., and are discussed in detail in
     Section 5.4 of the main text.

                        Calculation of Costs and Benefits
                        of a Reciprocal Membership Scheme.


       Reciprocal membership schemes are built on the work already done by
clubs on their 'home' membership schemes.    Therefore we are only interested in
the marginal costs and benefits of adding a reciprocal membership scheme onto

an existing 'home' membership scheme.




       Developing a model to calculate Costs and Benefits


       To indicate the scale of costs and benefits we need to develop a model
using two 'sample' football clubs which have the characteristics of an average

Football League club.


       Data


       The data for the model is as follows:


       -      Average attendance per game in 1986/87 was 8572,


              the ratio of stewards to spectators is 1:158, and


       -      the wages paid to a steward for each game is £6.60.


       This data comes from the Football League statistics for 1986/87.


       The May 1987 MORI poll of the football interested public indicates that

membership schemes would:


       -      attract twice as many people as they deter to attend games,


              deter 20Z of those people currently attending games.




                                        - 78 -
      assumptions


      To calculate costs and benefits we need to make some assumptions about

the club's characteristics and policies.       These are:


       -    the club's average attendance is 8572 per game,


            10% of game attendance is made up o£ away spectators,


            all 'away' spectators are members of their home club,


            away stewarding is done at the higher than average ratio of 1:100
            in order to provide closer supervision of the members,


            stewards are paid the average wage,


       -    the income from membership subscriptions is equal to the costs of

            discounting tickets to members,


       -    the away stewards      travel with       the members     on organised    coaches
             therefore there are no extra travel costs for the away stewards,


       _            effects   predicted   by   the    MORI    poll   manifest    themselves,
             therefore    for   every   spectator    who     stops   attending   because   of

             membership, 2 new spectators attend,


             the price to enter the ’away’ area in a football ground is £4, and


             22 ’away’ games are played for each club.




                                          - 79 -
       Calculation of Costs


      The additional costs areas of reciprocal membership schemes are:


             'away' stewarding, and


       -     ground modifications.


       Ground   modification      may   vary   for   each   club   and   is    a   fixed   cost
occurring once only.


       'Away'   stewarding   is    a variable     cost   and   occurs    for   every   season.
Therefore the additional running costs will be the wages for 'away’ stewards.


       This is calculated below:


       i)    8572 attendance; 10Z of which is 'away’ support - 857,


       ii)   9 ’away’ stewards per game:         (ratio of stewards to spectators ■
             1 : 100),


       iii) Total wages for stewards each season ■ 9 x £6.6 x 22 - £1307.


       Calculation of Benefits


       The only tangible benefit we can predict is the effect on attendance of
away spectators due to the implementation of reciprocal membership schemes.
For this we would use the MORI poll results described above.


       i)    All 'away* spectators are members,


       ii)   20% of 'away* spectators drop out but for each of these two new

             spectators replace them.          (MORI),


                    drop out rate of existing away support;
                    20Z of 857 - 171,
                    replaced by 342 spectators; 171 x 2,


                                           - 80 -
    %
*




                   -       therefore,   'away\ support increases to 1028.


               iii) Extra revenue at each game from increase 'away' support
                    £4 x    171   = £684.   Seasonal   impact   • £684 x 22   'away'   games   =

                    £15,048.


               The receipts benefit of a club's reciprocal membership Scheme would be
        distributed to other clubs when it plays away, but when playing at home                it

        would receive the receipts benefit of its visiting club s scheme.

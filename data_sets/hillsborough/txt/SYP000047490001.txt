Dear Chief Inspector Top

RE; ADAM SPEARETT DECEASED HILLSBOROUGH

As a result of a long discussion with Mr Edward Spearett                                                                                         today we
are instructed to write to you in the following terms.

At about 7.20pm on the 15 April 1989 in a boys club in Sheffield a
Police Officer read out a list of approximately 10 names of people
who he said had been identified as being alive and well that list
contained Adam Spearett's name and when a friend of Mr Spearetts asked
the officer who had read out the list where the individuals where
that he had named he said     that he  did not have that information.

As a result of this information being given by a Police Officer apparently
with the authority to do so Mr Spearett's friend telephoned the family
home in Runcorn and assured Adam's mother her son was alive and well,
he had the authority of a police officer to say so.         By that time
Edward Spearett had not himself been located, he was in fact in hospital
having himself sustained severe injury.

The   inclusion          of       Adam's             name          on       that          list was                obviously                 incorrect.

Since the list was read out there has been no admission by any Police
Officer   that the reading took place   or that Adam's name was on it.
The family wish it to be known that there is no criticism of the fact
of the reading of the list and no criticism for the mistake of the
inclusion of Adam's   name on it, the criticism is that the reading
of Adam's name was obviously a mistake and that that mistake has never
been apologised for.



                                                                                                                                                        Contd

We are instructed that there appear to have been a "Cover up" amongst
the police officers present in the club at the time the lists was
read out and of the fact that the list was in fact read out.

Mr Spearett therefore requires:

1. A Written admission that such a list was read out.

2. Confirmation that Adam's name was on it.

3. The name of the officer who read the list.

4. An explanation for the delay in supplying the answers to questions
 * 1 , 2 , 3 above in view of the fact that Mr & Mrs Spearett have been
   asking for this information for approximately 15 months.

5. Confirmation that disciplinary action has or will be taken against
   the officer for refusing to admit reading the list.

Mr and Mrs Spearett have been caused great distress by the lack of
an admission on the reading of the list and anapology for theincorrect
inclusion of Adam's name on it, this distress has continued for the
past 15 months.

If the admission of the reading and the apology for the error had
both been made at or near the time of the mistake being made then
the distress would nt    have been suffered.  Mr and Mrs Spearett have
obviously been greatly distress by the loss of their son but their
anguish has been added to by the apparently in-sensitive and unecessary
refusal to admit the reading of the list and the inclusion of Adam s
name on it.    The mistake in including Adam's name is regrettable but
would have been forgiven by Mr and Mrs Spearett given the circumstances
in force on the evening in question had the admission they seek been
given earlier.

We trust that this letter will be given immediate and serious consideration
and we look forward to early receipt on our client's behalf of a constructive
reply.

Yours faithfully

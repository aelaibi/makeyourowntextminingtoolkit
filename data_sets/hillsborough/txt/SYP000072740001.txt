   after      the match.



   On arrival         at      the L e p p i n g s LN gate        I saw a few hundred                    people

    o b v i o u s l y wait i n g     to enter         the Ground.            There were          no orderly queues,

   /n    fact,      no queues at, all              nor anyone         directing            people      into queues.            I

    saw one m o u n t e d Po l i c e O f f i c e r at           the m a i n entrance who was                     just

    stationary         not      ma k i n g    any atte m p t    to control           the      crowd,    he was        just

    stood     in front          of those m a i n        gates.      Pe o p l e were           filing    past him on

    both    sides,       which       I did also.          Once      inside,          directly         behind the        gate       1

    saw a S t e w a r d d r e s s e d        in y e 1 1 ow j umper          or    j a c k e t , who aI f i r st

    appeared        to be trying             to ask     peoople       for        tickets,       however,        a few

    mome n t s    he just       gave     up.



    I rnade my w a y , at            f i r s t , i nt o t he    crowd o f pe o p 1 e wa i t i ng t o e nt er the

    ground       itself,       and whilst         wait i n g    to enter           e x p e r i e n c e d the    gradual

    build up of          people.         It was        building       up to such an extent                     that    I felt

    uneonif o r tab! e and           d e c i d e d to move      to the           right    to a point where              there

   was     space a l o n g s i d e      the River        Don.      The       river       is bounded          by a wire

   About      six    feet      from me there was a police                         barrier across a d r i veway

    leading       down toward           the     back    of the S Stand.                  Be h i n d   this     there were

    three m o u n t e d Policemen,               at    least    two    u n i f o r m e d officers            on foot and a

I w a i t e d agai n s t      the   fence     having        deci d e d    1 was    not    bothered about

gett i n g    into the m a t c h         on time      just about          getting       in safely.         Around

me    the re were      othe r people*             m e n , w o m e n , yo u t h s and     children a l 1

obviously         enjoying       the     relief      that    this    space       offered from the           crowd.

After about          two     to three m i n u t e s       one m o u n t e d P o l i c e m a n who    I

recognised         from other matc h e s at A n f i e l d                shouted,       " W e ’re going

through,       open the        barrier."           I w ould describe             him as,       white,    male,     of

average       height and build 3 5-40 y e a r s , w i t h                  dark    brown s h o r t i s h hair

and    brown moustache,             and he was wearing a unif o r m with some                            sort of

h e a dgear a n d was         riding a chestnut              brown horse with a white                    nose.     He

appeared       to be       in charge        of the other           officers.



As he s hou t e d this           order      the     po l i c e w o m a n at the    barrier       shou ted

back,     "No,      do n't,    you'll       make     it worse.,"          However,       the    barrier     was

removed and          the m o u n t e d    police       officers      rode       their    horses     through.

Once     t h r o u g h they s p u r r e d the horses              so that       they turned side           on to

the    people and          began     forcing       them back        towards       the main body of the

crowd.        To a v o i d    the horses          youngsters        were       climbing and       jumping

over     the wire m esh fence               bounding        the    river       bank,    and onto     that

e m b ankme n t .



This     was a very f r i g h t e n i n g         e x perience      and    I could not u n d e r s t a n d why

they were         doing      this as      tins was        the     place where          there was     space       and

a w a y f ro m t h e c r o w d .



T here    was a      limited        number    of options           of where       to go,       either     back    into

the    body    of the        crowd,      which     I did but        r e m ained the       river     side    of the

    The    horses m oved           into      the    crowd and          it was at       this    point    that    the        blue

    metal       conce r t i n a type         gates       were    opened.        T hese    gates were aboaut                2-3

    yards       f r am m e , but       be cause       of the      crowd       I could not see who opened

    them.          This    cuased an         instant          relief and the          people a r o u n d me and

    myslef         filtered      t h r o u g h this       entrance.           There was       no surge    of    people

    and    I had time and              o p p or t u n i t y    to go to the       tio 1 ets to the        l e ft-hand

    side       of the tunnel.



    Once       through this         gate       I did not see any signs                   directing me to my

    match       viewing      position,          nor      did    I see any Pol i c e Officers             or Stewards.

    Th e r e    was a distinct             lack     of    crowd direction.



    At    no time whilst            outside         the Gro u n d       itself    did     I sea any      fighting,

    drunkenness            or disorder,            nor    did    1 see any       unauthorised          entry    to the

    Ground.           I still      had my ticket and               had not       seen anyone,          had not        seen

    any o n e      asking    for    or     c o llecting         tickets       other    than the    single S t e w a r d

    I e m e r g e d from         the     toilets         and heard a sup p o r t e r          say to his       friend,           "

    not    crowded and at              the     end of         it was   the     pitch,     on which     the     players

    were       already      having       the    p r e-match warm-up.




i   The    time would have               been betw e e n 2.55            pm    (1455)     and 3 pm      (1500)        by

    now,       and    1 deci d e d to        enter       the    tunnel    and make my way 1/b the standing

    area.          I had    rela t i v e l y    free      passage along          the     tunnel   up until        X

    en t e r e d     the   standing area.                There were       people ar o u n d me,        but     it was

  not     c o ngested and there was                 no surge       of    people along        the   length of the

  tunnel.



  O nce    onto     the    terraces         1 realised       that       the    people a r o u n d me and       behind

 me were         being    joined g r a d u a l l y by more and more                    people.     I thought

  that     I was     entering a wid e              t e r r a c e d are a an d    could not see until              it

 was      too    l^te that        I was      entering a Pen.              The Pen was        situated to the

/ r i 'ight
       2    of the        rear    of the      goal.



  I found myself            p r opelled agai n s t my will                into the Pen towards              the

  pitch fence,             I tried to         resist      this m o v e m e n t    but along with other

  people ar o u n d me           I was      gradually       getting       closer and        closer     to the

  perimeter         fence,



  I r e a lised      that    the Pen was            overfull       and that       the    crush was      very

  dangerous,         I was       having      difficulty        in bre a t h i n g and       could not move my

  arms     w hich were       pinned across my               chest,        1 was     very    concerned about my

  situation         in fact       very      frightened,           A pair       of spectacles        in my

  breast         pocket    were    being      crushed       into my       chest and        I thought,       "Any

  moment        they're     going      to    break,"        And    injure me severely.



  Everyone         else was       in the      same     position,         they    could not move         of their

  own volition,           just w ith         the    crowd.

 we were,         however,        powerless         to do a n y thing          about    it or to help        that

  p e rs o n ,



  I began shouting               for   the Police O f f i c e r s         on the       pitch side      of the

  fence     to open the gate,               as others        were,      an d    for them to stop the

match.         They were        just    shout i n g     back,      "Push back,           push back."         And

obviously        did not        realise       the s e r i o u s n e s s    of the       situation.         I saw one

youths       a white      lad    17--18 years         old,     (I cannot          describe        him further)
                                                                                                                            /

fence        (pitch s i d e ), however             p h ysically      p revented the             lad from getting

over and        he then turned a n d shouted at                      the     crowd,      "Push back,        push

b a c k ."     W h i c h we all       repeated.



At    various        stages     I had shouted,             “Get    over     the fence."               to anyone

this was        in order        that    the    pressure        could be          released not           for any

other        reason.      We were       shouting a n y t h i n g          in d e s p e r a t i o n so that       the

crush        could be     released.



As    I was     being     pushed further             forw a r d my        left    knee     hit    something       solid

and    3'. r e a lised that my          left       leg was     t r a p p e d behind a. crush barrier                   in

the Pen.          I was    still       being m oved forw a r d             in the       d i rection

of    the     pitch gate and           I found my          left    leg     still    being        trapped.        This

S omehow,       after     I had shouted             that my       leg was        trapped,        my    leg was

r e l eased and        I was     pro p e l l e d    sideways       towards        the    pitch gate again.                  I

became aware           that     the    pitch gate was             open,     I w o u l d not       be able    to say

what    time     this was,        and    that       people were           being    helped        through    it onto

the    pitch.        After      several       minu t e s   the m o v e m e n t     of the        crush    resulted

in me h a l f “ falling          through the          open gate           gradually.            I left my one

left shoe        behind       in the     crowd around             this     time.



I was        lying    on my     right    side my        legs were          still    in the Pen but my

torso was        on the       pitch side.            I was     trap p e d       like this,        screaming at

some Police O f f i c e r s              on the       pitch side who were                 helping      people     through

the    gate,         for    them to       pull       me   out-     The y a p p e a r e d     to be ignoring my

head     in their           desperat ion to get out of the Pen.



A fter what           seemed       like a very            long time,          but was       probably      10-15

They     put me          onto my side           on the grass and at                  this    time     I found myself

having       difficulty            in b r e athing         and    I felt       I was        going     to become

u n c o n scious.           A Policeman          revived me by,               I think,       slapping      my face,

an d then e n c o u r a g i n g          me    to breathe         deeply.          S h o r t l y after    this    I was

s t r e t c h e r e d a way to the Players Tunnel                        and en route          to this       I

I was      placed on the              floor      near to a room being used as a First                             Aid

Ambulance            nurse.        She    e x a m i n e d me then        left me to attend               to other

£ 0 - 2 5 minutes,           and    it was       during       this     time        that    I saw a young         girl       of

a b o u t 12 -15 y ears            c o m e o f f 11"!e p i t c h i n t ears.              S h e was    c o n s o 1 e d by

I w a t c h e d her walk towa r d s and get                       onto       the   bus and     I then      realised

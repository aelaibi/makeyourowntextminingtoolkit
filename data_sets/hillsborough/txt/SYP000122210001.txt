           DETAILS OF DELAYS ON ROADS BETWEEN LIVERPOOL AND SHEFFIELD            15 APRIL

           1989    (150489)




           Before    itemising the delays,   it is important to clarify that the

           motorway road system around Manchester,      which now provides a complete

           bypass to the south of the city was not complete on 13 April.                 At

           that time the M63 finished at Portwood Roundabout,         to the east of

           Stockport at the junction with the A560.           The final    part of the M63

           providing the last      link to the M67 at Denton was not opened until 28

           April.



           ROUTES



           The    recommended route   published in the Liverpool Programme advised

           supporters to follow the M62 east out of Liverpool,            north of

           Manchester,    across the Pennine? to Jet 42 of the Ml.           It was then

           suggested that they travel      south on the Ml,    leaving at Jet 35 for
                                                                                               PAGE   2
                                                                                               R91

            Sheffield.        Supporters who followed that, route have not reported any

            g r eat delays.



            It is clear that many Liverpool            supporters    chose to follow the M62 or
poPL'-j W
            MS<b east out of Liverpool,           then joining the M63 to the west or south

            of Manchester.        This motorway terminated to the east of Stockport and

            supporters were then required to follow the A560 to Mottram in

            Longdendals,      where they could join the A57 over Snake Pass to

            Sheffield.        Supporters who       chose this    route were the ones subjected

            to long delays.



            DELAYS



            There    is some conflict of evidence between that offered by P S g t .

            Turner    (POL PS TURNER)         of Greater Manchester Police    (document 459) and

            that    contained within the statements and questionnaires               completed

            by supporters and coach drivers,            many of whom talk of lengthy delays

            including a coach driver,                           (Document 326) who    produced a

            tachograph chart      indicating he only travelled 5 kms in an hour on

            the M63.        However,    some of the accuracy of this evidence has to be

            viewed in the context that many people are               confused as to their

            correct    location when they were delayed and also,            they were frustrated

            by the hold-ups and may have understandably felt the period of the

            delay to be longer than it actually was.



            1162, WEST OF JUNCTION        15 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY



            At 1106 a damage only road traf f i c accident occurred between a motor

            cycle and a saloon         car.      The motorway,   which at this   point has four

            lanes,    was   reduced by two       lanes for only about    15 minutes.      No
                                                                            PAGE       3
                                                                            R91

reports of serious delays.           (Document 459



M62 JUNCTION 15 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY



Between Q83Q and 1345 hours,         the three    lane motorway at this    point was

reduced by one lane,         due to a third lane closure for essential       central

barrier    renovation.       During the closure,     traffic was flowing   slowly

through the road works and was only delayed for a maximum of IQ

minutes.     (document 459                   St 515 and 517).



Ii62 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 21 & 22 BOTH CARRIAGEWAYS



Contraflow,    two lanes      in each direction.      Long term work   relating to

widening scheme.         No serious delays    reported.    (Document 459

           St 517).



M63 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 2 & 3 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY



The three    lane motorway at this point was         reduced by one lane to

direct traffic     into a suitable     configuration for approaching

contraflow.      Delays      reported no time specified.      (Document 459

           St 214 & 517).



M63 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 3 & 6 BOTH CARRIAGEWAYS



Cont r af 1o w , two lanes    in each direction.     Long term work    relating to

widening scheme           ong delays   reported by supporters and coach

drivers,      It was at this      location that           inly travelled 5 krns in

one hour       (Document 459                     Doc 301 & 326,   St 252 & 517)
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 R91

M63 END OF MOTORWAY PORTWOOD ROUNDABOUT



At that time the motorway terminated at a roundabout,             at the junction

with the A56Q.         Heavy congestion reported due to volume of traffic.

This delay varies between a 1/2 hour and          1 hour   IQ minutes     between

1215 and 1325 h o u r s .    (Doc 325, St 214,   331 & 440).



M67 END OF MOTORWAY MOTTRAM IN LONGENDALE



This    is a traffic bottleneck     caused purely by the combination of a

heavy volume of traffic and the geography of the            road layout.          At

this    location the motorway terminates      into a single    lane    carriageway,

close to a crossroads        controlled by traffic   lights    in a small      village

centre.       The A56Q,   which carried traffic from the M63,         joins the M67

at a roundabout at the terminus of the motorway,           just   prior to this

point and this further        contributes to the bottleneck.          Uns pe c i f i ed

delays     reported.      (Doc 81, St 2145.



A57 APPROACHING SHEFFIELD



There      is one report of an unspecified delay at this location             (St.78).

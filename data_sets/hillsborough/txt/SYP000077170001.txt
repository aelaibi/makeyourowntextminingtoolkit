           there were               entering          t hrough          the turnstiles                in an orderly manner and                             I

           had      no diffi c u l t y           in getting              through myself.



           One      thing       that       I did notice                 outside       the    turnstiles                was      that       quite a.

           lot of supporters                     didn't          have     tickets and             1 was asked several                         times        if

           I    had      any    spare          tickets          for     sale.        There       couldn’t           have        been       ma n y    spare

           tickets          about         as    1 didn’t           see    any       ticket       touts.



           I noticed            several          ground          stewards           outside       the     turnstiles               giving

           directions               to    people       ari d     I was        advised       by    one     which          turnstile            to     enter

           and      then       where       to    go    once        in    the    ground,.          I    saw    a     couple         of      uniformed

           Police          Officers            standing          outside        the     turnstiles            and        about        4 mounted

           officers            wh o      were    positioned              in    Leppings          Ln a t      the       mouth       of      the      access

           I considered                  there    to       be    enough        at    that    time       for       the       size      of    the      crowd

           which         was    orderly.




           I handed            my t i c k e t     to       the     turnstile          operator          on    entry          to    the      ground

           and      then       walked          across        the      enclosure        at    the       rear       of     the      stand       to     a

           staircase            to       the    left       of    the     stand       itself.           I had        no      difficulty              in

           locating            the       stairs       as     they       were    directly          in    front          of    me    after         leaving

F r o m 2 pm         (1400 hrs)          the stand         began to fill                            up s t e adily until about 2 ,

time        I was     very       conscious        of the       build up of                          pjsraple in the               centre        pens

climbing           from the           centre     pens     and o v e / f e n c e s                         which divided the

wing        pens.       These; pens at            the     sides         of the               stands were                virtually

empty.            Considering           that     people had to escape                                 the     crush of the               centre

were        being     directed          into     the middle          pens and                       not      into the side               ones

from        the    centre        pens.         I saw    that     there            was           a     crush       against          the

               looked        in some     distress       and were       red faced,            I knew there were               going        to

               be some        injuries a n d that            people     climbing          onto     the fencing         were    trying

               to escape        the    crush.

               climbing        onto    the     fencing       from the       pens were         being      pushed

               back     by Police        officers       on the       track    side        of the     fencing.



               T hese       initial    actions        by the Police          caused        lots     of anger       by fans      in

               the    pens were        in some        dire    distress and           the Police were              unaware      of

               this.         I believe       that     the Police       feared a pitch               invasion        i n i tially and

               wer e unaware          of what was         taki ng     p 1a c e .



               As the        game    kicked     off    I noticed a young                lad being        passed down the

               heads        of the    people     in the       centre       pens    directly         behind      the    goal.         He

               was a        lad of    perhaps       his early        teens a n d he a p p e a r e d motionless,

               p o s sibly unconscious.                This y o u t h was          passed above          the heads          to the

               f ront       fencing w he re      1 think       he d i s a p p e a r e d    through one of             the    small

               gates        in the    fencing       itself.       1 saw him taken onto                   the    track where           he

               was    treated        by memb e r s    of the St J o h n ’s Am b u l a n c e             Brigade.        I believe

               this y o u t h was        one    of the       first    casualties           to be taken out             of the

A fter      a very short           time    the     position            in the        pens became             critical      with

2.      All    public       houses     should, have              been     closed          in the       immediate area of

             3.      There were          large        numbers    of    people    outside    the ground without

             tickets.           I went      to the       corres p o n d i n g m atch    the year     before and there

             were     1ar ge     numbers         of    s par e t i ckets about       outsi de the ground.          I

             there      because       of    last y e a r ’s surplus.             Obviously     this year      this w a s n ’t

             the     case.

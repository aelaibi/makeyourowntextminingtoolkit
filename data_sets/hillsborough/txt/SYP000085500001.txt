the    Public            House.            It    appeared              that       the       football            supporter           in       the

Boulogne            were       Nottingham              Forest              fans.        I was            unable     to      arrest           any

because          it      would        have       left,      the        others         to       fight.           Further         youths

appeared            at    the       Public        House           and       these       were         persons        who       were

obviously             against             Nottingham              Forest          fans.             I believe           they       were

Sheffield             United          fans       and       n ot    Liverpool                supporters.                 I requested

assistance               and     while          waiting            found          that         a    further        fight        was      taking

place     at        the        Waingate           entrance                 to    the P u b l i c         House.             Iattended              ther

and    saw      a     group         of     about       thirty              youths shouting                  for      the s u p p o r t e r s            in

the    public:           house        to    come       o ut .          I    prevented               the    youths           coming       out       of

that     entrance              however,           they       must           have      used          the    other        entrance             and    bot

groups         emerged           on       the    streets           facing            each          other.         I tried          to    prevent

them     fighting              but        scuffles          did        take       place.             However,           a    transit          van

came     and        the     supporters                ran     off          in    the d i r e c t i o n       of      the C i t y         Centre.

About,    3.15pm            (1515)          that       date        we       were      inform&4_jthat                we      were        to    be

with     other           officers           I was          taken           by    transit            van    to     H i 11sborough

0 n a 1 ight ing from the                 van    I was       told by an       Inspector whose           ident i ty    I

do not       know         to stand with other                officers       in the    centre    of the p i t c h ,,

while       there         I was     told by another             Inspector         to escort     press

photo g r a p h e r s       off    the    pitch        in the d i r e c t i o n   of the old stand.           This

was    due     to some Liverpool                 fans who were             very distraught       complaining

over       them taking            pictures       of     persons     being     carried away on s tretchers

I compl eted this and w hile                       I was s t a nding         near    to the old stand         I. was

a p p r o a c h e d by several            Liverpool         fans who were           complaining       bitterly

about a small g roup of N ot ti n g h a m Fo r e s t                        s upporters    who were

c a 1 1 i ng f or         the game to start and the Li ve r p o o 1 suppor te r s to get                          of f

the    pitch.             I had     to restrain these youths                  who    became    very

ag g r e s s i v e .      The L i v erpoo l       fans were         shouting        that   people were       dead

and    it was          obv i o u s l y   that    the N o t t i n g h a m   fans did not know that.

W hi l e    there       I was a p p r o a c h e d       by a canteen w a i t r e s s who was           carrying a

bowl       of water.          I es co r ted her          to the     1a r g e nurnbe r of peop 1 e 1 y i ng o n

I was       then taken to my traffic                       point at L a d y s b r i d g e and    I completed

traffic        control         duties.          I was      later taken to the Driving School                     wher

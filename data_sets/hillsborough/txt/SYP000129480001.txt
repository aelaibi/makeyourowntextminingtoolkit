Dear Mr.
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
      As promised in my discussion with Mr.         yesterday,
I write to record the load tests which have recently been
carried out.    We have not yet finished writing up the
report cm the testing of all crush barriers but I can give
an assurance that all barriers except one were brought up
to standard during August and that the remaining barrier
has recently been tested and satisfactorily passed the green
book requirement.
      We have also managed to apply test loads at two or three
places along the boundary fence adjacent to the tunnel exit
from Spion Kop and in each case, the fence withstood the
required sideways load for handrailing set out in the green
book.
     We have also test loaded the wall in the small
triangular area below the tunnel exit from Spion Kop to the
full 6 kN/m requirement.
     In the South stand we test loaded on a 2m length at the
foot of each of the access gangways with the full crush barrier
load of 6 kN/m length.   We have also test loaded every
complete span of the balustrade under a load of 3 kN/m length.
In all cases the load was withstood without distress.
                                            Yours sincerely,
City of Sheffield                                                                              Igf

 Sear Sirs,

 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
 Limited. Safety Certificate Application

 With reference to the above, it will be recalled that an undertaking was given
 to provide a structural survey report on the South stand construction, together
 with proposals for any necessary treatment, with particular reference to the
 loss of strength caused by the severe corrosion existing at the base of the
 front support columns.

 As you are aware, the application for the Safety Certificate has reached an
 advanced stage and without consideration of this detailed report I would be
 unable to give full building authority approval.

 I should be grateful if you would forward this information, together with all
 outstanding test reports at your earliest convenience.

 Yours faithfully,

Upper Wortley Road,
Rotherham. 861 2RF
For the attention of Mr.


Dear Sirs,
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
         New Crush Barriers and Handrails
     We have now considered your draft final account dated
20 September 1979 and have pleasure In enclosing a copy ot our
Interim Certificate No 3 for the sum of           which should be
presented together with your statement for the same amount to
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
     The adjustments given below have been made to your drtfft final
account.
1) Referring to the letter dated 3 August 1979 from Messrs Shaw
    Engineering we are still not convinced that the cost of items
    5,7 and 8' should be met In full by the Employer. £        has
    therefore been deducted until these items have been considered
    in detail.
2 ) Referring to the letter dated 14 September 1979 from
    Messrs Shaw Engineering we have not received any substantiating
    time sheets for the additional work. We have certified £
    of this work and deducted ij
3) Due to the reduction In the two proceeding items "Other charges
    and profit" (35/3) has been adjusted accordingly. £65.18 has
    been deducted.
4) We believe the £       entered against "Method Related" Items is
    a fixed charge and should not be Included In calculations for
the four day extention to the contract period. Plant on site should
have been included in your tender as a time related item with an
establishment and removal fixed charge,       ^ias therefore been J
deducted.
5) We believe that item 7 page 15 in your final account was never
    carried out. The painting of the additional barriers, and rails
    was eventually done by Ballamshire Builders Ltd after your
    painting Sub-contractor failed to complete the work. £      has
    therefore been deducted.                                        /
     Would you be kind enough to comment on the above adjustments.
We are of the opinion that providing evidence can be forwarded, on
the work done by Messrs. Shaw Engineering, of time spent there is
little to disagree with and settlement should follow soon after the
necessary documents have been received.

Dear Sirs,
          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
          Extract Fans in South Stand
     We write to confirm our recent request for you to supply a
total of four U9/WW plus one U6/WW fans, in accordance with your
quotation dated 9 November. A fan is now to be fitted in the
players lounge.
     South Yorkshire County Fire Service have insisted that intumescent
grilles be fitted to the fans. Would you therefore please place
an order with Vent-Axia Ltd for the supply of these grilles. They
will be the egg-crate type and be fitted on the corridor side of
the opening. The fan fixing plate will be mounted on the room side.
     We have discussed the grilles with Mr.          (0532-452985)
the Leeds area manager of Vent Axia Ltd and he will be familiar with
the requirements.



                                 Yours faithfully,

                 Safety of Sports Grounds Act
     Thank you for sending me a copy of the letter dated
29 November from South Yorkshire County Council.
     Dealing first with the question of the steel columns
of the South stand, the position is that no progress has
been made because we do not intend to carry out any further
strengthening.   This matter has been the subject ot a number
of discussions both on the telephone and person to person
with the representatives of Sheffield City Council and I
think it likely that they will come round to our point of
view in the next two or three days.    They are, of course,
perfectly correct in saying that the column base is not
capable of taking overturning moment.    They argue that
because it has a built-up gusseted base, the original
designer obviously envisaged that it was to take moment
and they therefore request that the column be restored to its
original condition and purpose.    My counter-argument is that
at the time the stand was constructed, all column bases were
stiffened in this way whether they were intended to take moment
or not.   The concrete frame of the stand is capable of taking
all horizontal forces due to wind acting on the roof and the
steel column merely acts as a prop.    The steel plating which
we have already had welded to the bases is by itself sufficient
to take the vertical load.    In my view, no further strengthening
 is necessary.
      Sufficient mosey is at stake to make it worthwhile
 to dig in our heels.   The welding we have so far carried
 out has cost approximately £600 and together with work on
 the concrete, taking up floors etc,, we shall have spent about
 £1000 on this item.   If we accede to the City Council's
 request the extra welding will be at least two or three
 times as great as that carried out so far and we shall need
 to demolish parts of the front parapet wall round each base
 and also take upquite major areas of the floor and replace.
 The additional expenditure is unlikely to be less than £2,500.
      1 have had two conversatlns with Mr. Sherrif this week
 and have undertaken to write a short report setting out my
 views on how the columns perform their function.       I have
 pressed sufficiently hard for the matter to have been
 referred to Mr.             I. the chief building surveyor and
 I think that after receipt £>f my report, we are likely to
 have their agreement.
      With regard to the emer g e nc y lighting, you will
 recall that until the meeting on 12 November, we had said
 that we would appeal to the Secretary of State rather
 than put in a complete new lighting system in the South stand
 which would, I believe, have been considerably more expensive
 than that provided in the North stand (i.e. more than £10,000).
 At the meeting on 12 November, a compromise solution was
 suggested in which we would mix the circuits which at present
 each serve approximately one third of the stand.       By doing
 this we would not have one area plunged into complete darkness
 if one fuseboard were seriously damaged.
     A meeting was held with Mr. Jones of the Fire Service
during the following week to try to agree the extent of the
modifications which would satisfy, following which our
electrical engineers spent some time on site trying to sort
out the various circuits.   During this period, we discovered
that the lights covering the seating areas of the South stand
                                                                  3.




are not in fact connected to the wnergeney lighting system.
In some way, they must have been accidentally left on when
we had the evening visit and inspection last May.    I am sure
this was completely unintentional on the part of Messrs. Bownes
but it has now presented us with a new situation.
     However, we have also discovered that the main cabling
serving the fluorescent lights of the South stand is completely
independent from the remainder of the cabling.    This has
made it very much easier to provide an adequate amount of
light should one of the three fuseboards become inoperative
since we have a second source of mains power from which we
have devised a scheme of cross connections.    These will serve
both the internal areas and the area over the seating in the
stand.
      The final picture is that- we believe we can produce
a system which overall will satisfy the Fire Officer and which
will give adequate lighting in the event of both a mains
failure and a failure of a fuseboard happening at the same
time.    We do not know the precise cost but our belief is
that it will be between £1000 and £1,500.     We suggest that
Messrs. Bownes be engaged to carry out this work as an
extension of their existing contract and at the dayworks
rates given in that contract.     There is a good chance that
all the work will be complete by Christmas.
      No doubt you will confirm your approval of our action
in asking Bownes to do this extra work.     I am sure it is a
satisfactory outcome to what might have been a serious impass
with regard to emergency lighting in this particular stand.

                                Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
                        Phase II Contract
     We write to confirm the instruction given to you today by
John Strange.
     Would you please remove more excavated material from behind
the precast concrete panel wall from the cofener of the Hillsborough
Suite to the new staircase as a matter of urgency.
     It is evident that during instruction of the staircase
excavated material has been allowed to accumulate behind the precast
concrete panel wall which is now showing signs of distress. We wish
to receive from you your proposals for repairing, strengthening or
replacing the panels.

             Dear Sir,

             Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

             As was discussed at the meeting on 12th November between representatives of
             the Club and the Officer Working Party, the question of the issue of the
             flpnAral Safety Certificate and the fee to be charged was put to the County
             Ccnmittee concerned this morning.

             Subject to the outstanding points being satisfactorily resolved, the
             Carcmittee has approved of the issue of the Certificate and has recannended
             that the question of the fee to be charged should be discussed with another
             Committee before a decision is reached. This approval will, of course, be
             subject to formal confirmation by the County Council on 19th Decentoer.

             The principal outstanding matters are still those relating to the South Stand
             discussed on 12th November, namely, remedial works to the steel columns and
             the emergency lighting system. I understand that little or no progress has
             been made on these two matters.

             Whilst the County Council recognises the Club's co-operation in carrying out
             by far the majority of the measures recommended by the Officer Working Party,
             I am sure you will appreciate the position which will be created should
             progress not be made quickly on these two outstanding major items.

                                                                         Yours faithfully,

Dear Sargeant Aiaaley,

            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                  Proposed Police -Post
        As requested in your recent telephone conversation with
John Strange, we have pleasure in enclosing our sketch 1610/56
which shows the layout of columns beneath the North stand
and their relationship to the gymnasium.   The sketch also
shows the edge of the mezzanine floor above which limits the
headroom in that area to a total of 3.5m.
        John Strange would be pleased to give any other
information you may require.

                                 Yours sincerely,




c.c.   Mr. E. England

Dear Sirs,
                  Sheffield     Wednesday Football Club
             Installation of Extract      Fans in South Stand
         Thank you for your quotation for the supply and
fixing of five extract fans.         We now have the authority
of the Club to accept your quotation except that it is
unnecessary for a fan to be placdl in the players bar
so that only four are required instead of five.
         I               should be grateful if the wor k could be carried
out w i t h all speed as we are attempting to have the
Certificate of     Safety signed early in December.

          It was a g re e d that, w hilst the only positive way of proving the adequacy of the

          Long lengths of soffit had required repair.
                   Work on the external members would be finished by
          Friday 9 November.         Dr* Eastwood said that unless absolutely
          necessary only the areas marked on the drawings for repair
          should be done.        These repairs must be complete by Friday
          and then return to finish the few remaining internal members.
          g)    Alterations and Strengthening Staircases in South Stand
                   Mr.          said that all remaining steelwork for the
          whole of the works would be delivered by Wednesday 7
          November.      Mr.              said that he must have all the
          vertical stanchions for the staircase before then.          The
          holes for the holding down bolts were being drilled on 7
          November.

                    The pockets for the handrail posts down the second
           staircase would be cut out and the bolts fixed in one day,
           the 6 November,       leaving only the handrails to bend and
           fix.
                     Mr.        said that one weeks work was required to
           complete this section.       Two more men would be employed on
           site making four in total from the morning of 7 November.
           Mr. England agreed that work could continue throughout the
           evening providing suitable arrangements could be made with
           the caretaker.
                     Dr. Eastwood said that if work on the handrails and
           strengthening was not complete by the morning of 12
           November,       account would be taken of this by the Club when
           deciding on the amount of liquidated damages to be claimed,
           h)     Spion Kop Staircase
                     The additional excavation was complete.       One
           further flight of steps had been cast with another landing
           being cast on 7 November.          It was expected that all the
           flights and landings would be cast by the end of the week.


 10.4      Priorities for Completion

                     Dr. Eastwood outlined the priorities for the
           completion of the steelwork on the Contract.
                     a)    All work in the South Stand.
                     b)    Angle struts and strengthening of the pitch
                           perimeter fence,
                     c)    Handrails on the Spion Kop Staircase.
                     Mr.        said that the handrails on the Spion Kop
           Staircase would take seven working days to finish.
           Providing the weather did not cause major disruptions,                and
           work started earlier in a morning and up to lunchtime at
           weekends this section would be complete by the evening of
           Wednesday 21 November.


 10. 5     Debris and rubbish beneath timber boards in South Stand

                    Dr. Eastwood requested that six boards be taken up
           at random,      at locations where paper was likely to accumulate,
                                                                   SHEET    4

           behind upstand beams and exits,      to ensure that no rubbish
           lay under the seated area.


  10.6     Metal radial barriers in South Stand

                  Mr. Strange said that the two lengths of metal
           dividing barriers in the seated area were to be removed.


  10.7     Handrails on staircases in South Stand

                  Mr. Strange confirmed that the handrails on the
           outside walls were to be stopped on either side of the
           horizontal timber ducting.


  10.8     Inspection required by the Contractor

                   Mr.             confirmed that there was no outstanding
           information required critical to the progress of the works.
           M r . a s k e d   Mr. Strange to inspect and comment upon the
           heights and widths between handrails on the South Stand
           staircases    after the meeting.

Dear Eric,
      I enclose a copy of a letter received today from
South Yorkshire County Council.
      As you will see they have half given wayoon the
question of the cprrugated sheeting at the back of the
North West terrace in that they are now only requesting
the fixing of a continuous horizontal timber.
I would still be prepared to say that this is not
necessary but you mi g h t feel: it politically expedient
to agree on this particular item.
      With regard to the new concrete slabs forming the
ne w escape passageways from the Westsstand,      I see no
reason whatever to apply a test load.         Calculations
have been submitted which show that the slabs are in
accordance wi t h C.P.110.   The cost of applying a test
load wo uld be several hundred pounds and in ray view, is
a complete waste of money.     I recommend that we should
resist this requirement.
      With regard to the steel column base plates, w e have
liaised wit h Mr. Sheriff and have invited wi ther Mr. Sheriff
or Mr. Mills &o inspect the work whi ch has been carried out.
We telephoned Mr. Sheriff twice during the week before last
to let h im know when the bases w o u l d be exposed and his
commitments did not permit him to make an inspection. We
have therefore let the work proceed, with Mr. Sheriff's
knowledge, and we will write a little note explaining
exactly what we found to be necessary.
      I am pleased to see that there is an apparent
willingness to consider the South stand emergency lighting
as being satisfactory for the time being.   I think the
reference to the automatic operation In the event of
failure of the main lighting arises from the fact that
we were not sure during the meeting with Mr. Jones
whether all the lights are left on within the stand
during a game.   You have now been able to assure us that
this is so in which case the lights will be switched
over automatically to the battery in the event of mains
failure.
      I will speak to you tomorrow morning (Tuesday) to
obtain pour reaction before replying.

                              -Yours -sincerely,

    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club                           Piec’d       .........................
    I thank you for your letters dated 16th and 22nd October.

    Following consultations with the Officer Working Party, I would make the
    following ccrrments on the points raised in your letter of 16th October

    (a)      Whilst it is agreed that the corrugated sheeting at the back of the
             North West Terrace should generally be adequate to resist the forces
             which could reasonably be expected to arise from crowd loading in
             this area, it is considered that precautions should be taken to
             prevent local damage to the sheeting, particularly at the joints, and
             to spread the anticipated load over a larger area than at present.
             This could be achieved it is suggested by fixing a continuous
             horizontal timber member to the front of the sheets at a height about
             one metre from terrace level.

    (b)      Regarding the strength of the reinforced concrete slab adjacent to
             the escape stair at the West Stand, it is considered that the only
             positive way to prove the adequacy of the joint between the new and
             existing construction is by means of a test load generally in
             accordance with CP110.

    (c)      As discussed between Mr. Strange and Mr. Sheriff, it would appear
             that most of the steel column base plates supporting the South
             Stand roof will need sane remedial work, and I look forward to
             receiving your proposals on this.

    The points you make in your letter of 22nd October relating to the emergency
    lighting in the South Stand, are noted. I hope you will agree that the County
    Council has always shown itself to be willing to exercise discretion so long as
    it is consistent with public safety and does not depart too radically with the
    Guide's recorrrendations. With this in mind, I should be glad to receive your
    proposals as to how the emergency lighting arrangements in the South Stand
    could meet the Guide requirements pending the installation of the proposed
    generator, particularly as regards its automatic operation in the event of
    failure of the main lighting.
    An additional copy of this letter is attached for you to pass to the Club
    should you so wish.
                                                                         Y n n rs   -F ai th -F n l 1 v .

For the attention of Mr.

Dear Mr.
             Sheffield Wigdnesday Football Club Ltd.
      Thank you for your letter, dated 31 October and the
accompanying application for payment.
      We have pleasure in enclosing a copy of our Interim
Certificate No. 2 for the sum of £3,770.15 which should
be presented together with your statement for the same amount
to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.    In accordance
with the terms of the Contract we have deducted a retention
of 5% from your application.    The retention reaches a
maximum of 5%.of the Total Tender Sum.    Half of this amount
will be paid 14 days after the issue of a Certificate of
Substantial Completion.
      For the purposes of this valuation we will accept your
figures for the various items.     The quantities are not
necessarily agreed until we have made our own remeasurements
from the drawings and site work.
      We disagree with your argument that the late delivery of
the fire doors warrants the granting of an extension to the
Contract.   In your telephone conversations with John Strange
on 18 and 19 September it was agreed that doors should be manufactured
to the original specification.   These you said would be made within
four weeks from your supplier receiving the order,,i.e. four
weeks from 24 September and coincidentally four weeks from the
Commencement Date.   The contract period is six weeks, with
completion being due before 5 November.   We do not therefore
consider that the fire doors are a legitimate claim for an
extension to the Contract.
      However, we do agree with your reasoning for an
extension to the Contract as a result of the decorating which
has been increased in scope from the original tender documents.
      We are therefore willing to grant an extension to the
Contract to Friday, 23 November 1979 but insist that all other
work is complete by 5 November.   It is extremely important to
the Employer that all the upgrading work, doors, fittings etc.
are complete by this date for during the same week
representatives from the S.Y.C.C. will be inspecting the ground.
The issue by them of the essential Certificate of Ground
Safey will depedd upon their findings.   Without your work
being complete, the spectator capacity may be reduced,
especially in the South stand, drastically affecting the
club's potential income.
      We trust that every effort will be made to ensure that
your work is complete before the inspections.
      Although we have granted an extension for the decorations
it is unlikely that a pro-rata sum for the General Items will
be accepted because of the reduced volume of work, intensity of
labour and supervision required whilst decorating.   Would you
therefore please submit for our consideration a detailed
statement of your General Items for the extended period.

                                  Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                                        W
                                                                                                                                         ■ ■

     Dear Sirs,

                                                                                                        __i
     I thank you for your letters dated 16th and 22nd October.

     Following consultations with the Officer Working Party, I would make the
     following carments an the points raised in your letter of 16th October: -

     (a)    Whilst it is agreed that the corrugated sheeting at the back of the
            North West Terrace should generally be adequate to resist the forces
            which could reasonably be expected to arise from crowd loading in
            this area, it is considered that precautions should be taken to
            prevent local damage to the sheeting, particularly at the joints, and
            to spread the anticipated load over a larger area than at present.
            This could be achieved it is suggested by fixing a continuous
            horizontal timber mertter to the front of the sheets at a height about
            one metre from terrace level.

     (b)    Regarding the strength of the reinforced concrete    slab adjacent to
            the escape stair at the West Stand, it is considered that the only
            positive way to prove the adequacy of the joint between the new and
            existing construction is by means of a test load generally in
            accordance with CP110.

     (c)    As discussed between Mr. Strange and Mr. Sheriff, it would appear
            that most of the steel column base plates supporting the South
            Stand roof will need sane remedial work, and I look forward to
            receiving your proposals on this.

    The points you make in your letter of 22nd October relating to the emergency
    lighting in the South Stand, are noted. I hope you will agree that the County
    Council has always shewn itself to be willing to exercise discretion so long as
    it is consistent with public safety and does not depart too radically withthe
    Guide s recommendations. With this in mind, I        should be   glad to receive yo
    proposals as to hew the emergency lighting arrangements in the South Stand
    could meet the Guide requirements pending the installation of the proposed
    generator, particularly as regards its autcnatic operation in the event of
    failure of the main lighting.
    An additional copy of this letter is attached for you to pass to the Club
    should you so wish.

   Dear Eric,
                  I enclose a copy of a letter received today from
   South Yorkshire County Council.
                  As you wil l see they have half given w a y on the
   question of the corrugated sheeting at the back of the
   North West terrace in that they are now only requesting
   the fixing of a continuous horizontal timber.
   I W o u l d still be prepared to say that this is not
  necessary but you mi g h t feel, it politically expedient
   to agree on this particular item.
                 With regard to the n ew concrete slabs forming the
  hew escape passageways from the Wes t stand, I see no
  reason w h atever to apply a test load.                                                Calculations
  have been Submitted wh ic h show that the slabs are in
  accordance wi t h C.P.110.                                              The cost of applying a test
  load wou l d be several hundred pounds and in m y view, is
  a complete waste of money.                                                I recommend that we should
  resist this requirement.
                 W it h regard to the steel column base plates, we have
  liaised with Mr.                                                     and have invited either Mr.
  or Mr.                              to inspect the work w h i c h has been carried out.
 We telephoned Mr.                                                       twice during the week before last
  to let h im kn o w whe n the bases wo u l d be exposed and his

E A S T W O O D fir P A R TN E R S




   commitments did not permit h i m to m a k e an inspection,              We
  have therefore let the work proceed, w i t h Mr.
  knowledge,          and we will write a little note explaining
  exactly what we found to be necessary.
             I am pleased to see that there is an apparent
  willingness to consider the South stand emergency lighting
  as being satisfactory for the time being.                 I think the
  reference to the automatic operation in the event of
  failure of the m a i n lighting arises from the fact that
  we wer e not sure during the mee ti n g wi t h Mr. Jones
 whet h er all the lights are left on within the stand
 during a game.                 You have now been able to assure u s that
  this is so,in w h i c h case the lights will be switched
 over automatically to the battery in the event of a mains
 failure.

            I wil l speak to you tomorrow morning         (Tuesday)   to
 obtain your reaction before replying.


                                              Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,
             Sheffield Wednesday FootballlClub Ltd
                       Phase 11 Contract
      We are extremely concerned about the present lack of progress
on the work In the South Stand. At the site meeting held on
9 October it was agreed that all materials for the staircases be
on site by 15 October with all work complete by Friday 26 October.
      At the time of writing this letter the only materials on site
are the posts for the handrails on the two main staircases. These
cannot be fixed without the handrails.
      Every effort must be made to bring the materials to site
immediately and the work completed by 2 November. It is absolutely
essential that this work, including painting by the Main Contractor
is complete by this date.
      Tour proposals for acheiving this target are urgently required.
Would you please contact Mr*           and Mr. Strange to arrange a
meeting to dismiss acceleration of the work.


                                       Yours faithfully,

         the top of the existing mesh and over the fence.
               Mr.        agreed to properly secure, by bolting and
         tack welding, the existing corrugated sheeting which had
         become loose whilst altering the fence.
         (b)   New Emergency Exits at the bottom of Spion Kop
               These were now complete.     Dr. Eastwood reported that
         cracks were visible in the horizontal Reebafill rendering.
         The defective rendering was to be broken out and replaced
         with new.
         (c)   North Stand Barriers
               Mr .       said that one complete barrier would be
         delivered on Wednesday 10 October so that holes could be
         marked out ready for drilling.      The holes would be drilled
         during Thursday and Friday 11 and 12 October.         The cleats
         and base plates would be delivered separately.         All barriers
         would be on site by Friday evening 12 October and be fixed,
         including all welding by the end of Tuesday 16 October.
         (d)   New Escapes from West Stand
               Mr.        agreed to place the additional sheet of mesh
         on the gate at the North exit.      It was requested that holes
         be drilled in the chequered plate at the South exit to
         prevent water ponding on the landing and a cabin hook and eye
         be added     to secure the open gate.
         (e)   New    Gate from South side of Spion Kop
               Angles had been welded to the door head beam and the
         barbed wire fixed between these angles and back to the
         existing curved steel brackets.         The angles only required
         painting to complete      this section.
         (f)   Alterations to gates at bottom of West end Terrace
               No further work had been done to the gates since the
         last meeting.     One frame leg required welding and the centre
         gate was still binding at the head.
         (g)   Remedial Work   to Areas of Damaged Terracing
               Mr.    Malthouse confirmed that this work was now complete.
                                                                  SHEET    3 .

         (h)   Repairs to Concrete Members in South Stand
               Approximately 80% of this work was complete.    Several
         lengths of badly spalled concrete had been discovered along
         the beam at the rear of the seated area.     Mr. Strange, after
         inspection, agreed that these areas be added to the repair
         schedule.     Mr.           said that he expected all the repair
         work to be complete within two weeks,    including that on the
         outside of the stand.
         (j)   Alterations and Strengthening Staircases in South Stand
               No steelwork had been delivered by Peter Ward Engineering.
         Mr.         agreed to deliver the steel for the centre handrails
         on Wednesday 10 October with the vertical U.B. sections for
         supporting the walls being delivered on Thursday 11 October.
         Holes for the fixing plates w u l d be drilled during Thursday
         and Friday 11 and 12 October.     Dr. Eastwood insisted that all
         materials for the staircases be on site by the morning of
         Monday 15 October.
               It was agreed that handrail posts could not be fixed
         and left without the rails.     The handrails had to be complete
         before Saturday 21 October with the remainder of the work, with
         the possible exception of the painting, being complete by.
         Friday 26 October.
               Mr. Strange agreed that the handrail brackets could be
         turned at right angles to simplify fixing to the walls.      He
         said that the handrails need not be cranked round the projecting
         columns and could be stopped on either side of the existing
         duct ing.
         (k)   Spion Kop Staircase
               The two bottom flights and one landing had been cast.       One
         further landing and part of the third flight had been excavated.
               An inspection of the staircase had been made before the
         meeting.    Dr. Eastwood confirmed that the second landing should
         be reduced from 4800 mm by 550 mm and the upstand at the back
         of the landing made 215 mm wide to carry a brickwork retaining
                                                                    SHEET     4.

         w a ll.
                   Polyethylene sheet was to be placed over all exposed
         red shale on which concrete was to be cast.
                   Mr. Strange said that to match the levels of the ramp
         at the bottom of the staircase an extra step had been found
         to be necessary together with the possibility of a triangular
         •shaped landing.      Sufficient concrete had already been broken
         out from the ramp to accommodate this extra step and landing.


   8.4   Labour Returns
                   Mr .          handed to Mr. Strange the labour returns
         for the previous two weeks.       They showed that over the period
         the labour strength had averaged thirteen, with Peter Ward
         Engineering being present on 6§ days with two men.


   8.5   Information required by the Contractor
                   Mr .          confirmed that there was no outstanding
         information required critical to the progress of the works.


   8.6   Next Meeting
                   The next site meeting will be held on Tuesday 23 October
         at 10.00.

Minutes of Site Meeting No. 9 held on Tuesday 23 October 1979.


              Present
                    Mr. E. England                                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                    Mr.                                                  Hallamshire Builders Ltd.

8.1           Previous Minutes
                    The minutes of meeting No. 8 held on 9 October were read
              as the meeting progressed.                                   They were then accepted as a true
              record of the proceedings.

8.2           Absence of Peter Ward Engineering’s Representative
                    Mr.                                      reported that Mr.                        was away on holiday.
              It was not known if Mr.                                             would be attending the meeting
              in his place.

8.3           Progress
                    Mr.                                      reported progress on the items given below,
              (a) New exit at East end of South Stand open seating
                    The additional angles and mesh were being welded between
              the vertical posts.                                  It was expected that this work would be
              complete by the end of the day.                                       The new members would be
              painted starting on Wednesday 24 October.                                                Mr.                 added
              that welding and fixing the corrugated sheets should have been
              completed by Peter Ward Engineering before 20 October but work

      had not started on this section until just before the meeting.
       (b) New Emergency Exits at the bottom of Spion Kop
           The replacement of the Reebafill rendering would be done
      during the next few days.

       (c) North Stand Barriers
            These were painted on Friday 19 October, though the last
      barrier had not been delivered until Wednesday 17 October by
      Peter Ward Engineering.

       (d) New Escapes from West Stand
            The additional sheet of mesh on the gate at the North
      exit had been fixed on 19 October.    Holes had been drilled in
       the landing at the South exit on the same day.
            This section was now complete with the exception of the
       cabin hook and eye on the South exit gate.

       (e) New Gate from South side of Spion Kop
            The recently fixed angles had not been painted.
      Mr. Malthouse agreed to paint these immediately after the
       items in section (a).

       (f) Alterations to gates at bottom of West end Terrace
            The outstanding work had been completed by Peter Ward
      Engineering on Friday 19 October.    Mr. England requested that
      adjustments be made to the centre gate so that both bolts slid
      into their respective keeps.

       (g) Repairs to Concrete Members in South Stand
           All the internal work was complete.      Work continued on
      the beams at the rear of the seated area.     Repairs on the
      external face would commence on Wednesday 29 and be complete
      within one week.   Mr. England requested that the Nitomortar
      repairs be rendered with a cementitious paint of a similar
      colour to the existing.
           Mr.   j       said that the repair work had taken
      longer than envisaged because of the additional badly damaged
      areas discovered whilst work proceeded.
                                                                         SHEET   3

       (h) Alterations and Strengthening Staircases in South Stand
             The only steel delivered to site by Peter Ward Engineering
      was the handrail posts for one staircase.          These could not be
      fixed until the handrails had been delivered and bent.            There
      were no vertical U.B. sections for strengthening the walls or
      handrails on site.
             After considering the large amount of work still to
      be done on this section byPeter Ward          Engineering it was
      apparent that it was in danger of         not being complete ready for
       for   home   game on 3 November.
             Mr. England said that        it was essential that the work
       be completed by this date.         Early the following week an
       inspection of the ground was to be made by representatives of
       S.Y.C.C.     The purpose of the visit was to establish that all
       the items listed by the S.Y.C.C. to comply with the Safety of
       Sports Ground Act had been done.        The issue of the Certificate
       of Safety depended upon their findings.
             Mr.             said that the pockets for the handrail post
       base plates wouxa oe sawn out on Wednesday 24 October but not
       cut out until the remaining steelwork had arrived.         Mr. England
       said that it would be possible to close one staircase during
       the Central League game on Saturday 27 October,

       (j) Spion Kop Staircase
             One further landing had been cast.        Excavation was almost
       complete.     The top three flights would have 16 risers in each.
      Mr. Strange said that the landing between two consecutive
       flights had to be a minimum of 1100mm.         It was therefore
      agreed necessary to break out a further 900mm of the existing
      approach slab at the top of Spion Kop to accommodate the
      additional steps.
             Mr. England reported that some of the existing precast
       concrete panels in the wall at the corner behind the Hillsborough
       Suite were showing signs of distress.         Mr. Strange instructed
      Hallamshire Builders to immediately remove the additional spoil
      recently placed behind the wall.         If necessary excess material
      was to be taken off site.
                                                                   SHEET 4


EASTWOOD Cr PARTNERS




            Again Mr. England emphasised the importance of also
       completing this section of work.   There was concern that
      handrails would not be fixed by Peter Ward Engineering before
       the inspection by S.Y.C.C.   Mr. Strange agreed to write to
       them expressing this concern.

8.4    Labour Returns
            Mr.           handed to Mr. Strange the labour
       returns for the previous two weeks.  They showed that over
       the period the labour strength had been maintained at thirteen.
       Peter Ward Engineering had only been present on three days
      with two men.

8.5    Information required by the Contractor
            Mr.             confirmed that there was no outstanding
       information required critical to the progress of the works.

8.6   Delivery and Completion of Remaining Steelwork
            It was agreed that to complete the work on the staircases,
      material had to be delivered to site no later than the following
       dates.

          (a) South Stand     Friday 26 October, all material
          (b) Spion Kop       Thursday 1 November, all handrails.,    (Posts
                              are already on site).

            All work on the South Stand staircases was to be complete
      by Friday 2 November.    The whole Contract was to be complete
      and men off site before 12 November.

8.7   Timber Partitions in South Stand
            Mr. England confirmed that the timber partitions to be
      removed from the South stand should be stored behind the North
      stand.

8.8   Next Meeting
            The final site meeting will be held on Tuesday      6 November
      at 10.00 a.m.

For the attention of Mr.



Dear Mr Titterton,
               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
     We have pleasure in enclosing two copies of our painting
and decorating schedule for the South Stand and the doors      in
the North and West stands.
     Having inspected the closer fixed to the door in the
South Stand it does appear that the mechanism is not strong
enough for the weight of the new door.     We therefore confirm that
you supply and fix a similar but heavier duty closer for all the
doors.   The SWELCLOSE type would be acceptable.
     The Employer has decided that the fire fighting equipment
should be fixed by the ground staff.     The equipment is unlikely
to be delivered before the end of the Contract and to save a return
to site we wish this part of the work to be omitted.
     Supplying and fixing the exit signs is still included.
                                                   Yours sincerely.

                                           Mr. J. Strange



     8.1        Apologies for Absence from Previous Meeting
                         Mr                     apologised for not being represented at the
                last site meeting.


     8.2       Previous Minutes
                         The minutes of meetings Nos 6 and 7 held on 11 September
               and 25 September respectively were accepted as a true record
               of the procefedings.


     8.3       Progress
                (a)      New exit at East end of South Stand open seating
                         It was agreed that 40 x 40 x 6 angles be welded between
               the vertical posts, on Spion Kop side, and mesh placed between
               these angles.                       This was to prevent spectators climbing onto

        the top of the existing mesh and over the fence.
               Mr.       agreed to properly secure, by bolting and
        tack welding, the existing corrugated sheeting which had
        become loose whilst altering the fence.
        (b)    New Emergency Exits at the bottom of Spion Kop
               These were now complete.    Dr. Eastwood reported that
        cracks were visible in the horizontal Reebafill rendering.
        The defective rendering was to be broken out and replaced
        with new.
        (c)    North Stand Barriers
               Mr.       said that one complete barrier would be
        delivered on Wednesday 10 October so that holes could be
        marked out ready for drilling.       The holes would be drilled
        during Thursday and Friday 11 and 12 October.         The cleats
        and base plates would be delivered separately.         All barriers
        would be on site by Friday evening 12 October and be fixed,
        including all welding by the end of Tuesday 16 October.
         (d)   New Escapes from West Stand
               Mr.       agreed to place the additional sheet of mesh
        on the gate at the North exit.       It was requested that holes
        be drilled in the chequered plate at the South exit to
        prevent water ponding on the landing and a cabin hook and eye
        be added     to secure the open gate.
        (e)    New   Gate from South side of Spion Kop
               Angles had been welded to the door head beam and the
        barbed wire fixed between these angles and back to the
        existing curved steel brackets.         The angles only required
        painting to complete      this section.
        (f)    Alterations to gates at bottom of West end Terrace
               No further work had been done to the gates since the
        last meeting.     One frame leg required welding and the centre
        gate was still binding at the head.
        (g)    Remedial Work   to Areas of Damaged Terracing
               Mr.   Malthouse confirmed that this work was now complete.
                                                                    SHEET     3.

         (h)   Repairs to Concrete Members in South Stand
               Approximately 80% of this work was complete.      Several
        lengths of badly spalled concrete had been discovered along
        the beam at the rear of the seated area.        Mr. Strange, after
        inspection, agreed that these areas be added to the repair
        schedule.     Mr.            said that he expected all the repair
        work to be complete within two weeks, including that on the
        outside of the stand.
         (j)   Alterations and Strengthening Staircases in South Stand
               No steelwork had been delivered by Peter Ward Engineering.
        Mr.         agreed to deliver the steel for the centre handrails
        on Wednesday 10 October with the vertical U.B. sections for
        supporting the walls being delivered on Thursday 11 October.
        Holes for the fixing plates     vd   uld be drilled during Thursday
        and Friday 11 and 12 October.        Dr. Eastwood insisted that all
        materials for the staircases be on site by the morning of
        Monday 15 October.
               It was agreed that handrail posts could not be fixed
        and left without the rails.      The handrails had to be complete
        before Saturday 21 October with the remainder of the work, with
        the possible exception of the painting, being complete by
        Friday 26 October.
               Mr. Strange agreed that the handrail "brackets could be
        turned at right angles to simplify fixing to the walls.         He
        said that the handrails need not be cranked round the projecting
        columns and could be stopped on either side of the existing
        ducting.
        (k)    Spion Kop Staircase
               The two bottom flights and one landing had been cast.         One
        further landing and part of the third flight had been excavated.
               An inspection of the staircase had been made before the
        meeting.    Dr. Eastwood confirmed that the second landing should
        be reduced from 4800 mm by 550 mm and the upstand at the back
        of the landing made 215 mm wide to carry a brickwork retaining
                                                                  SHEET     4 .

         wall.
                 Polyethylene sheet was to be placed over all exposed
         red shale on which concrete was to be cast.
                 Mr. Strange said that to match the levels of the ramp
         at the bottom of the staircase an extra step had been found
         to be necessary together with the possibility of a triangular
         shaped landing.     Sufficient concrete had already been broken
         out from the ramp to accommodate this extra step and landing.


   8.4   Labour Returns
                 Mr.           handed to Mr. Strange the labour returns
         for the previous two weeks.     They showed that over the period
         the labour strength had averaged thirteen, with Peter Ward
         Engineering being present on 6^ days with two men.


   8.5   Information required by the Contractor
                 Mr .          confirmed that there was no outstanding
         information required critical to the progress of the works.


   8.6   Next Meeting
                 The next site meeting will be held on Tuesday 23 October
         at 10.00.

Dear Sirs,
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
                     Phase 11 Contract
     We write to confirm the instructions given to you on
Tuesday 9 October, after the site meeting and during yesterdays
telephone conversation with John Strange.

South Stand
     (a) Please remove sufficient lengths of timber floor boarding
          at the front of the stand, adjacent to the front parapet
          wall to allow inspection of the main stanchions supporting
          the roof structure.
          If the steelwork is found to be corroded plates may have
          to be welded over the flanges and webs and the bases
          protected by erasing in concrete. Further instructions
          for these operations will follow after the inspection.
     (b) Please remove to tip, unless the Employer wishes to keep ,
          them, the timber partitions in the upper seated area. Do
          not remove the partitioning around the directors box.
     (c) Please repair the first joint from the West end, in the
          timber handrail/barrier rail over the frcmt parapet wall.
          This detail is shown on orr A4 size drawing 1610/51.
     (d) Please repair the reinforced concrete stub columns built
          into the front parapet wall. Use Nitomortar for these
          repairs. The columns to be repaired      numbers 1,4,6,7
           8,14,15,18,19,2 3 and 24 counting from the West end.
     (e)   Please clean out all the debris lodged beneath the
           timber boarding of the upper seated area. This will
           Involve removing and replacing various lengths of
           decking boards to allow inspection and access. It
           is likely that most of the rubbish has accumulated
           towards the front of the stand in which cast it can be
           removed whilst the boards adjacent to the front
           parapet wall a»e lifted to carry out the Inspection
           mentioned previously in (a).
     (f)   Please cut rebates in the treads and landings for the
           base plates on the two main staircases shown on our
           drawing 1610/37. The rebates should be made just deep
           enough to accommodate the holding down bolts. The
           plates are then to be covered over with Reetiafill mortar
           to give an even and smooth finish to the steps around
           the posts. The tops of the holding down bolts are not
           to project above the finished level of the steps.
     (g)   Refering to our drawing 1610/38 please omit the 25 mm
           thick non-shrink grout shown beneath the base plates of
           the vertical p&sts restraining the brickwork parapet walls
           on the staircases. These plates are to be bolted directly
           to the existing slab. If the slab is uneven, spread a
           thin layer of sand/cement grout beneath the base plate
           before tightening up the holding down bolts.

Spion K6p and Leppings lane. Perimeter Fence
      (f) Please supply and fix short steel angle supports between
          the existing bottom horizontal angle of the fence and the
          perimeter wall as shown, on cur A4 size drawing 1610/53.
     .(h) Please supply and fix new horizontal members betweenfche
          existing ' supporting frames      of the fence as shown on
           our A4 size drawing 1610/54.
    (j)   Please repair the reinforced precast concrete fence post
          between spans 33-34 of the pitch perimeter fence on
          Spion Kop. Use Nitomortar for this repair.

          Enclosed are two copies of our A4 drawings 1610/51, 52,
          53 and 54.

Dear Sir,
               Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
     Mr. England has passed to me a copy of your letter of
 11 October.   He will no doubt be confirming to you that
Monday, 12 November, is a convenient date for the meeting.
     In the second paragraph of your letter you comment on
three matters which you believe to be still outstanding.
It is, of course, correct to say that the appropriateness
of the corrugated sheeting at the back of the North West
terrace was raised at one of the early meetings.    We have
since made an inspection and believe that the sheeting
and the frame to which it is attached are an appropriate way
of closing off the back of the terrace.    I have spoken to
Mr. Sheriff of the Building Surveyors Department and he is
going to have a look.
    I have also queried with him the suggestion that a test load
should be applied to the reinforced concrete slab firming
access to the new escape stair of the West stand.   I am a
little puzzled by this suggestion since calculations were
submitted showing that the reinforced concrete is in accordance
with the British Standard Code of Practice.   Mr. Sheriff
is to discuss this matter further with the District Building
Surveyor.
       The bases of the steel columns supporting the South
stand roof are being inspected this week.      The District
Building Surveyor is to take part in the inspection.
The remedial work which is found to be necessary will be
carried out by Hallarashire Builders and their sub-contractors
over the next ten days or so.


                                  Yours faithfully,

       Dear Sir,

       Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

       I thank you for your letter of 14th September, and note what you say.

       With regard to the ’’outside work”, I understand that the corrugated sheeting at
       the rear of the North-West Terrace has yet to be replaced. I also understand
       that the investigation of, and any necessary repairs to, the steel columns supporting
       the front of the South Stand has yet to take place. Finally, I understand that it was
       suggested to your Consultants that a test load might be advisable to that portion of
       reinforced concrete slab forming access to the new escape stair construction of the
       West Stand, with particular observation of the junction of existing and new work.
       So far as the Building Authority and myself are aware, the latter also has not been
       done.

      With regard to a date in November for the proposed meeting to discuss any outstanding
      points, I am now able to say that Monday the 12th would be the most convenient date
      to the Working Party. Subject to your agreement, I would suggest 10,30 a.m. for the
      meeting and obviously it would be most advantageous to have the meeting at
      Hillsborough so that any contentious points can be quickly checked and cleared.


                                                         Yours faithfully,




                                                          Chief Executive

Dear Eric,
    Before replying to the letter from South Yorkshire
concerning the outstanding work I have had another look
at the corrugated sheeting at the North West corner.
I see no reason to change my view that it is quite adequate
although we may find ourselves having to put in a few
drive screws to improve the attachment of the sheet to the
steel frame in order to avoid a direct confrontation.
    I have also spoken to Don Sheriff and have suggested
that he have another look at the sheeting and if he
still believes that some work is needed, I will meet him
on site.
    The statement in Mr, Mallett's letter that it had been
suggested to us that a test load might be applied to the
new concrete slab forming access to the escape stair of
the West stand is not, in fact, correct.   We have
certainly never contemplated a test load because we submitted
calculations showing that the reinforcement which was
discovered when the balustrade was broken out was quite
adequate provided we thickened the concrete cantilever.
This was in fact done and our calculations were approved by
the Building Surveyors Department.   Mr.         tells me that
it was the District Building Surveyor, Mr.        who suggested
a test load.   I have explained that it would cost several
hundred pounds and that I see no purpose In the exercise.
He has promised to discuss the matter further with
Mr.       [and I trust that we shall hear no more of it.
    I enclose a copy of mv letter to Mr. Mallett in which
you will see that I have kept the tone of my letter as soft
as possible compatible with getting the message over.

                               Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr. C. V. Titterton



Dear Mr|_________ |,
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
     Following recent telephone conversations with John Strange
we write to confirm the following:
      1) Please omit the panic latch on doors W8a, W10, W12, W15
          and W17. Please supply and fix handles and lock to each
          door in place of the latches.
     2) Where possible, please re-use the existing handles and
          locks. If the existing furniture cannot be re-used
         because it does not work, or is generally unfit or
          unsuitable please supply new handles and/or locks. The
         new locks should be suitable for master keying or be
         suited, for example all cushion store doors.
               The sub-station door in the North Stand may be fitted
         with the existing cylinder lock.
     3) Self colour, steel, double flap butt hinges may be used
         instead of the stainless steel pattern specified.
     4) The emergency exit signs should read 'EXIT* 7" x 19"
         with green letters on a white background.
     5) Please form openings for fans (to be supplied and fixed by
         others) in walls W5, W10, W12, W16 and W7 as shown on our
         A4 drawing 1610/50.
     6) Please omit the fire fighting equipment, items 1, 2 and 3
         page 55. We understand that the cost of these appliances
         is r — ---
     We accept that there may be a small charge for re-stocking
the items of door furniture not ixaed and returned to the supplier.
     Since your last telephone conversation, yesterday, we have
been requested by S.Y.C.C. to provide two vertical arrow signs

supply and fix these. They should be the same depth as the EXIT
sign with a green arrov on a white background.

For the attention of Mr.


Dear Mr.           ,
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
     As discussed in your telephone conversation with John Strange
yesterday the Employer wishes to hang wallcovering in the lounges
and bar in the South Stand.
     We will accept your offer to take pattern books to
Mri England. The wallcovering will have to be of the 'Vymura*
type to give a class 1 rating for surface spread of flame.
     We have also suggested that ’Fortaflek' or *Prodorglaze' is
applied to the walls, facing the corridors, up to the tops of the
lower glazed partitions. The remainder of the walls above this
level will be eaulsioned.
     Coloir charts for these products are expected from the
manufactures within the next two days.
                               Yours sincerely,




b.c.c. Eric England - S.W.F.C.

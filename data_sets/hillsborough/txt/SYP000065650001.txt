                On    page\four         of    that        statement    I refer r e d        to an     incident whe n        I was

                                                                                     ^ d ^ A iy my rib c a g e , but with

                the     people        crowded a r o u n d me and w i t h so m u c h going                   on,    I was    not

               aware          of who    had a c t u a l l y    done    it.

                I also made            re f e r e n c e   to a comment w h i c h           I b e l ieved    I had heard        in

                re l ation to some b o d i e s              daughter.

                I would         like    to    clarify        that   comment      by saying          that    I cannot       be sure

               at all          if the      reference         was made      to my daughter             or his      daughter,

                I have         given the matter              some   thought and            I w ould    like to say that               I do

             particular        incident.

             It is not the          first        time    I have    been a s s u a l t e d    in the   course   of my

             job.      I understand         the     reasons,       even    if I d o n ’t agree w ith        them,   and

             in this        case   I feel        that,    that    should be the end of the matter.

             In a n y event        the asrs^ault as         such did not         prevent me from         continuing my

             work.      I only went          to hctepi tal        because     I was     told to an d     I only

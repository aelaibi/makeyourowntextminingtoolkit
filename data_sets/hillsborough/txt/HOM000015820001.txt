                     METROPOLITAN POLICE CHARGES FOR FOOTBALL MATCHES

                       This is to follow up my telephone call to your private secretary
                   ^ ^ t h i s lunchtime about your letter of 28 July.

                     I entirely agree with you in your support for the Metropolitan
                     Police's attempt to recover the full costs of policing football
                     matches inside grounds.                    I see no j u s t i f i c a t i o n for c h a r g i n g
                     a n y t h i n g less and I t h i n k that the m o v e w o u l d be w e l c o m e d
                     strongly by our Parliamentary colleagues with Football League
                     g r o u n d s in t h e i r c o n s t i t u e n c i e s . The f o o t b a l l c l u b s wi l l no
                     doubt make a fuss but I would be inclined to have the argument
                     over and done with straightaway, rather than spreading it over
                     two stages.          In other words, my advice would be to go for the
                     full increase in charges implied by (i), (i i ) and (iii) in the
                     second paragraph of your letter, from the start of the 1989/90
                     season.

                     If the increases were to be phased, as the Met have suggested -
                     for reasons which I understand - we would find ourselves facing a
                     second round of controversy in August next year, at a time when
                     the clubs will be complaining vociferously about the costs of the
                     Government-imposed membership scheme and about the implications
                     of s a f e t y m e a s u r e s f l o w i n g from Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r ' s final
                     report .      In my view, it w o u l d be b e t t e r to deal w i t h p olice
                     charges in one fell swoop now, and I think that you would find
                     that the public was generally sympathetic.

                     Whatever you decide on this aspect of the policy, I agree that it
                     w o u l d be as w el l for any a n n o u n c e m e n t to be m a d e as e a r l y as
                     possible this week, in advance of the publication of Lord Justice
                     T a y l o r ' s i n t e r i m report.  I also s u g g e s t e d to you r p r i v a t e
                     secretary         that       you might wish   to write        to  the MPs whose
                     constituencies include the clubs affected, at the same time as
                     any announcement, to explain what was happening.

                                                                          1,




                                                                       COLIN MOYNIHAN

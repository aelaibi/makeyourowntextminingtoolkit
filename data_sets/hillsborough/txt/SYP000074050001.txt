             I am       a   Chief        Inspector           in    the     South       Yorkshire          Police       and    work    at    Force

             Headquarters,                Sheffield.               From      time      to    time       I attend      a     football       match

             as    a    spectator.                I had      few     committments             during       the     weekend         15-16    April

             and       so   obtained          a    ticket         for    the     F .A . C u p     Semi     Final      game     between

             Liverpool           and      N o t t i n g h a m /forest.

            My     ticket        was      for      seat      IMN28      :i.n a   South      S t a n d ^u n c o v e r e d    enclosure.

             relatively               close       to   the    Leppings           Lane       enclosure        on    the      13th    row    from

The    day       was        fine       and       sunny,        I    left,    the     city         centre       about       1.20pm             (1320)

in    my    car        to    travel          to     the       ground.           I drove           from    Bridge          Street

out    of       the       city     via       West        Bar,       Gibraltar           Street          and    Langsett             Road.           I

had    allowed              for    heavy           traffic          but     was    surprised             that       there          was    very

little          problem           until          the     usual       bottleneck              at    Hillsborough                corner-

traffic          lights.               I travelled                 through        the       junction          towards          Hillsborough

Football             S t a d i urn.         T h e re     w e re     no    hi n d e r a n e e s     as    I travel led               down

Leppings             Lane        onto       Penistone              Road     and    left          into    C l a y w h e e 1s Lane.




I parked             my     car    i n I C l a y w h e e 1s L a n e          and     walked         towards          Hillsborough

Stadiurn.             The        time       would        be    about        1.45pm          (1345).




Many       people           were       milling           around,          but     there          were    no    large       crowds             as    I

made       my    way        to    the       Penistone              Road     roundabout             and    along          Leppings             Lane.

All    the       way        along       my       journey           I was      continually               asked       for    'spars’

tickets          and        ’s w a p s 8 b y        young          male     Liverpool             supporters.              I       politely-

answered             the     first          few     taut      the    number        of       enquiries          became          so

overwhelming                 that       I simpply              walked         past      or       shook    my     head.




My    ticket          was        green        in    colour          and     showed          admission          by    a    South          Stand

gangway          closest           to       the     South          West     corner          of    the    stadium.              I    consulted

the    schematic                 map    on       the     rear       and     the    natural          route       appeared             to       be    via

Leppings             Lane        and    a    service           road       which      leads         to    the    South         Stand.               The

ticket          bore        no    mention           of     colour         coding        -    I assumed          until         a     long       time

after       the       event        that          ALL     tickets          were     green.




I saw       no       reference              to     colour          coded     direction             boards.           Furthermore,                   I

reached          the        South       Stand          service           road     and       found       the    way       barred          by    a

 awful     lot       of    supporters              were      invited       to    walk        round        the      block          and     enter

 the    South        Stand       from          Penistone          Road.        The    point        of     relating               this     is    to

I
  ti me was 1. 5 4 p m (1354). The ground was very sparsel

 There     was       however          a    quite      densely        packed          area     in             two
                                                                                                      t h e /two        centre

 I   bought         and    read       a    match      programme           as    I waited           for       the       game       to

 begin.         I    remember             at    one   stage,        looking          across        to     the      West          Stand

 terraces           and    seeing          the     supporters            patting       a    multi-coloured                       beachball

 around        the    centre          enclosure.              The    significance                of     this       is    that          the

 crowd     were       not    so       tightly         packed        as    they       were     able          to    raise          their       arms

 and     bounce       the    ball          around.




 The     two    teams       came          onto     the      pi tch for a        warm-up           session.               I        d o n ’t

 remember           the    time       precisely             but     remember          that       it w a s     early,             perhaps        2.

 ,30pm    or    2.35pm       (1430-1435).                   When     the t ea ms        left        the       pitch          I   remember

 that     the       ground       seemed          more       full.




 About     2.45prn         (1443)          I    c a n ’t    remember       precisely,              I saw          several          fans

 from     the       centre       anclosures                scaling       the    wall       and     climbing             into       t he

 seating        enclosure.                 I    interpreted          this       as    mischievous                 rather          than

 arising        because          of       overcrowding.              I saw       about       four        or       five       police

 officers,           one    an    Inspector                standing       in    the    aisles           of       the    seating

 enclosure           close       by       the    front       of    the    stand.           I was        not       surprised             to     see
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      SI 8 3 1

 the      officers             move    to    prevent          this          activity          and    thought          it    proper          that

 officers            should       eject          those       who       had    managed          to      climb        into    the       stand.

He       escorted          the    young          man    up    the       aisle       and       out    of    the       stand.

The       climbing             from    the       standing          to       the    seating          area       ceased,       apart          from

a       very    occasional             person,.




 There         appeared          to    be    sufficient                officers          on    the       perimeter          track          around

 the      ground.




 The      two       teams       returned          to    the       pitch       at    about          S.55pm       ( 1 4 5 5 ) and        I

 considered               it    unlikely          that       the       game       would       be    able       to    start       at   3.00prn

 (1500)         however,          the       preliminaries                   were    curtailed             and       the    teams       were      in

 position            to    kick       off    around          that       time       or    a    minute       afterwards.                 The

 crowd         in    the       South    Stand          were       all       standing.              I sat       down       before       many

 around         me       and    thereby          did    not       see       the    k i ck     of f .      As    people       began          to

 sit      down       there       was    a    cheer       from          the    crowd          and    my    attention          was       drawn

 to      the    ’players          tunnel5.              I guessed             that       the       Nottingham             Forest       Manager

 was      taking          his    seat       but    could          not       see    the       subject       of       this    interest.




 I saw         very       little       football          played             because,          seconds          afterwards,             my
    i
 sft t e n t i o n       was    drawn       to    fans       being          allowed          out    of    the       Leppings          Lane

 enclosure               and    onto    the       pitch.           I    immediately                assumed          that    the       centre

/closure            had    become       overcrowded                and       that       the    Police          there       were
\
jtr a n s f e r r i n g        fans    to    another          enclosure.                 I became          concerned             when       I saw

 that      the       fans       were    just       sitting             on    the    pitch          and    were       not    moving

 towards            o/ther      enclosures.              Other          fans       were       scaling          the    perimeter

 fencing            And d r o p p i n g      onto       the       perimeter             track.




Members             of    the    public          around       me       who    were       less       than       100    yards       from       the

 incident            interpreted             this      as     a    pitch          invasion          and    there          were    many
     calls       for    strong       police          action    to     get      the     fans         bac k , - i n t o       the

     enclosures.              The    man       sitting       beside       me    suggested/putting                           police       dogs

     into       the    enclosure.              Because       the    police        offi ce/s             were       not       just

     allowing          but    assisting          the    fans       over     the^fen/e               and     out        of    the

     emergency          gates,       I realised             that    this       was     not      a     pitch        invasion             and     was

     definitely          a    matter       for       concern.




     I    recall       that    the       football       players        and      officials               continued             the       game

     for    an    inordinate             period       after     I had       realised            the       need         for    the       game     to

     be    halted.           Fans    were       actually       sitting          on     the      pitch.             The       football

     match       was    not    helping          the    officers        attempts            to       deal      with          the    situation

     because          there    were       cheers       and    surges        and      the     attention                 was    drawn           away

     from       the    matter       at    hand.



                            H III*"
     I saw       Superintendent Murray                      come    from       the     d i r ector)         of     the       Police

     control          room    and    go    to    the    perimeter           track.           He       went        to    the       area

CM   behind       Leppings          Lana       goal    and    then     walked          very         quickly,            almost          ran,     to

     the    linesman          in    front       of    the    South     Stand.           He      clearly            wanted          the        game

     to    be    stopped.           I would          have    thought        the      linesman             could         not       have

     .misinterpreted               Superintendent             H u r r a y ’s    intentions                and      yet       he    simply

     ran    away       from    him       keeping       up    with     the      play     on      the       pitch.




     My    attention          was    now       totally       fixed     on      the     Leppings             Lqfne       end       of    the

     the    playing          area    and       ensured       that     the      match       was        stopped.

     gates       at    the    front       of    the    enclosure          or    by     climbing             over        the       fencj/fig a

     this       point.        The    first       indication           I had       of    the         e ;<t e n t    of       the    problem

     was    when       two    young       C o n s t a b l e s , one    was      Police          CottstabTe^aij^n                       ’F ’

below       where           I was          sitting          and       began       to       give       mouth          to    mouth

resuscitation                    to       the       boy.        They       worked          with       a    member          of    the    p u b l i c to

resuscitate                 the       boy       for    some       time          and       appeared             to    have       been    successful

as    the    crowd           which             had    gathered             round          turned          towards          the    stand        and

cheered.




1t seemed           to       be       a    long       time       until          the       single          St    J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e

appeared           on       the       playing          area.           The       scene          was       becoming          more       and     more

chaotic       although                    there       were       more          than       enough          police          officers        who       were

•io i n g   everything                    they       possibly          could          to       deal       with       the    situation.




f. t h o u g h t    that,             as       there       were       so       many       police          officers          on    the     pitch

there       may     be       a       lack       of    control          around             the       back       of    the    stand       so,        at

about       3.25        -    3.30pm             (1525-1530)                I    left       the       stand          and    went    to     a    poi/nt

at    the    South           West          corner, immediately                            behind          the       Police       Co nt ro_l/Cower.

There       were        other             police       officers                there,          none       of    whom       had    radios.               I

imagined           that          all       the       injured          would       have          been       brought          onto       th e    pitch

and    would        be       evacuated                at    this       point.              It       being       the       nearest       access

point       for     ambulances,                      1 therefore                looked          towards             making       the    casualty

station.            There             was       a    Police       Landrover                parked          in       just    the    spot        where             I

considered              the          ambulances             may       park       and       1 wasted             an    awful       lot     of       time

getting       the           Landrover                moved-       there          were          no    keys       in    the       vehicle.




At    this    time,              a    middle          aged       man       with       a    stewards             tabard^rolled                 up    in

his    Jacket           pocket walked                      up    to    the       young          steward             who    was    wearing           his

tabard       and        dutifully                   manning       the       gate          at    this       point.           The    older           man

said,       "Gi,        get          that       jacket          off,       some       supporters                just       beat    a    couple              of

our    lads        up w h e n             they       found       out       they       were          stewards".
When    I next          looked          around       there          were       two       casualties             at       this       point.

One    male       about       6    feet       tall       and       heavily          built,             28-30    years,             laying        on       a

metal     stretcher.               He    was       obviously             dead.           I helped             a Policewoman                and        a

member       of ftt J o h n ' s          Ambulance             in    the i r a t t e m p t s             to    revive          him       but     was

^struck      at    that       time       by    the       futility           of      the       operation.                 The       other

casualty          was       very    much       alive,,         holding           his      arm.           An    ambulance                arrived

and    after       attempting             resuscitation                   for       a    few       seconds          on    the       deceased

man    the       ambulance          crew       suggested             putting             him       in    the    ambulance, I

helped       them       to    do    that       and       then       told       the       group          of 4 - 5 p o l i c e

constables          at       this       point       that       I    wanted           one       of      them    to a c c o m p a n y        the

body.        A    young       nia 1 e    c o n s t a b le      who       spoke          with       a    Merseyside             accent,           but

who    I'm       sure       was    wearing          the       uniform          of- S o u t h           Yorkshire          Police          s a id,         ”

I'll    go,       I know          his    family".              1 was        amazed            at       this    comment             but    had     not

time    to       follow       it    up.




The    other       slightly             injured          man       got     into         the    same       ambulance                and    t he

ambulance          left.           There       was       nothing          to     do      at    this       point          so    I    instructed

the    Police       Constables                to    keep       the       area       clear          for    ambulances                and    walked

along     the      service          road       towards             Leppings             Lane       t o ensure            unrestricted

access       for    the       ernergency            services             w h i ch       I expected             to    arrive.




As    I turned          a    corner       of       the    service           road         walking          towards             Leppinos           Lane

I was     met      by       the    full       tragedy          of    the       situation.                 There          were       a    row     of

ambulances          at       this       point       beside          the     perimeter                  wall    of    the       stadium,

numerous          people          were    receiving                medical          attention.                 But       at    least       ten

male    bodies          were       laid       ouff in a t t e m p t e d             recovery             position             along       the

fence     beside            the    river       and       no    one       was     paying            them       any attention

whatsoever,             they       were       obviously             dead.           Their           skin had a           mottled           blue

pallor       and    their          limbs       were       completely                limp.

                                                                                                                               :                 PAGE
                                                                                                                                                 S I 831

There      were       literally                dozens,,            if       not    a    hundred             or    moi/e,         Police       Officers

at    this    point            under          control          of fC h i e f           Inspector                Pur/by .         I was      in

civilian         clothes             without          a    radio             and       felt       completely                help!ess          in

this    situation.                   I    continued                to       the    end       of       the       service          road    and

there      encouraged                several          supporters                   who       were          trying       to       walk    down         the

Service       road         that          they    could             not       do    so       until          the    emergency             services

had    departed,                I arranged a                   group          of       Police          Officers             who    were       not

engaged       with         anything,             into          a    cordon             across          the       mouth       of    the      junction.




I now      found          myself          outside          the          cordon          and       had       felt       of    little         use

inside,       I decided                  to    leave       the          stadium             to    telephone             my       wife    to

reassure         her       that          I was       uninjured.                    The       telephones                in L e p p i n g s        Lane

were,      not     unexpectedly                  full          and          had    queues             of    people          outside.             As    I

walked       along         Leppings             Lane       there             were       groups             of    Liverpool             supporters

standing         around             and       they    appeared                very          aggressive.                 A    Police         car       was

driving       up      and       down          Leppings             Lane,          asking          via       the       P.A.       system,         for

fans    to    clear            the       way    for       ambulances.                       I saw          more       than       one    supporter

kick    out      at       the       slowly       patrolling                   car.           I    returned             to    my    car      parked             at

the    junction            of       Claywheels             Lane             with       Niagara             Road.        I decided             that         I

would      drive          to    Hammerton             R o a dj          telephone                my    wife       from       there       and       assist

in a n y     way      I    could          at    the       Police             Station.                 I arrived             at    the    Police

Station       to      find          it    much       calmer             and       well       staffed             than       I had       -

anticipated.                   I telephoned                home.              After          a    short          time       the    talk       was      of

relatives          and         friends          being          received                at    Hammerton                Road.        I decided

that    this       was         an    area       in    which             I    could          offer          useful       assistance.




Together         with          other          officers,             notably             Detective                Chief       Inspector             Agar

I helped         to       transform             the       ' n e w 1 ,CID           Office             at    Hammerton             Road      into       a

relative         reception                area.           In       the       early          evening             friends          and    relatives

began      arriving             at       Hammerton             Road,          I don't             know          how    they       had    got       there
or    who          had    decided           upon       Hammerton                Road       as    the          poSTnt    of       reception.              It

quickly             became        apparent             that          we    would       need          a    larger        area       for       them    to

gather             and    wait.            The    Hillsborough                   Boys       Club          Ha/1       was     suggested,             the

keyholder                was    known           and    so       it    was       arranged.                 All    the       S o c i ^ l / W o r k e r/

H e l p e rs        gathered           there          and       received             the    friends             and     relatives             of

supporters                when        we    had       obtained             a    formal          report          about        a    missing          friend

or    relation.




The       system          worked           as    follows;                 Somehow          (?)       people          who     had       lost    contact

with          friends/relatives                       at    the       time       of    the       incident              were       directed          to

Hammerton                Road     Police          Station.                 The       team       of       officers          working           with    me

would          complete           a    li.F.H         report          and       we    would          then       pass       the     person          making

the       report          over        to    the       Social          Workers          at       the       Boys       Club.




During             the    course           of    the       evening/night                   our       growing           list       of    'missing’

persons             was      checked            with       lists          of    casualties                at    hospital           and       with

lists          of       arrested           persons.              About          1.Q O a m       ( 0 1Q Q ) t h e        stream          of    friends/

the       makeshift,            mortuary,              I    c losed            our    operation                down.




The       final          duty     was       to    drive          to       the    mortuary                and    check        the       M.F.H.

reports             against           the       list       of    deceased.                 I handed             all     documents             to

Detective                I n s p e c t o K ^ C h a r 1 es        who       was       working             at    the     mortuary          and       who

said          he    would       be     working             the       following             day.           I    left     duty       at    4.00am

As    a       postscript              to    this       report             about       the       incident,              I am       reminded          of    an

earlier             visit       to     Hillsborough                   Football             Stadium             in m y      youth        when       there

was       a    very       1a r g e     crowd.

                    The       match          was    a       First       Division             League          game       b e t w e e n 'Sheffield               Wednesday

            .       and       Manchester                City.           It       was    the       last       game       of    the       season          and    Sheffield

                    Wednesday                needed          to    win       the       game       to    remain          in    the       First       Division.                 It

                    would          be    about          1971.


     n
    lOJ^t       •   It       was    an       all    ticket             evening          game       and       my    ticket          was       for    Leppings             Lane.

                    I a r r iv e d           with       a    f r iend        in    good       time          and    took       up    my       position          on    the

                    t e r ra c i ng          behind          the       goal       b u t , b e f o re         the       start       of    the       g a m e , t he
i


                    terraces             had       become          so       full       that       not       only       was    I unable             to    see    much          of

                    the       pitch),         but       it       was    a    very       uncomfortable                   situation.                 There       was       no

                    room       to       move       and       I    remember,             at    one       time,          being       squashed             against          a

                    barrier             to    such          an    extent          that       I was          exerting          all       my    energies          to

                    prevent             injury          and       quickly          became          totally             unconcerned             about          the    game.

                    I dreaded                any    goals          or       near       misses          as    this       was    followed             by    a    surge          of

                    people          which          caused          me       to    be    squashed             painfully             against          the       barrier.




                    By       half       time       I had          seen       very       little          football             and    was       thoroughly             fed       up

                    with       the       situation.                    Half       time       was       the       first       opportunity                I had       to       move

                    my       position          and          after       fighting             my    way       through          the       crowd       I found          a       more

                    comfortable                position                at    the       front       of       the    south       west          corner       of    the

                    Leppings             Lane       terracing.                    I had       been          in    very       large       football             grounds

                    before          and       since          but       had       never       experienced                anything             quite       like       th e

                    pressure             that       was          created          in    this       crowd          at    Hillsborough.

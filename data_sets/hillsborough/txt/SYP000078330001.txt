About       2.45pm       (1445)     t h at      day,    about        eight       Liverpool              supporters               came           up

to    g a t e 2 a n d a s k e d me         to    escort       them        up    to    the        raised         section.               I

contacted          Inspector        DARLING,           who went           to    seek       advice          as     to w h a t       to do

with     these      supporters.                The Liverpool              supporters              could         not     get      up        to

the    raised       section       due      to N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t         supporters                blocking           their

way.




At 2 . 4 7 p m ,    (1447)       Inspector           DARLING         returned and                 t o l d me       to    escort

these       supporters          across         the   front      of    the K o p           in f r o n t       of    the

Nottingham          supporters            and    into    the     raised          section.               I pointed             out          to

Inspector          DARLING       t h at    this      would      be d a n g e r o u s         to m y s e l f        and     the

Liverpool          supporters.             However,          Inspector           DARLING            insisted            t h at     I

escort       the L i v e r pool       supporters             in f r o n t       of    the        Forest         fans;      and         not

across       the    perimeter         track,         some     20 yards,              to    the      safety         of    gate          ’0*.

Fortunately Police                Constable            HOLMES accompanied                        me w i t h       the L i v e r p o o l

raised       section.           I then accompanied                   the L i v e r p o o l          f an s      from     the       rear

into     the    raised      section.

              myself engaged in carrying the deceased I now know to be Qg>in W A F E R ,

              body 13.      I carried this person from the Leppings Lane end of the

              pitch to the Spion Kop end.                   However,     as I reached the corner between

              the Spion Kop and the North Stand I lost grip of the hoarding and was

              knocked out of the way.              The o ther fans           carrying the h o a r d i n g carried

              on with the person to the gap between the Spion Kop a n o N o r t h Stand.

              I had no further dealings with any other                            people that died.

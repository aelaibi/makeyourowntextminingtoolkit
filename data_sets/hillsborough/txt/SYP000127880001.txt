VIDEO RECORDING OF HILLSBOROUGH GROUND AND ITS APPROACHES.
PLEASE WILL YOU ARRANGE FOR DETECTIVE CHIEF INSPECTOR LANCASTER TO MAKE
CONTACT WITH CHIEF INSPECTOR COCKER AT THE WEST MIDLANDS POLICE AIR UNIT WITH
VIEW TO ARRANGING AN EARLY MORNING FLIGHT TO SHEFFIELD FOR THE PURPOSES OF
FILMING THE GROUND AND ITS APPROACHES FROM THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF
LIVERPOOL.  YORKSHIRE TELEVISION, WHO ARE CURRENTLY MAKING A DOCUMENTARY WITH
US ARE HAPPY TO UNDERTAKE THE VIDEO FILMING FOR US AND THE CHIEF CONSTABLE IS
QUITE HAPPY FOR THEM TO BECOME INVOLVED.
HOM&VER, I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE IS A GREAT DANGER THAT THE TV COMPANY COULD
FIWreH UP TAKING OVER THE OPERATION, SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT DETECTIVE CHIEF
INSPECTOR LANCASTER SHOULD LEARN HIS SCRIPT TO LIAISE WITH YORKSHIRE TV, AND
THEN WITH MR COCKER WITH A VIEW TO MINIMISING THE TIME TAKEN.  THE PARTICULAR
CONCERN IS THAT THE FORCE WILL BE DENIED THE USE OF THE HELICOPETER DURING
THE TIME THIS OPERATION IS BEING PURSUED.  IT SEEMS APPROPRIATE, THEREFORE,
GIVEN THE EARLY MORNING LIGHT, FOR FILMING TO TAKE PLACE EARLY SO THAT THE
HELICOPTER CAN BE BACK IN FORCE AREA BY MID-MORNING AT THE LATEST.  PLEASE
KEEP MY APPRAISED OF THE DEVELOPMENTS ON THIS PROJECT.

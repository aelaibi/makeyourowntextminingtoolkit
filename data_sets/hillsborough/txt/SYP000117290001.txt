c/s.
             My duty at the Sheffield Wednesday re Football          around*   began at
       a     9,00am on the Saturday 15 April 1989.        I was on serial 1, the duty

             being to police the perimeter track surrounding the pitch.             My
             position on the track was in front of the South Stand approximately

             10 yards from Gate 1 at the Spion Kop.        After briefing etc I

             commenced duty at that position at about 11.45am,          and spectators

             began entering the ground at about noon.           I distinctly remember that

             the Spion Kop and South Stand, both to house Nottingham Forest

             supporters,   were being filled a lot quicker than the stands for the

             Liverpool   spectators.      Even at around 2.20pm to 2.30pm,     there were

             still relatively few Liverpool       fans in the ground compared to the

             opposite side of the ground, which was virtually full with Forest

             fans.   However,    as is usual,   the section at the Leppings Lane end

             immediately behind the goal was virtually full this time - In the

             six years I have been working football matches at Hillsborough I

             would say that this has always been the most favourite position for
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         R90

the fans occupying those terraces.         There was still plenty of room

in the sections at either side of this central pen,          and also in the

raised section between the Leppings Lane terraces and the North

Stand, which is usually left "sterile” .



At about 2.30pm,    I was directed by Sergeant Chapman to patrol the

part of the track immediately in front of the West Stand and

Leppings Lane Terraces      in order to relieve officers at the end who

were to meal.     The terraces were continually "filling up" with

fans.   A lot of people appeared to be still trying to enter the

terraces via the t u n n e l , because there were a lot of people

climbing over the partition fencing into the winged terracing,

which still had a lot of room.       I can remember that children and

teenagers wre in the main      occupying the     front positioning behind

the goals.    At this time,    the Liverpool     supporters within the

ground were in good h u m o u r .



At about 2.55pm,    just prior to the teams entering on to the pitch,

I returned to my original position in front of the South S t a n d .

Most of the noise in the ground was being made by the Forest fans,

who were drowning out the singing of their opposition,          simply due

to the fact that there were obviously many more Notts Forest fans

in the ground.     At this time there was still a fair bit of room in

the North and West Stands,      and in the Leppings Lane Terraces.



When the game started,     the atmosphere was charged.      During the

first few minutes X was paying attention to the Nottingham

supporters in front of my      position,   and   therefore did not see what

was happening at the West      Side of the ground.
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 R90

After about five minutes I remember that a Liverpool player had a

shot which hit the crossbow of the Nottingham g o a l , and when Forest

began attacking immediately after this,            that is when I first noticed

the Liverpool fans climbing the f e n c i n g , on to the perimeter track

and the p i t c h .    No more than one minute     later,   I saw a Pol ice

Officer of at least Inspector rank run on to the pitch towards the

referee.      I then realised that something serious was happening,                and

as I did not have a r a d i o , I asumed some sort of crowd t r o u b l e .            As

this was happening the Forest fans were obviously angered and one

y o u t h , a Notts Forest supporter called                                            of

                                                   L e ic est ersh ire , jumped on to

the perimeter track and started s h o u t i n g .      With the aid of PC 2046

H o l m e s , I escorted             to the Police room, where his details were

obtained,     and he was then ejected from the ground by the usual

p r o c e d u r e , this would have taken no longer than 5 m i n u t e s .   Under

normal circumstances I would have charged                     with an o f f e n c e .
                                                                                             I
In my opinion,         he had used threatening words and behaviour towards                   I

the Liverpool         fans,    and he had been drinking,    but as it appeared              to

me then that the pitch was            being invaded,   I thought it better to
                                                                                             1
                                                                                            dea

with             juickly and return to my position where I would have been                   I

of further a s s i s t a n c e .   PC Holmes had a radio with him and when I                 |
                                                                                             I
asked him if he knew what was happening,            I remember him saying that               j

he didn't know or he w a s n ’t sure.         I then returned to my duty on the

perimeter track and at this t i m e , being totally unaware of the                           ]

severity of the incident at the opposite end of the ground,                  I               1

strongly believed that my job was to prevent the hooligan element

within the No tt ingham contingent from entering on to the p i t c h .

Obviously,     they were totally ignorant of the facts and at this time

there was much abusive chanting and shouting from many p e o p l e .               I

then realised it was serious because of several t h i n g s .            Firstly,
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         R90

people being carried away from the Liverpool goal - Policeman

attempting to resuscitate people - youths tearing down advertisement

boardings around the pitch to use as stretchers - rumours spreading

from o f f i c e r s , near my position, who had radios - I assisted ball

boys in tearing down the advertisement boards near my position, but

due to the taunting and abuse from the Forest f a n s , I decided to

remain in my position        (still to prevent the minority of those fans

who were either stupid or aware of what was happening but chose to

ignore) as I feared crowd t r o u b l e .   This decision turned out to be

correct because at one s t a g e , a group of about 50 Liverpool fans

charged at the Forest end - I am not ashamed to say that I became

quite s c a r e d .   I do not believe that this was because of "wanton

violence"     I think that these people were obviously angered and

frustrated and the chanting was not helping m a t t e r s .     I (ref 1977)

stopped 3 or 4 y o u t h s , who I simply re-directed back to the Liverpool

e n d , after strongly advising them.       But one youth of about 16 years

of age called                    (from Merseyside),   whom I had to "rugby

ta ck le ” in order to stop reaching the Forest Kop, was absolutely

hysterical and crying h e a v i l y .   When I spoke to h i m , he stated that

he had been looking for a 12 year old friend of his who m he had lost

due to the c r u s h .   I therefore talked to him in an attempt to calm

him,   and reassured him that we would find his m a t e .      I thought that

the best course of action would be to take him to the Police room or

the Gymnasium in order to obtain detaiIs which could be passed via

personal radio and tannoy,       but when we reached that area immediately

behind the North Stand,       I then realised that the situation was more

severe than I had initially anticipated.           I was unaware that anybody

had died,     and when I saw the large numbers of dead and seriously

injured laid o u t , I went totally numb - I turned cold and was totally

speechless.       The young lad with me then became hysterical again and
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           R9G

this brought me   back to my senses.     I r e - d i r e c t e d a n d   myself

to a quiet area   away from the dead,    and after again calming him down,

obtained details from him regarding his friend.           I then walked around

the dead and injured and thankfully there was no-one answering the

description of the missing boy.                  ;hen decided to continue his

search amongst the Liverpool       fans on the pitch,    and I informed him of

my position in the ground and told hi m that if he needed me again,               to

look for me.    I did not see him again nor did I see         the boy.    I did

not give anyone   else details of the missing boy,       and did not     pass the

details via personal    radio due to the large amount of "traffic" on it.



I then returned to my original position and was totally shocked and

sickened to hear a small number of people still singing and chanting

obscenities.    Others were only concerned whether the match was going

to be played or not.     However,    there were thankfully many people

ready to give any help they could,       and I directed some people who

claimed to be trained as doctors,       nurses or simply first aid to

positions where I thought they would be needed.



When people began to leave the stadium       (at about 3.45pm)      I was then

directed together with other officers to prevent people from entering

the players tunnel and the South Stand,          where there were still some

"official   looking people".      Many of these fans had obviously been

drinking,   and some were drunk (about 10 that I saw).          There were two

men in particular who were having great difficulty in standing up.

They did not appear    injured,    just drunk.    A lot of these people were

shouting and swearing at myself and other officers, but were simply

strongly advised.     I can remember a youth who was only about 5'4”

tall.   He was probably 16/17 years of age, but looked much younger.

He was very abusive to a couple of officers whom I ^ d o n 't know.         When
                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                  R90

they advised him,          he spat at one and then became violent towards him

ie kicking and throwing punches at him.                It took two other officers

to restrain him,          h o w e v e r , he continued kicking out and throwing

punches,      he was then led away by a few other Meraeysiders who I

assumed to be a s s o c i a t e s .



Before being informed that the game had been abandoned,                 I saw

who I had earlier e j e c t e d .         I had a short conversation with him,      and

he said that before the game he had been drinking in a pub with

friends and Liverpool f a n s .           He said that it had been good natured

and there had been no t r o u b l e .         He also told me that they had all

arranged to meet          in the same pub after the m a t c h .



Whe n all fans had left the ground, myself and many other officers

were sat in the North Stand awaiting to be debriefed.                  It was obvious

that many Policemen as well as women had been crying and it was

obvious that the vast majority were very u p s e t .



Naturally,       there was much talking about the events and I remember PC

G r e e n , who had been on the perimeter track nearby m e , stating that

whilst attempting to resuscitate somebody,               he was urinated on by some

unknown p e r s o n .



I was eventually "stood d o w n ” at about 7 p m .         I can say that during

the inc id e n t , that I felt many different emotions             Fear,

h e l p l e s s n e s s , numbness,   guiIt and most of all sickness   (DISGUST) at

the attitude and behaviour of some fans and the press,                 none of whom I

saw give any a s s i s t a n c e .



I have policed many games now at Hi 1lsborough including the two
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 R90

            previous semi -fi nals .   D u ring this time I have worked in all areas

            around the ground.

               HILLSBOROUGH DOCUMENTATION

               I refer to your letter of 3 November 1997 in which you raise four points in relation to requests for
               docum entation. T h e position w ith each of th ese is as follows;-


               1.       Your faxed request of 12 August 1997 for statement numbers                                      and
                                   author                    related to statements made by PC                      This was
                        a fte r w e had sent you the statem ents of PC                            following a similar request
                        for different statement numbers, author                                 It is only your letter of
                        3 November 1997 that has finally made it clear that you are seeking the statement of
                        A m bulancem an                        i wrote to him care of the South Yorkshire
                        Metropolitan Ambulance and Paramedic Service on 5 November 1997 seeking his
                        authority to release his statement to you. Once he responds J will inform you of the
                        outcome.

                         Photographic copies of the material you requested together with two other photographs
                         only requested on 27 October 1997 were forwarded on 4 November 1997.                One
                         photograph and three laser copies were actually forwarded to you on 8 August and
                         although you previously described the laser copies as being of poor quality, so were the
                         negatives and photographic prints, but we did provide you with copies to work from within
                         seven working days of your request. I can only apologise for it taking almost three
                         months to supply the actual photographs.

                         Coroners exhibit C535 was first requested on 26 September 1997 as exhibit 3535.
                         Unfortunately we interpreted this as exhibit C353 and forwarded you a laser copy of this
                         photograph by recorded delivery on 30 September 1997, a response time of only three
                         working days. On receipt of your letter of 6 November 1997, pointing out our error we
                         were able to rectify it the very same day.

                Ms A M Adlington




                          The copy of Richard Wells’ Report to the Home Secretary was first requested from me on
                          29 September 1997. I responded to you on the same day and when I tried to speak to
                          you about your request during a telephone conversation on 2 October 1997, you chose to
                          terminate the conversation without discussing it. My detailed letter of 3 November 1997,
                          covers all the points in your letter of 16 October and of course the report was forwarded to
                          you the following day.

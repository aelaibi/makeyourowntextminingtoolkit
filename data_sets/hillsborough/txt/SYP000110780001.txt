E N D OF   REPORT

Detective Inspector
South Yorkshire Police.



I am a Detective Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police, at present stationed
at Hammerton Hoad Police Station.
On Saturday 15 April 1989 , I was on duty in connection with the I".A. Cup
serai-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the Sheffield Wednesday
football ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield. I was in charge of the C.I.D officers
inside the ground.                        They consisted of four officers based in the gymnasium
to take reports of crime and also deal with persons arrested for crime, and
eight officers forming a !Pick-pocket Squad', who were deployed at the
Leppings Lane end of the ground, both inside and outside the turnstiles.
The details of the officers involved are as outlined in Appendix F of the
Operational Order.
Outlined below is a resume of the events of that day, to the best of my
recollection:
10am      Briefing at Hillsborough
          Followed by briefing for C.I.D. officers (Det Supt McKay,/
I was then engaged on general supervision dmties.
From about 1pra I was outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles with the pickpockets
squad. Crowds were building steadily but they were constantly being 'moved on’
by mounted officers, ie enter the ground or move away.
Numerous people v/ere asking for 'spares’ (tickets for sale).                                                      A   number of them
were the worse for drink.
Approx. 2pm       I overheard a group of four or five Liverpool supporters
(aged jO-hO years) discussing whether to go into the ground or go for a drink.
They decided it v/as too early to enter the ground and walked away.
Approx 2.10pm               Kadio message asking for C.I.D officers to attend at the
gymnasium, person arrested.                                      I made my way to the gymnasium and found two men
had been arrested in possession of aarmabia. Also in the gymnasium at th.au tiine
were sveral peonlo r-ox.'i'txng tl'iefts.                                                        c-firco-cc were dealing wiuii tneoe

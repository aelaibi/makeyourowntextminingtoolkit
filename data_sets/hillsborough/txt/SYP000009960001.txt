was    beer      everywhere        up the walls          on the       ceiling and floor            and broken

and we       continued to the football                   ground,        whilst      walking      to the       ground

there were             large amounts         of N o t t i n g h a m Forrest     fans walking           to the

ground and a lot of them gave me the appea r a n c e                              that      they had,

consumed a fair amount                  of alcohol.         We    even saw at          least     twenty youths

urinating         behind some ad v e r t i s i n g        hoarding        in Pen i s t o n e Road,,

get    to the ground via the entrance                      between the Spion Kop and the N orth

Stand      1 could see the             players      leaving      the    pitch,        I then ran across

the    pitch towards            the L e p p i n g s Lane     end where         the West S tand          is

situated.              On arriving      1 could see        the fans        trying      to    climb out        of the

pens and at             the time      i. thought      they were        fighting      inside      the    pens and

these      fans were          trying    to get out to avoid              the    trouble.         The    people

that     had     climbed out were             struggling        for    breath and        I still       d i d n ’t

realise what was               happening        inside    the    pens.       A girl      came    out    of the

pens and         I went       to her assistance.            She was        having      great     difficulty             in

breathing and was               nearing       unconciousness.            I mana g e d to keep her

awake and e ventually wa l k e d her to the side                           lines when she had

recovered         enough to be          1eft     by herself.           I then     returned to behind                   the

goal.        I saw a man         lying       on the floor,        he a p p e a r e d to be dead.              I

couldn't        find any        pulse and he a p p e a r e d          to have     stopped       breathing.              He

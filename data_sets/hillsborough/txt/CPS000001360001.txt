                             FILENOTE: HILLSBOROUGH



23 .12.98

T/C from Ann Adlington of the HFSG requesting update of when the decision as to
voluntary disclosure is going to be made. They are concerned that it should be made before
Christmas.

I said that the matter was being considered at the moment, and that either I or someone in
London would contact them as soon as possible.

I explained that if the decision of the CPS was to give voluntary disclosure prior to any
judicial review proceedings then that would be subject to considerations of Pll/legal
privilege and consultation with the police re their material in our possession. She now
accepts the impossibility of dealing with physical disclosure by the CPS before 4.1.99 as
consultation between the CPS and the police cannot take place until the first week in
January. However she would like some confirmation of our intentions so that she inform
the Magistratesâ€™ Court at the next hearing on 7.1.99.

ACTION: GC to inform CN/RB as to conversation                  Latest letters from Walker
Morris also to be considered re their complaint that we may not give them full reasons as
to our decision not to intervene, and that we should not give voluntary disclosure until after
judicial review.

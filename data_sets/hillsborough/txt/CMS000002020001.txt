Expenditure on this sub-head will fall almost exclusively in the
third and fourth quarters, with publication of the interim and
final reports respectively.


2.   Although the total cost of each report is likely to be in
the region of £50,000 (the Interim Report for Popplewell in 1985
cost approximately £30,000), HMSO tell us that we will need to
meet only the direct cost of copies supplied to the Inquiry and
Home Office.   For the Interim Report, this consisted of 1,000
copies at a total cost (at discounted rate) of £6,266.11.   A
similar arrangement will apply for the Final Report, although a
larger number of copies may be required.


3.   The figures have, accordingly, been adjusted downwards.

           I am Dr REDGRAVE c/o the above Medical Centre and have been a Doctor

           for 14 y e a r s .



           On Saturday,         15 April    1989 (150489)as a result of information               I

           received,     I attended the Hillsborough Football Stadium in Sheffield.



           On my arrival          there,   at about   1530 hrs (1530)        I was directed by a
                                                           JLJL—  7^
           Police Officer to attend the G y m na si uiti, actuated beneath the N Stand,

           At the Gymnasium,          I was directed by a Senior Police                     cer to examine

           bodies which were lying on the floor of the Cjymrysfsium, for any signs

           of life.      I then examined 14 bodies ajpra I pronounced                        extinct on
                                                                                                                      PAGE

                        each one.         The bodies      X examined were accompanied by a Police Officer

                        I estimate the time of each certification to be between 1530 hrs

                           (1530) and 1635 hrs       (1635).

                   y         n.ng this incident          I was unable to keep a record of each individual

                   ^ ./cert if i cation as I was obviously more concerned in finding                           live

                        bodies,       I therefore had to rely on the records made by the Police

                       Officer accompanying each body.

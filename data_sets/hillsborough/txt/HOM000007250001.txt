Dear Mr Treloar


HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - USE OF SHEFFIELD JUDGE'S LODGINGS


Thank you for your letter of 11 May setting out the arrangements
for the provision of itinerant staff at the Judge's Lodgings
during the course of the forthcoming oral hearings. I am very
grateful to you for arranging this so promptly.

I can confirm that the Home Office is content with the
arrangements for payment set out in your letter, and, in
particular, that should the Inquiry run beyond 7 July, the
Department would be prepared to pay half of Mr Dorgon1s salary.

Please let me know if there are any other points you wish to
discuss. May I leave you to inform Mr Bingham and Mr Fairweather
accordingly.

                                       Yours sincerely

                                                   — *— /

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - USE OF SHEFFIELD JUDGE'S LODGINGS

Further to our recent telephone conversation I can now confirm that this Department
will be supplying itinerant staff to the Judges Lodgings at Sheffield whilst The
Right Honourable Lord Justice Taylor is conducting the inquiry into the disaster at
Hillsborough.

The staffing arrangements are as follows:

    DATES                                   COOK                                    BUTLER

    14 May - 9 June
    11 June - 16 June
    18 June - 7 July


From 9 July until the end of the summer term the Lodgings will be staffed by
              and                         who will be at the lodgings to serve Mr
Justice Boreham and Mr Justice Potts.

Should you need to speak to any of the staff, please contact me.

As we agreed, the pay situation is as follows:

We will pay our staff each week directly from our Supreme Court Accounts Office at
the rate of £20.25 per day.    The Accounts Office in turn will seek reimbursement
from you at the end of the Summer Term.

Should the Inquiry        end earlier than 7 July, we will try to fit the staff into other
lodgings; in which        case we would cover the cost. However, if this is not possible,
we still have to          pay the    staff asthey are contracted for work for these dates.
Therefore we would        have to add this to the reimbursement costs.

Should    the   inquiry    run   into   Mid-July,   you   would    not     be   expected       to   pay    for


                                                                                                    contd/2.
salaries, as we will already have staff in the lodgings.      However, when a butler
has to serve three or more judges, he is paid at the double rate: ie £40.50 per
day; and a s __________ will be serving two High Judges anyway, the presence of Lord
Justice Taylor would mean that he would be eligible for double pay. Therefore, I
would ask you if you are prepared to pay half of               [alary in the event of
the Inquiry running past 7 July (this policy of double payment does not extend to
itinerant cooks).

May I thank you for your assistance and I look forward to your reply.

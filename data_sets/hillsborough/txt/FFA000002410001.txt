  Dear Sirs,

  FA CUP FINAL 1989

  You will be aware that whilst The Football Association is
  laying plans for the continuation of this season's FA
  Challenge Cup Competition, until such time as Liverpool
  FC makes a final decision we cannot be certain that there
  will be a Cup Final this season.

  However, it was necessary for an early decision to be
  made with regard to the allocation of tickets in the
  event that the Cup Final does take place.       Taking all the
  circumstances into consideration regarding the tragedy at
  Sheffield Wedne sd a y last weekend, it was agreed that this
  year's Cup Final, if it proceeds, should be a
  Tribute/Memorial to those who died.       In view of this it
  was further agreed that competing finalists should be
  allocated approximately 3 7,000 tickets each, with the
  remaining tickets being allocated to The Football
  Ass o ci a ti on for distribution on the basis of two to every
  Association, Club or other football organisation in order
  that they may be represented at the Cup Final.

  I appreciate that some of you may have collected money
  and sent cheques to Wembley Stadium for the tickets
  originally allocated to you.   If this is so refunds will
  be sent' to you as soon as possible.

  Yours      faithfully

                  On    13th April              1989,        I was       on w e e k l y      leave,          but    ha d    previously               been

                  Burman        of El          s ub    division.            We    travelled             to    the       ground     as     a serial

                  arriving           at     approximately                8.45am,.           We    then went             straight        to    the       North

                  directed.               We    remained           seated        until       briefing           took       place     at      10am.

                  Immediately              after           briefing,,       we    had a          packed       lunch,        again       in the          North

                  Stand,        to    be       on     our    points       by     1 1 1 3 am ,     for    the       gates      opening        at       12    noon.

                  My    specific           duties           related       to     the       Leppings          Lane    Stand,        in     company with

                  at    the     rear       of       the     upstairs        stand.           This       is a n a r e a w h e r e          the        toilets

                  and      refreshments                are.        This     duty       was       until       the    match      started,              w h e n we

                  were     to    be       relieved           by a n o t h e r     serial.            Liverpool             supporters            started

                  arriving           and       entering           the    stand        at   about        IE.13pm         but    very       fe w       had

                  entered        up       to    approx        1. 3 0pm.          Between          1 . 3 0 - 2 . 1 5pm m o r e      supporters

                  entered        the       ground           but    it was        apparent          that       there        were    still         a    great

                  many     still          o u t s i de      the    ground.

                  It w a s      apparent              that    a    number        of    the       supporters          had      been      drinking,

but    none    caused any          problem     inside      the    ground.            Wh i l s t    continuing

to    patrol     the     c o n course a view was a v a i l a b l e             onto     the       perimeter

wail,    gates     & road,         I could see       that       there was a large                  number of

supporters        gathering         on the o p p osite          side     of the        road to the ground,

on the     grass        bank i n g & none      of these         suppo r t e r s :were ma k i n g any

attempt       to enter       the    ground even th o u g h the             kick off was              not far off.

Supporters        that     were     entering      the     gr o u n d were making              specific

complaints        about      pushing at the           turnstiles.              At this        time a message

was    b r oadcast       over    the    tannoy    sy s t e m    to fans        outsidk        the ground to

stop    pushing.          This     appeared      to have        no effect & fans                  had started

to scale       the walls         to gain access           to    the ground and/or                  escape    the

crush outside,

11 was     now be eomi ng apparent               that     peopIe wer e be i ng              injurad        outs i de

the    ground.          A number       of s u pporters         were     entering        the       concourse area

wit h minor       facial        injuries and        b r e athing        d i f f iculties          after    being

gave what aid we             could      in the      circumstances.              At this           time    I was

made aware        that     a gate was          open & a large            number        of fans       began

enter i ng the          concour se area,         a g a i n some       i nj ured and a 1 1 a n g r y .             A

I remained        in the        concourse      area as         s u pporters      c o n tinued        to enter &

I attempted         to help as man y of the                supp o r t e r s     as     I could that were

injured.         Several        became     u n s teady a n d     collapsed as they                  e ntered      the

concourse        area.       With      other    officers        I helped        these       people        into the

recovery       p o s ition and ensu r e d that             they were           breathing.            After a

short     time    it was        a p p arant    that these        people would have                  be taken to

the a m b u l a n c e    s e r vices    outside     the    gr o u n d    for    treatment.               Together

w ith Pc 2 "167 F rost           I picked up a y oung male                  person and             carried him

out    to the     rear     of the Leppings           Lane       stand where           he was        left

         v o mitting      in the       care   of the a m b u l a n c e     service & a friend.                    I

         returned       to the        stand & concourse where                I saw for           the first        time the

         injuries       that     had o c c u r r e d on the        pitch.        I returned          to the       concourse

         where     the fans were           very     hostile      towards       the     police and at             that time

         I feared       for the        saf e t y of officers w o r k i n g           in that area.

         I stayed       in this a r e a with suppo r t e r s              trying       to t a l k / a d v i s e / a s s i s t

         them     in what       ever    way   possible.

         As the d i s aster           became more        clear and        it was       obvious       that       the    game

         was     not going       to    continue,        I together        w ith other           officers        tried as

         t a c t f u l l y as   possible      to advise         t h e :supp o r t e r s    to    leave     slowly.         A

         small     number       of f a m ilies     did    so.      The -m a j o r i t y— pf— %+re suppo r t e r s w-e r-e

         o fficers      present.

         In the      course      of    time a large        number       of supporters             left     the    ground

         quietly & slowly as               requested & were             consoled & a d v i s e d as              they     left.

         W hen    the Lepp i n g Lane         stand had been            cleared        together w i t h other

         officers       I made my way           to the North S t a n d           for      the de brief.

         I returned        to H a c k e n t h o r p e   Police     s t a t i o n with other          officers

         finishing        duty at 6pm.

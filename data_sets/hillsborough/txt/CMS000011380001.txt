LETTER FROM CLLR DR ALAN BURNETT,   LEADER OF PORTSMOUTH CITY
COUNCIL TO THE PRIME MINISTER


Hie Prime Minister's office have asked (flag A) this Department
to reply to the letter at flag B from the Leader of Portsmouth
City Council.
I attach at flag C on hard copy and disk a draft reply, which
has been provided by various parts of the Department and by
officials at DNH (football stadia) and DTp (ports). You should
note that two Press Notices are to be attached.

Most of the reply is self-explanatory but the Minister should
note that on item 2) on CCT, local authorities have repeatedly
sought Government's agreement to their in-house labour forces
being allowed to tender for contracts with other authorities.
This has been opposed on the grounds that it is not appropriate
to risk local taxpayers' money in commercial ventures.      The
Aadit Commission have taken the view that this is not permiss­
ible, but the vires are not clear and some local authorities do
trade in this way.   These actions have not so far been chal­
lenged by any District Auditor, but the Commission's advice is
cLear.
I also attach at flag D a note on item 6) about setting aside
housing capital receipts.

DRAFT REPLY FROM MR REDWOOD TO CLLR DR ALAN BORNETT, LEADER OF
PORTSMOUTH CITY COUNCIL


Thank you for your letter of 2 June to the Prime Minister raising
a number of issues that concern the quality of services offered
by local government.     I shall take each of the points in the
order in which they appear in your letter.

Item 1

You ask firstly about local government reform. Michael Howard
recently announced the areas which the Local Government Commis­
sion will review. I enclose a copy of his announcement and you
will note that Hampshire is in the second tranche of areas to be
looked at by the Commission.    We have also invited the local
authority associations to comment by 30 June on our draft
procedural guidance to the Commission and on Annex A to our
revised policy guidance.

I am pleased that you enthusiastically embrace the challenge of
the local government reform and am sure that you will put your
case to the Commission with vigour when it comes to examine your
area.

Item 2

I welcome too your support for competition in the provision of
local Government services.    It is now widely recognised that
competition is the best guarantee of efficiency.      It is also
right that competition should be fair. But I cannot agree that
this requires completely free competition between public and
private sectors in the wider market. The purpose of CCT is to
protect local taxpayers from inefficient and costly provision of
services by local authorities' Direct Services Organisations, not
to expose local taxpayers to the risk of the market place.      A
poorly managed or inefficient private company may ultimately
cLose due to bankruptcy, but a loss making DSO can continue to
be funded by the local taxpayer. I am sure you will agree that
this is not the way in which taxpayers money should be used.
Item 3


You ask for help to meet community charge collection costs. When
the Community £tiarge was introduced, we accepted that it would
cost more to collect than the rates had done, simply because
almost twice as many people would be liable to pay. We therefore
increased the Other Services Block for 1990/91 to reflect these
additional costs of collection.       This has continued to be
reflected in the Other Services Block totals announced for
1991/92 and 1992/93. In addition we agreed to provide the sum
of £235,560 to Portsmouth in respect of the costs incurred in
preparing for the introduction of the community charge in respect
of 1990/91.


The resources available to all authorities, including Ports­
mouth, for pommunity fifharge collection, should fully match the
costs that a well-run authority will incur.
Item 4


As for imprisonment for community charge defaulters, we believe
that it needs to be retained as the ultimate sanction for those
who delay payment for as long as possible.     If the levying of
distress does not meet with success and the court is satisfied
that the failure to pay is due to the individual's wilful refusal
or culpable neglect, the individual is liable to be committee to
prison. The court would usually expect a local authority to have
attempted to use all the enforcement options available to it
before seeking committal and it certainly must first have tried
to levy distress against the defaulter.

In general a prison sentence cancels the debt to society owed
by the prisoner. Nearly all fines are remitted by a term of
imprisonment and the Government felt it only right that community
charge debts should also be treated in the same way. The
regulations also provide that where the debt is paid then the
debtor is released; if the debt is partly paid then the prison
sentence is reduced accordingly.
We do not consider it to be appropriate to sentence community
charge defaulters to community service rather than imprisonment.
Using community service for defaulters would divert the Probation
Service far more than it would save the Prison Service.
Moreover, those who failed to comply with the terms of a
community service order would still end up being committed to
prison for default.

Item 5


As for Portsmouth Football Club, the Secretary of State for the
OepatffemeH'fe af National Heritage announced on 4 June the Govern­
ment's plans to re-examine the all-seater requirement at Third
and Fourth Division clubs in the Football League and to consider
the position of those Second Division clubs with very low average
attendances.    Although on the basis of average attendances
Portsmouth may not fall within this category, I would make the
point that on the timetable for achieving all-seating the
Football Licensing Authority have made clear that it is incumbent
on clubs to inform it of any circumstances which prevent them
from achieving all-seating by the August 1994 deadline.

Item 6

You also ask for the present rules on the use of capital receipts
to be changed so that your council can build more houses. Any
Government has to concern itself with total public expenditure,
whether financed from taxation, borrowing or receipts, in the
interests of the national economy.     Relaxing the rules on the
use of receipts would not mean that more money overall could be
spent on housing;    but rather that resources were spent where
receipts happened to be high.     Allowing authorities, such as
Portsmouth City Council, to spend more of their receipts would
mean giving more spending power to those authorities that need
it least and depriving those in greatest need.



As you are aware local authorities have been encouraged to adopt
more   of an   enabling role   in housing,   working with housing
associations, private developers and landlords to meet local
housing needs in their areas rather than building houses them­
selves. The Government has taken measures to increase output of
social housing in those areas where it is needed, including a
substantial increase in public resources through the Housing
Corporation for new development by housing associations who are
now the main providers of new social housing for rent and sale.

Item 7


You call for planning powers to be reintroduced for conversions
of houses to be lived in by up to 6 single, unrelated people who
are not living as a household. Following the publication last
year of research by Wootton Jeffreys/Bernard Thorpe Consultants
into the effects of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes)
Order 1987, we decided that there was no need to change the law;
bat we do intend to carry out further research

Item 8

While Portsmouth's ferry port remains in the public sector its
borrowing must remain subject to controls.   The Department of
Transport have made substantial supplementary credit approvals
available to assist the port's development. I cannot give any
undertaking about resources for the future.      The    Government
believe that commercial enterprises are better able    to flourish
in the private sector than under public ownership.     But we have
no immediate plans for legislation to require local    authorities
to dispose of ports.

Because of their responsibility respectively for football stadia
and ports I am copying this correspondence to Robert Key at the
Department of National Heritage and to Malcolm Caithness at the
Department of Transport.
Background note


1. Authorities have been required since April 1990 to "set
aside", broadly, 75% of housing capital receipts and 50% of
non-housing receipts to redeem debt.

2. The expected inflow of receipts is taken into account in
determining how much new borrowing can be allowed, within
overall public expenditure restraints. Receipts reduce General
Government Expenditure (GGE); spending from receipts adds to
GGE. Debt redemption also reduces authorities borrowing costs.
It is a widespread fallacy that additional spending from
receipts could be permitted without implications for public
expenditure totals.

3. In practice, the new local authority capital finance system
introduced by the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 -
including the debt redemption rules and a new power to take
account of available receipts in capital allocations - has
permitted much improved targeting of spending power away from
receipt rich authorities to those in greatest housing need.

4. Housing Associations are now the main providers of new
social housing with local authorities working alongside
associations, fulfilling a mainly enabling role. Public
resources for the Housing Corporation for new development by
housing associations is planned to reach £1.7 billion this
year, rising to over £2bn a year thereafter. Housing
associations can also attract private finance to supplement
public resources. Associations' estimated Housing Corporation
funded output is set to rise to over 53,000 by 1993/94.

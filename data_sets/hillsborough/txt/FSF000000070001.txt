facility so that the necessary expenses should be paid pending the renewals
subscriptions and the Liverpool donation being received.

 direct debit were proceeding.

ID Card campaign

Rogan and Craig Brewin attended many Parliamentary Committee hearings. Most of
the changes to the Bill in Committee were bureaucratic changes but it has
emerged that the role which the Licensing Authority will play will be more
dominant than that performed by the FMA, which appears now to become a rubber
stamping authority.
Detailed discussions on the role played by supporters were held in Committee.
It was reported that Mr Moynihan saw the need for supporters to play a role in
the FMA. The report stage and third reading were to be held when Parliament
reassembled in October with the Bill being passed by the end of November. The
scheme was to be implemented in the early part of the 1990/91 season. It was
reported by the Tyne and Wear branch that Gordon McKeag, who was on the League
Management Committee, had undertaken to advise the branch of the proposals put
forward by the FMA thus giving the branch an early opportunity to respond
accordingly.
In committee, David Evans made references to the fact that the FSA was a "bunch
of non-aligned supporters". Rogan had written a letter to Mr Evans stating
that this was not in fact true and offering him any further assistance he
needed in getting his facts right.

These last petitions were being submitted and the final figure looked like
being close to 300,000 signatures. A final total was to be determined by
Rogan.

Taylor enquiry report

The Sunday Times had leaked what they believed to be details of the interim
report but Rogan reported that most of the information appeared to be common
knowledge.

A letter of thanks was to be sent to the FSA to the Barrister and Solicitors
acting.
Channel 4 were holding a discussion programme on the Taylor report on Saturday
19th August and the FSA were to be represented.

Branches were asked to ensure that the recent questionnaires, issued to canvas
members' views, were to be returned to the Sir Norman Chester Centre as quickly
as possible.
The FSA submission for Part II of the enquiry had been drafted and circulated
by Rogan and amendments and suggested alterations should be sent to Rogan as
quickly as possible.

Reclaim the Game

Adrian Goldberg had enjoyed editing the August edition but reported that the
organisation, production and finances of the publication was in an ''utter
mess". After much discussion it was asked that the Management Committee look
at the publication in all its aspects with a view to appointing a full time
Editor.   Mark Jenson, editor of "The Mag" would be invited to the next
Management Committee meeting with this in mind.




                                       (3)
Any other business

The next supporters meeting with the FA/League was to be on 15 August. It was
decided that Rogan should attend this and future meetings together with one
National Officer and a branch representative thereby getting as manydifferent
people to attend these meetings as possible.

A proposed motion of censure from the West Midlands for Rogan in connection
with accepting scxne spare tickets out of the FA's own allocation was discussed
but not moved or voted upon following further explanationsby Rogan.

The renewal system for membership will be explained in thenext issue of
Reclaim the Game.

Tom Simner was available at the FSA's office at the Marie Curie Centre on
Tues/Wed/Thurs. Telephone___________ .

The date for the next AGM will either be on 2 or 9 June 1990.

Dear Sir
Re:       Hillsborough Disaster .
                                Inguir.Y
We refer to our letter of 24 April 1989.
The District Health Authority and the two hospitals involved in the
Disaster have been de-briefing staff over the last couple of weeks.
In the course of that process we have taken statements from a tew
key personnel, including medical and nursing staff, 18 in totai.
We envisage not all of them will have evidence relevant Jo the
Inquiry, but we would like the Inquiry to know those statements
available. We are awaiting approval of the statements at the
moment but we can let you have copies of them, either in dratt rorro
or as soon as they are approved, should you so require.

Yours faithfully




 OXLEY & COWARD

             Dear Mr Gadsby,

             Re:       Hillsborough Disaster Enquiry

             Further to our telephone conversation this morning, we now enclose copies of
             twenty two draft statements from various Health Authority Staff employed at the
             Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals, and the District Headquarters.
             We have prepared a list of names, status and place of work, for ease of
             reference.  The statements are currently with the staff for approval, and we
             expect will be returned, with any amendments within a week to ten days. The
             enquiry may not require all or indeed any of the staff to attend to give
             evidence, but if any of them are required, perhaps you would let us know so that
             we can expedite the production of their signed statements.

             We also enclose a copy of the major disaster plans for each of the two hospitals.
             These plans are referred to extensively in the statements and you may find them
             useful.   If the enquiry requires further copies kindly let us know. In addition
             we enclose a set of plans for part of the Northern General Hospital, identifying
             the Accident and Emergency Department (D Floor) and the Out Patient's Department
             (C Floor). Again, please let us know if you require any further copies of the
             plans, and any plans of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

             Yours sincerely




             Oxley & Coward

                            X am aware that a police enquiry is being under taker, and may be that the

                            with 3 black strap, roman rurerale and the Initial                the face,

                              If it has been found, perhaps you c<              ivise how          my   c lie n t    can recover It,

                              My client will be making 3 claim fo               jrtal injury and 1 am contacting
                              the Liverpool taw Society who«4 i underst         id are co-ordinating such claims.

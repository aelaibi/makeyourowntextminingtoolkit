 THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

 T h an k you for y o u r letter of 5 J u n e 1997 outlining th e considerations w hich
 have led you to conclude th a t we should initiate a n independent exam ination
 of th e alleged new evidence because th is ap p ears to be th e only w ay to allay
 public concern.

 I have no difficulty in principle w ith y o u r approach. T here u ndoubtedly
 rem ain s deep rooted dissatisfaction am ongst th e relatives of th o se who died as
 well a s som e of th e survivors an d th e ir relatives ab o u t th e m a n n e r in w hich th e
 public au th o rities conducted them selves a t th e m aterial tim e. They have
 m anifested them selves in calls for official action w hich, even if acceded to,
 w ould in all probability n o t th e n ad d ress th e concerns. For exam ple, a fu rth e r
 in q u e st - w hich can only be ordered by th e High C ourt - w ould have to
 consider th e sta tu to ry issu es prescribed by th e C oroners Act 1988 a n d could
 n o t properly becom e a wide ranging or generalised enquiry.

 A rnim tithi? hnrlffrm ind, I do have difficulty w ith th e draft Term s of Reference.

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

Please see (Flag A) a letter from th e Home Secretary to yourself outlining his
view th a t public concern ab o u t th e H illsborough stad iu m d isa ste r will no t be
allayed w ith a n assu ra n c e from th e Home Office (or an y o th er public body) th a t
th e re is no new evidence. He considers th a t th e issu e should be th e subject
of a n indep en d en t exam ination of alleged new evidence w ith a view to
determ ining w h eth er an y fu rth er step s m ay be justified.

The p re se n t position is th a t th ere is no pending application to LSLO u n d e r ^
Section 13 of th e C oroners Act 1988. We have tak en th e view th a t none of th e
alleged fresh m aterial w ould have m aterially affected th e consideration of th e
applications w hich w ere m ade having regard to th e b asis on w hich th ey w ere
m ade. So far as th e DPP is concerned, th e fu rth e r "new evidence" does no t
ju stify asking th e Chief C onstable of S outh Y orkshire Police to initiate a fu rth e r
crim inal investigation. She h a s no t yet an nounced th a t decision b ecau se it will
need to be qualified, assu m in g th a t th e Home Secretary an n o u n ces som e form
 of fu rth e r enquiry, by reference to th e fact th a t th e issu e will be fu rth e r
 considered in th e light of any fresh evidence emerging.

B oth th e CPS an d LSLO have su b sta n tia l difficulty w ith th e proposed Term s
of Reference. The difficulty is th a t in each case th e Term s of Reference invite
n o t m erely a fact finding exercise b u t for th e public enquiry to express a view
a s to w h eth er grounds exist for "considering" a n application to th e High C ourt
or prosecution. The difficulty is th a t th e subtlety of th e w ording "to consider
w h eth er su ch step s should be taken" will be lost. The fact th a t a public
enquiry refers th e m a tte r back to th e DPP or yourself w ith a view to crim inal
p ro ceedings/application to q u ash th e in q u est verdict, will raise expectations
to a point w hich m ight effectively m ake it im possible to decline. In th e case of
prosecution, th e views expressed by th e public enquiry could them selves be
dam aging to potential defendants.

All th is points to Term s of Reference w hich distinguish betw een th e question
relating to a public enquiry - w here a recom m endation w ould be ju stifiab le -
a n d th e issu es relating to p ro secu tio n /in q u est w here th e fu rth e r exam ination
ought to be confined to ascertaining w hether th ere is any fresh evidence w hich
h a s n o t previously been considered by th e D PP/A ttorney G eneral as
appropriate. It w ould th e n be for th e D P P/yourself to consider w hat, if any,
step s needed to be taken.

           THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

           As you know, I have been considering the representations which have been
           made about the Hillsborough Stadium disaster on 15 April 1989. The disaster
           was of course fully investigated by the late Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor, but
           concern has been raised about a number of features of the case and material
           considered by some to represent new evidence has been brought to our
           attention. These and related matters were raised in the Granada Television
           documentary drama "Hillsborough" last December.

           My officials have thoroughly examined the alleged new evidence and the
           allegations made in the Granada television programme and have concluded that
           there are no grounds for establishing a new public enquiry. The material has
           also been considered by the Attorney General's Office and the DPP's Office.
           None of those who have examined the material consider that there is evidence
           to justify a new public enquiry, a re-opening of the inquest, or the prosecution of
           individuals. But I am certain that continuing public concern will not be allayed
           with a reassurance from the Home Office that there is no new evidence. I
           therefore propose that there should be an independent examination of the
           alleged new evidence by a senior legal figure - a respected judge {serving or
           recently retired), or perhaps a senior Counsel. It will be important to ensure that
           whoever undertakes the task is sufficiently senior and respected to command
           public confidence. My personal preference would be for a judge. The proposed
           terms of reference are:
     09:16      THE HOME SECRETARY’S OFFICE ■» ATTORNEY GEN                      NO.286




"To carry out an independent examination and advise whether there is new
evidence relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989
which provides sufficient grounds for:

      i.     the Secretary of State for the Home Department to establish a
              further public inquiry;

      ii.    the Attorney-General to consider applying to the High Court under
              Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for another inquest;

      iii.   The Director of Public Prosecutions to consider bringing criminal
             charges against any person;

      iv.    The relevant Chief Police Officer to consider taking disciplinary
              action against any police officer.

Or whether there is any other action which should be taken in the public
interest."

There will need to be a public announcement of the establishment of the
independent examination. This will require careful handling. I am sure that the
announcement will have to be made in the House. But I shall want to make sure
that the ground is properly prepared before the announcement is made with
those outside Government with a close interest in the Hillsborough disaster
including the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

I should be grateful for the Lord Chancellor's advice on a suitable figure to lead
the independent examination, and for your comments and those of copy
recipients on the proposed terms of reference by 12 June.

Copies of this letter go to the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the
Lord Chancellor, the President of the Council, the Minister Without Portfolio, the
Secretary of State for National Heritage, the Director of Public Prosecutions and
Sir Robin Butler.

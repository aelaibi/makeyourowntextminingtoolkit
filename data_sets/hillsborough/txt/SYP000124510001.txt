 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLtD

 AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1.        LACK OF   INIATIVE AND ACTION BY THE POLICE , THEY SEEMED STUNNED BY WHAT

 WAS GOING ON IN THE PENS.          ONCE SOME OF THE OFFICERS REALISED WHAT WAS

 GOING ON THEY REACTED WELL AND MIXED WITH THE FANS TO ASSIST THE INJURED.

 2.        THE REACTION BY THE POLICE OFFICERS APPEARED TO BE INITIATIVE RATHER THAN

 LEADERSHIP OF SENIOR OFFICERS,         THE DEPLOYMENT OF POLICE OFFICERS ACROSS

 THE PITCH AND IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND PROVED THAT THE SENIOR OFFICERS

 IN CHARGE OF THE GAME DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

 3.        IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE PROPER FIRST AID EQUIPMENT ARRIVED AT THE

 sj^NE IE AMBULANCES ETC ALL THE FIRST AID WAS GIVEN BY FANS AND POLICE

 OFFICERS ON A DIY BASIS.

 4.        THE POLICE OFFICERS ON THE HALF WAY LINE SEEMED IN SENSATIVE TO THE

 FANS W HO WERE STUNNED OR INJURED AND STILL APPEARED TO BE TREATING THE

 SITUATION AS A CROWD DISTURBANCE.

 3.        EVEN AS YOU WERE LEAVING THE GROUND INTO LEPPINGS LANE THERE WAS NO

 ORGANISATION         OF FANS, BECAUSE FIRE ENGINES POLICE CARS WERE PARKED

 CAUSING A BOTTLE NECK AS YOU WERE LEAVING AND THAT BOTTLE NECK COULD HAVE

 CAUSED FURTHER         INJURIES OR DISTRESS TO ALREADY SHOCKED FANS.


G1<®

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

, 1.       THE POLICE A T / l € ROAD BLOCKS SEEMED TO BE MAKING THE TRAFFIC

 PROBLEMS WORSE AND WE. WERE EVEN DELIBERATELY MIS-DIRECTED BY ONE POLICE

 OFFICER LEAVING US AT A LOSS AS TO WHICH DIRECTION TO TAKE.                  ^ / Cm * * - / ^ U'

 2.        THE POLICE SEARCHING THE COACHES AND TRANSIT VANS A GOOD 15 MILES

 OUT OF SHEFFIELD CERTAINLY DELAYED THE TRAFFIC.

 3.        THE POLICE DEPLOYED AT IMPORTANT POINTS IE BY THE MAIN COACH PARKS WHERE

 WE PARKED SHOULD HAVE BEEN LOCAL OFFICERS WHO KNEW THE AREA RATHER THAN
      ,    '*                                                       GSLHG9&

 OUTSIDE DIVISIONS.       THIS WOULD HAVE HELPED FANS ASKING FOR DIRECTIONS.

 4.   THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS ALL WRONG YOU CANNOT DEFEND HOW MANY TICKETS
                     i
 LI VERPOOL WERE GIVEN, ALSO THERE IS NO REASON WHY LIVERPOOL WERE GIVEN THE

 LEPPINGS LANE END.

 5.       THE LEPPINGS LANE ENTRANCES ARE JUST NOT DESIGNED TO COPE WITH THE

 NUMBER OF FANS THAT USE T H E M .      WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT THERE ARE ALSO

 ENTRANCES NEAR TO THE KOP END WHICH WEREN'T USED BECAUSE OF SEGREGATING

 T H E ’FANS IT IS DISGUSTING TO CLOSE THEM OFF AND FORCE FANS TO THE

 LEPPINGS LANE END.

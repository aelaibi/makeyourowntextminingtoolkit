       Bupportere.ii; At about the< same time proposals by Eastwood and Partners, which
  yj would have achieved enclosures having their own turnstile entrances and
 ^ i n d i v i d u a l crowd capacities, were rejected by the Club.
 There ar*'a-total of f5 turnatilaa at Hillsborough, 12. of which (Nos 77 - 86)
 ware not inluae for reasons of segregation on IS April 1969. Nottingham Forest
 fansiwer* allocated 60 and Liverpool the rsmaining 23 all from Loppings Lana.

 The t i turnstiles in L*ppings Lana contained in two section* 1 to 16 and A to
 Gi ate divided by the metal wall previously mentioned. They were designed in
 tuch a w a y . that turnstiles 1 to 10 served the West aide of the North Stand
 seated area i'll to 1$ the Vest Stand seated area and A to G the Vest Stand
 terraces. i-In!actual .fact turnstiles 11 to 16 and A to G give access to the
 same concourse area at the rear of the Vest Stand. Confusion was caused by the
 turnstilesjbeing signed from left to right A.C.B. The tickets given to
 supporter*'.added to the confusion and the general layout once inside the iron
 perimeter gat8B caused congestion if a supporter needed to get from turnstiles
 A to 0 to 1 to 16 or vice versa.
As a result if a supporter went through the outer perimeter iron gates towards
turnstilss A-0 and found he needed turnstiles 1-16 he would have to return
through the outer perimeter iron gates into Leppings Lane and then to the
correct turnstile.
Also in this area are three Exit Gates A, B and C. These Gates ere large
concertina type metal gates measuring 4.064 metres across And 2.184 metres
high, except     gate which is 3.2 metres high. They were built in 1985 during
modifications;to th* turnstiles and concourse area. Both sides of the gates
closed towards th* centre and ate operated from the inside only they were
painted blue and were capable of being locked and bolted. In each pair of
gates one was fitted with a non-opening glass observation panel at about eye
level*
Looking from Leppings Lan* Gat* 'A* is situated to the left of turnstile 1 and
adjoins the outer perimeter vail of th* ground running parallel to Ver* Road.
Gate ' B ' i s a t the end of the metal wall across the courtyard and between
turnstile* 16, and A. Gate 'C* iB located to the right in the vail running
parallel vith the River Don beyond turnstiles A to G.
Emergency .Gate ’&* is a small concertina type gate opening from inside only and
located in;the wall running parallel with the River Don, immediately before it
joins the‘side of the South Stand and behind the Police Control Box.
 Beyond the turnstiles and behind the Vest Stand,is a concourse area which is
 divided into three sections. Each of thes* sections serves a different part of
 the Vest and North Stands and the-VeBt Terraces. The three aections are
 created^by.ametal fence and « brick wall. There was no access from the
 central-concourse through the metal fence to the North Stand section but a
 gate;in the:brick wall did give access throughout the standing terrace
 concourse; area. • •

               capacity for the North Vest Terrace was wrong having been calculated with the
               wrong scale.> The result was that 2,900 was excessive. The revised figure is
               now 1 t500. T h e figure is based on an amended Certificate issued by Sheffield

               In 1961 when the first radial fences were installed on the terraces, creating
                the 3 large enclosures a crowd capacity of 2,200 was declared for the centre
               .enclosure by Dr EA3TW0QD based on calculations in the1976 Green Guide. When
                this largeenclosures was divided in 1985 into enclosures 3and 4 and the void
                5, Eastwood and Partners split the capacities as followst- 1,200 into enclosure
                3 and 1,000 for enclosure 4.' These figures were included on a plan of
                EaBtwoods but the author of the figures has not been identifed. These new
                capacities.were never referred, it seems, to the Council or the Club in order
                that the Safety Certificate could be amended. Xn any event the ability to

   Hillsborough was issued by South Yorkshire'Oounty Councul on 21 December X979,
   on Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's promotion to the Second Division.
   Attached to'the Certificate art a number of schedules. Schedule 1 deale with
   Interpretation) Schedule 2, -the General Tarm* and Conditionst and Schedule S,
   Crowd Capacity and Safety Stewards.
   South Yorkshire County Council, a9 the issuing authority, was responsible for
   the administration and supervision of the certificate until their demise in
   1986 when reponsibility was transferred to Sheffield city council.: The Officer
  Working Party, now called the Sheffield City Council Safety at Sports Grounds
  Advisory Group,' at the time of this disaster comprised o£ representatives from
   Sheffield City Oouncil, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Eastwood and
 ; Partners, South Yorkshire Police, South Yorkshire Fire‘Brigade and South
   Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Servioe.
   At the time the County Council transferred responaibilty for licensing to the
   City Council, there was a prepared schedule of responsibilities under the
   Safvty of Sports Ground Act 1975 in existence. This document showed the
 r esponsibilities of the County, Police, Fire Brigade and Building Control
   Authority.: According to correspondence this echeduule waa adopted by the City
   Council which meant they then assumed the      former County and Building Control
   function*. :       '
  In July 1987,, these responsibilities were re-drawn by the City council in draft
  form in a document entitled 'Division of Responsibilities between Authorities',
  which proposed-responsibilities being divided between the Building Surveyors
  (Department-of!Land and Planning) and the        Director ofEnvironmental Health and

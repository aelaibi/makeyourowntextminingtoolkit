MEMORANDUM


From: C F BONE
      Room 1106
      0171 273 2512


Date:     6 November 1997

To:     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith




I attach (in no order of importance) -

1)     a letter from the Treasury Solicitors about the selection of material for the compilation
video and the evidence for Lord Taylor’s Inquiry. Mr Whitehurst is available to see you
from next week. Shall I fix an appointment?

2)    a letter which the Family Support Group have forwarded us which Bernard Ingham
(Mrs Thatcher’s former pet) sent to a Liverpool supporter. For interest, if any, only;

3)        a rather more important letter from Mrs Corrigan, whose son, Keith McGrath died. I
was interested in what she says about Dr Redgrave. Redgrave was working alongside Dr
Bull in the mortuary and I expect that we may well be hearing something similar from him;

4)     a letter from Superintendent Foster about the video evidence. I have sidelined what
seems to me to be the most important bit, which describes what the compilation video was all
about;

5)      the transcript of your discussion with Dr Walker; and

6)      the transcript of your discussion with Professor Scraton and Mr Frost.

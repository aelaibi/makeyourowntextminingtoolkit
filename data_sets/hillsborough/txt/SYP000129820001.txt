ground, following the submission of an application for a safety certificate,
arrangements are made for the Police, the Fire Service, and the Building
Control Officer of the appropriate District Council to carry out their Inspections
at the same time, in order to avoid undue inconvenience to applicants, although
It appears likely that testing of crush barriers will of necessity take place on a
separate occasion.

   Dear Sirs,
                                      Certificate of Safety - Interim Report
                We have now progressed sufficiently far with our
   survey and assessment to be able to submit an interim report
   covering the probable ground capacity and the likely costs of
   improvements which will be required by the certifying authority.
                The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal­
   culations, although as with probably all existing grounds, it
♦ w i l l not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
   guide.           Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of
   the fire officer and the police.


   Standing Accommodation
   <*>           Splon Kog
                        The general layout of Spion Kop is good.                                         It
                 has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
                well below the maximum laid down in the guide.                                          The
                 slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements for
                 good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                                 The only questions therefore are the adequacy
                 of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
                 permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of


                                                      Registered in England - No. 1134531
EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




          the exits.
                 Where the barriers are adequate in strength
          and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
          of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m    of plan
          area.   Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
          Kop is approximately 3120m2 which would provide
          accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                 Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
          standards.   Category A must be able to withstand a
          test load of 6kN/metre width (400 lb/foot approximately)
          and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
          In 1973 you had tests made on all the barriers by
          Toft and Brocklebank Ltd.   Of the 101 barriers on
          Spion Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb
          and a further 15 carried the load but had some actual
          or incipient defect which needed attention.     Most of
          those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
          would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
          On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of
          a long barrier which was weak.   The general situation was
          satisfactory compared with most grounds.
                 Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
          barriers up to a uniform category A standard.     It
          should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
          the tests and there will have been some deterioration
          due to rusting.    Most of the barriers are made from
          2§” diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
          inches when new.    Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
          atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
          to more rusting than others and we must expect some
          increase in the number needing attention.
                 Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m,the
          maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
          guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m
ft PARTNERS




 for slopes of 30°.     These figures apply to ’peak
 viewing' areas.      Spion Kop has an average slope
 of about 17° for which the recommended spacing is
 3. 6m •
           In calculating spectator capacity each barrier
 is assumed to cater for an area of ground immediately
 behind it which is either 3.6m wide or up to the
 next barrier, whichever is the smaller.      We have
 surveyed the Kop, and our drawing 1610/1 attached
 shows the proportion of the Kop which will be
 admissible in the spectator calculation if all the
 barriers are brought up to category A standard.        It
 will be immediately apparent that the great majority
 of the available area will qualify.      Our calculation
 shows that the permitted number of spectators should
 be about 13,900 i.e. the number of places ’lost’ will
 be almost 3,000.
           If you wish to retain moetrof these extra places
 (aiming for a ground capacity of at least 50,000
 say) then new barriers could be constructed at positions
 shown by the red lines on the second copy of drawing
 1610/1.      The capacity would then be 16,000.
           In proposing the extra barriers we are mindful
 that in some cases they will possibly hinder the
 close packing of spectators.      Clearly, there is no
 point in spending money in order to achieve a large
 permitted.ground capacity, if 'that~numberrcaanot
 then be packed in.      However, we think that even with
 an uneven distribution of spectators it will still be
 possible to accommodate 16,000 spectators.
           You may wish to consider whether the cost of
 these extra barriers will be justified by the additional
 income they might generate over the years.        It is
                                                                    SHEET   4.


EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




          likely that new barriers, which will require fairly
          massive foundation and anchor blocks will cost between
          £50 and £60 per metre run.     Thus the extra 235 metres
          of barrier will cost about £5-00 per extra standing
          place.
                   Spion Kop is not ideally catered for by exits.
          A very adequate gangway system feeds to only three
          exit points.     The total width of these three exits
          at their narrowest points is 12.5m.    The guide assumes
          a maximum flow rate through these exits of 60 persons
          per minute for each 550mm of width.     Thus the
          theoretical time to discharge 16,000 spectators from
          Spion Kop would be 12$ minutes, compared with a maximum
          of 8 minutes indicated by the guide.
                 The exits at each end of the terrace are reasonably
          free from hazards, except the one at the North end passes
          under a bridge with a headroom well below the recommended
          value of 8ft.     This defect could be removed by lowering
          the floor level, but I would argue strongly that it is
          far from essential to have such a large headroom, and
          the cost of modification is not justified in an existing
          structure.
                 The exit at the back of Spion Kop is likely to
          raise most difficulty.     The ramp is steep and it has
          an appreciable cross-fall at the top where there is also
          a change of direction.     At one side is a vertical drop,
          which has guard rails which appear to be reasonably
          strong, but this can only be established by testing.
          We shall need some indulgence by the licensing authority
          if no works are to be requested.      My feeling is that
          continuous handrails will be required, splitting the
          ramp into say three separate lanes.
                 There may be considerable pressure to increase


                                                               l                 /
                                                                     SHEET   5.

         the total exit capacity.      We can argue that the
         eight minutes allowed for complete evacuation is only
         really valid for stands where there might be a risk
         due to fire, or explosion, or structural failure.       In
         the case of terracing it is only the impatience of
         spectators which might create danger.      For an interim
         period, at least, this should be acceptable.
                Any changes or additions to the exit arrangements
         should take account of a possible future decision to roof
         over Spion Kop.      It would be possible to incorporate in
         such a scheme a 'squaring off' at the top which could
         increase the area available for spectators.      However,
         this would probably mean that additional entrances would
         be needed, possibly by tunnelling through the bank at
         lower level.      This would certainly make it easier to
         pack the crowd more uniformly.     However, this is a
         matter for the future and is unlikely to be part of the
         present exercise.

  (b)    The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
                The west terrace is not quite so well endowed with
         barriers as Spion Kop.      The present layout is shown on the
         attached drawing 1610/2.  Our measurements show a total

         area of 1480m but there are no gangways. We feel that
         some allowance should be made for circulation space as
         spectators have to move quite considerable horizontal
         distances to achieve good packing.      The full area would
         justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
         probably be appropriate to allow 10% as     the equivalent
         of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.       The
         barriers should be designed to match this figure approximately.
                The shaded area on drawing 1610/2 is that which
         may be counted if the existing barriers are of class A.
         About 15 of the existing barriers are likely to need


                                                                                  y
                                                                     SHEET   6.

          strengthening to .achieve this .standard.    Even with
          this strengthening only 4,300 spectators could be
          accommodated, Tepresenting -a loss of nearly half -
          We presume this would be unacceptable.
                    The extra barriers required to achieve
          approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
          second copy of drawing 1610/2.      You may feel that
          some of the proposed new barriers which are close
          to the entrances might restrict the passage of
          spectators undesirably.      In that case they could
          be omitted.
                 The three exits have a total width of about
          11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
          to leave the ground.      Thus the stand could empty
          in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                 The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
          should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.         There are
          no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
          exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as
          movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
          and quick.
   (c)    The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                    This area is also illustrated in the drawing
          1610/2.      The gross area available (there are no gangways)
          is about 565 m2 .     Thus if the crush barriers were
          adequate and the whole area is included the number of
          spectators could be about 3,050.
                 Unfortunately, the crush barriers in this area
          were shown to be very inadequate when tested in 1973.
          Only one was tested and the rail and posts were bending
          at a load of only 270 lb/ft.      Because of this result
          none of the others was subjected to a test lead.         We
                                                                       SHEET


EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




             have examined the drawings of these barriers and
             in addition to the weakness of the rails and posts,
             the holding down arrangements appear to be very
             inadequate and might be treacherous.         A sudden
             failure of a bolt, and they are very highly stressed,
             could lead to a collapse without warning.         These
             barriers need major strengthening as a matter of
             urgency.
                    Assuming that the barriers are strengthened
             it will be seen from the drawing 1610/2 that they
             also need considerable supplementation.         The scheme
             shown on the second copy of this drawing does not
             quite justify the whole area being taken in the
             calculations.      But it would be reasonable to count
             say 2900.       This would bring the total standing at
              the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                       The exits serving this part of the terrace are
             very adequate, but there may be requests for central
             handrailings to be provided.


      Seating Accommodation
      (a)    The North Stand
                    The form of construction of this stand is such
              that it presents a minimum fire hazard.        The exits
              are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy the
              recommendations of the guide.
                       Two matters might cause concern.      The first,
              the fact that the exits are marginally below the
              recommended minimum of 1.1m, is we think of very little
              consequence.      However, the second, the narrow gangways
              which are only about half the recommended minimum may
              cause some difficulty.     It would be possible to widen
              the gangways by taking one seat off the end of one of
              the rows meeting at each gangway.      As the gangways
                                                                             SHEET   8.

    EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




              are the same in the other stands the total number of
              seats lost would be 1,041.       This is almost unthinkable
              and must be resisted strongly.
                      Fortunately, the timing of spectators leaving
              the ground on 6 January shoved that a peak of 80 per
              minute passed through one exit.          This is the figure
              quoted by the guide for a 1.1m gangway.         With 18 exits
^             for 10,000 people theaverage would be 556        per   unit.
              Thus the stand would empty in about seven minutes,
              which is within the recommended limit of eight minutes.
                     Our observations on 6 January showed that everyone
              had left this stand, apart from a few people who were
              in no hurry,in about six minutes, although we also counted
              about 40 per exit who left before the final whistle.
              The overall picture appears very satisfactory and
              encourages the hope that this stand will be accepted
              as not needing any significant modification.
                                                   /

       (b)    The West Stand
                      This stand isvery     similar to the north stand
♦             in its construction.        We were not able to accurately
              assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
              January because there were many seats which were unsold.
              However, there is every reason to believe that there
              will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
              eight minutes also.    There should be no need for
              significant modifications.

       (c)    The South Stand
                      The structure has been surveyed and appended
              are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
              show the plans and cross-section.         Also attached is
              a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
                      The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
              has 5710 seats.    These are served by 10 exits (excluding
                                                                      SHEET   9.

           those serving the directors box) so that an average
           of 570 people need to pass through each exit.      The
           count on 6 January showed an average of just over 70
           per minute passing through one exit which corresponds
           to an emptying time of about eight minutes.      Indeed
           there were very few people still trying to get out six
           minutes after the final whistle.      A few had no doubt
0#         left early and a few were still standing around, but
           the stand had substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                     Having left the top of the stand the spectators
           have to make their way from the first floor landing via
           one of three staircases.      Two of these are 3.6m wide
           and the other 2.4.      This is equivalent to 17$ 'lanes'
           of 550mm.      At 40 people per lane, 700 people pass per
           minute.      To discharge 5710 people (less those in the
           directors box) will therefore take almost exactly 8
           minutes as permitted by the guide.
                     The fire officers were clearly very interested
           in the first floor.      There is very little 'fire load*
           on this floor - the snack bars and the office/lounge.
           But quite a small fire might fill this area with smoke.
           We suspect that there might be a request for it to be compart­
           mentalised by fire doors.
                     At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
           almost straight to the open air, through a compartment
           which is separated from the main part of the building.
           The third staircase is not so well separated and some
           structural work may be needed.      Apparently the paint
           store is beside this staircase.      This may not be wise.
                     There may well be requests from the fire officer
           for considerable extra precautions and structural
           alterations in this building.
                     The front, open-air part of the south stand is
                                                                    SHEET   IQ .


EASTWOOD €r PARTNERS




          veil endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
          one passage.      This passage has a theoretical capacity
          of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
          This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.      Becaase
          the stand is open to the air and there is very
          ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
          long emptying time is of any great consequence.


   General Requirements
          It remains to be seen what other general requirements
   will be requested.     The fire officer may request structural
   alterations which we have not mentioned.      We must expect
   requests for handrailing dividing staircases into lanes and
   on the ramp from Spion Kop.      There will probably be need for
   a new fire warning system, and the emergency lighting
   standards may not be adequate.      In the first instance we
   think it better to wait for the police and fire service to
   suggest what is required.
          The police wish to have a new police office of a
   significantly better standard than the present one, with a
   separate room for the detention of 'wrong doers'.     It would
   probably be better to ask what they need at an early stage
   and with your permission we will do this.


   Effect on Ground Capacity
          If no new crush barriers were provided but the existing
   ones are all brought up to class A standard the ground capacity
   would become
          Seating approximately                 24,000
          Standing on Spion Kop                 13,900

        EASTWOOD St PARTNERS




                  If all the new barriers which we have suggested
           are installed the capacity will become :-
                  Seating approximately             24,000
                  Standing Spion Kop                16,000

                  If it is required to increase this capacity at some
           time in the future Spion Kop could be 'squared o f f at the
           back using a steel framed structure and perhaps a further
           4000 places could be provided.    The Kop could also be
           roofed over, of course.


           Probable Costs
                  It is still too early to give an accurate estimate of
           costs but the following will give an indication of what may
           be involved.                                                     £

           This total should not at this stage be taken as
    more than a broad guess.     We may have pleasant surprises
    but there could be shocks.      The total does not contain
    any allowance for the local authority's charges in
    connection with the issuing of the licence or for our
    professional fees.


    Future Action
           Subject to your approval we suggest that the next
    steps might be as follows :-

    1.     We should pass copies of all drawings to the police,
            the fire brigade, the city Building Surveyor and the
           County Council.     In addition to drawings showing
            the results of our surveys of the Kop, the Leppings
           Lane terrace and the south stand, we are preparing
            suitable drawings of the north and west stands,
           measuring from the photo-copies of Husbands drawings.

    2.      We should make firm proposals to the   police and the
            fire brigade for the new crush barriers, together
           with our computation of the number of spectators, and
            invite comments including any suggestions of further
            measures which may be needed.

    3.      At the same time we should make detailed drawings and
            specifications for the strengthening work on the
            barriers which are known to be weak, andfor the con­
            struction of the new barriers, and obtain tenders.

    4.      We should request a meeting with the   police and the
            fire brigade to discuss the standsand to try to agree
           what may need to be done to bring them up to standard.

     5.     We should discuss in detail with the   police their
            requirements for a police office, and prepare a detailed
            design.
                                                                 SHEET   13.


EASTWOOD «r PARTNERS




     6.     We should discuss with the police and fire officer
            what other services such as alarms, communications
            etc. are needed, prepare an agreed scheme and
            obtain tenders.


     A Meeting with The Club
            You may feel that another meeting to discuss this
     report and the suggestions for further action, should be
     held shortly.     Dr. Eastwood will be out of the country
     for three weeks from 22 January so that the week beginning
     15 January would be appropriate.

                                                   REPORT ON GROUND CAPACITY


                     This report sets out our thoughts on the ground capacity
        vhich is attainable.
                     It deals in broad terns with the necessary strengthening
        and supplementation of the crush barriers on the terraces, and
^       calculations are made of the theoretical exit times.
                     Calculations of exit times are also made for each of
        the stands and reference is made to the observations vhich vere
        made at the end of the third round cup-tie on 6 January, 1979.
                     The green guide has been used as a basis for our cal­
        culations, although as vith probably all existing grounds, it
        will not be possible to satisfy all the recommendations in the
        guide.           Reasonable compromise will be needed on the part of the
        fire officer and the police.

    Standing Accommodation
    (a)     Spion Kop
                   The general layout of Spion Kop is good.      It
           has a very adequate number of gangways, with spacings
           well below the maximum laid down in the guide.      The
           slope strikes a happy balance between the requirements
           for good viewing and the requirements of safety.
                   The only questions therefore are the adequacy
           of the crush barriers to justify a high number of
           permitted spectators, and the capacity and nature of
           the exits.
                   Where the barriers are adequate in strength
           and spacing, the guide recommends that the number
                                                     o
           of spectators should not exceed 54 per 10m of plan
           area.   Disregarding the gangways the area of Spion
                                     2
           Kop is approximately 3120m which would provide
           accommodation for 16,850 spectators.
                   Crush barriers can satisfy either of two
           standards.    Category A must be able to withstand a
           test load of 6kN/metrewidth (400 lb/foot approximately)
           and Category B must withstand 4.3 kN/metre (290 lb/foot).
           In 1973 tests were made on all the barriers by Toft
           and Brocklebank Ltd.    Of the 101 barriers on Spion
           Kop, 21 failed to carry the test load of 400 lb and
           a further 15 carried the load but had some actual or
           incipient defect which needed attention.    Host of
           those which failed the test, failed so badly that they
           would probably not satisfy category B standard either.
           On the other hand, it was sometimes only one part of a
           long barrier which was weak.   It should be emphasised
           that the general situation was satisfactory compared
           with most grounds.
                   Clearly it would be advisable to bring all the
                                                                          SHEET   3.


     EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




                barriers up to a uniform category A standard.       It
                should be kept in mind that it is now five years since
                the tests and there may have been some deterioration
                due to rusting.      Most of the barriers are made from
                2§” diameter tube which only has a thickness of 0.192
,#             inches when new.       Rusting is now very slow in Sheffield’s
                atmosphere, but certain parts of the barriers are subject
                to more rusting than others and it is possible that
                there will be an increase in the number needing attention.
                         Provided a barrier can withstand 6kN/m, the
                maximum distance between barriers recommended in the
                guide varies between 5m for slopes of only 5° to 2.9m
                for slopes of 30°.      These figures apply to ’peak viewing’
                areas.      Most of Spion Kop has a slope of about 17
                for which the recommended spacing is 3.6m.      The slope of the
                upper part     changes to 25° for which the spacing is
                3. lm.
                          Whilst we believe it is arguable that parts of
 ^             Spion Kop could be considered as not being ’peak
                viewing areas’ we are prepared to accede to the police
                view and use peak viewing area standards for all barriers.
                This also applies to the stands at the west end of the
                ground.
                          We propose that the existing barriers should be
                 supplemented by new ones as shown in red on the attached
                 drawing 1610/1X.     The green shaded area behind each
                 barrier shows the area which can then be assumed to be
               • available for spectators.     This area is 2958m   which
                 at 54 persons/10m2 gives a capacity of 15,973.      It
                 should be kept in mind that as many as 20,000 spectators
                 have been admitted to the Kop in the past.
                                                                        SHEET   4.

                 Spion Kop has three exits, one near each
            end and one at the top.       The total width of
            these three exits at their narrowest points is 12.5m.
            The guide assumes a maximum flow rate through such
            exits of 60 persons per minute for each 550mm of
            width.      Thus the theoretical time to discharge
            16,000 spectators from Spion Kop would be Ilf minutes,
            compared with a maximum of 8 minutes indicated by the
            guide.      We do not consider this to be a serious
            matter.      Rapid evacuation (in say 8 minutes) is very
            desirable for stands where there may be a risk due to
            fire, or explosion, or structural failure.         In the
            case of terracing it is only the impatience of spectators
            which might create danger.     We believe that for an
            interim period at least the evacuation time of Ilf
            minutes should be acceptable.
                      The exits at each end of the terrace are
            reasonably free from hazards, except the one at the North
            end passes under a bridge with a headroom below the
            recommended value of 8ft.      This defect could be
            removed by lowering the floor level, but we believe
             it is far from essential to have such a large headroom,
             and the cost of modification is not justified in an
             existing structure.
                    The exit at the back of Spion Kop would benefit
             from handrails dividing it into lanes.     Some remodelling
             of the approaches to the ramp may also be thought
             desirable.
      (b)    The West Terrace (Including Lower Level at North West Corner)
                       The west terrace has a total area of 1480m       but
             there are no gangways.      We feel that some allowance should
                                                                     SHEET   5.


EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




            be made for circulation space as spectators have
            to move      quite considerable horizontal distances
            to achieve good packing.      The full area would
            justify about 8000 spectators, but we suggest it would
            probably be appropriate to allow 10% as the equivalent
            of gangways giving a capacity of 7200 spectators.
            The barriers should be designed to match this figure
            approximately.      Those barriers which cannot withstand
            6kN/m should be appropriately strengthened, and extra
            ones provided where necessary.
                       The extra barriers required to achieve
            approximately 7200 capacity are shown in red on the
            attached copy of drawing 1610/2X.
                       The three exits have a total width of about
            11.5m which would permit about 1250 people per minute
             to leave the ground.     Thus the terrace could be
            emptied in about six minutes which is very satisfactory.
                       The guide suggests that everyone on a terrace
             should be within 12m of a gangway or exit.     There are
             no gangways and some spectators will be 25m from an
             exit.      But we feel this is of no consequence as
            movement horizontally along this terrace will be easy
             and quick.
     (c)     The North West Corner Reinforced Concrete Terrace
                       This area is also illustrated in the drawing
             1610/2X.   The gross area available (there are no
                                     2
             gangways) is about 565 m .   Thus if the crush barriers
             were adequate and the whole area is included the number
             of spectators could be about 3,050.
                       Provided the existing crush barriers are
             brought up to standard and supplemented in red as
                                                                      SHEET £ '

           shown on our drawing 1610/2X, the area which can
           be used in calculating spectator capacity is that
                                                         2
           shown in green.     This area is about 535m       corresponding
           to about 2900 spectators.     This would bring the total
           standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.
                    The exits serving this part of the terraces
           are very adequate in width and there will be no
           difficulty in emptying in eight minutes.


    Seating Accommodation
    (a)    The North Stand
                    The form of construction of this stand is
           such that it presents a minimum fire hazard.         The
           exits are numerous and spaced so that they satisfy
           the recommendations of the guide.
                    The exits are very marginally below the
           recommended l*lm width, but we do not consider this
           to be of great consequence.
                  Gangways are only 640mm wide for much of their
           length (they widen round the exit).     This is well
           below the green guide recommendation.      However, it
            is clearly appropriate to take into account the
            general nature of the stand, the number as well as
            the width of the gangways, and above all the ease and
            speed   with which spectators can evacuate the stand.
                    On 6 January we counted the number of spectators
            leaving in successive minutes after the final whistle.
            The figures were 71, 72, 80 and 73.    Thereafter
            the number fell off as the spectators were in no hurry.
            This established that in an emergency the green guide
            figure of 80 per minute (relating to a l*lm gangway)
            can be achieved.    With 18 exits for 10,000 spectators
                                                                    SHEET   7,


EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




           the average is 556 per exit.    Thus the stand would
           empty in about seven minutes, which is within the
           recommended limit of eight minutes.
                  Our observations in company with the fire
           officer^ staff on 6 January showed that everyone
           had left this stand, apart from some people who were
           in no hurry, in about six minutes, although we also
           counted about 40 per exit who left before the final
           whistle.    The overall picture appears very satisfactory
           and we suggest that this stand should be accepted
           as not needing any significant modification.

    (b)    The West Stand
                  This stand is very similar to the north stand
           in its construction.    We were not able to accurately
           assess the time taken for it to be vacated on 6
           January because there were many seats which were unsold.
           However, there is every reason to believe that there
           will be no difficulty in vacating this stand within
           eight minutes also.    There should be no need for
           significant modifications.

    (c)    The South Stand
                  The structure has been surveyed and appended
           are prints of our drawings 1610/3, 4 and 5, which
           show the plans and cross-section.     Also attached Is
           a seating plan, drawing No. 1610/6.
                  The upper part of the stand (the covered area)
           has 5710 seats.    These are served by 12 exits (excluding
           those serving the directors box) so that an average
           of 476 people need to pass through each exit.     The
           count by the fire officer's staff on 6 January showed
           an average of about 70 per minute passing through one
           exit which corresponds to an emptying time of about
           seven minutes.    Indeed there were very few people
EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




           still trying to get out six minutes after the final
           whistle.    A few had no doubt left early and a few
           were still standing around, but the stand had
           substantially emptied in about six minutes.
                  Having left the top of the stand the spectators
           have to make their way from the first floor landing
           via one of three staircases.    Two of these are 3.6m
           wide and the other 2.4.    This is equivalent to 17$
           'lanes' of 550mm.    At 40 people per lane, 700 people
           pass per minute.    To discharge 5710 people (less
           those in the directors box) will therefore take almost
           exactly 8 minutes as permitted by the guide.
                  At ground floor level two of the staircases lead
           almost straight to the open air, through a compartment
           which is separated from the main part of the building.
           The third staircase passes through a wide lobby which
           will probably need three sets of self closing fire
           doors to separate it from the remainder of the building.
           The club intends to move the paint store from the
           space behind this staircase.
                  The front, open-air part of the south stand is
           well endowed with exits but these all discharge onto
           one passage.    This passage has a theoretical capacity
           of only about 150 people per minute in each direction.
           This gives an emptying time of 11 minutes.     Because
           the stand is open to the air and there is very
           ready access to the pitch we do not think this rather
           long emptying time is of any great consequence.


   General Requirements
           The police and the fire officer, and possibly the
    Building Surveyor, will no doubt wish to discuss a number of
    matters.   Prior to holding a further formal meeting they
I   i                                                                         SHEET   9.


^EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




        will probably wish to study the drawings and to pay a
        further visit.           We would like to be present when any
        further inspection is made and would appreciate contact
        being made with Dr.                luring Dr. Eastwood's absence
        which will extend to 15 February.
                  If the police would like to suggest the kind of police
        post they would like, this can be considered by the club
        and drawings prepared by us as a matter of urgency.
                  A meeting to discuss all aspects of the application
        might be held around say 16 February.
                  In the meantime Eastwood & Partners will be checking
        the various electrical services so that we shall be in a
        position to discuss these at the meeting.


        F u tu r e Ground C a p a c it y
                  Following the upgrading of the barriers and the carrying
        out of such other works as may be required it is hoped the
        ground capacity will not fall below 50,000 made up as follows
                  Seating approximately                    24,000
                  Standing on Spion Kop                    16,000
                  Standing at Leppings Lane end
                  (total including N.W. corner)            10,100

                                                           50,100

                  It will be recalled that in recent years agreement
        has been reached with the police that 55,000 spectators might
        be admitted to the ground.            This involved of the order of
        19.000 - 20,000 spectators being on Spion Kop.              Indeed, it
        is believed that in the days when crowds of approximately
        70.000 were accommodated in the ground, the figure on Spion
        Kop probably approached 30,000.
                  It should also be emphasised that the ground has an
        excellent safety record stretching over very many years.

                H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

l.    Scope and Objectives of D iscussions

Mr H. E. McGee welcomed the representatives, and stressed that the C'ubwere
ambltlousand wanted to make the Stadium the best In Europe C r w d ih a d b e e n
averaging 11.000 this season and, viewed purely as a football operation, the Club
had been losing money since 1967. Commercial ventures had m ade the Club
viable and It was hoped to expand this side of the Club's activities. The Club s
eventual ambitions obviously had to be tempered by practical considerations.

 IT WAS AGREED -
 1     That whilst Designating Orders did not specify time lim its for the Issue of
 G en era l^ fety Certificates, It was essential to aim for the Certificate to be Issued
 by the start of the 1979/80 Season.
                 2.    That, a s the Club wanted to attract representative gam es, the aim should
                 be for the Stadium to be certificated for maximum crowds.

                 3.    That as much work a s possible should be carried out In the close season,
                 bearing In mind that because of the recent continuous spell of bad weather, this
                 will be more restricted than usual. The Annual Jehovah’s Witness Bally had
                 also to be borne In mind.

                 2.    Discussion on Standing A reas

                 A.    Spton Kop

                 IT WAS AGREED -

         /       1.    That the siting and angle of the new barriers to be Installed be the subject
         J       of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

     )           2.    That the Club consider the Installation of simple lateral barriers (Hot of the
                 climb proof type) for crowd control purposes in the blocks on either side of the
         J       central block (but not so a s to obstruct the gangways).

                 3.     That, In view of the clearance time of I l f minutes compared with the
                 8 minutes specified in the Guide, the means of escape be discussed In detail
                 between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service (including the re-sltlng of the gates
             /   in the existing barriers and, possibly the widening of the existing gates and/or
         J       an Increase In their number).

                 4.   That the headroom at the North end under the bridge be Increased to the
         y       maximum possible without going to the extent of underpinning.

                 5.    That representative parts of the concrete wall and boundary posts and fences
>   1*7
                 be tested to the appropriate standards.

    x^           6,    That the condition of the concrete at the lower end, the height of some of the
                 crush barriers and the scoreboard structure be the subject of detailed discussions
     ^           between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

                 7.    That the Club’s longer term proposals for the Improvement of the means of
                 eg ress be unanimously welcomed.

                 8.    That the maximum capacity of the Spion Kop be determined after the foregoing
                 points have been resolved.




                                                           2   .
B.    West Terrace

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That the Club’s proposals for the Installation of additional barriers and the
reduction In capacity to 7,200 spectators without the need for additional gangways
should be Implemented.

2.    That the question of the c r o ss-fe ll on the steps on the north-west corner
exit, the height of some of the existing crush barriers, as w ell a s their corrosion
and sharp edges In places, be the subject of detailed discussion between
Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

C.    North West Corner Terrace

IT WAS AGREED -

1.    That the Clubs proposals to bring the crush barriers up to standard and
supplemented by new b arriers with a consequent capacity of 2,900 spectators should
be Implemented.

2.    That the Improvement or replacement of the existing corrugated sheeting be
the subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

3.    North Stand

IT WAS AGREED -

1.     That, In view of the obvious difference of opinion between the Club and the
Working Party a s to the appropriate steps (if any) to be taken over the width of the
existing gangways, both sid es be requested to consider all the points made, and
to re-conslder the matter at the next meeting.

2.     That the question of fire protection works to the Store Room and to the Team
Boom be the subject of detailed discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the
F ire Service.

3.     That the replacement (from a fire hazard point of view) of the existing Police
and First-A id Temporary Structures under the Stand be accepted In principle, and
that the facilities required In the new permanent structures be considered later In
the Agenda.

4.     That tiie existing Wire Mesh barriers under the Stand be the subject of
d iscussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service.

5.    That the question of the provision of handrails be the subject of discussions
between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

         4.    West Stand                                                                  .

         it w a s a g b e e d -

         That, whilst the upper level of the Stand can be emptied In the required tim e,
         consideration be given to reducing the congestion which may occur in the lower
         level by examining the possibility of erecting an additional stairway at each
         end of the Stand (possibly of the Fire Escape type for emergency u se, rather
     J   than for normal use).

         5.     South Stand

         IT WAS AGBEED -

         1.     That Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor discuss In detail the apparent
         spalllng of the concrete frame at high levels, apparent corrosion of the main
         steelwork columns, removal of the timber casing at base level for Inspection (2
         only as representative sample), and load testing of a representative sample of
     J   single and double skin w alls.

         2.    That, to overcome the means of escape problems In the upper part of the
         Stand (the covered area), the existing barriers be removed altogether, the Club
         to deal with any problems about different admission charges by way of coloured
         seats or some such alternative.

         3.    That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service discuss the methods of upgrading the
         fire resistance In the central area, protected escape routes, and the provision of
     J   handrails down the stairways.

         4.    That the means of escape problems In the front open air part of the stand
         be dealt with on the West side by making an additional exit for emergency use only
         through the Tea Bar wall to the foot of the existing stairway, and that on the east
     J   side consideration be given to providing an addi tlonal gangway to exit on to the
         derelict land adjoining the Spion Kop.

         5.    That no Immediate answer seemed to be available with regard to a possible
         limitation on the use of the car park behind the Stand by entitled persons Immediately
         before a match, even though police had control of Its use after a match.

         6.    Ground Exits

         Dr. Eastwood apologised that the 1:500 site plan had, unknown to him, not been
         alreacty supplied some time ago. He undertook to ensure that copies were
         circulated without delay.




                                                 4.
7.     Communications

IT WAS AGBEED That consideration would be given to the Installation of an
improved public address system , with the Police having a c c e ss to Its control
from their Control Boom, together with Its use as a fire alarm system , subject
to an emergency back-up system In the event of failure.

S.     police and F irst Aid F acilities

IT WAS AGBEED-

1.     That the Club accept the principle of permanently contructed Police and
F irst Aid F acilities.

2      That the Police would supply the Club Secretary with a copy of their Initial
sketch plan showing the fa cilities they wished to see, and that Dr. Bailey would
Inspect the existing first-a id and medical facilities and then discuss future
facilities with Dr. Eastwood.

 9.    Any other Topics

 IT WAS AGBEED That Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service d iscuss the existing
 and any proposed em ergency generating and fire-fighting equipment.

 10.    Future Action

 The Club stressed that they wished to carry out as much work a s possible bef° re
 the issue of the C ertificate by the start of the 1979/80 Season. If this was to be done,
 It was essential that any points for discussion between the various representatives
 of the Working Party and Dr. Eastwood had to be cleared without delay.

 11.    Date of Next Meeting

 IT WAS AGBEED That the next meeting should be held at 2 .30 p .m . on
 Wednesday, 18th A pril, 1979, at the Stadium.

Apologies lor absence were received from Dr.            (Shcffield Area Health-
Authority) and H. E. Wright (South Yorkshire bounty *ire Service).

The Note (previously circulated) of the meeting held on 2ndApril, 1979, was considered
In conjunction with a Note (circulated at the meeting) of a meeting between Eastwood
and Partners, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the City of Sheffield
Metropolitan D istrict Council Building Surveyor’s Department held on 13th April, 197S.

The Note of the meeting held on 2nd April, 1979, was agreed, subject to the following
amendments and additions in the light of the further Investigations and discussions

2A     Spion Kop

P aras. 1 & 2 - Bevlsed copies of drawing no. 1610/IX were circulated at the meeting
showing the proposed new crush barrier layout, Including the two lines of radial
barriers. This was AGBEED In principle.

Para. 3 - A 16, 850 crowd capacity on the Kop as existing would mean an unacceptable
evacuation time of som e 12-i m inutes. Larger and re-aligned gates in the barrier
and improvement of the existing upper exit could reduce tills time to som e 10 minutes,
but 8 minutes could only be achieved by installing a new exit of 3 metre overall width.
This could be integrated into the proposed future scheme for enlarging and roofing the
Kop. The Club AGREED to give consideration to the proposals.


                                      1.
                                                                                    ,:-r-   -w




           Para. 4 - The exploratory work regarding the Improvement of the headroom had
to i j -   still to be carried out, but was not expected to be a major Item.

           Para. 5 - Because of the difficulty In devising a suitable method of testing In places
           (such as the top of the Kop), it was AGBEED that proposals should be formulated
           after further discussions between Dr. Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.

           Para. 6 - The Club accepted that the concrete required attention and that the scoreboard
           structure should be looked at. It was AGBEED that the question of the height of some
           of the crush barriers be considered again after it was seen which of them failed on
           testing.

           Para. 7 - The Club stressed that their proposals for the Improvement of the means of
           egress would hopefully be carried out In the shorter rather than the longer term future.

           Para. 8 - The Club hoped that the testing of the existing crush barriers, together with
           the Installation of the new crush barrier layout and alteration of the gates in the existing
           barrier, could all be carried out in the close season. Their aim was to achieve a
           16,850 crowd capacity.

 t<Xl      Para. 2 - The Club accepted that In view of the cro ss-fa ll on the north-west corner
           exit, the steps should be re-bullt. It was AGBEED that the other matters would be
           considered again after It was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.

           2C     North West Corner Terrace

           Para. 2 - Whilst accepting the need for the Improvement or replacement of the
           existing corrugated sheeting, the Club felt they wished to consider whether to carry
           wit more extensive works so as to bring the existing unused area Into use for an
           additional 250/300 spectators.

           3.      North Stand

           Para. 1 - Dr. Eastwood,, the Building Surveyors and the Fire Service had reached
           agreement on a schem e which could be recommended to the Club. This would
           involve the removal of 10 seats from each of the 9 gangways and 4 seats from in
           front of each of the 9 upper ex its. The result would mean a loss of 126 seats
           compared to the 225 In the original proposals. The Club AGREED to give
           consideration to the proposal.

           Para. 2 - The word at the end of the first line should have been 'Tea1 and not ’Team ’.
           It w as AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service would discuss In detail any
           fire protection works considered to be necessary.

          The Club AGREED that additional exits o f simple steel construction should be
   W '    provided from each end of the upper stand.

          5.     South Stand

          Para. 1 - The bases of two stanchions had been exposed by removing floor tim ber.
          Whilst rusting was not ex ce ssiv e, it was AGREED that all bases would be exposed for
          Inspection and, if necessary, steel plating will be welded to any corroded parts before
          encasing in concrete for permanent protection. Because of the apparent accumulation
          of waste paper, wood shavings and cigarette ends beneath the floor boards, the
          Club a lso AGREED that the space beneath the timber floor should be cleaned out.

          Para. 2 - Provided the penning barriers were removed entirely, It was AGREED that
5.w.T c   It would not be necessary to remove any seats for escape purposes In the upper part
          of the stand (the covered area).

          Para. 3 - It was AGREED that timber handrails should be provided down each of the
          outer edges of the main staircase; that the existing iron centre railing should remain,
          and that a new handrail down the centre of each side of the stairway should be Installed.
          It was also AGREED that the brick staircase walls should be buttressed where crowd
          su ig e pressure could be generated.

          Para. 4 - So far as the front open air part of the stand was concerned, It was AGREED
          that on the west side a new exit through a new 1.2 metre wide door adjacent to the existing
          snackbar should be provided, with appropriate fire resistance m easures in the
  i       surrounding area. On the ea st sid e, consideration was given to an extension of the
          footway at the front of the stand and the removal of the wall, provided the new exit was
F-S       Isolated from the Kop exit. It was AGREED that Dr. Eastwood and the Fire Service
          should consider p recisely what m easures could be considered satisfactory so as to
          avoid any loss of sea ts.

          6.     Ground Exits

          The 1:500 site plan was In the process of being circulated.

          7.      Com muni cations

          The Club stressed they were thinking In terms of an upgrading of the existing public
          address sy stem . It was AGREED that the Police should have an over-ride facility
          from their Police Room, and Dr. Eastwood undertook to look into the possibility of
          achieving this through radio, rather than wire, means.

          8.      Police and F irst Aid F acilities

          P aras. 1 & 2 - The Police stressed that It was essential that there was no gap In
          the provision of Police F acilities when the temporary structure was replaced by
          the permanent structure. With this In mind, they were happy for the safety aspects


                                                  3.

                                                                                          /
to receive first priority and to wait for the 1980 close season for the work to be
carried out. It was understood that Dr. Bailey had not yet completed his investigations
Into the first-aid and medical facilities.

9.     Any other Topics

The evening of the 27th April was agreed as mutually convenient to test the existing
emergency lighting equipment.

10.    Future Action

Mr. McGee stressed that It was essential for decisions to be taken urgently if the
Club were to complete their plans, both from a financial and practical point of view.

The Club were to make application for financial assistan ce under the Football
Association's Ground Improvement Scheme, and had to have over 50,00.0 crowd
capacity if the aim of attracting international matches was to be achieved. The latest,
proposals, If implemented, appeared to give a capacity of som e 50,750.

So that they could be noted and returned for agreement, the Working Party asked for
2 copies of all plans (as revised) to be supplied by Dr. Eastwood, especially to the
Fire Service and the Building Surveyor.

Mr. McGee requested that he be advised If it appeared that any undue delay was
occurring as the Club wished to ensure that the certification procedure proceeded without
delay.

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

 I have now received the detailed comments of all of the disciplines
 represented on the Working Party.

 These have been collated into the attached schedule which, together with
 plans, confirm form ally in writing the matters discussed by the Working
 Party with the Club over the se r ie s of meetings held so far and which
 the County Council feel require attention so as to secure reasonable
 safety at the Ground.

 They are, of course, individual requirements on specific m atters and are
 additional to the general requirements set out In the specim en form of
 General Safety Certificate forwarded to the Club with my letter of
 8th December, 1978, and d iscussed at the meeting held on 13th December,                                      GuJfr
 1978.

 After the Club has had the opportunity of considering the schedule, perhaps
 you would let me know which of the requirements you feel will be able to
 be carried out In the clo se season.

 Should you have any q u eries, Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (ext. 422) would
 be happy to discuss them with you.

                                           Yours faithfully,

                            reduced lighting output, it may be necessary to provide a number of
                            illuminated exit boxes.

                                                       4.
 Emergency Procedure

 Emergency procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout
 the ground.

 A ccess for Emergency Vehicles
                                                                                  tJlitiLl sUyt.t
 1.       Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct                —,
           access can be obtained by em ergency vehicles to all exterior parts of             ^
          the stadium.                                                             ^ ^

 2.       Ensure that parked vehicles will not obstruct emergency vehicles on
          these access roads.

 Public Address System

 The existing public address system to be upgraded, with the Police having an
 over-ride facility from their P olice Room.

 P olice Facilities

 A suitable permanent Police Room (with facilities as shown on the sketch plan
 marked AA ) to be provided in the 1980 close season.

 F irst Aid Facilities

 (i)      Structure

           The existing facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
 f        and it is suggested the Club consider providing a more permanent
 **       structure which is not likely to require up-grading for a very long tim e,
ir        The internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
           impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered fairly
           sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the use of
           tile s or formica type finish e t c . . . .

  (ii)    Waiting Area

           The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to m inim ise
           the cost, where sitting ca ses could wait for attention on ch airs.

  (iii)    Treatment Area

           The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
           patients at any one tim e, and consideration should be given to the needs
           for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
           patients may well be lying on couches.
                              i



(Iv)     Lighting

         Good lighting is essen tial and strip lighting would be satisfactory. The
         provision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.

(v)      Water

         A supply of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
         for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
         be provided. The Club might consider whether it would be cheaper in
         the long run to provide stainless steel basins which are not subject to
         chipping.

(vi)     Toilet Requirements

         The Club should provide at least one male and one fem ale toilet, for
         the use of the public, and should consider whether they should provide
         an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

(vii)    Storage

         Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
         wheels for stretch ers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
         be lockable.

(viii)   Equipment

         The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service

         Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
         on space available and/or number of cuhicles, if the accommodation is
         cubicled.

         Six Stretchers.
         Two sets of stretch er w heels.
         20 Blankets.
         Six Pillow s.
         One Minute-Man R esuscitator.

(ix)     Telephone F a cilities

         A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. This could be
         achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
         police.




                                    6.
(x)    Car P arking

       The Club might also consider what facilities could be extended to the
       St. John's personnel for the parking of staff cars.

Crowd Capacity

The following numbers will be considered to be satisfactory, provided that the
recommended work as detailed above is carried out:-

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

Further to my letter of 19th July, the provisional drawings In respect
of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club’s Hillsborough Stadium have
been considered In detail by the Officer Working Party. As you are
aware, a marked set of the drawings have subsequently been
collected by a member of your staff from the office of the Building
Surveyor at the Town Hall, Sheffield, on 2nd August.

I would stress that the notes on the drawings cover essential points
and are without prejudice to any future detailed requirements.

A s agreed, I should be obliged if you deposit a complete set of
drawings showing the "as built” construction.

                                    Yours faithfully,




                                    Chief Executive.

Dear Sir
                                                                2 3 AUG 1979
Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975                        -................................................

As I think you are aware from the conversations which Mr. D. Vaughan of my
staff has had with you from time to time, the County Council has always had in
mind that if possible the Certificate in respect of the Hillsborough Stadium would
be issued in September. This possibility was based on the assumption that the
required works would be conp leted by that tim e, and also the Club's request
that the Stadium be certificated to maximum capacity by the start of the 1979/80
Season.

However, it Is obvious that despite all the progress to date, It will not be possible
for the Club to conp lete In the next few weeks all of the work set out in the
Schedule of Matters Requiring Attention forwarded with my letter of 8th June. The
County Council has particularly In mind the structural and fire resistance works
required to the South Stand, and the Officer Working Party is endeavouring to let
M essrs. Eastwood and Partners have comments by 3rd September as requested
by their letter dated 10th August.

The County Council would be loathe to Issue a Certificate In September with a
restricted capacity, and I believe such a step would also not be in accordance with
the Club’s w ishes.

With these facts in mind, I think it would be m ore realistic to aim to issue the
Certificate at the beginning of December, and so allow the Club more time in
which to complete the required works. It would a s s is t If you could let me know
the Club's programme for the completion o f the required works.

An extra copy of this letter Is attached for your u se should you wish to pass It for
comment to M essrs. Eastwood and Partners.

                                               Yours feithftilly,

M r. Whitehead welcomed the representatives and explained that, delays caused prim ariiy
by the wet weather, had meant that all of the required work had not been completed by
today’s meeting as the Club had originally envisaged.

The Schedule of M atters requiring attention (dated 8th June, 1079) was considered, with
the following resu lts (after site inspection \vhers n ecessary):-

4.         Except for one o r two areas o i theriopr, r.’l of th« concrete terracing had beer
           made good.
The future of the score-board building was still undecided but, If a decision
to be made shortly was to retain It, supporting calculations would be forwarded
to the Building Authority.

Work carried out. T est report to be forwarded to the Building Authority.

Work carried out.

North Stand

Work carried out.

North Stand (Lower Level Access) (Upper Level Access)

Work In hand. Should be completed in next few days.

North West Terrace

To prevent local damage to the sheeting, particularly at the joints and to
spread the anticipated load over a larger area than at present, it was agreed
that a continuous horizontal timber member should be fixed to the front of the
sheets at a height about one metre from terrace level.

Work carried out.

W sst Stand

It was agreed that, whilst the only positive way of proving the adequacy of the
joint between the new and existing construction was by means of a test load,
the calculations provided would be regarded as acceptable.

West Terrace

Work carried out.

Work carried out.

South Stand (Rear)

It was agreed that, provided seat no. 26 was replaced by a flush fitting type
without arms, the two additional exits from the directors box would not be
Insisted upon.

             necessary remedial work.

    (Ix)     It was agreed that a test load of 200 lb/ft would be applied along the
             whole length.

    2.       R e-assessm ent to be carried out shortly.

    H.       Emergency Lighting

    1&        It was obvious that there was a difference of opinion as to what could be
    2        regarded as acceptable as regards fee emergency lighting in the South
              Stand. It was agreed that a trial should beconducted during the hours of
              darkness attended by representatives, of th<? Club and Ihs Fire Service so
              a s to identify the danger areas. Consideration would then be given to
              possibly installing an extra battery and additional wiring to those particular
              areas not covered by fee emergency lighting covering other parts of the
              ground.

    L____ Fire Warning System

              The problems with the public address S5'Stem seem ed to be mainly ones of
              diction and correct volume level. It was agreed that the police would monitor the
              position at the next home match and, pending the new police control post being
              erected, would arrange for an officer to sit alongside the Disc Jockey In the
              meantime.

              It was also agreed that the monitoring point for the fire detection equipment
              should be In the tower between fee South and West Stands, and would proceed
              once the electrical work was completed.

    J.        F i re Extinguishers

              The fire extinguishers had been delivered and were to be fitted shortly as
              shown on fee plan. The Fire Service undertook to clear any doubtful points.
K.     General Fire Precautions

1.   ’ *Work in hand.

2.     Work to be carried out shortly.

       To be done shortly In consultation with Fire Service.

M.     Notices - Exit Signs

1.     To be erected after decorations complete.

2.     Will be put in hand once agreement reached on emergency lighting.

N.     Emergency Procedure

       It was agreed that the Fire Service would supply the Club with details of the
       necessary wording.

Q.____ A ccess for Emergencv Vehicles

1.     It was agreed that whilst no real problems had occurred In the past, the Club
        would (in consultation with the Fire Sex-vice and the Police) mark out o lane
        from the main gate to the South Stand in which parking would not be allowed.
        It was also agreed that the hydrant outside the South Stand would have to be
        kept clear.

P.     Public Address System

       Already discussed under "Fire Warning System"

Q.     P olice FacHites and R. First Aid Facilities

       As agreed, a suitable permanent Police Room would be provided in the 1980
       closed season.

       The Club explained that it would be preferable from'a building point of view
       for both the police and first aid facilities to be in the same overall building
       although physically separated. The police rqiresentatives reserved their
       position on this point, ponding the outcome of detailed discussions with the
       Club.

       The question of parking for both police and St. John's personnel purposes
       would also need to be looked at in detail.

S.____ Ground Capacity

        Provided the outstanding points   wjhv   satisfactorily resolved, it was agreed
        that the crowd capacity would be a:; shown, i . e . a total of 50,174.
T.          Issue of C ertificate

The Club were anxious that the Certificate should be in force by the derby game
with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning, and they were assured that providing
the outstanding points were satisfactorily resolved, it was stiU the intention to
issue the Certificate at the beginning of December.

     providing:-
              that the existing purely wooden furniture in the P ress Box was not replaced
     <*>
              by modern plastic/foam type,

     (b)      that a member of staff was present In the Bar throughout aU of the period
              It was open to the public and also whilst a match was being played, and

      te)     that the use of the luncheon room was confined as at present to use over
              the lunch-time period on other than match days and was kept locked at all
               other tim es.

     Dear Sir,

         Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
     As was discussed at the neeting cn 12th November between representatives of
     the Club and the Officer Working Party, the question of the issue of the
     General Safety Certificate and the fee to be charged was put to the County
     Carmittee concerned this morning.

         Subject to the outstanding points being satisfactorily resolved, the
         Committee has approved of the issue of the Certificate and has recaimended
         that the question of the fee to be charged should be discussed with another
         Carmittee before a decision is reached. This approval will, of course, be
         subject to formal confirmation by the County Council cn 19th December.

             principal outstanding matters are still those relating to the South Stand
                   cn 12th Novenber, namely, remedial works to the steel oolums and
         the emergency lighting system. I understand that little or no progress has
         been made on these two matters.
         VJhiist the County Council recognises the Club's oo-operaticn in carrying cut
         by far the majority of the measures recommended by the Officer Working Parly,
         I am sure you will appreciate the position viiich will be created should
         progress not be made quickly cn these two outstanding major items.
     _                                                       Yours faithfully,

          Dear Mr. Stenton,
                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                  As promised in my discussion with Mr# Sherrif yesterday,
          I write to record the load tests which have recently been
          carried out.      We have not yet finished writing up the
          report on the testing of all crush barriers but I can give
          an assurance that all barriers except one were brought up
          to standard during August and that the remaining barrier
          has recently been tested and satisfactorily passed the green
          book requirement.
               We have also managed to apply test loads at two or three
          places along the boundary fence adjacent to the tunnel exit
          from Spion Kop and in each case, the fence withstood the
          required sideways load for handrailing set out in the green
          book.
                  We have also test loaded -the wall in the small
          triangular area below the tunnel exit from Spion Kop to the
          full 6 kN/m requirement.
               In the South stand we test loaded on a 2m length at the
          foot of each of the access gangways with the full crush barrier
          load of 6 kN/m length.      We have also test loaded every
          complete span of the balustrade under a load of 3 kN/m length.
          Ip all cases the load was withstood without distress.
                                                      Yourssincerely,
                                                                                                                           %o

 Dear Mr. England,
                 Certificate of Ground Safety, 1979
                      Test on Crush Barriers,                               Balustrades and Fences
            We have pleasure in presenting a formal report drawing
 together the results of all the load tests on crush barriers,
 fences etc. which were carried out between June and December
 1979.


 Crush Barriers
       The first series of tests were made on all the barriers
 existing at the time of the application for a safety certificate.
 These are shown on the attached prints of drawings Nos. 1610/61 and
 62.        The barrier numbers used in the following descriptions of
 the tests are as shown on these two drawings.


 (a )       A total of 19 barriers failed to carry the specified test
            load of 6 kN/m length when first tested.                                              Seven of these
            failures (Nos. 40, 41, 42, 57, 58, 62 and 68) were caused
            by defective retaining clips on the horizontal rails.
            Seven failed because the horizontal rail suffered permanent
            deformation (Nos. 34, 87, 91, 92, 93, 97 and 98) and five

           19, 37 and 38).
                During the course of the testing careful inspection
           was made of each barrier and it was found that, although
           they passed the test, a number of barriers had minor
           defects mainly due to corrosion.     A total of 32 new clips,
           eight new rails and five new posts were fitted in addition
^          to strengthening of those barriers which failedthe test.
           All protruding or sharp edges were removed.
                One further barrier was modified because it was initially
           significantly lower than the minimum height recommended in the
           green Code of Practice.
                Following construction of the new additional barriers on
           Spion Kop and the completion of repairs to the old barriers
           a second series of tests was made.    All the new barriers
           and all the repaired barriers now passed the test.


     (b)   Leppings Lane
                In the first series of tests six barriers (Nos. 104,
           105, 106, 107, 110 and 123) had failures of the    tube
4^         retaining clips.    Five barriers (Nos. 107, 114, 115,    121 and 130)
           suffered permanent deformation of the horizontal rail.
                All these barriers were repaired.     In addition 13 new
           clips and five rails which were badly corroded were replaced,
           and any protruding or sharp edges removed.
                After construction of the new barriers, they and all
           the repaired barriers were tested and all withstood the
           test load satisfactorily.


     (c)   North West Corner
                The initial testing of the first few barriers in this
           corner showed that all of them were only capable of taking
           about half the test load.    The rails deflected excessively
           and the holding down bolts were also inadequate.
                                                                     SHEET

               Major strengthening in the form of extra posts to
         shorten the span of the rails and to share the load with
         the existing posts were installed.     A new type of holding
         down arrangement was devised.
               When re-tested all existing barriers plus all the
         new barriers successfully withstood the specified load.


^ T h e Safety Cage
        When the first series of tests were made on the crush
  barriers it was found that the safety cage along both ends of
  the ground had defective supports.       It was found that certain
  holding down bolts had not been fixed when the fence was
  installed.     There was also a need for support from the
  concrete perimeter wall in some places.      After appropriate
  remedial work the fence was successfully test loaded in 4m sections
  along both ends of the ground using the normal crush barrier
  loading of 6 kN/m length.


  Boundary Fences
^       Concern had been felt for the boundary fence along the
  edge of the ramp from Spion Kop.       Any failure of this fence
  as the crowd leaves the ground could result in people being
  spilled down a steep bank.     The whole length of this fence
  from the score board down to the bottom was therefore tested
  using the lateral force specified in the green Code of 2.74 kN/m.
  The whole length carried the load satisfactorily.
         The continuation of this fence round to the north-east
  corner of the pitch, plus the two lines of fence which protect
  the island of spectators to the west of the tunnel were also
  appropriately tested (the lengths marked in red on the attached
  print of drawing 1610/11).     All the sections successfully
  carried the test load without signs of distress.
         It was also found to be possible to test load five sections
  of the boundary fence round the top of Spion Kop as shown by the
  short red lines.     The load applied was again that appropriate to
                                                                      SHEET   4 •



 EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




   the lateral force on exit routes.       Again the load was
   satisfactorily resisted.


   South Stand   Balustrade
         The final testing was on the south stand      balustrade.
   At the foot of every gangway a length of 2m was subjected
   to the same test load as crush barriers i.e. 6 kN/m length.
   In every case this load was resisted without distress.
         In between the gangways, the      balustrade was subjected
   to a test load of 3 kN/m length applied to the whole span
   between successive pairs of supports.      Again the load was
   everywhere satisfactorily resisted.


   Future Numbering of Crush Barriers
         Many of the barriers have been lengthened and also
   additional barriers have been installed.       It is obviously
   inappropriate to continue with the old numbering system.
   We therefore include prints of two new drawings 1610/63 and 64 which
   show a new numbering system for Spion Kop and the whole of the
^ w e s t end of the ground.   It is proposed that these numbers
^ w i l l be used in all future reports.

     Dear Sirs,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited

     I thank you for your letter dated 15th July.

     After consultations with the Building Authority and in view of the fact
     that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, the County
     Council is able to agree this year with the course of action which you
     propose. However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
     upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as
     to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
     25(2) of the Safety Certificate.

     May I also mention the Certificates by:-

     (a)     a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
             paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) as to all structural
             parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

     (b)     an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
              26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
             within the Stadium; and

     (c)     an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
              12(2) of the Safety Certificate) as to the condition of the
             Emergency Power Supply.

     I take it that if the Club has not already done so, they will shortly be
     requesting you to supply these.

                                                               Yours faithfully,

           D.I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

        Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the second in the twice-yearly programme of visits by Officer
Working Parties to all five League Football Clubs in South Yorkshire, as
mentioned at the meeting on 10th February, 1981, and originally referred to
in the Chief Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981. The
visit on 7th April had been a special one in view of the Stadium being the
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2.      Inspection of Stadium

The representatives made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)     South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
trusses referred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, in
the absence of Dr. W. Eastwood, no specific answer could be g\ven.

It was noted that the monitoring device to be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for the
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had yet to
be provided.

(b)     West Stand

The cracked brickwork at the rear of the stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars* supporting the steps at the rear of the
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets of stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to the new emergency exit
(nearest to the South Stand).

Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match, the Club were
considering revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the Stand.
An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
when these had substance.


                                    -1 -
(c)   North-West Terrace

The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

It was also noted’that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
area to the rear had been protectively wrapped.

(d)   North Stand

The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
Kop) had been made good.

(e)   Spion Kop

The infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
original exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would
be attended to shortly.

The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
new Kop exit outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest of the
Kop original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
extend the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season

(f)   General

It was noted

(i)    that the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the
rear of the Butcher's Shop on Penistone Road required attention because of
corrosion, and (ii) that the top of the brick built wall between the Spion

For the attention of Mr. P. Vaughan.

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
              Radial Fences at Loppings Lane End
     Ve have been Instructed by the Club to organise the
installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
Loppings lane end of the ground.
     It is Intended that these fences are so positioned
that they divide this section of the terrace into
approximately three equal areas, each served by its own
entrance.
     By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
should result. A visiting teas with only a few follovers
will be allocated one section, with the other two sections
retained by the hone supporters.
     Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers
dictate.
     A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
during a gams. The gate could be left open, but fastened
back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones
                                                                 \/
are accupled by supporters of the sane team. When establishing
the height we have considered that the views to the corner
flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
present by the perimeter fence. We therefore propose that the
top of the fence should be approximately 1680mm above the
terrace.
     This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James's
Park, the home of Newcastle United.
     We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
within the Working Party and your cooraents forwarded to us.
     Also to be Included in the same contract are some gates at
various locations around the north stand. Now the gymnasium is
open to the general public security toother parts of the ground
must be maintained. It is proposed that gates are provided at
the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
gates at ground floor level at the Penlstone Road end of the
stand. A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to
prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards
Lepplngs Lane.
     Six copies of our drawing 3363/1 together with two copies
of our drawings 3563/2 and 3 (for reference only) are enclosed.


                                   Tours sincerely,

OurRef:    DV/SY/583/5          YourRef: WE/KH/3563            Date: 14th September, 1981,



Dear Sir,                                      ijQSLVy ood cit Partners
Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 ,                     15 SEP1981
Sheffield Wednesday Football CKuh

Referring to your letter of 9th September, the Officer Working Party
(Sheffield District) has considered the proposals referred to in your
letter of 2nd September and accompanying plans.

1.      Radial Barriers on West Terrace

Whilst welcoming the increased control on the Terrace which should
result, concern was expressed as to the problems which could occur with
opposing fans mixing at the rear of the West Stand and/or at the entry/
exit gates. However, it was felt that only experience would show
whether this would prove to be a reality and, if realised, whether the
problem was of such a small scale that it could be easily coped with by
the police.

Accordingly, the Officer Working Party at this stage sees no objection
to the proposals to instal two 1680 mm high radial barriers, with 1.15
metre gates at the rear, on the West Terrace, subject to:-

I (a) the further calculations required by the Building Authority being
'     satisfactory (Mr. Sheriff to contact you direct);

 (b) confirmation that adequate headroom will be available at the rear
     of the Terrace after installation of the barriers and gates, and

 (c) the new gates at the rear of the Terrace also being under police
      control.

 2.     Security Gates around North Stand

 The Officer Working Party fully recognises the Club's need to provide
 security for the remainder of the stadium when only the gymnasium is in
 «se.                                                  c jlj

 Provided that the gates and/or their Supports, hinges, etc. do not
 impinge on the existing critical ramp widths and the gates are secured
 {jj the fully open position on match days, the Officer Working Party
 sees no objection to the erection of security gates around the North Stand

3.     Other Matters

Two other matters were also raised by the Officer Working Party relating
to the Police and First Aid Facilities and the siting of certain of the
Lottery Ticket Boxes.

(a)    Police and First Aid Facilities

       It was recalled that the existing unsatisfactory police and first
       aid facilities under the North Stand had been accepted on an interim
       basis on the understanding that the Club would provide purpose built
       replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

       It is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements are
       still continuing, but it is felt that the Club should be asked to give
       a firm indication when the new police and first aid facilities are to
       be provided.
 (b)   Lottery Ticket Boxes

       Concern was expressed as to the blocked egress which could result if
       the timber lottery ticket boxes presently sited close to the ramps
       were to be tipped over or ignited, either accidentally or deliberately.

       The Officer Working Party felt that the Club should be requested to
       re-site the boxes in a less critical position.

I attach an additional copy of this letter for your use.

                                         Yours faithfully,




                                         Chief Executive.

        Dear Eric,
                          Safety of Sports Grounds Act
            I enclose a copy of a letter from David Vaughan dated             *
        14 September from which you will see that the proposal to
        instal the radial barriers on the West terrace and to
        provide security gates round the North stand are accepted,
        although with some reservations in the case of the radial
        barriers.    Twoothers matters are also raised, that of the
    ^   Police and first aid facilities and also the lottery ticket
        boxes •
            I intend to walk round the ground at the end of the week
        to inspect the various minor works associated with strengthening
        crush barriers and boundary fences before issuing a certificate
        for this year's testing programme.    I will telephone before
        I cane so that we can have a chat for a few minutes.


                                         Yours sincerely.

»vv 100   tXaU       ^ In reply to your letter dated 14th December, 1981, I understand that
                      the Building Authority has contacted your office direct for clarification
                      on a small number of points regarding the proposed installation of pairs
                      of gates at the bottom of the two staircases at the back of the West
                      Stand. Subject to the satisfactory resolution of these points and, of
                      course, to the gates being secured in the fully open position during the
                      time the public parts of the stadium are occupied when matches are
                      being played, the Officer Working Party has no objection to the proposals.

                      As regards the radial fences installed on the West Terrace and the
                      security gates around the North Stand, the Officer Working Party wishes
                      to make the following comments

                       (a)      Radial Barriers on West Terrace

                       The matches played at the stadium since the installation of the barriers
                       confirm that they appear to be working well and satisfactorily effect the
                       segregation of opposing groups of fans. However, the entire section of
                       the Terrace has yet to be given to one group of fans.

                       The Police inform me that, on installation of the new radial barriers,
                       the existing crush barriers have been extended in some places up to and
                       completely through the new radial barriers at a height of 4’6” or so
                       from the ground. The effect is to make it very easy for fans to climb
UKjt . TLt-j     ^     from one pen to another. In other places the existing crush barrier
                       rails have been cut off short of the radial barriers in a manner which
      y+JiuJt          leaves dangerous pieces protruding into some of the gangways.

                       (b)       Security Gates around the°North Stand
                 /
                 kb I*. You will recall that my letter of 14th September, 1981 stated that,
                       provided that the gates and/or their supports, hinges, etc., do not
                       impinge on the existing critical rang) widths, the Officer Working Party
                       saw no objection to the erection1?of the~security gates.
                                                                                 wvJr               -
                       I am informed that the manner in which the gates have been installed
                       has resulted in each gate's hinge impinging at least 7i" into the width*
                       of the ramp. This means that there is a 15" reduction in width of the 1

  As the Annual winter inspection of the Hillsborough Stadium is due
  to take place anytime around now, I would suggest the opportunity be
  taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

  Perhaps you would contact Mr. D. Vaughan of my staff (extension 422)
  so that the necessary arrangements may be made.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                    Safety of Sports Ground Act
        Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
        I believe the small number of points needing
clarification have already been discussed between
John Strange and Mr. Sheriff.      One of these refers to the
need for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
in fact already provided by the sheeting fratae.     There is
also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
of reinforcement in the 100mm thick retaining wall.      There
is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
maintenance repair will be carried out.
        Turning now to the radial barriers on the West
terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
it will make it easifcr for anyone who so wishes to climb
over.   Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
leave the crush barriers as they are.      If all barriers
were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
would mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.
There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator
capacity which is undesirable from the Club's p4int of
view.     However from the point of view of safety a strip
of that width without a single crush barrier would be a
major hazard.
          It ahould be kept in mind that the introduction
of these radial barriera has affected a very great
improvement from the point of view of segregation of
spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
view of segregation brings with it other disadvantagea.
Z believe that what we have done la a reasonable compromise
between the varioua interests.
          In the second paragraph on this subject you
refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
crush barriers.     I have not had an opportunity to check
this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
the word 'dangerous* is a little exaggerated and they
do not of course protrude into a gangway aa there is no
gangway at this position.
          With regard to the security gates around the North
stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into
the gate width is at all critical.     The remaining clear
width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a aix unit exit.
Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
eight minutea using the green book figure of 60 people
per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
routea.    The stand capacity ia of courae 10,000 and in
practice more than half the number tend to uae the lower
exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
to the upper set of exit stairways.     The picture is that
fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight minutes.
        there were very good structural reasons for placing
the gates in this way.   The theoretical exifc capacity has
not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
There is no funnelling effect, and there is a good
'reservoir' area upstreaa of the gates.
        t telephoned your office yesterday but gather
you were on leave and have again telephoned this aorning
with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter
meeting of the working party.    Z will try again in the
next day or so.


                                Yours sincerely.

                        Note of a Meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
                            Sheffield on 4th February, 1982


        PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd

                   E. England        (Secretary)
                   Dr. W. Eastwood    (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)
                   J. Strange        (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)

                   Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

                   Ms. J. Barker        (South Yorkshire Police)
                   R. Hero Id           (South Yorkshire Police)

                                        (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District
                                         Council)
                   D. I. Vaughan        (South Yorkshire County Council)
                                        (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

        1.    Purpose of Meeting

        The purpose of the meeting was to discuss^£he apparent difference o£ opinion
        on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
        and the security gates at the top of the North stand ramps, as well as to
        carry out the usual winter inspection of the Stadium.

        2.___ Ground Inspection

        A.   West Terrace

        Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
        erection of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
        satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

        However, the police pointed out that in places the existing crush barriers
        had been extended up to and, in some cases, completely through the new
        radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
        who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, in the pen
        nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
        left unsupported.

        IT WAS AGREED -

        (i)   That, on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
        prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
        through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
        able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
        current season.

    j   (ii) That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
v       be cut off.

                                                -   1-

                                                                                        /
B.     West Stand •

One of the security gates which the Club wished to instal at the bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.

IT WAS AGREED     that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

C.     North Stand

The Fire Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

The Club’s Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on the figure to be
applied in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
of the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.

IT WAS AGREED   that, as the point might well have been covered in the
initial consideration of the Club's application for a General Safety
Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

       NOTE -    A search of the file subsequently revealed that, as
                suspected, the point had been considered at a
                meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.2.79,
                the relevant part of the Note of the meeting reading:-

                  "the construction and width of the ramps being
                   such that they could quite.properly be
                   regarded as elevated roadways".

D.    Spion Kop

It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
the left of the original exit at the top of the Kop had taken place;that
the boundary fence at the top of the Kop had been reinforced, andthat the
existing barriers had been permanently extended and the area at the foot
of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
levelled off as agreed.

E.        South Stand

The agreement to visually inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection
after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions was recalled.

 F.    Items    of General Maintenance

 IT WAS AGREED     that the following items of general maintenance required
 attention:-

 (i)   The rounding off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
 the exit at the southerlyendof the West Stand    (to be done that day), as
 well   as the rounding off ofthe brackets to the NorthStand securitygates.

 (ii) The repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
 fencing and sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
 Gate "0".
/
(iii)    The cracks‘in the concrete terracing    of the Spion Kop   to befilled.

(iv)    The wooden support to the electrical    line between the    brickbuilt
refreshment point and the Owls Club to be fixed more securely.

(v)   The brick wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop (nearest
to the South Stand) to be pointed.

(vi)    The concrete supporting strut to the     wall between the SpionKop and
the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop)       to be protected (cracks and
exposed bar).

G.      Temporary Structures

Concern was expressed as to the possibility of inadequate structural stability
of temporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection with
television transmissions.

Paragraph 20 of the Club’s General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
and portable equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreed
between the Police and the Club.    The Club also weregenerally required  to
ensure that the Stadium complied   with good engineering andbuildingpractices
and with the relevant British Standard Specification or Code of Practice.

IT WAS AGREED that the question of temporary structures should be kept
under review, and that the Club’s Consultants should give advice to the
Club.

3.      Future Developments

A.      Police and First Aid Facilities

It was likely that, following continuing consultations with the Police, the
Club would shortly be in a position to formally notify the County Council
that the new Police and First Aid Facilities would be provided in the
forthcoming close season.

B.      Additional Turnstiles and Exit Gate in Penistone Road

The Club hoped to formally notify the County Council shortly of their
intention to proceed in the forthcoming close season with the demolition of
some of the existing toilets on the Penistone Road side of the Stadium in
order to provide additional turnstiles and exit gate on that side of the
Stadium.

C.      Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
When settlement was complete, it was intended to widen the existing
walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

For the attention of Mr. E« England


Dear Eric,
                Annual Certificate of Ground Safety
     We have completed the testing of the remainder of the
barriers at the Spion Kop end of the ground excepting
those barflies which because of their position cannot be
subjected to the test load.     I am pleased to say that all
the barriers withstood the load but unfortunately in a number
of cases the clips retaining the horizontal tube deformed
considerably.      It is inevitable thatwwater gets under
these clips and they rust thus becoming weaker with the
passage of time.     In one or two cases the clip actually
snapped as the final load was taken off.        A total of 25 new
clips are needed on Spion Kop Including a few on the barriers
at the top which have not actually been tested.           John also
inspected the Leppings Lane end and 10 clips are sufficiently
corroded to mirice it wise to change them rather them wait until
they are tested during the n      e      x      t       are usin9
a heavier gauge metal for the j e in force me       clips so that the
future life expectancy will be increased.
     The metal in the tube beneath the clips is also subject
to corrosion and 11 lengths each about 8ft. long on Spion Kop
are clearly nearing the end of their life.          We have to bear
in mind that the corrosion which can be seen on the outside may
be matched by corrosion Inside the tube which cannot
of course be painted.     Whilst all 11 lengths successfully
carried the test load you may think it prudent that they
should be replaced now because they could become dangerous
within five years.
     Zf all this work Is carried out (new clips on both
Spion Kop and Leppings Lane plus 11 new lengths of barrier
top rail on Spion Kop) the likely cost Is between £1250
and £1500 exclusive of professional fees.      Z should be
pleased to have your view as ttowhether we should carry out
the whole of this work or merely replace the clips on
Spion Kop which deformed under test in which case the cost
of the work would be approximately halved.
     John has already walked round the ground and he tells
me that some splitting and spalllng of the concrete columns
IK developing at ground floor level at the back of the
South stand.   Ivshall be making my inspection in company
with the Building Surveyors department representative during
this month and it is likely he will raise the matter.        Zn
any case it is important that splitting of this kind be dealt
with reasonably quickly so as to retard the* rate at which the
reinforcement corrodes.    Z will discuss this matter with you
when Z have seen the damage myself.

                Barrier Testing 1983
      Over June 2 0 - 2 4 , crush barriers 121t 122, 123, 124,
124A, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134,

153 and 154 (part) at the Lepping Lane end were tested in
accordance with the procedure laid down in the Guide to Safety
at Football Grounds. The layout of the barriers is shown on
the enclosed print of our drawing 1610/64B.
      Spans 3 and 4 of barrier 136 could not be loaded because
of the recently Installed radial fencs. Soae spans of
barriers 144, 145, 146, 149 and 154 could not be tested because
being towards the back of the terrace the absence of a suitable
reaction point or obstruction prevented jacking.
       In all but one case the barriers sustained the test load
although in twoj :ases the clips retaining the horizontal tube
deforsed. These^were on barrier 136 between spans 6 - 7 and
8 - 9 . New clips have been fitted. On barrier 129 the tube
has been welded onto the clip to give a aore positive
fixing, but nevertheless the test load was resisted.
     The only failure was the centre support of barrier
141. Hie angle leg, vhich was corroded round the top
rivets, parted during the first load application. The
angle has been plated and net bolts inserted to conplete
the connection. This is shovn on our enclosed sketch,
4644/2.
     Also enclosed are single copies of our record sheets

1.   Purpose of Meeting
                                                                                           Vjuu
The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the /            .
Stadium in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football   /{ jJ P J A * '
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2.   Ground Inspection

A.   South Stand

The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

(ii) That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

(iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
should be infilled with mesh from a safety point of view to accord strictly
with the appropriate Regulations.

(iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

B.    West Stand and Terrace

The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
temporary barriers. This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
visiting supporters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
obviously desirable to allow hone supporters access to a sheltered area.
IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
permanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party in the
usual way.

(ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

C.    North West Terrace

No comments.

D.    North Stand

IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,
the area would be regatded as acceptable.

E.   Spion Kop

It was noted that the remedial work to the roof of the tunnel exit from
the Kop had stabilised its condition for the time being (pending the
Club's development proposals proceeding'; that the loose coping stores
had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i) That the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

F.   Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

3.   Public Address System

The Club pointed out that an improved public address system had been installed,
and the Police confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
better than the previous system.
4.    Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Officer Working Party confirmed that plans for the revised catering
facilities at the rear of the West Stand had been received from the Club's
Architect and had been formally approved.

The Club reported that the scheme for the general up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand) was shortly to be
considered by the Board.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would submit the proposals for improved toilet
and catering facilities for approval in the usual way, subject, of course,
to the Board's decision whether to proceed with the scheme.

                   Dear Bill,

                   Many thanks for reply dated 27th March and observations contained
                   therein.

                   I must admit I share the same view as yourself regarding the event
                   of any future problem, now that the matter has been drawn to our
                   attention.

                   It is my belief that this work, at an obviously favourable tender
                   price, should be processed forthwith.

                   Please advise if this work is within the limits of our own
                   maintenance staff or necessitates outside contractors. In
                   the event of the latter please arrange to attain the relevant
                   estimates. Completion of the said works could, I would imagine,
                   be scheduled between matches.

                   Yours sincerely,

      Z have pleasure in enclosing three copies of our
sketch €705/2 showing a possible layout which segregates visitors
from home supporters reasonably well. Zt also allows flexibility
in allocating varying amounts of accommodation to visitors.
      Suggestions are also made for new refreshment and toilet
areas utilising vacant volume under the west stand.
      We have not attempted to cost the scheme until you have
had time to comment and suggest improvements.

A   Department of Administration,
    County Hall*
    BARH8LEY

    For the attention of Mr P Vaughan




        The club is anxious to segregate the visiting teas’s supporters
    as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
    their exit at the end of a gaas.
        We have prepared the schese shown on the attached print of our
    drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
    turnstiles (Hoc 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
    and new gates.                              *
        It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
    proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
    the drawing to the police so that they have had s o n advance notice.




                                      Yours sincerely,

  twelve new turnstiles will be required. Four each of

                          ?umstiles at Lepplngs Lane

        Thank you for returning the marked copies of our drawings
6705/2 and 3.      After our telephone conversation yesterday we
have altered the layout accordingly.      Two prints of our drawing
6705/4 are enclosed for your comments.
        We have equalised each combination of turnstiles and gate
as requested but each gate needs to be at least 2.75 m for exit
purposes.
        If this arrangement is satisfactory, or*even if you wish us
to make more alterations, ve would be available to have a meeting
with you and South Yorkshire Police sometime nest week tc discuss
the proposals in detail.,. _ _ ___

Dear Dick,
                      Re-organisation of Turnstiles
               and Mew Toilet Facilities at Leppings Lane
        As requested we have now prepared an estimate for the
cost of works envisaged at the back of the West stand for the
segregation of visiting spectators.
        The scope of the work falls into two categories, firstly
the turnstiles, fences, walls and gates, and secondly, the;
toilets and refreshment facilities.                      'r .
        The proposed layout of the turnstiles etc. at the beck
of the stand is shown on our drawing 6705/4, a copy of which is
enclosed.     including the radial fence on the West terrace, we
estimate that the cost of this work, including professional
fees, is likely to be in the order of £66,600.      'This               V;vy
assumes that five of the existing turnstiles can be re-used
and seven new turnstiles are purchased.
           Also enclosed is a print of our drawing 6705/7 stowing A
the proposed layout of the new and refurbished toilets beneath
the West stand.     We estimate that the cost of the toilet^,* if,‘
ags&Anincluding professional fees, will probably be around 'y
£60.700.      This includes stiinless steel fittings which tte;fairly
resistant to abuse but are expensive.      The saving if vitreous
china is substituted for stainless steel urinal troughs andj_
sinks WHild be about £2,200.   If the items of aainteanone
work, listed by S.Y.C.C. Working Party on their last visit
and agreed to be done i.e. investigate the condition of the
concrete fraae at the back of the South stand and the corrosion
of stanchions at the back of the Nest stand, repointing the
boundary wall on Penlstone Road and providing the mesh infill
on the bridge to the kitchens are added to the same contract
we suggest that an allowance of £3,000 be Bade for this.       4
        The total expenditure for the whole scheste plus
the aainteannce work is therefore likely to be about £130,$00
including professional fees and Building Regulations fees.?


                         Yours sincerely.

        Dear Sirs,

        Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1985
        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

        In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meeting of the
        Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) was held on 18th April
        to consider the proposals which you outlined, the County Fire
        Service requested additional time to consider the means of escape
        aspects.

        I am now able to say that, subject to the incorporation of the
        following points and to the submission of detailed plans and
        calculations under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and
        Building Regulations, the proposals outlined are regarded as
        generally acceptable

        (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile
              numbered 16 and the wall of the inner access road;

        (b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral
              area or visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in
              half by a new central radial fence running from the tunnel
              entrance to the pitchside security fence with gates erected
              so as to permit entry to be diverted to either half as
              appropriate (the proposed new secondary radial fence
              adjacent to the existing fence indicated on the plan to be
J             abandoned);

        (c)   the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
              terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial
    .   I ^   fence running from back to front with two gates (the existing
         ’    radial fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral
              area and home supporters - to have a second gate installed); y '

Dear Dick,
             Re-arr»pgement of Entry and Exit Arrangements at
                          Lepping8 Lanel
        I understand, following John Strange's telephone conversation
with you yesterday, that South Yorkshire County Council did not send
you a copy of their letter to us dated 2 May.       A copy is now
enclosed.
        A number of things that they request-have already been
incorporated since we wrote to then on 9 April.        Bowever Z do
not think that it is realistic to ask for the gates in the radial
fences and have written to David Vaughan accordingly.


                                 Yours sincerely,
                                                           WE/KB/6705

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
             Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
         Thank v®* for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April.
         Zn the interim period several of the points which you
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.          However Z
.would'ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial               .
barrier which you have asked for to have two g a t e s . Z f these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having          a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.    Zt is our view that in the event of
emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough b y the
gates 6n to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                            Yours sincerely,

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

    In reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
    (c) of my earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request
    of the South Yorkshire Police.

    Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
    are incorporated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
    the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radial fence
    in the right hand area of the Leppings Lane End Terrace (indicated as home
    supporters' terrace on the plan).


                                                      Yours faithfully,




                                                      thief Executive.

  Dear Dick,
                     Alterations at Leppings Lane End
       We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of each of our drawings
  6705/5 and 6705/8 showing two possible alternative arrangements for
  the turnstiles and toilets at the back of the West stand.
       Both drawings show the following turnstile arrangements.
               Turnstile Nos   1 - 8  -    North stand
                               9 - 13 -    North west terrace, hone supporters
                               14 - 16 -   West stand, home supporters
                               17 - 19 -   West stand, away supporters
                               20 - 23 -   South west terrace, away supporters
       The proposals for the toilet and refreshment facilities are also
  the same on each drawing.      You will see that we propose to build a new
  ladies toilet for away supporters using the end of the existing
  refreshment bar.     The existing ladies toilets will be refurbished for
  the use of home supporters.      The existing gents toilets will be
  divided and refurbished.
       Drawing 6705/5 indicates present turnstiles housings (17 i 18)
  remaining with the ajoining fence covered with sheeting to completely
  separate the heme and away supporters.        However, doing the calculations
  for the evacuation of the ground reveals that there is a pinch points at
   the two external gates on the left hand side of the row of six.
   Zt could take over 20 minutes to evacuate that end of the ground
   depending on how many people leave the South stand from that side.
   We, therefore, show on drawing 6705/8, an improvement to that
   arrangement by demolishing the two end turnstiles (17 & 18) and
   constructing a new dividing wall angled across to enclose three
   gates on the left hand side instead of two.
         We believe that the cost of the scheme on drawing 6705/5 will
^ b e   about £57,500 and for the one shown on drawing 6705/8 around
   £59,500, both including professional fees.- To these figures add
   say another £3000 for the maintenance work mentioned in our letter
   of 2 Nay.
        If a decision to proceed with one of the proposed schemes is
   given within the next few days it may be possible to have the work
   substantially complete by the start of next season.    This is not
   certain but we would have a go.


                                 Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I'b

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

    I thank you for your letter dated 12th June.

    Taking into account all the factors which you mention (particularly the
    steel sheeting of the wooden decking of the upper seated area by the
    start of the forthcoming season), the existing roof of the South Stand
    will be regarded as acceptable on a temporary basis until the end of
    the 1985/86 season. At that time, either a new roof must be constructed
    or the under-roof timber cladding of the existing roof replaced by the
    start of the 1986/87 season.

    Details and plans of the work will, of course, be required in the usual
    way.

    Yours faithfully,




                                                     *■   V\>t

Dear Mr. Calvert,

              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

      Further to our telephpne conversation on 24 June we have
pleasure in enclosing two copies of our drawing 6705/8 showing
the proposed arrangement of the turnstiles and fences and gates
at the rear of the West stand.
      It is also proposed, but not shown on the drawing to
install a single barrier rail, just above head height down
the centre of the seated area and also a fence approximately
2m away from the existing radial fence .on the right hand side
of the terrace (looking from the pitch),to separate standing
spectators.   The fence will be just like the ones alxeady installed.
      Although Dr# Eastwood has discussed the proposals in
outline with Chief inspector Moseley we would also appreciate
receiving your comments.
      Perhaps the work can be completed ready for the start
of the season if the scheme meets with your approval.

                                 Yours sincerely,
                                                            WE/KB/6517

    Dear Sirs,

                 Sheffield WiMfln^Tday Football Club Ltd.
        Thank you for your letter of 25 June regarding the roof
    of the South stand.    I am sure the Club will be very appreciative
    of the co-operative attitude of the County Council*       The
    breathing space which has been provided will be adequate for
    the Club to take action by the start of the 1986/87 season.

Dear Dick,
                    Alterations at Leppings Lane End

     We have pleasure in enclosing a set of prints of our drawings
showing details of the work, at the Leppings Lane End.
     Drawing 6705/8A is worth a look at because it shows the proposed
layout of the turnstiles and fences.   South Yoricsnire Police have
given their approval to the scheme though we have not received
anything from then in writing.
     Tenders are due back on 11th July, 198$.

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

As requested by your letter dated 16th July, I have written a confirmatory
letter to the Club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
the timber deck to the South Stand upper seated area (copy attached for .
your information).

I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval
have been made by the Club in respect of (i) re-organisation of fences
and turnstiles and alterations to toilet facilities at the rear of the
West Stand, Leppings Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
Spion Kop Terrace.

Hie Officer Working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in May but, other than
brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine meetings of the
possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
of such proposals have been considered to date.

As on previous occasions, I am assuming that you will submit the necessary
detailed plans, specifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds
Act approval (bearing in mind the General Safety Certificate requirement
to give the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
alterations or extensions at the Ground) should the Club decide to implement
the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

                                                    Yours faithfully,




                            J935        er 5

    Dear Sir,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Clubpic

    The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) met yesterday afternoon
    to consider the detailed drawings enclosed with your letter dated
    25th July relating principally to arrangements for the segregation
    of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborougji
    Stadium.

    Subject to the following points and to the submission of the necessary
    detailed calculations to the Building Authority, the proposals are
    regarded as generally acceptable

    (a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress
    purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided;

    (b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
    shortened or re-aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the
    outer (river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile
    16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller
    shutter gate between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

    (c)    Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the internal walls
    (e.g. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
    substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
    be required;

    (d)    Plan No. 6705/10A - same comments as for plan 9A;

    (e)    Plan No. 6705/11A - no objection in principle, but details of exact
    location required;

    (f)    Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier height
"   indicated;

                                                        /Contd , . .

(g)   Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved
by steep slopes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped" arrangements
to give foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need to
take measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to
climb over will have to be borne in mind;

(h)       Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences last year, the front
c o m e r of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered 5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

(j)   Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
Stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained.


                                     Yours faithfully,




                                     Chief Executive.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                    Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
          Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.         We note
the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
by the Building Surveyors Department.     We believe that all the
calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
checking and comment.
       With regard to your detailed observations our response
is as follows *-
(a)    We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
the proposed extra security gate.     There is already a gate in
the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
police.     This same gate will still be available for the spectators
in emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
which will be under the control of the police.         This point may
perhaps be clarified during the Working Party's visit on 7 August.

(b)       The foundatioasffor this fence are in fact already aligned in
the way you suggest

 (c) and (d)
         We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
                                                             /
single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
walls.    The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

(e)      The refreshment area is under the most westerly
staircase up to the north west corner terrace.     There will
be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

(f)      The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4*I")
above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
step.

(g)      The stepping of the lace of the wall is achieved by 45*
chamfers which will not form good footholds.

(h)      Ur. Chester says that the club will certainly not
object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

(i)      As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

(j)      Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
taken care of by Mr. Chester.


         It will be much easier for your Working Party to
appreciate irhat is intended when they see the works under
construction.    There will also be an opportunity to see
the metal decking of the South stand.


                            Yours sincerely,




c.c.     Mr. R.B. Chester

                           South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

1.   Purpose of Meeting.

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "summer" inspection of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

2.   Ground Inspection.

A.   Leppings Lane End

The progress of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
points raised at the Officer Working Party's meeting held on 29th July,
(forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive's letter
of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
checking and comment.

On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
45 chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted).

As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
by both the outer walls and the door frames. The Building Authority noted
the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
d iv id in g w a lls in the new t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s ev id e n tly did not have any
foundations, apparently having been b u ilt stra ig h t onto the e x is tin g
concrete sla b s. I t was noted that there were some 9 inch thick brick w alls
in the Male T o ile t s , i t being considered that any hooliganism or vandalism
would be more lik e ly to occur there than in the Female T o ile t s .

The Club pointed out that the new t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s would not be completely
fin ish e d by the f i r s t match of the season (on 17th August) but that
temporary f a c i l i t i e s would be a v a ila b le and that no building m aterial would
be l e f t on s i t e .

The position of the new refreshment area under the most westerly staircase
up to the North-West corner terrace was noted. This again had been built
straight onto the existing concrete slabs.

On the Terrace i t s e l f , i t was noted that there was an e x is tin g gate in the
new 2 m. wide gap formed by the new radial fence fo r use by the P o lic e .
This gate would s t i l l be a v a ila b le for the use of spectators in an
emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under the control of the
P o lic e would enable spectators to be directed down the 2 m. wide gap.
However, i t was agreed that step s or a longer gate would be required. I t
was a lso agreed that a new gate would be required from the new South
Central Terrace Pen.

As regards the upper seated stand area, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had
sent by l e t t e r dated 2nd August plans of the new fences and barriers in
both the Stand and at the Access le v e l.

IT WAS AGREED: -

(a)        that the condition of the internal w alls in the new male and female
t o i l e t f a c i l i t i e s at the rear of the Stand should be monitored;

(b)   that the e x istin g gate in the pitch perimeter fence should eith er be
extended or have steps to provide ea sier access from the new 2 m. wide gap
formed by the new radial fence;

(c)   that a new gate in the p itch perimeter fence should be provided from
the new South Central Terrace Pen;

(d)   that the advertising hoardings at the front of the upper seated                    stand
area should be securely fixed to the concrete w all;

(e)   that the sp allin g of the concrete of the w all at the fron t of the
upper seated stand area should receive a tten tio n as a matter of maintenance;

(f)   that the corrosion of the s t e e l columns at the rear of the Stand
should r e c e iv e atten tion on a maintenance b a s is .

B.      South Stand

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reported that the con d ition of the upper
concrete outer portion of the ex terio r wall of the Stand had been
in v e stig a te d and was considered to be s a tisfa c to r y .

I t was noted that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand had been largely completed, and the spraying of the n o n -slip
surface was to commence very sh o rtly (and c e r ta in ly be completed by the
s t a r t of the season).
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the flammability problems inherent in such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completion of the
laying of the metal sheeting.

C.    Spion Kop

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club's
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been sent for the information of the
Officer Working Party by letter dated 22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would be removed. Its present condition
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.

In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard which could
occur when large crowds were present.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate in the pitch perimeter
fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
arrangement to assist access and egress.

D.   North Stand

The temporary storage facilities created by the erection of a timber wall
(in front of the Ladies' Changing Facilities in the Sports Hall) were
inspected.

IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
basis.

E.   Closed Circuit Television Facilities

The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Circuit
Television System were explained to the Officer Working Party.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)   that a 2$ kg. CO 2 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
Police Control Box and the Disc Jockey Box;

(b)   that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
secure.

    Dear Dick,
            Many thanks for your note of 12 August enclosing the
    copy of David Vaughan's note K>f the meeting held at the ground
    on 7 August.          A copy of ay letter to David Vaughan was sent
    to you the same day so that our letters have crossed in the
    post.
^           You will see that I have taken up very strongly the
    suggestion by Don Sheriff that the workmanship in the brickwork
    was poor and would lead to weakness.          It is unfortunate that
    David Vaughan did not record that I had completely refuted
    what Don Sheriff said.          David now recognises that this was a
    mistake but iV putting the matter right by circulating a copy
    of my letter.
            Turning to the matters on the second page
    "It was agreed"
    My comments on the points you have in mind are as follows *-

    (b)     This refers to the existing gate between the new 2m wide
            gap formed by the radial fence which will be used for
            police access only.         You will notice from the wording
            0: * *
             of
            s*
                     David's minute that I persuaded them that steps eould
be used.    I have interpreted     this as being from
the inside only which means that we will not lose
any of your advertising space.      We have added the
proviaion of some timber steps on the inside to
the work being carried by Gleeson.


The other radial fence forming the small visitors
pen has left a length of terrace without a direct
access on to the pitch.      There is of course a gate
at the top of the terrace connecting into the next
pen and we had hoped that the police would accept
that as an adequate means of exit in emergency.
However at the meeting they made the point very
strongly that if someone had to be got out of the pen
which has no gate or if there was misbehaviour the
police would only be able to get in via the neighbouring
pen, passing up the terrace through the gate at the
back and then down again in the isolated pen.      They
considered this unacceptable.      I think that this
particular item can be paid for out of the contingency
sum and suggest that it be added to Gleeson* s work.


You will recall that when you and I went round with
Superintendent John Freeman he pointed out that the
advertising hoardings on the parapet of the seating
area of the west stand were simply hooked over the
parapet wall and some of the hooks had been bent.
We agreed that a fixing would be provided.     He had
apparently reported this to David Vaughan so the
matter « q s raised again.    It is clearly a good point
because any hooligans in the seated area could easily
drop an advertising board on to people below.       I have
in mind that the hoardings can be fixed by a runner
of timber and again subject to your approval, this
can be carried out as part of the present works.
(e)     This is a very minor matter which can be dealt with
        next year.


(f)     You will probably know that the bases of the steel columns
        behind the West stand have bean queried year by year
        by Don Sheriff who has requested $hat exaavations be
        carried outto ensure :hhat the steel is not rusting
        below ground level.      By chance Gleesons had exposed
        one of the columns and I was interested to see that it has
        not suffered badly.      However I have pointed out that the
        columns do not carry any load.        They form part of the
        previous structure and were chopped down to that level
        when the new concrete stand was built for the World
        Cup.     They merely form a frame within which the brick
        wall is built.     There is therefore no cause for concern.
        At the next meeting in February I will try to get this
        item deleted from the list.



        Quite a number of items have now been added at Police
request.       In addition there is the cost of the new gas main
and also unexpected costs in connection with the electricity
supply to the new refreshment area in the North West com e r .
I am asking John Strange to check on all these items to see
whether they can be accommodated within the contingency sum
which we included in Gleesons contract. I%am iin holiday but
-John, w 11                      next week.

For the attention of Mr.


Dear Mr.
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                    Segregation work at Leppinos Lane

     The segregation of supporters at the Leppings Lane
end of the ground was first proposed so*ae time before
September 1981.     We do not know the exact date but the
original request that schemes be looked at was made by
South Yorkshire Police in the days when Mr. England was
the Club Secretary.     Some rough outline stoemes were
prepared at that time but the work did not proceed.

     In February this year the matter was raised again
and more schemes devised.      Approval of a schrae was
given by SYCC in May.      Shortly after that another, much
 less expensive scheme was put forward.     After agreeing
 several matters of detail with SYCC and the Club,
 construction work eventually started on 22 July* 1985,
 The work is now almost complete*
      Enclosed are copies of the following documents
 relating to the segregation work*-

      a)   Our letter dated 9 April,to SYCC.
    b)    Their reply dated 2 May.
    c)    Our letter dated 8 May to   SYCC.
    d)    Their reply dated 10 May.
    e)    Our report on the tenders received      forthe work
          dated 12 July.
     f)   A filled in copy of the relevantpages      ofthe
          Bill of Quantities received from Gleeson
          $fiheffield) Ltd.
     The scheme involved the alteration of existing toilets,
the orovision of new ladies toilets and refreshment
facilities because segregating walls prevented access to t
the existing toilets and refreshment bars by either the
home or visiting spectators.
     Also included in the Contract were various items of
ground safety work.    These are items 6 and 8, page 7/1 of
the Bill of Quantities, items 1 to 4, page 8/1 for the
repair of barriers on Spion Kop which failed the load test
earlier this year and items 1 to 3, page 9/1.

     Enclosed are copies of the following documents
relating to that safety work:-
     g)    Minutes of a meeting with SYCC, held on 23
           January,' 1985.
     h)    Letter from Mr. P. Robinson to SWFC.
     i)    Our letter to SWFC dated 27 March.
     j)    Minutes of a meeting with SYCC, h M d on 7
           August, 1985.
     The final account has still to be agreed with Gleeson
 (Sheffield) Ltd.

        Note of a Meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield

           Dr. W. Eastwood (Messrs. Eastwood & Partners)
           R. Ward (Groundsman)            *

                         (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)*

1.    Welcome and Introduction

Mr. Vaughan pointed out that the Local Government Act, 1985, would abolish
the South Yorkshire County Council (and the other Metropolitan County Councils)
on 31st March, 1986. From 1st April, 1986, the Certificating Authority under
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, would be the appropriate District
Council. In the case of the Hillsborough Stadium this would naturally be
the Sheffield City Council. For this reason, it had been suggested to the
City Council that appropriate representatives in addition to the Building
Surveyors' Division might find it useful to be present at the meeting, and
Mrs. L. Bashforth and Mr. J. Derricott were welcomed and introduced to the
remainder of the representatives present.

Mr. Vaughan took the opportunity of expressing appreciation and thanks to
the representatives for the help and assistance which they had given to him
in his role as Co-ordinator of the Officer Working Parties since 1978. There
had obviously been occasions when differences of opinion and interpretation
had occurred but, in the main, these had been resolved both amicably and
constructively.

For the Club, Dr. Eastwood thanked Mr. Vaughan for his services and wished
him well for the future. Other representatives endorsed Dr. Eastwood's
remarks.

2.    Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was two-fold; firstly to discuss the further
details of development proposals at the stadium forwarded with the letter
dated 23rd December, 1985, from Messrs. Eastwood and Partners and, secondly,
to carry out the "winter" inspection of the Stadium.

A.    Development Proposals for the Spion Kop

The further details were in addition to the comments set out in the letter
dated 29th November, 1985, on the observations made following the Officer
Working Party meeting held on 13th November.
      (i)    Sheeting of Outer Face

      Dr. Eastwood reported that the sheeting of the enlarged Spion Kop at
      the rear and sides would result in the structure being virtually
      sealed. In reply to queries from the County Fire Service, he confirmed
      that no storage would be allowed under the structure and that checks
      for any accumulations of rubbish would be undertaken on a regular basis.

      (ii)   Climbing of the-Inner Steel Frame

      As regards the possiblity of unruly spectators climbing the inner steel
      frame of the new structure, Dr. Eastwood reported that the bottom boom
      member was now to be omitted. The resultant height of ovej 10 feet
      would make it very difficult for spectators to climb the structure.

      (iii) New Step and Barrier Layout

      Drawing No. 6648/56 was circulated and considered. This related to the
      new step and barrier layout on the Spion Kop, and Dr. Eastwood reported
      in particular on the discussions which he' had had with the Planning
      Authority as to the height of an intermediate or a low second rail to
      the barriers.where the drop ^to the gangway below could be over one metre
      in places. He sought the Ofiicer Working Party's views * and the merits
      of the options were considered.

      IT WAS AGREED that, in the view of the Officer Working Party, the best
      option for a second rail in the areas described was a low toe rail at
      a height of some 200 mm.

B.    Facilities for the Disabled

To illustrate that the figures originally quoted to provide facilities for the
disabled at the foot of the Spion Kop (nearest to the North Stand) were not
unrealistic, Dr. Eastwood reported on the breakdown of the tender figures
(opened on Monday) for the enlarged, roofed Spion Kop. He still considered
that any such proposals would involve the loss of up to 1,000 of the extra
5,000 spectator places which would be provided by the enlarged Spion Kop.
Other areas of the Stadium had also been considered and investigated, but
none could provide as large a flat, easily accessible area as that in front of
the North Stand, which had been successfully used for so long without any major
problems. Up to 80 disabled persons, plus attendants, used the area. The only
major drawback he saw was that when there was a strong southerly wind, rain
could be blown onto the disabled, despite the cantilever roof of the North
Stand extending virtually to the pitch. For this reason, the Club were willing
to roof an area from approximately the letter "0" on the results board to the
end of the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) with a substantial roof, including
armoured glass where there might be a visibility problem, provided that this
was supported by the Officer Working Party.

Whilst accepting much of what Dr. Eastwood said, the Officer Working Party
(and the Police representatives in particular) still expressed some concern as
to whether making semi-permanent facilities for the disabled in front of the
North Stand was the appropriate and correct thing to do.

The Building Authority confirmed that, after further investigations, it was
considered that the disabled facilities requirements of the Building
Regulations 1985 did not appear to strictly apply to the roofing of the
enlarged Spion Kop.
IT WAS AGREED that, in the first instance, Dr. Eastwood would prepare sketch
plans of the suggested roofed disabled facilities in front of the North Stand
for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

C.    Ground Inspection
      (i)   West Terrace and Stand

The Police representatives confirmed that the revised segregation arrangements
to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seatedarea '
of the stand could be moved within certain limits if the Police considered
that this would achieve a useful purpose.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(a)   that the additional advertisement hoardings at the front of the upper
seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
fixed to concrete wall;

(b)   that further areas of spalled concrete at the front of the upper         ..
seated stand area should received-attention as matters of maintenance.

      (ii)   North-West Terrace

IT WAS AGREED that the advertisement hoardings erected on the upper North-
West Terrace should be securely fixed.

      (iii) North Stand

The area for the suggested covered disabled facilities was inspected.

As previously mentioned by Dr. Eastwood, the possibility of providing an
increased width access to the pitch area (between the North Stand and the
Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as far maintenance
by the Club was discussed. The facility could be incorporated into the
enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.

It WAS AGREED that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
was not essential for their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

      (iv)   Spion Kop

Dr. Eastwood indicated the extent of the work to construct the enlarged,
roofed, Spion Kop, and confirmed that steps would be taken to prevent
unauthorised access to areas where work might be in progress during the
course' of thVseason.

It was noted that the additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the
front corner nearest to tne South Stand, with a stepped arrangement w
assist access and egress, had been provided.

      (v)    South Stand

It was not«d that the metal sheeting of the wooden floor of the upper
portion of tlie Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had proved to be of an
acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to provide a compromise
solution to the flammability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.

^ t h e procedure already established at Hillsborough.    The document
  envisages that far more grounds for various sports will be designated
  but in appropriate circvaastancas the procedures will not be so
  onerous as those relating to Hillsborough.       However, as it is a
  •top' ground we cannot expect that there will be much relaxation
  compared with the present arrangements.
           There is a welcome statement on page 11 that due account
  vhould be taken of the need to keep the costs to clubs and local
  authorities to reasonable proportions.    There are also various
  references to Safety Certificates reflecting the circumstances of
  each particular ground and the number of spectators who are likely
  to attend (see page 14).      These words may be useful to us in the
  future, although we can expect to have more stringent requirements
  compared with some of the smaller clubs.
           It is comforting to know that the new Green Guide will not
  become a statutory code, and will continue to be subject to
                                                                     2.




interpretation.
         The reference to prohibition notices by either the fire
authority or the local authority on page 19 may cause concern to
some clubs.   But in paragraph 2.38 on page 20 there is a clear
implication that it is only necessary to reduce the risk to
an acceptable level, rather than trying to remove all risk.   This
wording will help curb excessive demands, and may be useful to
us sometimes in negotiations.
         I am returning the document herewith.


                          Yours sincerely,

     For the attention of Hr. D. M. Bownes


     Dear Sir,

     SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 ~ SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

     Thank you for your letter dated 3rd November, 1986, in respect of the above
     Club.

     Please find below my observations in response to outstanding matters.

     An inspection of the ground was carried out on 17th November, 1986.        The
     comments appended below do not take into account the numbers of persons using
     individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
     it is assumed tnat from previous correspondence and documentation that the
     various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

     MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

     North Stand

     Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

     The only reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7.8.85
     in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

     There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
     with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
     ment of these buildings.

     Spion Kop

     A.     Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exit route has not
             received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
             installation, this should be removed immediately.
                                                             «


     B.     It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter fencing form
             part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten

                               security   d e v ic e    easily openable from the pitch side should
          be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.

           gate before patrons enter the stands.

 VJest Stand
 A        Timber framed and clad units located under this stand have been there
           for some considerable time. No record exists of.-

            (1)    acceptance of these units or,

            (2)    that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions,

fc.         Exit gates to the pitch perimeter as item E under Spion KoP above.


     South Stand

     The accommodation is divided into four areas:-

     A.     Oround     floor    offices,     directors         suite,        players area,       function suite,
            kitchen etc.
     B.      First    floor,    upper stand walkway,             press lounge, players lounge, paint
             stores, disused Dar area.

     C.      Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

     D.      Rear stand, covered seating.

     With respect to the four areas, the following observations are made:-

     A.      Ground Floor:-


                  » ’ rbeamade
                            . - readily
                                s s . 'available

                                                               for use b y j m y person within the area.
                                     - 3 -


       (ii)   A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
              and directors' suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
              fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
              also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
              by corrugated, lightweight plastic sheeting.

              The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
              should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
              requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

      (iii)   All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and these
               areas always maintained free from such storage.

     First Floor

        (i) Again, a number of rooms i.e. players' lounge, press lounge,
             the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint •
             store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
             should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

       (ii) Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
             five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be cut
             off should an emergency arise.

      (iii) All timber construction within this      area   should   be   suitably
             treated so as to be flame retardant.

       (iv) The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
             mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
             be removed from this area.     Proposals to relocate the stores
             should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any work
             is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
             licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

        (v) The timber constructed cupboard and the portable sales kiosks
             should be removed from this area.

       (vi) In the cleaners' cupboard to this area, the fire resisting
             separation between the ground and first floor levels is breached
             by the passage of cables through a wall.    The area around the
             cables should be infilled with material to ensure a minimum
             fire resistance of thirty minutes.

      (vii)   All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
              it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
              being to the same standard and made self closing onto 25 mm
              rebates.

     (viii)    Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
               purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

C.   Uncovered Seating Area:-

     The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
     the rear part of the stand.   Should this route not be available then
     evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having the
     ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter track.
     This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
     to 1 m high at the West end.
                                    - 4 -


     To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch it is recommended
     that openings be provided in the wall at the foot of radial gangways •
                                                                                  \
D.   Covered Seating Area (Rear Stand)

     The means of escape from this area is not considered to be satisfactory
     in that escape is possible in one direction only, this being down through
     areas described in A and B above.

     Subject to all the recommendations outlined in A and B above and made
     later in respect of automatic fire detection being implemented, the
     means of escape from the covered seating area would be acceptable.

AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION

In 1979 the working party discussed the provision of automatic fire detection
in the South Stand.

^It is recommended that such provision should be made in all areas beneath
 the seated area of the stand as soon as possible.    The system should also
 cover the Tavern Club which has a direct link on to the first floor corridor
 of the South Stand.

The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
system.

In order that persons using the Spion Kop can receive early warning of any
fire occurring in the "Stands" Club, it is also recommended that automatic
fire detection be provided in that Club.

EMERGENCY LIGHTING

Spion Kop

The emergency lighting has yet to be tested - no test certificate received.

South, North and West Stands

 In letter dated 12th November, 1980, from Eastwood and Partners, it \sas
 suggested that following test certificates dated 11th August, 1980, a period
 of 5 years should elapse before re-testing for South Stand and 2 years for
 North and West Stands. As of today no record appears to exist as to whether
 these areas have been re-tested or that the test certificates together with
 maintenance records have ever been re-presented.      The emergency lighting
 system should therefore be re-tested for the whole of the ground and test
 certificates produced.   In addition the whole of the system should conform
 to B.S. 5266.

 FIRE ALARM

 West Stand

 Existing call points to be relocated to accessible positions outside of
 franchise areas and be increased to cover the upper areas of the stand.

 North Stand

 As West Stand above.
                                     - 5 -


South Stand

This stand appears to be well covered with regard to the provision and siting
of call points.   *

Indicator Control Panel

The indicator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
between South and West Stand.    Whilst this is reasonable for match days it
is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

This panel should be duplicated with control at each location which should
be: -

1.      Police control box

2.      Main office reception area

FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT

The current standard and displacement of First Aid fire-fighting equipment
is considered satisfactory.

GATES

The sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by this
Authority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
and the fact that they are of existing construction.     I would wish, however,
to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice be
given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be
replaced then their replacements must open outwards even if this involves
structural work to recess the opening to avoid impinging over footpaths.
While the sliding gates remain in use however, they must be immediately avail­
able for use from the inside by any person should an emergency situation
arise. Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the outside
must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use of a key,
additional security being afforded by the presence of a steward who should
be familiar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

If there are any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to contact
the Officer concerned.

Yours faithfully,

  The Secretary,
  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC,

  Dear Sir,

  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

  In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
  condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
  have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
  received them as yet.

  The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
  with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
  receive is very satisfactory.

  The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
  information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
  letter have now been further clarified as follows;-

  (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
  from the walkways.

  (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
  dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

  (c) Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
  cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

  I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
  particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of final
  exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
  the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
  their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
  Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
  better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
  outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
  type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
  current locks, about which they are very concerned.

   Encs
   BH                                                                                                      - Mr. Bownes

                          For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring......................          (STD Code 0742)

    possible.

   Dear Sirs,

   Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Gate Release Devices

   I refer to your letter of 19th August and the enclosed plans of a proposed gate
   release device.

  The proposed device has been discussed by the various Authorities at some length
  and it has now been suggested tha^erhapsa prototype device could be fabricated
  and fitted to one of the gates for testing purposes. It has also been mentioned
  that with some modifications the proposed device could also be used for the
  sliding gates at Sheffield United Football Club.

   I look forward to hearing from you with your comments on this matter.

  Yours faithfully,




  Head of Department

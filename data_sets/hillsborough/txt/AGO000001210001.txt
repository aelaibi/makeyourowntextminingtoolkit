Dear Sir

Re: Inquest into deaths at the Hillsborough stadium in 1989
Request bv Anne Williams for new inquest

I was recently given to understand from a news report on the BBC
website (enclosed) that Mrs Anne Williams may be pressing you to
direct a further inquest into the Hillsborough disaster. In particular
around the choice of 1515hrs cut off time, in terms of hearing
evidence.

You may already be aware that this was subject to judgement in the
Divisional Court on 5th November 1993 on Judicial Review dealing
with just this point.

I enclose for your attention a copy of the Judgement of R v Her
Majesty’s Coroner for South Yorkshire ex parte P Stringer and note
in particular the comments made by the Judges in dismissing the
application, in particular at page 26 dealing with the 1515hrs point.




                                                                         COUNCIL OF THE YEAR 2005




The person dealing with this matter is Steve Eccleston                     in v e s t o r i n p e o p l e
I would therefore respectfully suggest that this issue has already
been fully and properly canvassed in the Divisional Court (indeed
before a two Judge Court) and that little would be gained from a
further inquest this many years after the original tragic events.

Yours faithfully

Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynihan which has been
passed to this department in view of our responsibilities for
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

Following the publishing of Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report
on the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster the Home Secretary made a
statement in the House of Commons.  I enclose a copy of that
statement in addition to a document outlining the initial
response by the Government to the Recommendations contained in
the Report.

As you may be aware since the Home Secretary made this
statement the Chancellor announced that the Government .would
be reducing the pools betting tax therefore making available
£100 million to the football industry over the next five
years.

I hope this information is of use to you.

                                                         Yours sincerely

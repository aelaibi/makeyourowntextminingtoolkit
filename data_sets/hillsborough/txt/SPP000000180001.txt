Dear Stefan
H illsborough Disaster
I recently had a very long telephone conversation with Ann Addlington from the
Hillsborough Family Support Group. It is plain to me that they are under a number of
misapprehensions albeit very strongly believed misapprehensions.
Ms Addlington felt that some of the preparations for their submission to Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith might be short circuited if she had the opportunity to speak with you to
confirm your understanding on one or two particular points. You will obviously wish to treat
any such request with caution and I said that I would write to you and ask if you are
prepared to do this.
If you do want to make contact the telephone number is I                I.
Kind regards.




C P Dorrieg

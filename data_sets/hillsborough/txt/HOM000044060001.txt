STATEMENT BY LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH ON HIS VISIT TO
              HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM


Lord Justice Stuart-Smith yesterday visited Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield
as part of the independent scrutiny announced by the Home Secretary on 30
June.

He said:

      “I know that a great deal has changed in and around the stadium since
      the disaster, including the way police and the club deal with the large
      numbers of fans who attend each match.

       “However, I wanted to familiarise myself with the site of the events of
       15th April 1989, and with the atmosphere and build-up to a major
       match.

       “I am planning to go to Liverpool shortly to meet the relatives of those
       killed and their legal representatives.

       “The meetings I have will be private and I will not be making any public
       comments on the evidence or representations which are made to me
       during the course of the scrutiny. I hope to report my findings to the
       Home Secretary towards the end of the year.

       “Anyone who feels that they are able to submit material to me should
       contact my secretary via Room 1106, Home Office, 50 Queen Anne’s
       Gate, London SW1H 9AT.”

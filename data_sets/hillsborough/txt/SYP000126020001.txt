I WENT ON A COACH FROM WORK, THERE WERE ABOUT 60 PEOPLE ON IT.
THE MAJORITY WORK WITH ME AT                            LIVERPOOL:

OUTSIDE THE GROUND I SAW A COUPLE OF MOUNTED POLICE OFFICERS, 6 - 1 2 OFFICERS
ON FOOT. THERE WERE NO QUEUES, JUST ONE BIG, MASSIVE QUEUE. LAST YEAR WE
WERE TOLD WHERE TO GO, THERE WERE PLENTY OF POLICE TELLING US WHERE TO GO,
THIS YEAR IT SEEMED UNDERMANNED.
OUTSIDE IT WAS PANDEMONIUM, PEOPLE TRYING TO GET INTO TURNSTILES, THERE WERE
YOUNG KIDS THERE AND WE BIGGER LADS WERE TRYING TO KEEP THEM CLOSE TO US AND
LOOK AFTER THEM. WE'D BEEN IN THE QUEUE FOR 1 0 - 1 5 MINUTES, AND WE WERE
GOING TOWARDS THE TURNSTILES. THE STEWARDS AT THE TURNSTILES WEREN'T EVEN
CHECKING THE TICKETS, THEY JUST CONTINUALLY OPENED THE TURNSTILE TO GET
PEOPLE IN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
BY NOW IT WAS 2.35 PM. AND WE WENT THROUGH THE TURNSTILES.    I'VE STILL GOT
MY TICKET INTACT. SERIAL NO 150489 . LLP. TERRACES.
WE COULD SEE THE TUNNEL LEADING TO THE TERRACES AND SEE THROUGH TO THE PITCH,
IT WAS JUST A MASS OF PEOPLE IN THE TUNNEL, AND WE DECIDED IT WASN'T WORTH
THE RISK OF GOING IN, IT LOOKED DANGEROUS. WE WENT TO THE STAIRS AND ASKED IF
THERE WAS ANOTHER ENTRANCE TO THE TERRACES, BUT BY THIS TIME THE GATE WAS
ABOUT TO BE OPENED, AND THERE WERE 4 BOBBIES INSIDE, AND THE STEWARD WENT TO
GET ONE OF THE POLICEMEN, AND AT THAT POINT THE BLUE CONCERTINA DOOR OPENED.
NEXT MINUTE      THERE WAS AN ALMIGHTY RUSH, SO BY THIS TIME, TO GET OUT OF THE
WA^ OF THEM      PEOPLE WE WERE FORCED UP THE STAIRS TOTHE STAND.
WENT TO THE   BACK OF THE STAND, AS WE HADN'T GOT A SEAT, AND STOOD THERE. BY
THIS TIME, IT WAS 2.55PM, WAITING FOR THE TEAMS TOCOME OUT.     THE NEXT THING
IS , THE GAME WAS KICKED OFF, THERE WERE STILL EMPTY SEATS IN THE STAND.

WITHIN A MATTER OF MINUTES THERE WAS AN ATTACK ON THE NOTTS FOREST GOAL, THEN
WE SAW A YOUNG LAD RUN ONTO THE PITCH FROM THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACES, TO ONE
OF THE PLAYERS, AND THE GOAL KEEPER TRIED TO GRAB HIM, THEN A POLICEMAN WENT
AND STOPPED THE MATCH. THEN I SAW TWO LADS TRYING TO RESUSCITATE A LAD NEXT
TO THE GOAL.
I WENT OUT TO THE BACK OF THE STAND, AND FROM TOILET WINDOW LOOKED OUT TO THE
BACK OF THE STAND, AND SAW A ROW OF POLICMEN WITH BODIES BEHIND THEM. MY
MATE AND I PUT OUR ARMS ROUND EACH OTHER, AND CRIED, AND DECIDED WE SHOULD
JUST GO HOME. AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ENTRANCE WE SAW A YOUNG PAKISTANI LAD,
DISTRESSED, HIS LEG WAS BADLY INJURED, AND WE CHAIR LIFTED HIM TO THE ST
JOHNS AMBULANCE, AND WE HAD TO STEP OVER BODIES TO PUT THIS YOUNG KID BY THE
SIDE OF THE AMBULANE. THE NAME OF THE LAD WHO HELPED ME WITH THE LAD WAS
                                          1LIVERPOOL.

f^TH EN LEFT THE GROUND.
CALLER WAS OBVIOUSLY DISTRESSED, AND WAS REFERRED TO HELPLINE.

               ABOUT 14.55 IT WAS SO CROWED PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE

OVER THE TERRACES. AT ABOU T14.57 THERE WAS SOME SORT OF DISTURBANCE, WHICH
INVOLVED THE POLICE, AT AROUND KICK OFF TIME A PC AND WPC WENT FROM PITCH UP
TO THE PARTITION BETWEEN NOTTS FORREST SUPPORTERS AND THE LIVERPOOL
SUPPORTERS, THEY CLIMBED ALONG THE FENCING, UP TO THE POLICE OBSERVATION BOX,
AND THEY STARTED HAMMERING ON THE WINDOW AND THE DOOR, I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT
HE COULD SEE HOW SERIOUS IT WAS, AND WAS TRYING TO TELL THEM, A COUPLE OF
MINUT3ES LATER ABOUT 40 -50 POLICE CAME DOWN TO WHERE WE WERE STANDING, AND
THEN WENT TOWARDS THE LEPPING LANE SUPPORTERS AND THE PITCH, THIS WAS ABOUT
1^.03 WE COULD SEE THE FIRST PEOPLE BEING BROUGHT OVER THE RAILING IN A
E®TRAUGHT STATE. MORE POLICE ARRIVED AT THE BACK OF THE GOAL THEN IT BECAME
VERY CONFUSED THE POLICE THEN ASKED THE REFEREE TO STOP THE GAME. THE PLAYERS
WENT OF THE PITCH, MORE CASUALTIES WENT ONTO THE PITCH, BUT IT WAS UTTER
CONFUSION. THE POLICE THERE WERE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OVER THE RAILINGS, AND
OTHER POLICE FORMED A CORDON RIGHT ACROSS THE PITCH, THEY STARTED TAKING
PEOPLE DIAGONALLY ACROSS THE PITCH BETWEEN THE SPION KOP AND NORTH STAND.
THERE WAS A MASS OF PEOPLE IN THE GOAL MOUTH LEPPINGS LANE END, IT WAS SO
CONGESTED THEY WERE BRINGING PEOPLE OVER TO THE SOUTH STAND TO TREAT THEM AND
GIVE THEM THE KISS OF LIFE. AT THIS TIME ONLY ONE AMBULANCE HAD GOT INTO THE
GROUND. WE WERE ASKED TO FORM A GANGWAY TO GET INJURED PEOPLE OUT, I WENT
DOWN TO THE WALL AND ASSISTED THE INJURED. I HELPED TO CARRY SEVERAL PEOPLE
OUT I BELIEVE ONE WAS OUT, AT FIRST WE TOOK THEM THROUGH E OR F ENTRANCE, AND
WE WAITED THERE AND ATTENDED TO THE INJURED UNTIL THE AMBULANCES ARRIVED.
BECAUSE THE AMBULANCES COULD NOT GET THROUGH WE WERE ASKED TO CARRY THE
INJURED BACK TO THE MAIN LEPPING LANE ENTRANCE, THERE WERE ABOUT 6 BODIES BY
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD.
THE POLICE SAW MY TICKET PRIOR TO MY ENTRANCE, WHEN THE PROBLEM STARTED THE
POLICE DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO,

AND A POLICEMAN WAS TELLING PEOPLE NOT TO PUSH AS THE GAME HAD ONLY JUST
STARTED AND AS SOON AS HE HAD SAID THAT THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS PUSH FROM THE
CROWD.BY THE TIME I GOT TO THE TURNSTILES I COULDN'T EVEN GET MY TICKET OUT
OF MY POCKETS BECAUSE IT WAS SO PACKED.WHEN I WAS O/S THE GROUND THERE WAS
ONLY 4 TURNSTILES AND THE POLICE TOLD PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH ANY ONE. THERE WAS
AN AWFUL LOT OF NOTTS FOREST TICKETS BEING SOLD AT LEPPINGS LANE END.I
FINALLY GOT TO MY SEAT AND THEN REALISED THAT THERE WAS A PROBLEM UNDERNEATH
USflkND THERE WAS ONE OR TWO PEOPLE STARTING TO CLIMB ONTO THE PITCH.2 OR 3
LiSI; THAT GOT ONTO THE PITCH STARTED TO PULL AT THE NETTING BEHIND THE GOAL
AND THE POLICE ACTUALLY STARTED TO DRAG THEM AWAY.IT WAS THEN THAT ALOT MORE
WENT ONTO THE PITCH AND I COULD SEE THAT THEY WERE HAVING HEART MASSAGE.AT
THAT STAGE THE POLICE HAD BUT A LINE ACROSS THE MOUTH OF THE GOAL AS THOUGH
PROTECTING A PITCH INVASION. THE ONLY THING A COULD SEE AT FIRST WAS A
POLICEWOMAN AND A ST JOHN'S AMBULANCE MAN HELPING THE PEOPLE ON THE PITCH.
THE POLICE BROKE RANKS AND BEGAN TO HELP THE PEOPLE.PEOPLE WERE THEN BEING
FERRIED ON HOARDINGS ACROSS THE PITCH. I STOPPED THERE UNTIL ABOUT 4.10PM AND
THERE WAS NO TROUBLE WITH THE FANS ON THE PITCH.I DID SEE ONE LAD GRAB HOLD
OF A POLICEMAN AND TRY TO DRAG HIM TOWARDS THE GROUND. I WOULD SAY THAT THERE
WERE ALOT OF PEOPLE LEAVING THE SAME TIME AS ME AND THEY COULDN'T GET OUT OF
THE MAIN IRON GATES DUE TO THE EMERGENCY VEHICLES BLOCKING THE EXIT.I WOULD
SAY THAT THERE WAS PLENTY OF SPACES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MIDDLE SECTION
BEHIND THE GOAL.

TERRACE JUST AS THE MATCH KICKKED OFF. WHEN THE TROUBLE STARTED I SAW TWO
LADS STAGGER OUT OF THE CRUSH - THEY LOOKED DRUNK I SUPPOSE, BUT THEY HED
BEEN CRUSHED, AND TWO POLICEMEN THREW THEM BACK IN. ANOTHER MAN WHO STAGGERED
OUT WAS FROG-MARCHED OFF AS THOUGH HE WAS ARRESTED. THERE WAS PRAISE FOR A
FEW OF THE POLICEMEN, BUT THERE WERE A HELL OF A LOT MORE WHO DID ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO HELP. THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION - IT WAS JUST CHAOS. EVEN GETTING
INTO WEMBLEY LAST YEAR WAS MORE DANGEROUS THAN GETTING INTO HILLSBOROUGH. IT
SEJfiMED TO BE UTTER CHAOS AT ALL THESE MATCHES - IT NEED CHECKING OF TICKETS

TO GET OUT. ABOUT 50 OR 60 WAS LET OUT AND THEY SHUT    THE GATEAGAIN. THE
POLICE TOLD US TO KEEP OF THE PITCH AND WALK DOWN TO    THE END. I SAT AT THE

THE GAME STOPPED, WE WERE NOT REALLY AWARE OF THE SITUATION AT THE FRONT AND
SUPPORTERS ON THE PITCH WAVING AT FANS ON THE TERRACING TO MOVE BACK BUT
THERE WERE STILL PEOPLE COMING IN THROUGH THE TUNNEL. THERE WAS NO WHERE FOR
US TO GO BECAUSE OF THE BRICK WALL BEHIND US, THE POLICE ARRIVED AND DID NOT
KNOW WHAT TO DO,MORE PEOPLE THEN SPILLED ONTO THE PITCH AND WERE BEING PULLED
OUT.FROM THEN ON THE CRUSH GOT WORSE, IT SEEMED A HELL OF A LONG TIME BEFORE
THE GATE AT THE FRONT WAS OPENED. AT ONE STAGE MORE POLICEMEN THEN FANS ON

FROM THE TERRACES ONTO THE STANDS ABOVE AND REALISED I WAS BEING SUCKED DOWN
INTO A CRUSH.PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE ONTO THE PITCH.I RETREATED
AND WENT TO AN AREA NEAR TO THE POLICE CONTROL ROOM AND WAS THERE UNTIL
APPROXIMATELY 15.40 HOURS.I REALISED SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED BUT
WASN'T REALLY AWARE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.I SAW SOME TERRIBLE SIGHTS.
 A h e r e WAS NO ONE ASKING THE FANS TO VACATE THE GROUND WHICH THEY COULD DO
A^xHERE WAS NOTHING STOPPING THEM GOING OUT.IT WAS AT LEAST 15.25 OR 15.30
BEFORE AN ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE CONCERING THIS AND THEN THEY ASKED THE
'LUTON FANS' TO VACATE THE TERRACES.THIS WAS A MISTAKE BUT ADDED TO THE
CONFUSION.THE POLICE WERE PUSHING THE FANS BACK OVER THE FENCE BUT THEY
COULDN'T POSSIBLY HAVE APPRECIATED GRAVITY OF SITUATION.THE CONSTABLES LACKED
DIRECTION.THE POLICE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING BUT NO BLAME CAN BE ATTACHED TO THE
CONSTABLES,THEY LACKED DIRECTION.
   WHEN I ATTEMPTED TO LEAVE HILLSBOROUGH THE TOWN WAS COMPLETELY BLOCKED.A
CONSTABLE DIRECTED ME DOWN A STREET WHICH WAS 'ONE WAY' AGAINST ME BUT HE
SAIDIT WAS ALRIGHT,IT WAS THE ONLY WAY AND WAS MOST HELPFUL.I HAD TO GO VIA
STOCKPORT AND REACHED HOME AT APPROXIMATELY 20.45 HOURS.
   DON'T KNOW FULL NAMES AND ADDRESSES OF FEMALES ACCOMPANYING,AS STATED ONLY
KNOW THEM THROUGH ANFIELD WHEN WE MEET AT MATCHES AND I USUALLY GIVE LIFT
HOME.

I SAW PEOPLE TRYING TO GET IN WITHOUT TICKETS BUT THEY WERE THROWN OUT.PEOPLE
WITH TICKETS WERE ALSO CLIMBING OVER THE WALL DUE TO THE CRUSH. AT ABOUT 2.45
THE CONCERTINA GATES WERE OPENED AND APPROX 75 PEOPLE WERE LET IN,BASICALLY
TO ELEVIATE THE PROBLEM. AT ABOUT 2.55 THE GATES WERE OPENED AGAIN AND
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE FLOODED THROUGH.THERE WERE STEWARDS OR POLICE TO DIRECT
PEOPLE TO THEIR SEATS AND SO THEY ALL RAN THROUGH THE TUNNEL TOWARDS THE
Plflfc.I RETURNED TO MY SEAT AND THEN SAW THAT THE PEN DIRECTLY BEHIND THE GOAL
POSTS WERE CRAM PACKED AND PEOPLE WERE PULLED UP INTO THE STANDS BECAUSE OF
THE CRUSH.AS FAR AS I COULD SEE THE GATES NEEDED TO BE OPENED BECAUSE OF THE
PRESSURE OUTSIDE.

WENT LAST YEAR I KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THE CENTRE PENS AND DID NOT INTEND
TO GO BEHIND THE GOAL BUT WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH THE TUNNEL ALL YOU CAN SEE
IS THE GREEN OF THE PITCH. I WENT DOWN THE TUNNEL, REALISED WHERE I WAS AND
WALKED BACK OUT. THERE WERE NO OFFICIALS AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE TUNNEL AT
ALL. I WAS CONCERNED THAT THE END PEN WASN'T FILLING UP, I THOUGHT THAT IF I
NOTICED THAT THEN AN OFFICIAL SHOULD HAVE NOTICED. AFTER A WHILE I NOTICED
PEOPLE STARTED TO CLIMB OVER THE SIDE BARRIERS INTO THE PENS BY THE SIDE.
ABOUT 3.05PM I CVOULD SEE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT FENCE, PEOPLE DIDN'T
REALISE WHAT WAS GOING ON. THE POLICE SEEMED TO BE IN TWO MINDS AND IT WASN'T
UiB E l L I COULD SEE PEOPLE WORKING ON OTHERS THAT I REALISED WHAT EXACTLY WAS
HAPPENING. BY WORKING ON PEOPLE I MEAN PUMPING THEIR HEARTS. IT WAS A WHILE
BEFORE THE AMBULANCE GO ONTO THE PITCH, ABOUT 10 OR 15 MINUTES. IT WAS NOT
APPARANT TO PEOPLE AROUND ME HOW SERIOUS THINGS WERE.
PLEASE RING BEFORE CALLING AND GIVE PLENTY OF NOTICE.

              When    I a p p r o a c h e d GLOVER    he was    lying      on the    grass   surrounded       by a

              group of Liverpool            fans     two of who m       I believe were       his   brothers,             At

              this stage         I be 1 ieved GLOVER was          still    alive and my mai n        cg^c ern was

              to get him m o v e d to enable             him to receive        first aid      treatment.             A

and together           wit h the group that           had been origi^pwflTiy s u r r o u n d i n g           him

I assisted        to    carry GLOVER          off the       p^.tch ^rfa up to the S pion Kop end

of the g r o u n d .       I still       thought      he was alive at             this   stage

             as we       carried him.



We took     him to outside             the gymnays i^m^ by a sandpi t and                placed him on

the ground and the hoarding                    boafrd was         taken away.        1' tried to feel

for a pulse        but    couldn't       find one       then a w o m a n who        stated she was a

nurse    came over and           checked him over             on my       request   to do so and           I then

m o v e d a way   leaving       the    nurse who m      I do not know and the                 two men who            I

believe where G L O V E R ’s brothers w i t h him.                         I then went        back towards

the    pitch a n d had no further               dealings wit h GLOVER a l t h o u g h            I did       later

PAUL ANTHONY JAMES EASON states :

1.   I was born on 23rd July,                    1957.            I am a Station Officer

     stationed at Longley Ambulance Station, Sheffield 5.

2.   I have been employed by SYMAS since 2nd October,                               1978.      I

     was       a    Qualified       Ambulanceman            at    Batemoor    Station       until

     August,         1982.         I then transferred to Middlewood Ambulance

     Station,            Sheffield for 14 months.                  I was then promoted to

     the       position of         Leading      Ambulanceman          at Maltby      Ambulance

     Station where I remained until                         September,      1986.       I then

     transferred to Parkway Ambulance Station in Sheffield as a

     Leading         Ambulanceman         and    I    was        promoted    to   position     of

     Station Officer at Longley in May, 1987.

3.   I    am    qualified         to    perform       the    full     range    of    ambulance

     duties.                 I do not however have extended training.                          My

     training has included a two week induction course,                                 the six

     week          residential         course    at    Markfield         Training       Centre,

     Leicestershire and twelve months on the road experience.                                   I

     gained the Millar Award (DHSS Proficiency Award).

4.   Longley Station is just under two miles east of Sheffield

     Wednesday Football Ground.                       Because of its close proximity

     to    the       football       ground      the    previous       Station       Officer    at

     Longley was nominated as Liaison Officer for that stadium.

5.   Sheffield            Wednesday      Football        Club       provides      two   season

     tickets for me and a second Liaison Officer, Station Officer

     Higgins,         in the south stand.                   One or the other of us or

     both of us will attend all the home league matches.                                      Our

     seats         are       in the south stand above the players tunnel.

  South Yorkshire Police are aware of the seat numbers of our

  tickets.     For big matches (e.g. semi-finals and league games

  where large crowds are expected) we take an ambulance to the

  ground (with crew) and position it at the point marked by a

  green rectangle on the plan attached.              We also have a back

  up ambulance,     with crew,    stationed at Middlewood Ambulance

  Station d)n standby.

  When attending matches we each take a pocketphone radio.

  Before the start of any game it is our practice to carry out

  a radio test to ensure radio communications with the Control

  Unit at the SYMAS H.Q., in Moorgate Road, Rotherham.

    The match on    Saturday 15th April, 1989 was the F.A. Cup
Affcka,-                    IiaMTo ie i to y a
     semi-final.                   that the tickets reserved for us

  for league matches would be sold for this particular match

  and we would have to make our own arrangements if we wished

  to attend.        On the Tuesday before the game I telephoned

  Inspector    S.   Sewell   at   Hammerton   Road    Police   Station   in

  Sheffield and I informed him of our decision to attend the

  game in any event,     as Liaison Officers.          We always liaise

  with him before each game to inform him of our intentions.

  I told him where we would meet him and the time in order

  that he could arrange access for us.               Although I was not

  present at last year's semi-final I understand from Station

  Officer Higgins that the same problems were encountered then

  so far as our tickets were concerned.

  After telephoning Mr Sewell I contacted                  the secretary

  of Mr              (the secretary of the Football Club),               at
Hillsborough and confirmed our arrangements made with South

Yorkshire Police and her response was "lovely".

I was asked by Assistant Chief Jones to ensure that I, Mr

Higgins       and    the    extra    duty crews       arranged       for   the match

should each have pocketphone radios.                       We decided between us

that    we    would     leave      one    vehicle    at    Middlewood       Ambulance

Station on          standby    (one mile         to the    west     of    the ground,

outside Middlewood Hospital) and the other vehicle would be

used    by Mr       Higgins,       the crew of       that    vehicle       and me   to

travel       down     to    the     ground.          The     ambulance       left   at

Middlewood was intended to be backup - the idea being that

there     should       always        be    one    ambulance       on      station   at

Hillsborough.              If that ambulance had to be used then the

backup       vehicle       would    be    brought   down     from    Middlewood     to

replace the vehicle in use.

We all met at Longley Station at 1350 and shortly after that

S.O.    Higgins,       and Q.A.                   and Q.A.                      and I

proceeded to the ground in one ambulance.                         We arrived there

at 1410.        We met Inspector Sewell of South Yorkshire Police

and parked our ambulance inside the Penistone Road entrance

in the position marked by a rectangle on the plan attached.

 This was close to the gymnasium which in accordance with

the SYMAS Disaster Plan for Hillsborough would be used as a

casualty clearing post in the event of such problem.                                We

asked    Inspector Sewell            how things were going and he said

they    were        O.K.           The    ambulance       radio     was    operating

satisfactorily.
11.      At 1445 we proceeded to the point marked on the plan by an X

         (between the North Stand and the Spion K op ).                               We checked

         the pocket radios and they were all working.                            At the point

         marked by a X there were a few St John's representatives and

         some police officers.

12   .   I clearly remember that the match kicked off at 1459 i.e.

         one minute early.             I always look at the stadium clock at

         the    time   of     kick-off.            At    the    time     of    kick-off       Q.A.

                       Q.A.                         S.O.       Higgins    and     I    were    all

         standing together at the point marked by a green x.
                        4
13.      At -abotTC" 1505 we noticed what we took to be a                                scuffle

         occurring     in     the   middle     of   the       standing        session    at    the

         Leppings Lane end of the ground.                        Q.A.                        and I

         walked    along the asphalt           track by the             side    of    the pitch

         (along the side of the North Stand) to investigate.                                 As we

         got closer it appeared that there had been some overspill of

         spectators.          When we reached that end of the ground there

         were   more    people      actually moving            onto     the    turf    and    some

         sitting    along     the     length   of       the    touchline.        People were

         getting agitated.            Someone then drew our attention to a fan

         who was injured.              This was in the area just behind the

         lefthand      goal    post    at    the    Leppings          Lane     end.      We   had

         proceeded round to the middle of the Leppings Lane end and

         we attended to the injured fan, a youth who appeared to have

         a   fractured      leg.       At   this    stage       I thought        there was       a

         scuffle going on inside the enclosure.                       More people however

         started to emerge around u s .                   I think that it was about
      this time that the game was stopped by the referee.

14.   We needed a fracture-pac to put on the youth's leg,                               and a

      stretcher.       T rm n li l ninnillj h m rn r rn n l i t r n r l r r t p t i n n n to ^ ^ -* 3

      request.            I tried the pocketphone but it did not work.                          I

      moved away from the stand thinking that might help reception

      but it did not.             There was no reply from Control.                      /C tn a w

15.   By now people were getting angry and                          frustrated and they

      tended to take out their anger and frustration on those in

      uniform by hitting out and aiming kicks.                             I was struck on

      the    right         side     of my chest        and     I    noticed     that     Q.A.

                          and some     of the policemen in the vicinity had

      kicks aimed at them by spectators.                       I still, at this stage,

      thought      there had been           a    fight on       the   terraces    and     that

      spectators were coming away from the terraces to escape the

      fight.

16.   When the spectators started getting aggressive I pulled Q.A.

                           and me    back       to   our     original      position.         We

      walked back.            I advised S.O. Higgins of what was happening

      and I      told      him that my pocketphone was unserviceable.                          I

      said there was a youth with a broken leg and there had been

      a   disturbance.              Q.A.                            Q.A.                  S.O.

      Higgins and I then walked back to the Leppings Lane end with

      fracture-pac and stretcher,                    first    aid   bags    and a b&dgdjng          <£

      mask    (an instrument for resuscitation).                           When we arrived




                      0
              back at the scene the situation had worsened.                      This was two

              or three minutes from when we had left it.                        We were still

              not     aware     of    precisely      what   was     happening    but     it    was

              increasingly obvious there were a lot more angry and a lot

              more    injured        spectators.         Both S.O.     Higgins    and    I were

              thumped and subjected to verbal abuse.                      Q.A.

              <                         applied a splint to the youth's leg.
        17.   The situation was becoming increasingly u g l y I                     took S.O.

              Higgins' pocketphone off him to see if it would work but it

              would not./            I wanted now to bring the other vehicle from

              Middlewood to Leppings Lane as a precaution.                         Because I

              could not get through S.O. Higgins returned to our ambulance
                                    £ VU^e
              to use the ambulance radio. A     Again we were subject of

              punching and abuse.                While S.O.     Higgins was away I moved

              back to about half way towards the half way line and looking

              at the Leppings Lane end I saw that people were being pulled

              from the terraces into the seating area of the west stand.

              Other fans were staggering out of the enclosure or over the

              top    of   the    fence    and    many    spectators    were     falling/lying

              down.       I went down again to the Leppings Lane end and saw

              there were people crushed against the fence.                        By now the

              police had started to arrive in large numbers.

        18.   I knew having worked with S.O. Higgins that he would by now

              have    started        setting    up   a   casualty    clearing    point      where

              casualties        could    be     brought . for     assessment     and    I     knew

              according to our disaster plan that would be the gymnasium.

        fa. , A   spectator              approached me and asked me to look at a
\<K -
            little boy whom he thought was dead.                      He pointed at a group

            of people surrounding the body of a small boy on the pitch.

             I approached the group and a man who said he was a doctor

            was working on the boy.                He said he thought there was a

            chance for him.            I used the pocketphone repeatedly but to

            avail.         I told the doctor I would summon assistance.                          I

            ran back to our ambulance

l^V         Prior     to    running      back     to     our    ambulance          I    saw   that

            Ambulancemen                  and                        were attending to fans

            laid on the pitch.           I told them to keep eye contact with me

            so far as they could since I wished them to make sure they

            knew exactly where           I was.          Q.A.                          was on his

            knees giving mouth to mouth resuscitation on a patient.

            There was a gang of youths around him.                         One of those youth

            kicked Q.A.                         repeatedly on his side and legs as

            he gave the mouth to mouth treatment.                      It was at this stage

            that a policeman         told me he thought that some fans were dead

            or dying.        This    was now stating the obvious.

      2 0   I knew that S.O.         Higgins had returned to the ambulance but I

            did    not     have   confirmation         of     what    he    had    done.       My

            intention in returning to the ambulance was        to declare a«tM
                                                                        Iaoe_^/&k 1^

                         asked what was happening. I informed him about                                                                     the         child

                         on the pitch and I tried                                   to point out where he was.                                               The

                         police were now forming a line across the pitch.                                                                        We could

                         not see the child where we were but, carrying a stretcher,

                         we ran across to where the child had been.                                                            This was in the

                         plan attached.                The child was there.                                     We loaded the child

                         on to a stretcher.                        L.A. Flack's colleague had driven his

I then approaohed* Leppings Lane end and started the process

of trying to re-assess the situation.                                       There was general

chaos and mayhem.                    When I arrived at the Leppings Lane end

I saw people crushed against the fence.                                         Some were being

dragged out by police through gate 2.                                      Some were climbing

over the fencing.                    Some were being pulled up onto the stand

from the terracing.                    Somehow someone had made a hole in the

wire fence^and some people were escaping through it.                                                   I did

not realise at that time that people at the front of the

  fence must have been standing on bodies beneath them.

  I was on-my way back to otar ambulance to report/awd I saw

Deputy Chief Hopkins (at the point marked with an U on the

plan). A          We went back onto the pitch and I gave him an up

date       on    what     I had       seen      and     done       and      warned           him       to   be

careful because of the aggression in the crowd.                                              He told me

to make sure that the Major Incident Tender vehicle was on

its way in accordance with the disaster plan.     I returned
                                                   oA-    (
to the ambulance and radioed that request to ControlAand was

informed that that vehicle was                            already on              its way.

i   MIIiTTi I   null   I'i mi i ni    II   nl l l   liT! uf   l i r r n r a r n r ri^ r t.         I    then

went      into Penistone Road and began marshalling ambulances

which were by now arriving.

Under our disaster plan ambulances entering Hillsborough are
                      supposed to arrive at the point marked with a red X on the

                      plan and to leave by the point marked with a red Y.                                      We

                      could      not       however    do    this     because     of   parked       vehicles.

                      There were hire vans which the police had used.                               There was

                      also a jail van in the way.                       This meant that one could not

                      proceed by vehicle to exit point Y from point X, within the

                      ground.          I do not know if the hire vans had arrived before

                      or after the incident started.

                27.   Our ambulances were coming from the south along Penistone

                      Road.           There was enough space to reverse two ambulances

                      side by side through the entrance X.                            There was room for

                      two banks of two and I marshalled vehicles in this manner.

                      I held the arriving vehicles in Penistone Road until I could

                      get them into the ground.

                28.   S.O.                   then arrived with the Major Incident vehicle.

                      This vehicle is a mobile control and support unit full of

                      equipment.             I marshalled him into the space marked with a

                      Z.

                29.   D iv i s i o n a l    Supe r in t e nd e n t      Dale    and    Assistant         Chief

                      Metropolitan             A mb u la n c e    Officer       Jones       then    arrived,

                      separately.              Mr Dale asked me to up date him and I told

                      him what I was doing.                   Mr Dale then went to the gymnasium

                      to liaise with Mr Hopkins (Incident Officer in Charge).                                  I

                      was     still        marshalling           vehicles      and    all    the    time     the

                      ambulances were being loaded and sent on their way.                                    The

                      next time I noticed Mr Dale he was at the exit marked with a

                      Y.         He    must     have       been    to   the    gymnasium.           He     began




                                                                   15 ^
      marshalling vehicles in through the exit Y.                       This allowed

      us     double    the    number      of    vehicles     to   be    loaded      with

      casualties.

30.   Q.A.                     arrived with a mini bus ambulance and I

      arranged for him to park on the pavement and told him to

      stay with his vehicle.               The intention was to use the 10

      seater mini bus for transporting walking wounded.                            I told

      Mr Jones of the availability of this vehicle                          for walking

      wounded.

31.   Then Mr    Jones     asked     me   to   re-locate     myself     and vehicles

      still arriving at the scene to the Herries Road Bus Depot

      and to treat this as an ambulance parking point (ceasing use

      of point red X ).             The Herries Road Bus Depot is about 200

      yards away.          Vehicles Assembled at the Depot would operate

      as a standby pool and we kept vehicles there until they were

      required.

32.   I managed       to   locate     another    pocketphone      and    assembled      a

      convoy of ambulances which proceeded to the Bus Depot.                           At

      the Depot I contacted Control via the pocketphone and told

      them that I was stood by there.                    As vehicles arrived I

      stood them four abreast in an open area at the Depot.                             I

      sited    sitting       case    vehicles    (i.e.     vehicles      for    walking

      wounded)    and West      Yorkshire       Incident     Vehicle     (with extra

      equipment in the back) separately within the area.                           I then

      gathered together L.A. Flack,                      ,            and      "      and

      told them that L.A. Flack was staying with me as a relay and

      advised the others to make sure the crews stayed together as




                                                  5
      to     attempt      to maintain            morale.         I asked     L.A.                to

      complete       a    list       of   vehicle     fleet      numbers     and       respective

      services       at       the    garage.          L.A.    _____    did    that.             The

      vehicles stood by were 13 SYMAS, 5 West Yorks, 4 Derbyshire,

      1 Yorks and 1 Notts i.e. a total of 24 vehicles.

33.   I    was    starting          to    become    concerned      about     the       number    of

      vehicles arriving at the Bus Depot.                          The incident appeared

      to be coming to a conclusion and some vehicles might have

      been       required       for      other    emergency      duties.           I    tried    to

      contact Control by pocketphone to suggest this but I could

      not    transmit on the pocketphone.                         I could however hear

      Control calling me.                  I do not know why this was the case.

      After about a minute I got a poor contact with Control using

      a Barnsley ambulance on site.                          I was asked by Control to

      contact them on a landline.

34.   I took L.A.                    with me into the Bus Deport Garage to find

      a telephone.                  With the help of garage staff I was given

      access       to     a    manager's         office    and    I   made    contact       with

      Control.           I was connected to Mr Page who instructed me to

      ensure that either Mr Jones or Mr Hopkins contacted him by

      Vodafone as soon as possible.                        I had no communication with

      site so I told L.A.                        |to despatch a runner to the ground

      with the message.                    I believe the message was carried by

      Q.A.

35.   We could not maintain an open line so I agreed with Control

      I would ring in every ten minutes.                         After about ten minutes

      L.A.               informed me that the vehicles at the garage were
      to be dispersed and I was required at the gymnasium.                                     I

      proceeded to the gymnasium by ambulance and once there I was

      briefed with other Officers by Mr Page.                            Mr Page decided

      that Assistant Divisional Officer Morley,                          Station Officer

                    and I should remain at the gymnasium and carry out

      a     body    removal     programme        if      and    as   necessary.             The

      gymnasium was now full of bodies and we were told that we

      were now talking in terms of over 90 bodies.

36.   Mr Jones then advised me that all bodies were to be removed

      to     the    Medico      Legal    Centre          in    Sheffield       (the   Public

      Mortuary).

37.   Assistant       Divisional       Officer      Morley,      S.O.                  and     I

      discussed       the    situation.             Mr    Morley      became     Officer     in

      Charge for the removal of the bodies.                            S.O.                 |was

      made     responsible       for     radio      communications         and    I   was    to

      ensure       that   the   bodies       were     loaded     and    conveyed      with     a

      policeman with each body.                       There were       three     bodies     per

      ambulance.        We did this all night from the first release of
                                  0 * 2* £
      bodies       at 2130 up to            By 2130 eleven  bodies from

      Northern       General    Hospital       and one from            Royal     Hallamshire

      Hospital had been transferred to the gymnasium.                            I    believe

      this was on the Coroner's instructions.

38.   In all we removed and transported 94 bodies and accompanying

      police personnel between 2130 and 0528                         Mr Hopkins declared

      the    incident       closed      at   0530      and I     returned        to   Longley

      Station to organise equipment cleaning.                         I left Longley for

      home at 0640 on Sunday 16th April.

      During the mayhem on the pitch I saw a very young girl (I

      would estimate         she was    about    10 years    old)   in St       John's

      uniform.      She was with a male casualty who appeared to be

      dead.        It   is    clearly    a    distressing    matter      that   young

      volunteers are present at a football match when they might

      be exposed to a situation such as that.

40.   RED CROSS

      Sometime    between      2230     and    mid-night    when    we   were    busy

      transporting the bodies a Red Cross vehicle gained access to

      the area adjacent to the gymnasium.                  In it there were two

      ladies whom I took to be nurses, one gentleman and a young

      child.      I asked the man what he thought he was doing and he

      said he was from the Red Cross.               I said this was a mortuary

      and not a proper place for a child and I told him to move

      on.      He moved and parked his vehicle behind the gymnasium.

      I do not know if the child was then left in the vehicle or

      not.

      PRESS

      There are some terraced houses along Penistone Road whose

      gardens back on to the car park adjacent to the gymnasium.

      A press man took photographs with the aid of flash as we

      loaded bodies into the ambulances.               I arranged for a police

      officer to deal with him.               We re-located the Major Incident
     tender vehicle across the line of vision from the gardens to

     the ambulances.



Dated this     day of        1989.

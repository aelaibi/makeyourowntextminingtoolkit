             I live at the above address with my parents and family I am employed

             as an apprentice Electrician by

                                                                                           She was able to

             buy three tickets for the semi-cup final at Hillsborough,                            between

             Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15th April, 1989 (150489).                                 These
                                               *_________________
             tickets were for the Spion Hop stand.



             At about      12.30 pm (1230 hrs)      on Saturday 15th /4pril,               1989 (150489)          I

             walked to the                                                                          from rny

             home      I arrived at the Public House at about             1245 hr/s.          On my arrival           I

             saw about 75 Liverpool        supporters     in the P u b l i c H y u s e car park most of

             them were either sat         in cars with the doors open or sat on the ground.

             Just about all of them were drinking out of glassars.
                                                                                     PAGE         2
                                                                                     S2129




             I walked into the games    room of the public house and I found the room

             to be full of Liverpool    supporters.     I realised that    I was not going

             to be served for some time so I stood outside the public house door to

             wait for my father and his friend to arrive.



             The car park will only hold about nine cars.        All the spaces were

             taken, most of the   cars had the doors open with fans sitting        inside

             playing their car radios quite     loud.



             At about   1315 hrs that       I was joined by my father and his friend.

             My father got us some drinks and we stood on the pavement outside the

             car pafk of the public house.



                   was a Ford Cortina,/!     think it was brc^wn in colour,     parked with

                s boot against the wall of the car par#.  We were standing just the
                                                    /
             other side of the wall and were only about six feet away from it,



             I noticed a white man who I would describe as about 5 ’9 tall with

             light brown hair which was     curly and collar    length.    He had a day or

             so of growth on his face but he did not have a moustache.

ALCOt-jCTL      WaS a ^out"    years old.   He was wearing a pair of trainers, a pair
             df blue jeans and a 'T* shirt which was a light colour but I cannot

             remember exactly and a light blue pig skin jacket.



             This man was standing at the front of the Ford Cortina and was selli/ng

             cans of beer to the Liverpool    football   supporters.      The cans of beer

             were spread out over the bonnet of the      car.   The cans/were    in trays of

             24 cans and he had three trays./    About    15 or 20 supporters bought       cans

             from this man and one man bought a full tray off him.           The man was
                                                                               PAGE     3
                                                                               S2129

        charging SOp per can.



        He sold the cans quite quickly and he soon had no lager left and only

        half a tray of beer.     One supporter asked for some lager so the man

        put the    rest of the beer on the front passenger seat and took off his

        jacket and placed it on the driver's seat.       He closed the vehicle's

        doors and walked into the public house and I lost sight of him.



        I then saw one of the supporters walk t              he car.    This man
C k r
        approached the passengers door of the F              ina and got something

        out of his trouser pocket.     I think   it           keys.    He quickly

        opened the car door and took the half f               of beer and closed the

        car door.    He walked over to his friends.      There were about 20 of

        them.     After about 30 seconds this man returned to the car and as he

        got   close to the car he went to open the car door again as he did so

        he looked towards the public house.       Something must have    put hirn off

        from opening the car door,    because he carried on walking a few feet.

        He then turned and went back to the passengers door of the Ford

                                       ;n saw him take the jacket out of the car

        and close the door agai



        He walked towards his friends again and threw the jacket to them.           I

        then lost sight of the jacket.



        After about 5 minutes the man who owned the beer and jacket         returned

        to the    car with another two trays of lager.    He did not realise what

        had happened until about    10 minutes   later when he went    into the car.

        He then walked around the car park looking for the jacket.



        I turned around for a few seconds and when I turned back to the car

      park I saw the man who had been selling the beer having an argument

      with the 20 youths who had the jacket.          I thought that this argument

      was going to result    in a fight but the man who had his jacket stolen

      left them and returned to the public house.



      After about 5 minutes                     my father's friend and I went       into

      the   public house to get some more drinks.           When we got inside there

      was more space than before.        Shortly we were joined by my father.             I

      saw on the other side of the bar the man who had had his jacket

      stolen.     He still did riot have his jacket on at this stage.            We stood

      drinking at the bar for a short while,         I went to the toilet, when I

      came out the man had recovered his         jacket and was wearing it.



      I would describe the man who stole         the beers and jacket asa white

      male 5'6 tall, about 21 years old,         he had very short hair, in fact so

      short    I could not tell what   colour    it was.     Down the sides ofhis head

      he had a line shaved into his hair.          He was    clean shaven,    average

      build,    he was wearing a pair of jeans and a brown jumper.



      We then made our way down to the ground.          We had no difficulty in

      getting    into the ground.   Shortly after the match started at 1500 hrs,

      I noticed a commotion in the West stand.          Then Liverpool       supporters

      started to go onto the pitch and the players            left the ground.     No one

      seemed to know what was infact happening and the Nottingham Forest

      fans began to taunt the Liverpool         fans and they thought the Liverpool

      fans were    invading the pitch.



      At about    1515 hrs I saw a Liverpool      supporter trot down the piyfch

                                                                        82129

both hands.     He was still walking towards the Nottingham Forest

supporters he got to the by line which is six feet away from the fence

which ran along the pitch in front of the Nottingham Forest

supporters,   he was still   beckoning/the Forest supporters.    They

became agitated and a few of th&m began to climb up the fence        in an

obvious attempt to attack h i m /     Also the noise from the Spion Kop

increased.    This alterted other Liverpool     supporters who were also on

the pitch.



About 40 of them began to make their way towards the        Spion Kop.    By

this time the    Police   realised what was happening and   forced the 40

back.



The youth who    had been beckoning was chased by the Police and I       saw

them take him    down the pla y er ’s tunnel.



The Police then stood roughly at the half way line shoulder to

shoulder and cordoned off the pitch.



The man who was selling the beer outside the                                    ls

known to the licensee,     but I don't know his name.

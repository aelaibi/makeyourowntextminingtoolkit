Dear S i r ,

It was with h e a r t f e l t r e l i e f t h a t I saw my law a b i d i n g , f a n a t i c a l Liverpool
s u p p o r t i n g , 19 y e a r o l d son a r r i v e home a s h o r t time a g o .     This was a f t e r an
a g o n i s i n g t h r e e or four hours f o r m y s e l f and my w i f e .   I g r i e v e f o r t h o s e whose
lo v e d ones did not come home.

I, t h e r e f o r e , w r i t e t o complain b i t t e r l y about t h e o r g a n i s a t i o n and co n t r o l o f t h i s
match;

1.   i t was t h e wrong ven ue.

2.   even i f i t was th e r i g h t venue th e t i c k e t a l l o c a t i o n was r i d i c u l u o u s .

3.   my son t e l l s me t h a t t h e p o l i c e a ll o w e d p eo p le i n t o t h e ground who did not have
     t i c k e t s , in f a c t , one o f h i s f r i e n d s , whose t i c k e t had been s t o l e n in t h e po st
     and hoped t o buy one a t t h e ground, was a ll o w e d in a t 2 . 5 0 p.m. by t h e p o l i c e
     t o , "avoid t r o u b l e o u t s i d e t h e ground".

4.   why was t h e g a t e which was opened or broken down not s u p e r v i s e d when w it h in a
      few minutes o f t h e horror stanGng some 250 p o l i c e o f f i c e r s were on t h e p i t c h ,
      "to prevent fa n s g e t t i n g t o each other"?   I n e v i t a b l y t h i s meant t h a t Liverpool
     fans were having t o care f o r t h e i r own in j u r e d and dead.

5.   my son t e l l s me t h a t p eo p le who were drunk were a ll o w e d i n t o t h e ground and I
     can o n ly shudder a t t h e i r r e a c t i o n s in t h e panic s i t u a t i o n .

6.    a fireman who was on duty s a i d to my son and h i s f r i e n d , UI d o n ' t know who's in
      charge h e r e , i t ' s a God awful mess".

The above words were s c r i b b l e d on Saturday e v e n i n g ,                s h o r t l y a f t e r my son a r r i v e d
home.

I have now had time t o r e f l e c t and t o s ta nd with my s o n , h i s f r i e n d and c o u n t l e s s
o th er g r i e v i n g persons on t h e Kop.           I , t h e r e f o r e , w r i t e with g re a t s a d n e s s , much
b i t t e r n e s s and deep anger and commend t o a l l who have anything t o do w ith t h e
o r g a n i s a t i o n or co n t r o l o f t h i s match, Dr. A sh to n 's comments on t e l e v i s i o n
concerning r e s p o n s i b i l i t y and a c c o u n t a b i l i t y and a l s o t h e words o f Simon Barnes in
“The Times" t h i s morning. This should not have been a ll o w e d t o happen.

For the Attention of Mr. H.E. McGee,

Dear Mr. McGee,

     Could you please tell me why there were no stewards
on duty at your football ground on Saturday, 15 th April,
1989 at the Spion Kop end.

     I entered the ground at 14.05 hours and left at
15.45 hours, during that time, all I saw was the
individual at the turnstile and three programme sellers.

     Why was there no public announcement as to the
tragic events at the other end of the ground?

     Could the cause of this disaster be that there was
an equal absence of stewards at the other end of the
ground where up to ten minutes before kick-off, the
area to the right (looking from the Spion Kop end) was
almost empty and the area to the left only sparsely
populated whilst the area directly behind the goal was
packed solid even to my view from the other end of the
pitch.

    An answer to my questions would be appreciated.

                   Yours sincerely,




                                (CAPTAIN RET’D)

                                                   17th April 1989




We are a middle aged couple with two teenage daughters* We were
both in the stand above where all the Liverpool Supporters uere
killed.

We left our house at 11.00 a.m. and got into the ground at 2.10 p.m.
At 2.20 p.m. we went into our seats and then walked forward to look
over the balcony at the fans below.   It was obvious to us that there
were too many fans in the area behind the goal and indeed many looked
distressed and many of them uere chanting "no more room no more room"
"don't let anyone else in here".    Surely the Police must have had
their surveillance cameras focused on that area and surely if we
could see it was overcrowded at 2.20 p.m. they must have been able
to see it.   Why didn't they tell the Stewards not to let anyone
else into that area and to direct people to the two side areas
where there was room?   Why did they allow people to keep coming
into that area in a steady stream from 2.20 p.m. to 2.50 p.m. WHY ?

My husband went to the toilet at 2.40 p.m. and said there were
thousands outside and he could see a group of about 100 to 200
being allowed to run down the street as fast as they could towards
the crowds that were already there.

Then of course the event which if you wanted to be kind you would call
"gross incompetence and bad management" but if you were being really
truthful and honest you would call wicked, was allowed to happen.
The Police opened a 16 foot gate and let the crowd rush in as if this
was not bad enough, nobody had their ticket checked to see if they
had a correct ticket or in fact any ticket at all, this was at a
match that was supposed to be all ticket, I myself was frisked when
we went in and my bag was searched and my husband was also searched.
Then to make matters even worse the Police and Stewards allowed the
croud to rush towards the first entrance they saw which was of course
the tunnel leading directly into the already overcrowded area.

Why was the gate opened to let everyone in irrespective of whether
they had a correct ticket or not ?   Why were they allowed to rush
towards the most crowded area of the ground ? Why were they not
directed towards areas with more empty spaces ?

Now we have heard the Police opened the gate to alleviate pressure outside
which we just cannot comprehend was a valid reason knowing the
state of the ground inside.   Why was there so much pressure outside ?
Why couldn't the Police control it ? Isn't that what they are there for?
Why weren't there more Police outside ? Why were 100 to 200 fans allowed
to run down the road towards the rest of the crowd trying to get in
to the ground ?   Why did Police on horseback not make the croud queue in
an orderly fashion as the Police at Anfield do week in and week out in
far worse conditions i.e. the alleways to the bop and the main road
outside the ground ? Why uere the Police outside the ground if not to
control the fans ?    Why didn't the police inside communicate the position
to the Police outside ?
Lastly of course there is why uere Liverpool allocated less tickets
than Nottingham Forest.   We have tuice as many regular supporters as
NQttingham Forest and uere given 4,000 or uhatever less tickets than
them.   In fact people uho got into the ground uhen the gate uas
opened by the Police had tickets uhich they had bought from Nottingham
Forest fans.   The Police say it uas easier to control us and the
traffice if ue uere given the Lickers Lane End.   This has been proved
to be totally untrue as there uas no croud control outside and most of
the people arrived late because of traffic problems, not to mention
Police holding up coaches and checking for alcohol, and being made
to ualk dies from their coaches to the ground.   This has happened
many times to us, most recently at Coventry and prior to that at
Aston Villa when Liverpool played Arsenal in the Littleuoods Cup.
So there is no uay giving us feuer tickets can be justified.

We will never forget the scenes ue saw and people being dragged out
of the paddock below us and throun on to the pitch and left to die.
People trying to get out through totally inadequate gates and being
pushed back by the Police at first.   People being carried auay on
hoarding by the Fans not ambulance men, policemen or steuards.
Why weren’t the stretchers there uhere uere they ? Where uere the
ambulances ? Uhy ueren t uire cutters used in the fence more quickly ?
Why didn't the Police react quicker to this terrible situation ?
Why uere there no announcements over the loudspeaker made to inform
everyone uho didn't know of the problem ?

WHY uas this terrible thing alloued to happen ?

We uill never be able to forget it anyone  uho uas there and especially
those uho have lost loved ones and friends until ue get some ansuers
to the above questions.

We are enclosing an article uhich ue think ansuers those questions
but ue hope and pray that some one can shou us some other reason
to keep us sane.

Dear

                                    HILLSBOROUGH

I am writing on behalf of my wife and myself as we both attended Hillsborough on
that fateful Saturday, the 15th April.  We are only just beginning to come to terms
with what happened on that day, and it certainly has not been made any easier by
comments that have been passed in certain quarters.  These people can only be
described as both arrogant and ignorant, they need to be pitied. The hierarchy
running the game of football have shown nothing but total disrespect towards the
bereaved, they should hang their heads in shame.

My wife and I are both season ticket holders in the Kemlyn Road Stand seats
                         We have attended some one hundred and fifty matches over
the past five seasons, I myself first stood on the Kop as an eleven year old in
the 1967-68 season.

We had purchased two north stand seat tickets from Liverpool Football Club on our
season ticket vouchers and where seated in row 34 seats 29 and 30. The kind of
view we got of the Leppings Lane Terracing was rather similar to that which
________________ witnessed when taking photographs which appeared in the Daily Post

for us on that day.

We set off from Llandudno just after 9am on the Saturday morning, I was allowing

  Inside the ground now, first job is to use the toilets then something to eat and
  drink. The toilets were in a very good condition, perhaps the best we have seen
  in any football ground.   I remember visiting West Bromich Albions Ground, the
  toilets were in the open air and the urine was floating all over the floor and
  the stench was awful.   It would have been more hygenic to have urinated were I
  stood! We now visit the food bar for some refreshments due to the great difficulty
  we have in trying to get to the toilets at football grounds drinking of liquids
  is limited. Meat pies are 90p and the tea is 40p, we are served by a young girl
 .who is obviously nervous as we can see her visibly trembling as she attempts to
  total up the sum for four purchases. A man walks into, the food bar and is over­
 heard to mutter something about being short-staffed to the other ladies serving
 behind the counter.    The pie is luke-warm and the tea is made from some brown
 coloured powder which floats around on the surface of the hot water.    Not at all
 pleased with the catering facilities we decide to make our way to our allocated
 seats.

  Stewards are standing around but no one asks to see our tickets or direct us to our
  position in the stand. We find our seats and on being seated we notice the clock
  reads 12.50 p.m. We survey the scene, not many people in the ground as yet, a few
  are in the Leppings Lane Terracing who are sitting on the concrete steps reading
  their programmes, one or two people are leaning right back taking in the warm sun.
  We wonder what the pre-match entertainment will be that was promised, there was to
  be no pre-match entertainment. We read our programmes, it is now 2 p.m., the
  Leppings Lane central pens are getting quite full especially in comparison to the
  other areas of the Leppings Lane terracing. We decide to go to the toilet, this
  time a steward asks to see our tickets.

  It is 2.40 p.m. the central terracing in Leppings Lane looks cram packed, people
  are attempting to get out. Some are trying to get over the front perimeter fencing
  only to find they are being pushed back in the crush by the police possibly to their
  deaths. The braver and fitter ones are attempting to climb into the West Stand, to
  the rear of the terracing by jumping off crush barriers or fencing and praying that
  the people in the West Stand catch them and drag them to safety. The policeman in
  the West End is watching but made no attempt to prevent this happening, he obviously
  knows what is happening down below. The elevated section to the right is filling up
1 steadily, the section to the left appears half full, the section to the right has
  hardly anyone in it. We have only noticed two young girls entering this section of
  terracing to the right via the tunnel, everyone else appears to have got in there
  by climbing out of the middle pens.

  The two teams take to the field, the ground erupts with a cauldron of noise as
  both sets of supporters sing for their respective teams, any cries for help are
  totally muted. We cannot help but look over to the Lepping Lane end there is a
  strange humming sort of noise coming from there.    No one up this end of the ground
  is watching the game that is in progress, something is seriously wrong in the
  central pens. We hear screams, we hear shouts the people in the West stand are all
  standing up waving their fists towards the police.    People are being hauled up into
  the West Stand, the front perimeter fencing and the fencing on the sides of the pens
  have swarms of people trying to escape.    The police just stand there watching, one
  man escapes he is staggering around the pitch, he drops to his knees, two policemen
  grab him and appear to arrest him. Another two lads escape, they run onto the
1 pitcbr-tb«y-slTout and point out to Bruce Grobbelaar that people are being crushed
* to death. A senior policeman walks onto the pitch and orders the referee to get
  the players off the pitch.    Some players stop and look to see what is happening,
  eventually they walk off.

 There is now a noise of pandemonium, people are screaming for help but the police
 appear to be more concerned with preventing people getting onto the pitch.  It is
 the fans themselves who are assisting the injured.  It appears that escape gates
 have been opened, the gate to the terracing on the right side which is half full is
 definitely open, I wonder why no one enters this section of the ground, of course I
 do not realise the devastation that has taken place, those people witnessing that at
 There are now many people on the pitch, some staggering around then collapsing o n
 the turf. The police nearest the central pens are beginning to realise just what
 is happening and are starting to provide some assistance.      The people in the West
 Stand are going berserk they are screaming and waving their fists in the direction
 of the police, they have seen the carnage below them. Someone on the loud speaker
 is telling people to clear the pitch, the Forest fans are chanting, the Liverpool
 fans scream at them to shut up.     A large number of police come marching into the
 stadium from the corner between the North stand and the Kop.      We say thank God desperatel
 needed assistance has arrived and of course we are quite terrified by now with events that
 are unfolding in front of our eyes.     But no, the police march to the half way line
 and form a cordon just standing.there staring at the mayhem,       a totally useless act.
 Fans run up to them, screaming for their assistance but they do not budge.

 Liverpool fans are now ripping up hoardings and using them as make shift stretchers.
 They are ferrying casualties from one end of the ground to the other.  The police
 reinforcements standing on the half way line offer no assistance and in fact
 hamper operations by standing where they do. There are bynow many people all over the
 pitch, the people in the North stand are looking in a state of shock and are
 wondering the extent of the trauma.

Fans and police are tearing at the perimeter fencing, I tell my wife and the man
sitting alongside us that .someone is dead inside there.  People are being carried
out and put on the turf, lifeless bodies are being hurled all over the place.
Unconscious people are being given heart massages and the kiss of life. We now know
there are fatalities as coats and jumpers are placed over the deceased faces. People
are still staggering around, some half naked, articles of clothing come hurtling
over the perimeter fencing onto the pitch.   People around us are sobbing, some
people are leaving.  The Fire Brigade arrive, the perimeter fencing is ripped open,
there is an ambulance behind the goal.   People are continually running backwards and
forwards with people flat out on the hoardings, some injured, some shocked some dead.
The Nottingham Forest Fans now appreciate the severity of the problem and warmly
appauld the Liverpool fans heroics.

Police and Firemen are inside the pens it is difficult to make out just what is going
on. A young man lies slumped across a crush barrier obviously dead, people are
still inside the middle section of the terracing but now to the rear, they are
shouting and pointing a the police inside the pen. We see no signs of looting or
urinating, just total chaos.  People have told me since who were in the Leppings
Lane, of the disgusting remarks made by the police at the time, but as I did not
witness these insults first hand I will not repeat them.  As we watched these
harrowing scenes before our very eyes we felt totally useless unable to do anything.
We felt anger and grief we needed to get as far away as possible.  We made our way
out of the stand.

It was 3.40pm as we made our exit one young lad come over who was obviously shocked
and was shaking his head and saying it was the pigs fault.  We made our way down
the gangway, a man was standing there facing us, he was ashen his eyes staring
straight at us he was muttering that his lad was in there (obviously referring to the
Leppings Lane), We did not know what to say, I just said that they had got everyone
out now and that his son would be ok. What elso could I say? Further along
there was another man with the same expression on his face, but this face was familiar
as he sat near us at Anfield.  I asked if he was alright he replied "yes". We
moved on.

 We are leaving the ground quite possibly via them dreaded gates. We dare not look
 back on the side of us frightened of what we may see. We make our way past fire
 engines, ambulances and police with sirens blaring.   People are just standing around
 staring, crying attempting to make sense of the tragedy. We of course realise that
 people have died, we ask how many? Someone holding a portable radio to their ear
.replies "five". We know this is wrong as we saw at least fifteen fatalities. We
 walk along the dual carriageway towards where our car is parked, local people are standing
 at their front doors staring towards Hillsborough, no one saying a word.
                                  _   4   -




Coach drivers are sat behind their steering wheels listening to their radios
wondering what is going on and how many people less they may be taking home.
Some people are sat on the coaches, obviously feeling safer now. Outside public
phone boxes queues twenty to thirty deep are waiting to phone home and inform the
loved ones that they are safe. There is an eerie silence all around, the only
sound that can be heard are that of wailing sirens. Apolice car goes past telling
people to get off the road, to clear the way for the emergency services, people
respond by hurling a verbal volley of abuse towards the car.  It is if people are
in unison saying the attempts at organisation are now totally futile.

It seems to take an age to reach the car. We switch on the radio it is 4 p.m. we
hear "forty dead". We drive some miles, ambulances are passing us in the opposite
direction, we realise we need petrol and the use of the toilets. As we pull into
the service station we again see queues of people waiting to use the phone, it
now enters our head that we should also be phoning home. We decide to drive home
non-stop to get away as far as possible from Hillsborough.  We reach home at 7 p.m.
the death toll is in the 'seventies'. What we witnessed on that fateful day will
haunt us for the rest of our lives.

This closes our account of what we witnessed on that dreadfull day. We would
like to take this opportunity to add further comments as regards football in
general.

Our experience of attending football matches is that the 'Away' sections of the
  ound always appear to have far inferior facilities.      It is possible thalTthis
  eeds reS6ntmen't'_am'on,
                         g st~away fans due to their treatment. Usually the catering
facilities leaves a great deal to be desired.      I remember attending a game at
Stoke City Football Club and the car and coach park was just an expanse of waste
land and it was pouring down with rain that day, everyone's footwear was covered
in mud.

Also a visit to Aston Villa brings back memories of being treated less than human.
A friend and myself purchased tickets to stand on the terracing at the visitors
end of the stadium,  ljtg^jwere herded into pens not dissimilar to those at Hillsborough,
it became very packed i n s i d e these’pens.  The terracing to the right of us was
completely empty, we pleaded with stewards and police to open the gate to allow
some of us into this section of terracing to relieve the crushing. We asked a
policeman who stood by the gate to unlock it for us but he replied he did not know
where the key was. Fortunately people did manage to climb over the segregating
railings onto the empty terracing and I believe also that one of the gates at the
front was eventually opened.      People could well have suffered injury on this
occasion.

We hope this letter proves to be of some use, just writing it has made us feel
that we have made some contribution in the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy.
People must feel and be safe when attending football matches, and treated to
comfort and with dignity, no.other spectator or participant of any other leisure
activity would tolerate such treatment.

Finally, the signs above the Kop turnstiles at Anfield perhaps some up the attitudes
of the hierarchy within Football towards the supporters, "Enter ground at own risk,
no money refuned".

Yours most sincerely,

THE POLICEING OUTSIDE THE GROUND WAS VERY SCARCE.  I SAW ONE MOUNTED
POLICEMAN WHO WAS ADJACENT TO LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILES. THERE WAS
ONLY ONE POLICEMAN TO EACH TURNSTILE AND ONE      ERTAIN TURNSTILE
A POLICEMAN WAS SEARCHING PEOPLE FOR WEAPONS AND SUCH, WHERE CLEARLY
THERE WERE NO WHERE THEY COULD HAVE ANY BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE DRESSED
IN JEANS AND TEE SHIRTS. ONCE INSIDE THE GOUND THERE WERE TWO
POLICEMEN USHERING PEOPLE DIRECTLY ONTO THE TERRACING, NOT EVEN
GIVING PEOPLE THE TIME TO BUY PROGRAMMES. UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS
YEARS GAME THERE WERE NO STEWARDS INSIDE DIRECTING TO EITHER SIDE

                                                             27th April, 1989.




     I set off for Sheffield with my 3 friends and one of my friends 14 year old son.
     The 5 of us all went last year and we took the same route, the difference being
     that road works held us up on the M.62.     This may have been a factor in WHY
     so many people were arriving late.
     WHY didn t the police let people know in advance about the road works so
     we could have left earlier.
     After parking the car we walked towards the ground, there seemed to be only
     one   road and everyone walked down it. The side streets were cordoned off by
     the police.
\j   WHY did the police not check to see if you had tickets whilst you were
 *   approaching the ground, like they did last season, also we were not
|    asked by fans if we had any spares as we walked down that long road.
     We were outside the ground at 2.30 pm. we      all had ground tickets for entrance
     B Leppings Lane Terrace except for the young lad who thankfully had a stand
     ticket,   we were amazed by the number of people trying to get i n , t h e r e must
     have been 5,000.     It was sheer CHAOS.
     WHY didn't the     police get everyone into orderley queue? like they do at Anfield,
     instead of one     mass of people trying to get into about 6 turnstiles.
I    You could see A and C entrance but no B, this was to the left. WHY wasn't B
     more clearly signposted?
     WHY wi-xTe there only about 3 mounted policemen and about 10 on foot outside the
     turnstiles? to deal with an enclosure that holds about 10,000.
     As the crush began to get worse, people shouted to the mounted policeman to
     do something.    His reply was that "IT'S YOUR OWN PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE
     CRUSHING", surel]r he was there, probably on overtime to ensure that we could
     get into the ground safely.
     It is about 10     to 3 now, there was still about 5,000 people outside the ground.
     WHY didn't the     police have the kick-off delayed.My friends and I are now
     separateff~l am pushed by the crowd into a pen with walls either side of me
     which is entrance for the stands, to my right there is a steel wall about 10ft.
     high, people started to scale the wall to try to get into B, I did the same and
     ended up where I started, still thousands trying to get in, a lot of people

                                                                    “   1' / * / * ?
                                    -   2   -




A lot of people started shouting "THEY'VE OPENED THE GATE" the gate is open only
a policewoman   is between the entrance, I showed her my ticket, she beckons
everyone to walk through.
With attending the same match last season I didn't want to go beind the goal,
so I went to the right,    I could see the tunnel straight in front of me, there
was only the odd policeman and steward visible.       Certainly no one was advising
you where to go.
WHY didn't the police block off the tunnel which lead to packed terraces?           and
direct you to the right or left where there was plenty of room.           (I am told this
was what happened last season).
OK. the police must have been under orders (where have I heard that before) not to
let anyone onto the pitch, but surely when they seen people getting crushed
WHY didn't they try to get them out instead of what I saw, pushing them back,
possibly to their death.
WHY did the 100 or so police who came out of the Forest end line up against the
main stand instead of helping the people behind the goal.
OK.   some of the police   were brilliant, but most were useless, incompetent, in fact,
the fans were more help    carrying stretchers etc.
Finally, the impression I got certainly from one policeman who was arguing with a
Liverpool fan was that we were all a gang of yobs and they didn't like scousers
anyway.

Thank you for your letter of 26 April enclosing
five letters from eyewitnesses about the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.
1 have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
Taylor who has noted it. It has now been
passed to the Treasury Solicitor who is
preparing the evidence for consideration by
Counsel for presentation to the Inquiry. The
Treasury Solicitor can therefore consider
          offer to appear at the Inquiry.

Dear Mr. Whalley,

     I enclose herewith copies of five letters I have received
this week from Liverpool football supporters who attended the
recent match at Hillsborough and witnessed the tragedy that took place.

     I have thanked them for their letters and told them I am passing
them on to you as evidence to be placed before the Inquiry.    You will
note that                                           Merseyside
says he is willing to appear at the Inquiry.

     I hope the enclosed letters are helpful.



                             Kind regards,
                                Yours sincerely.

ground last year in the semi-final between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest. My 11 year old son, his friend and his
father and myself obtained tickets for the Leppings Lane part of
the ground. To get into this part of the ground, after passing
through the turnstiles, we had to pass through a narrow tunnel
beneath the West Gate stand. There were many, many fans heading
for this tunnel and it became very congested many yards before
entering the tunnel. There were no police officers or stewards
to control and marshal the fans through this tunnel and once in
the tunnel the congestion obviously greatly increased.

Now although the tunnel is relatively short it took some time to
actually get through it. Inside the tunnel there was jostling
and pushing and many people were stumbling. My son during this
time was being severely crushed and had difficulty in
breathing. I'm 6ft 2" and weigh 16 stone and had extreme
difficulty in pushing people away from him but fortunately I
managed to hold on to him.

Eventually we moved out of the tunnel but if anything the
situation became worse and the pressure of the crowd behind
became worse, causing many fans to stumble and fall down the
steps only to disappear under the crowd. Even once through
the tunnel it was impossible to move sideways as the
momentum of the crowd continued to push us forward. We were
forced to duck under metal barriers or suffer even more
crushing. Finally we were forced right up against the
barriers which prevent the fans from getting on to the
pitch. During the match we had to constantly bear the
crushing force of the crowd swaying forward from behind. It
would not have been so bad if we had been able to move
sideways, away from this central part, but it was so packed,
and the constant pushing, jostling and surging of the fans
made this prospect appear even more dangerous.
                            -   2 -




During the game some fans actually collapsed or fainted and
were passed over peoples heads towards the front of this
section of the ground. We were by the gate in the barrier
fence just behind the goal and witnessed the following:-


   Some fans tried to open this gate but it had been
   padlocked. Some fans attracted the attention of a
   policeman or steward, I can't remember which, but he
   appeared to be totally unaware of the situation. As a
   result these fans became extremely agitated and tried to
   force the gate open but eventually an official obtained a
   key, the padlock was opened together with the gate, and
   the distressed fans passed to safety.

   During the whole of this game we were very concerned for
   the safety of our youngsters but the police were only
   allowing injured fans through the gate. After the match
   finished we all vowed never to enter the Leppings Lane
   end ever again.

As far as I am concerned, when there is a large crowd
entering this part of the ground, it will always be a death
trap. It must be on very rare occasions when Sheffield
Wednesday have enough visiting supporters to this part of
the ground sufficiently to fill it completely and I believe
they are not aware of how dangerous it can be. The whole
layout for entry into the Leppings Lane end of the ground
and the layout inside the ground is a major hazard when
there are lots of fans entering the ground.

Under the circumstances I have described to you and the
additional events which occured at this semi-final - large
crowds, gates being opened to allow more fans in, lack of
police and stewards to act as marshals who would guide and
control the passage of fans into the ground, apparent lack
of police communications, then it is not surprising that
today, innocent people were injured and even more
tragically, lost their lives.

At this semi-final we had tickets for the West Gate stand
which is built up over the Leppings Lane part of the ground
and it was from here that we were to witness the harrowing
and heartbreaking chain of tragic events.
                              3




The match had been started for about 5 minutes when we saw a
slowly growing number of fans trying to ascend the barrier
which is supposed to keep them off the pitch. At first we
thought that this was due to hooliganism and violence going
on unseen beneath us or even just a pitch invasion but as
the events unfolded, we soon realized that many fans had
been seriously injured.
Even so the police took a long time to open the gates in the
fence - were they reluctant to do so or were the gates
padlocked once again. Even when the gates had eventually
been opened the police were pushing fans, who had climbed
over, back through this gate into the ground where people
were still being crushed to death. The police on the pitch
seemed to be the last people in the ground to realise a
major tragedy had happened and confusion amongst them
increased.  Some police were helping fans to climb over the
fence while just a few yards away other officers were
preventing fans getting over the fence by pushing them back.

Now everyone in the ground were dismayed and unable to
believe what was going on before their very eyes. People
lay all over the pitch, some appeared to be in agony, some
had collapsed once they got onto the pitch, still yet others
were carried, apparently unconscious to us, and laid down on
the pitch. St. John's Ambulance men, nurses and even fans,
were giving heart massage, mouth to mouth resuscitation and
all sorts of other first aid. Some policemen were also
trying to help but the vast majority were either spread
along the half way line or huddled in groups, apparently
bewildered and lacking any directives, as to what to do,
from their superiors.

During this time we did see one police officer spat at by a
Liverpool supporter close to the gate behind the goal but I
can imagine him being incensed because the police were
pushing fans back into the gate.

I also saw two scuffles between fans on the pitch itself but
it was against police officers who were just standing round,
seeming unwilling to help. I can understand the frustration
of these fans towards these particular policemen.
We saw angry Liverpool fans run up towards the Nottingham
Forest fans, the latter had been jeering and booing, the
former had been trying to save lives. We saw angry
Liverpool fans scuffle with a cameraman, he had been taking
pictures of the injured and dying, while they had been doing
their best to save them.
Even more astonishing events were to take place. It
appeared that when the ambulances eventually arrived they
had difficulty in getting to the dying and injured. Then
the majority of fans who were on the pitch, who had not been
seriously injured, but obviously suffering from shock, began
to rip down hoardings and use them as stretchers to ferry
the injured, and unknown to us, many dead. The fans carried
them from one end of the pitch to the other in a seemingly
endless relay. Again stewards and other people helped but
again so few policemen got involved as they still stood in
groups or in a line across the pitch.

Later, having learned that a gate had been opened, by the
police, to let fans in, it became obvious that this must
have been a major contribution to the tragic disaster that
occured. These fans headed for the same tunnel I described
earlier and what was to happen is to me inevitable. I feel
great sympathy for the policeman who gave the directive for
the gate to be opened, in his opinion, lives were at risk
outside the ground and he took the action he considered the
best under the circumstances known to him.

The factors which have contributed to   whathappened as far
as I am concerned are


1)   Police stopping coaches well before the ground so that
     fans had a 20 minute to 30 minute walk to the ground.
     This could be a likely cause of the late arrival of
     fans and the consequent build up outside the ground
     just before kick off.

     We consider ourselves extremely lucky as our coach
     driver dropped us off as near to the ground as possible
     even though police wanted him to turn round and drop us
     off a lot further away from the ground, despite the
     fact this would have resulted in us arriving even later
     at the ground. We had a 10 minute walk to the ground
     and arrived at Hillsborough at 2.35 p.m. If we had
     been dropped off where the police wanted them we would
     have been arriving in the ground at the same time as
     those unfortunate supporters who were to be involved in
     those tragic circumstances.


2)   Police not taking immediate control of the fans and
     getting them to line up in an orderly manner. There
     appeared to be more police on duty miles away from the
     ground than there were directly outside it. This
     shortage of policeman immediately outside the ground
     must surely have resulted in total lack of crowd
     control.
                            - 5 -




3)   The entrance to the Leppings Lane end and this part of
     the ground itself is a death trap when large numbers of
     fans are trying to gain entrance.


4)   The ultimate responsibility of what happened must lie
     with F.A. Authorities. For the second year running
     they gave Liverpool fans the smaller part of the
     ground, even though they must have an average of 15,000
     to 20,000 more fans attending their home games. This
     was despite the fact that Liverpool F.C. appealed to
     the F.A. to either give Liverpool fans the other end of
     the ground and so more tickets or choose an alternative
     ground which would be able to accommodate their fans.
     The F.A. officials with characteristic lack of interest
     in the problems of the fans, coldly dismissed
     Liverpools claims.

     The people who deserve commending are the Liverpool
     supporters who so bravely helped their injured
     colleagues who lay dying and injured on the Pitch. The
     ambulance men, nurses, stewards and firemen who also
     put in tremendous effort. The Nottingham Forest fans
     for their behaviour after they became aware of the
     extent of the tragedy unfolding before them. And last
     but not least those few policemen who did try their
     best and the people of Sheffield for showing such
     generosity and help to those fans in need of it.

     My condolences and heartfelt sympathy goes out to those
     families who have lost their loved ones in such tragic
     circumstances caused by the negligence, incompetence
     and ignorance of the F.A. and other officials.

     From a very sad but very angry Liverpool supporter, who
     stood there and watched, helpless to do anything. I'm
     not a fanatical or completely biased supporter, what I
     witnessed on both occasions is the truth.


     Yours sincerely,

19 April 1989


Dear Sir

I am writing to you regarding the events on Saturday 15 April,
at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup Semi-Final, at
Hillsborough, which resulted in 95 deaths.

I attended the match and was involved in some crushing outside
the ground, eventually taking up my seat in the north stand just
prior to kick-off.   I was very concerned about aspects of the
organisation of this match, primarily crowd control. Hopefully,
a full independent enquiry will find the reasons for this
tragedy, but I am concerned that the views of spectators will not
be taken into account due to the large number involved and the
fact that they are individuals and not from any 'body', hence my
letter to you.

To blame the fans is totally wrong and I feel that this could
happen unless all points of view are aired. I would stress that
I am not anti-police, but on this day they were the body
responsible for crowd control and safety.    They were totally
unprepared and their activities were not co-ordinated.     They
failed in their duty and got it wrong on the day.

The problems arose because a large number of people with tickets
tried to gain admittance at the same time. Impulsive decisions
were made and could have been avoided as the situation was
clearly predictable

        a.   the traffic situation on the motorways was well
             known

        b.   close circuit TV would show the position both in
             and outside the ground

        c.   the computer controlled turnstiles showed the
             number in the ground and the number still to take
             their places

        d.   the problem was evident by merely looking at the
             Leppings Lane end and was clear to all present.




                                     1
p




    with the known shortage of tickets, the whole situation should
    have been anticipated and panic avoided. At no time did I see
    any disorderly conduct, everybody was good humoured and
    apparently in possession of tickets.

    Whys

           a.   Why was there no filtering towards the turnstiles
                - as there was last year - to prevent the crowd
                build up?

           b.   Why was the kick off not delayed as has been done
                several times this season, including the match
                involving only 10,000 spectators at Tranmere.

           c.   Why having opened the gate were arrangements not
                made to stream fans to the sides and to evacuate
                those already packed in.

           d.   Why were no     announcements   made,   no   use   of
                megaphones.

    I have heard it said that an unruly mob was responsible. This
    was not the case, the sheer weight of numbers, created by poor
    organisation, created it.

    I understand that a decision was made to open the gate to
    prevent loss of life outside the ground.   I feel that this was
    a real possibility.      However, the decision was made in
    isolation, without regard to the serious problem which was
    already clearly evident inside.   The problems could not have
    been made clear to the police inside the ground by their
    superiors as they were deployed in the wrong places and ill-
    informed.   This was clearly illustrated by large numbers of
    police with dogs guarding the stands (for the wrong type of
    situation) when they should have been elsewhere.

    There were plenty of police about (I understand in the region of
    800) but in the wrong places at the wrong time. The lower ranks
    clearly thought violence was taking place, their superiors would
    have known that this was not the case, but failed to instruct
    them properly. One young constable, frightened, criticised his
    superiors in front of us.

    There has been a great deal of media attention and whilst I can
    be influenced by various debates or my own emotions, I can
    clearly recollect three impressions on that day:-

           1.   On reaching the ground there was no filtering -
                 merely all persons allowed to make their own way.

           2.   On entering the ground, one section was clearly
                 overcrowded and two other areas fairly empty.



                                      2
     3.   A lack of medical facilities and only two
          ambulances were seen in almost one hour of panic.
          Volunteers did nearly all the worX.

The police seemed very complacent and the lower ranks harassed,
unco-ordinated and lacking leadership.     There was a complete
absence of planning and direction and I am convinced that this
could have been avoided had a predictable situation been tackled
properly.   The Liverpool police have dealt with large crowds
over many years without incident.

I feel that the planning of such events should take into account
the views of supporters, including various associations which
now represent them.   The recommendations of Liverpool FC were
rejected for this match.
I know a lot of people share my views who attended the match.
Should you feel that I can be of any further assistance, please
do not hesitate to contact me.

I would like to record my admiration for the fans who assisted
the casualties and the attitude of Liverpool FC over the last
few days.

Yours faithfully




P.S. Since starting this letter, I have heard comments emanating
     from the Police Federation alleging that drunken fans
     started this incident. THIS IS UNTRUE.

     There was no evidence of this, the cause was their
     inability to, on a gradual basis, to stream arriving
     supporters, as they had done successfully the previous
     year. For some reason, they failed to do so and this must
     be highlighted.  I am deeply concerned that one isolated,
     inaccurate statement from a recognised body outweighs the
     more accurate reports from so many witnesses.

     Football supporters, unfortunately, are perceived by those
     who do not attend matches as those few seen in newsclips.
     The fans last Saturday came from all walks of life.    For
     example, our party of 4 were 30/40 years of age, married
     with children. We noticed no less than Billy Liddel having
     difficulty - hardly a hooligan!

16 April 1989


Dear Mr Moynihan,


I attended and w itnessed the awful and tr a g ic scenes a t Hillsborough yesterday.
I hope what I have to say may be o f some value to you in your capacity as
Sports M inister. I would l i k e to d iv id e t h is l e t t e r in to th ree short s e c t io n s ;
f i r s t , a d escrip tio n o f what I w itnessed; seco n d ly ,q u estion s which should
be ra ise d and l a s t l y , my su g g e stio n s as a l i f e - l o n g f o llo w e r o f f o o t b a l l .


The p o lic e on duty were, in my op inion, w o efu lly inadequate in both number
and t h e i r e f f e c t iv e n e s s a t crowd c o n t r o l.I have spent ten years serving in the
Royal M ilitary Policetwo o f which were served in Northern Ireland whre I
gained a great deal o f exp erien ce in                     crowd co n trol.
The p o li c e I spoke to could n ot even t e l l me where a c e r t a in club o f f i c i a l
c a r park was, consequently I was driving around the ground j u s t adding to the
a lread y alarmingly la r g e crowd. On a r r i v a l , by f o o t , a t the Leppings Lane
end o f the ground I was shocked to find only e ig h t t u r n s t i l e s open to s e r v ic e
th e whole o f the North Stand as w ell as the West Stand. The time was now
I4.35h rs and the crowd was s o l i d from the t u r n s t i l e s en tran ce backing into
th e road, a d istan ce o f about ten y a r d s .I t took me ten minutes to eventually
g ain a ccess to a t u r n s t i l e .
Once tb e other s id e o f the t u r n s t i l e s I walked to the l e f t f o r the North
Stand s e a tin g areas. As I looked back I could se e the s i t u a t i o n was becoming
more desperate with hundreds o f people arriv in g by the m i n u t e . S t i l l only three
mounted policemen were attem pting to                     control the crowd o u t s i d e . I then took my
s e a t in the stand. A fter k i c k - o f f i t          became c le a r that f a r too many people were
co n fin ed in too small a space in the West Stand.
The questions which have a r is e n from t h i s in c id en t are:
- why should Liverpool FC, with a f a r g r e a te r follow ing than Nottingham F o r est,
  be a llo c a te d le s s t i c k e t s ?
- why was the l e a s t supported club a ll o c a t e d the larger standing a rea ?
- l a s t y e a r's sem i-fin a l was c o n tr o lle d by s t r i c t marshalling a t l e a s t f i f t y
yards from the t u r n s t i l e s . What happened t h is y e a r ?
- why was there no           early announcemnt made, to keep both Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest fans informed?
-why were the f i r s t aid s e r v i c e s a t the ground under-manned and under-equipped
fo r a major sporting event such as t h i s ?




F i n a l l y , I would l i k e to comment t h a t , in my opinion, a match o f t h i s
s i g n i f i c a n c e and importance should be played a t a larger stadium. Could the
s e m i- f in a l s not be staged a t Wembley on a lt e r n a te Saturdays?
I fu rth er f e e l th a t i f the perimeter fen ces are not to be taken down a t grounds
around the country, small g a tes should be b u i l t in to the stru ctu res every th ree
f e e t or s o , with a steward assign ed to each gate throuhout the match.




In c o n clu sio n , I think a f t e r an in c id e n t l i k e t h is i t i s very easy to poin t
the f in g e r and apportion blame. This i s not my aim - I have j u s t t r i e d to
t e l l you what I saw and r a i s e a few p r c t i c a l s u g g e stio n s.

Dear Sir

re:   Liverpool v Nottingham Forest - 15 April 1989
      F A Cug? Semi-Final Tie________________________

I am in receipt of your letter dated 21 April, in which you refer to the
disastrous tragedy at Hillsborough, and I would confirm that I was in
attendance.

As requested in your letter I would submit my observations on hew I saw
the situation from my position in the Directors Box, where I must say it was
impossible to ascertain the magnitude of the disaster fran w here I was
sitting. However, I would say that upon taking my seat sane fifteen
minutes before the carmencement of play, I took particular notice of the
assembly of the crcwd in both standing areas occupied by the Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest supporters and whilst it would appear there were no
problems at the Nottingham Forest end or Liverpool at that time, some few
minutes before the kick-off the central section of the standing area provided
for the Liverpool supporters irrmadiately behind the goal posts seated to be
somewhat overcrowded, which I understand was due to the late arrival of a
large contingent of Liverpool supporters. It was notioeable to me at this
particular time the right and left sections of this standing area were not
in my view overcrowded, and I am of the opinion this terrible catastrophe
could have been avoided had adequate narshalling been available, more so
when you consider this was a repeat of last years semi-final when everyone
enjoyed an excellent match.

In conclusion, I feel I must mention that I have nothing but praise for the
behaviour displayed by spectators fran both clubs, many of which assisted
the Police and Doctors in their arduous task at this tragic event.

Yours faithfully



Lite Vice-President

tile are a middle aged couple with two teenage daughters. We were
both in the stand above where all the Liverpool Supporters were
killed.

We left our house at 11.00 e.m. and got into the ground at 2.10 p.m.
At 2.20 p*m. we went into our seats and than walked forward to look
over the balcony at the fans below. It was obvious to us that there
were too many fans in the area behind tha goal and indeed many looked
distressed and many of them were chanting "no more room no more room"
"don't let anyone else in here".   Surely the Police must have hsd
their surveillance camsrss focused on that area and surely if wa
could see it was ovsrcrowded at 2.20 p.m. they must have bean able
to 88e it.   Why didn't they tall the Stewards not to let anyone
sise into that area and to direct people to the two side arees
where there was room?   Why did they allow people to keep coming
into that area in a steady stream from 2.20 p.m. to 2.50 p.m. WHY ?

Ply husband went to the toilet at 2.40 p.m. and said there were
thousands outside and he could see a group of about 100 to 200
being allowed to run down the street as fast as they could towards
the crowds that wers already there.

Then of course the event which if you wanted to be kind you would call
"gross incompetence and bad management" but if you were being really
truthful and honest you would call wicked, was allowed to happen.
The Police opened a 16 foot gate and 1st the crowd rush in as if this
was not bad snough, nobody had their ticket checked to see if they
had a correct ticket or in fact any ticket at all* this was at a
match thst was supposed to be all ticket, I myself was frisked when
we went in and my bag was searched and my husband was also searched.
Then to maks matters even worse the Police and Stewards allowed the
crowd to rush towards the first entrance they saw which was of course
the tunnel leading directly into tha already overcrowded arss.

Why was the gate opened to let everyone in irrespective of whether
they had a correct ticket or not 7   Why were they allowed to rush
towards the most crowded area of the ground 7 Why were they not
directed towards areee with more empty epecee 7

Now we heve heard the Police opened the gate to alleviate preeeure outside
which we juet cannot comprehend was a valid reason knowing the
state of the ground inside.   Why wae there so much pressure outside 7
Why couldn't the Police control it 7 Isn't that whet they are there for?
Why weren't there more Police outside 7 Why were 100 to 200 fane allowed
to run down the road towarde the rest of the crowd trying to get in
to the ground 7   Why did Police on horseback not make the croud queue in
an orderly faehion as the Police at Anfield do weak in end week out in
far worse conditions i.e. the alleways to the top and the main road
outside the ground 7 Why wers the Police outside tha ground if not to
control tha fane 7    Why didn't the police inside communicate the position
to the Polica outside ?

Lastly of course there is why were Liverpool allocated less tickets
than Nottingham Forest.    We have twice as many regular supporters as
Ngttinghsm Forest and were given A,000 or whatever less tickets than
them.    In fact people who got into the ground when the gate was
opened by the Police had tickets which they had bought from Nottingham
Forest fens.    The Police asy it was easier to control us and the
traffic^ if we were given the Lickers Lane End.    This hss been proved
to be totally untrue as there was no crowd control outside and most of
the people arrived lste because of traffic problemet not to mention
Police holding up coaches and checking for alcohol, and being mede
to walk nLles from their coaches to the ground.   This has happened
many times to us, most recently at Coventry and prior to thet at
Aston Ville when Liverpool played Arsanal in the Littlewoods Cup.
So there ie no wey giving ue fewer tickets can be justified.

We will never forget the scenee we saw end people being dragged out
of the peddock below us and thrown on to the pitch and left to die.
Paople trying to get out through totally inadequate gates and being
puahed back by the Police at firat.   Paople being carried awey on
hoarding by the Fans not ambulance men, policemen or etewards.
Why weren’t the stretchers there where were they ? Where were the
ambulances ? Why weren't wire cutters used in the fence more quickly ?
Why didn't the Police react quicker to thie terrible eituation ?
Why were there no announcements over the loudspeaker made to inform
everyone who didn't know of the problem ?

WHY was this terrible thing allowed to happen ?

Ue will never be able to forget it anyone  who wes there and especially
those who have loet loved onee and friende until we get eome answers
to the above queetions.

Ue are enclosing an article which we think answers those queetions
but we hope and prey that some one can ehow us eome other reeson
to keep us sane.

Dear Sir
                         THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
The day was Saturday 15th April, 1989, F.A. Cup Semi Final Day.      I
had never been to a Semi Final before. I set off with three members
of m y faraily, one was my thirteen year old son.   He thought we were
going to have a great day.    Two of us were Forrest Fans and two were
Liverpool Fans.    Two would come back happy and two would be a little
bit dissappointed. That was far from the truth.

What we encountered we had no idea.    We set off in plenty of time for
Sheffield arriving at 12.30p.m. the match did not start until 3.00p.m.
We had a bite to eat after we had parked about 15 minutes from the
ground.   As we walked towards the ground we were pestered by supporters
asking if we had any spare tickets.      I would not dream of going to
a football match which was all ticket if I did not have a ticket.

We approached the ground, there was a barrier across one side with
Police patrolling.    We asked the Police which was our entrance, they
pointed about 10 yards beyond but because the barrier was up they would
not let us through, we had to walk all the way round.    Never mind the
exercise will do us good.

We got into the ground and took our seats, it was a magnificent stadium.
The crowd was beginning to build up, our seats were in the South Stand
near the Leppings Lane end, just in line with the by line.          To our
left, high up, was a Police Observation Post.         Three Officers were
situated with short wave radios and TV monitors.    The camaras positioned
around the ground and outside the ground.        All the time monitoring
the crowd behaviour.    At the Leppings Lane end, this section was split
into four in the standing area.     The centre two sections were quite
full at 2.30p.m. with the end two sections very sparse of spectators.
At 2.50p.m. we observed that there was quite a lot of swaying in those
two centre sections but the outer two were filling up very very slowly
indeed.    The game started with all spectators oblivious to what was
happening.    After a short time we noticed one or two Police running
along the touch line to the goal at the Leppins Lane end. It was obvious
that they thought that there was trouble as spectators were trying
to get out onto the pitch.      The Police at first appeared to try to
deter them from doing this but then the spectators swung quite
dramatically and started to climb up into the main stand and the
spectators there were trying to pull them free.      They were also trying
to climb over the divisional partitions into the outer two sections.
By this time, in between watching the match and observing the Leppings
Lane end the situation became out of hand and eventually the Police
started to help the spectators over the barrier which was quite high
and difficult to get over.   At this point nobody knew what was happening
or the scale of the problem behind the barriers.     The spectators helped
each other over the barrier onto the pitch and eventually there must
have been about 500 spectators who were on the cinder track behind
the pitch and there was so many in fact they started to go onto the
pitch but tried to keep close to the by line.      At this point in time
a Senior Officer raced across the field trying to catch the eye of
the Referee.    Play was still going on but obviously it was at the far
end of the pitch.    The referee turned and saw the Police Officer, went
towards him, made conversation and the referee, decided to take the
players off the field.    Once the players were off the field, at least
a hundred Police Officers came into the ground from the far side, from
the Spoin Kop. Totally unaware of what was going on they thought clearly,
that there was going to be a riot so they formed a barrier the full
width of the field along the centre line. Still the fans were coming
over the barrier, by this time they had managed to break free one of
the gates.    The spectators started bringing numerous casualties out
onto the green turf and laying them out.     Some of them immediately sat
up, others laid motionless on the ground.

At this point in time it must be noted that it was only the Liverpool
supporters who were actually carrying the spectators and helping them
to getfree from the       pressure on the Terrace.    The casualties were
laid on the floor and the spectators started on a number of casualties
to try to    resuscitate them, obviously they were unconscious.       There
were two young girls near the corner flag, they tried to revive them
for a long long time and eventually they put a coat over their heads.
There was one boy who was as old as my youngest son ; 10, he was brought
right near the touch line, there was a young Police Cadet and a Lady
Police Officer assisting with mouth to mouth resuscitation.      They tried
for about ten minutes without any success.        Spectators in the stand
where I was, and in the terrace below watched helplessly. A big spectator
ran over, said something to the Police Officers and they moved out
of the way, he obviously must have been a First Aider or a Doctor or
somebody with Medical knowledge.       He tried frantically for another
five minutes or it seemed that long to me, eventually all the people
crowding round let out a great cheer, he had started to breathe.        All
in the grand stand and in the terraces below started to cheer and applaud,
our jubilance was short lived, within a minute the big fellow was down,
mouth to mouth resuscitation again, the little boy had stopped breathing.
He eventually started breathing again, they turned him into the recovery
position, four spectators around this boy ran for a stretcher.         They
tried to pull away a notice board around the perimeter.         Four Police
Officers went across, and at first     it looked as if they were trying
to hinder, but after a few words they started to assist and pulled
this notice board away,it was then taken over to      the boy, he was put
on and was   transported right across to the far side.      While this was
going on an ambulance had turned up behind the goal. A number of bodies
were put inside.     It was still not clear at this point in time what
the casualty situation was but it was obvious that there was a number
of fatalities.   Spectators in the front row of the West Stand, started
to dismantle all the notice boards which were beneath them, hand them
down carefully and eventually they found their way onto the pitch.
They were taken to each casualty and then transferred right across
the ground to waiting ambulances that could not really get into the
ground for the situation.

Whilst this was going on the hundred or so Police Officers still on
the centre line, still waiting for trouble, still waiting for a riot,
at this point a number of Nottingham Forrest fans climbed over the
fence at the Spoint Kop and startedto dismantle the sign boards behind
their goal and carry them to where they were needed.   They then joined
with the Liverpool fans in conveying the bodies across to the far side.
There were only a few Police Officers helping to carry the stretcher
bound casualties across and help them in      reviving the injured spectators.
The control by the Police during this operation was absolutely negative.
No one seemed to be in charge at all, and it was the Liverpool fans
who took the initiative in dealing with the emergency situation.
Eventually a full half of the playing area was covered with distraught
Liverpool fans.   The Manager of Liverpool Football Club, Kenny Dalglish
came to the public address system, appealed for calm, there was no
need, they were completely calm, he asked them to move off the field,
those who were not in need of medical attention, they moved to the
side waiting for further instructions.    It is true there were a couple
of incidents, one involving a News Reporter trying to take photographs
of dead bodies.     Distraught and angry fans seized him.     The Police
protected him and separated him by escorting him away.       They should
have taken his camara away, I would have.

Another incident involving some of the fans near the players tunnel,
they congregated round the BBC Camara as you could see from the News
Report, they were not causing problems.      They were voicing their opinion
at the lack of      control, why did it happen, who's fault was it, why was
it not averted?        After a very long time when most of the bodies had
been taken across to the waiting amulances and the terraces were nearly
empty it became      evident ofthe horror of the incident.     Steel barriers
capable of withstanding 50 tons pressure        were flattened, it was only
then that the injuries became apparent.         As the fans left the ground
the Police in the centre began to disperse slowly.           Behind the goal
all the personal belongings, shoes, boots, coats, scarves were gathered
in one big heap.     We left the ground at about 4.30p.m. passing spectators
in silence.   The Police outside the ground tried to make their prescence
felt by stopping cars, asking them where they were going, stopping
groups of people, single people, asking them where they were going.
 Still they were looking for trouble.          There was no trouble, people
were too upset by the situation to think about causing trouble.            It
was not until I got back to the car and switched the radio on that
I heard    the horrific number of fatalities, 74.       That must have been
everybody who was carried across the full length of the field.             As
the reasons for this        disaster unfold, the responsibility      of crowd
observation and crowd control lies fairly and squarely with the Police.
 As they were situated in that control tower using the close circuit
monitors and using radios for giving instructions, it was obvious that
opening a gate and letting fans in would result in them getting into
the ground and seeing the game as quickly as possible.        With the centre
two sections of the Leppings Lane end being overfull it would have
been an easy instruction to deploy some of the Police Officers to the
tunnelsleading into       those two sections and directing the      fans into
the end    two sections.     Outside the ground at that particular end the
crowd was building up, two Police Horses appeared to be doing very
little to try to relieve the pressure.       I believe those Police Officers
failed in their duty to ensure the safety of those fans in that situation
outside the Leppings Lane end.           I also feel that the observation
controller, overriding and overseeing every action and activity around
the ground failed to recognise the problem in the centre two sections,
and deal with it accordingly by averting fans into the end two sections.
The horrific irony is that we had a situation that the Police had no
idea how to control.        They are just clearly trained in controlling
riot and violence and they were totally unable to control human tragedy.
By being First Aid Trained, they would have been able to make some
contribution to the situation. Very few did.

Because this gate was opened, many who did not have tickets, gained
entry and contributed to the problem unintentionally.  I have been
to many   football matches in my life and by being all ticket it is far
quicker   to gain entry into the ground than it is being, paying cash.
We now look at the consequences of having Membership cards. In a situation
like the 15th April, 1989 entry to the ground would have been much
slower causing terrific build up outside.      It is easy to say that by
being a member and having a membership card you must try to get to
the ground a little bit earlier.      We did because we travelled a long
way.   Not everybody thinks the same way as we do.      People get delayed
in traffic which contributes to late arrivals.      If this game had been
by Membership Card the same situation could have happened, spectators
outside without Membership cars, waiting to get in, the pressure builds
up, the gates are opened to relieve what is anticipated as a dangerous
situation and fans who have had their cards taken away from them gain
entry and cause great problems.

The Government must realise the tragedy caused at Hillsborough on Saturday
15th april, 1989 is due to interference by Government, Local Authority
and Police, in trying to restrict members of the public as spectators
from moving freely and safely around our grounds.       If the divisional
fences and the perimeter fences were not present today this tragedy
would never have arisen, as the spectators would have merely moved
to one side to avert the pressure. Penning in of spectators is a serious
breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act as far as Safe Access and
Safe Egress is concerned, in an emergency evacuation situation. Football
clubs must be left to manage their own business without interference
from outside bodies unless they request specialist advice and assistence.
It will be interesting to see how the Officer in charge of survelance
and deployment of his force will allay the blame for this tragedy.
95 passionate fans do not know the cause. Thousands do.

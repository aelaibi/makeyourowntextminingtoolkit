                 the    fence        but       it w a s        too c r a m m e d        to      get       through.             I shouted              to    some

                 police       officers             on    the       other          side       of     the       fence       to    help        us as       I had          one

                 still     breathing.                   We    passed             the    lad       through           to    others           but    couldn't

                 get    through          ourselves             so       I went          back        onto       the       t<erKace.             There        w a s n ’t

                 enough       room       on the           terrace            for       first        aid       I sax^hat              a     chain was             fiying

                 f ormed      at a hole             in the           fence         to       get     the       ds^d       and    injured           out       onto       the

                 fields,      so     they      could          be     helped            if     possible.              I then          joined           the     chain         I

                 *^as n e x t      to    the       hole       taking          bodies           from       people          the    other           side       of    the

                 fencX          There were               a    lot       of       people        passed          tl^ough          that        hole.           When
                                \                                                                                    \               <CA'7’       .
                 this    was       aone        there          was       still          only       one     ambulancg             a St.          Johns

                 ambulance.              I     saw       it    t r y to      move        off        but    there         were        too m a n y        people             in

                 the    way     so      I tried          to     make         a    path\[or              the    ambulance              to    get       through.              I

                 got    that       one     away         and     then         saw another County                      Ambulance              making          i t ’s

                 way    down       the       track       at, the         other          side        of    the       field       but       it     too    was

                 having       difficulty                getting          through             so     I ran a c r o s s           to       it a n d      shouted             at

                 people       to     get      out       of    the       way.           Then       I directed              it    onto        the       playing

                 field     infront            of    the       goal.           People           were       moving          boards          out     of    its       way.

                 When    this        was      in    position             I went             back     onto       the       terrace           where       I saw a

                 young     man       holding            a friend.                 I asked           how       his    friend          was       and     he    said          he

                 d i d n ’t know.             The       lad     on      the       floor        had g inger           hair       and a          red     shirt.               3.

                 tried     to      take a          pulse        but       c o u l d n ’t get one.                   I performed                first        aid       on

                                            Liverpool.                                                                    1989


                The above named is a student at the                                                Polytechnic,


                He contacted me at 10.45 a.m. this date and requested that a letter be sent to
                the Registrar at the Polytechnic confirming that on the 18th May, 1989 he was
                interviewed in connection with the Hillsborough enquiry by.EC*,,
                                                        tsj                          ft 5797
                                 The reason for this request is that
                                                                 is appealing against a
                decision of the College and requires confirmation that he was being interviewed
                on that date.

                 The Officer concerned is currently on annual leave and I am unable to confirm
                 this situation with him, therefore, I request that a letter be sent by the
                 Incident Room to the Registrar.                                 /•     P/^cz-,

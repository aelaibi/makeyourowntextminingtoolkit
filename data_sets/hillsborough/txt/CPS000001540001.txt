                       FILENOTE: HILLSBOROUGH

5.1.99

T/C from Ann Adlington re the disclosure process. I confirmed CE’s letter of
31.12.98 that we would give voluntary disclosure subject to police representations as
to the material that can be properly given. That letter was under the misapprehension
that the police were against giving vol. disclosure until the result of any judicial
review proceedings was known. It now transpires that the police are agreeable to
giving vol. disclosure subject to the usual rules concerning PII and legal privilege. I
said that I was awaiting the police response and would send the HFSG a formal reply
by fax tomorrow.

T/C to Eric Parsons re any charges to be made for the photocopying required for vol.
disclosure to the parties. He later answered by discussion with PJ. Subject to a policy
decision we could use Alfagraphics to do the required work and to bill the various
parties at the standard rate of 1.9p per page. The bill could be sent directly to the
party.

T/C to Peter Metcalfe of Hammond Suddards re CE’s letter of 31.12 and my letter of
23.12. We agreed that he would formally reply to the later letter as the circumstances
had changed since 23.12 in that they were going to give vol. disclosure as necessary.
He was quite satisfied that the CPS could disclose statements and exhibits to all
parties. We accepted that I would not disclose CPS/police correspondence, our
internal correspondence, counsels’ advice or CPS reports, and that I would refer the
parties to the police where there was police generated material that might attract PII.
His letter would be faxed to me am 6.1.

T/C to Robin Booth re above.

1.   He agreed that York could send a letter to the HFSG along the above lines.
     Similar letters to be sent to the other parties.
2.   The draft reply to the Walker Morris letter of 18.12 was with Sue Ross in the
     Treasury Solicitors department. We should await her advice before formally
     replying. If such advice could not be obtained this week then a holding letter was
     to be sent.
3.   Agreed that any voluntary disclosure given to the HFSG should be offered to
     both defendants as per our policy guidelines. Any photocopying would be
     charged at the rate of 1.9p per page. Photocopying would be done by
     Alfagraphics. However we would absorb the firsj^50 for each party, and they
     would only be billed for amounts above that sum.

T/C to Sue Ross at 1730 asking her to call me back.

NB. RB’s home tel is                  is he is not in the office on 6.12.

ACTION: GC to draft letters for all parties re the giving of vol. disclosure, contact
SR re response to Walker Morris and draft letter as req. Copies of correspondence to
be sent to Hammond Suddards.

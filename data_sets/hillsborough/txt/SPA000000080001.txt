 FINANCING OF WEST MIDLANDS POI ICE INQUIRY


 Notes o f a meeting a t the Home Office on Tuesday. 20 June 1989

 P resent:   Lord Ferrers
             Messrs Addison and Naglar, Ms Nicholson and Ms Ransford
             Councillors S i r Jack Layden, Axe, Fisher and Walayat
             Mrs Bullivant
             Messrs Johnston and Wright

 (The following i s not a comprehensive record of th e d isc u ssio n t h a t took place
 in the meeting but a note of the main p o i n t s ) .


1      Home Office View

       The inquiry was s t a r t e d a t the i n i t i a t i v e of the Chief Constable of South
       Yorkshire. I t r e l a t e d to an occurrence in South Yorkshire involving
       s u b s t a n t i a l p olice involvement. I t was a unique s i t u a t i o n demanding a
       special form of a t t e n t i o n much on the basis of the miners’ s t r i k e . The
       o f f e r was th e r e f o r e financing based on the same formula which put a
       c e i l i n g of the equ ivalent of 3/4p r a t e on th e local c o n tr i b u t io n .
2      South Yorkshire View

       While the f i r s t step in s e t t i n g up t h i s inquiry had been taken by the
       Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire, subsequent events had ra p id ly changed
       i t s n a tu re . I t was now a national inquiry covering o th e r policy areas as
       well as p o l i c e . The Chief Constable of the West Midlands was rep o rtin g
       s o l e ly to Lord J u s t i c e Taylor. The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire was
       conducting his own in te r n a l e n q u ir ie s in p re p a ra tio n f o r answering Writs


       The p a r a l l e l of the m iners’ s t r i k e which was e n t i r e l y a p olice m atter was
       m isleading. The f in a n c ia l s t r a i n on the Police A uthority resources would
       be acute and the add itio n al burden on the community charge payer u n f a ir.
3      Conclusion

       The Chairman s t a te d t h a t t h i s was not a South Yorkshire inquiry and asked
       the Home Office to reco n sid er t h e i r presen t " o ffe r" while i n s i s t i n q t h a t
       i t should l i e on the t a b l e .

       Lord F errers agreed to consider the m atter f u r t h e r . He did not give any
       i n d i c a t io n t h a t he would concede t h a t i t was a Home Office or Government
       in qu iry or t h a t any more money would be forthcoming.

       The Home Office agreed to w rite to the Police A uthority as a follow up to
       the meeting. Members involved will consider the p o s i t io n f u r t h e r uDon
       r e c e i p t of t h i s l e t t e r .

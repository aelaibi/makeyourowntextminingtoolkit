2.     The Beehive Dykpg/Hall Road.              Supporters were seen to enter the

                                                 premise under the landlord

                                                 supervision.       The doors of which

                                                 were then locked and presented no

                                                 further   public order problem.

     The Sportsman jjjotuatad on Worrall Road/' this again was quite full

                                   . with Liverpfro/ supporters who were of

                                     similar spirit but presented no problems.



     T he Horse a n y J o ckey on junction a y Uiadsley Lane and Dyl-^s Hall

            ^                         Rd.     Fu/f 1 to capacity with i^i/erpool

                                      supporters with fans in car park spilling

                                      on to grass verges footpaths and the road

                                      itself.     At that time in order and good

                                      spirits.



A regular patrol was then made of the above area with particular

attention to the above licenced premises.              As the day progressed the

number of fans in the area and public houses swelled.



At about    \.30 prn/^1330 3 a further      check was made at the Hor/Se and

Joc ke y/ wh ere it was seen that the supporters numbers had increased

noticeably to approximately 300.             The majority were young males in

their early twenties.            The noise level had risen.       The consumption

of alcohol appeared to be heavy and the situation appeared to be

deteriorating although no disorder was encountered.                Due to the

situation PS Miller         requested assistance with a view to dispersal or

containment.        No assistance was available at that time.



I positioned our mobile in the mouth of the junction in a position to

observe the publ^jfx house and the supporters outside.              A small number

of fans were advised regarding the chanting of obscenities,,              no

problems were encountered as a result of this.                The consumption of

alcohol    continued unabated and it was obvious that many of the young

supporters were in fact drunk.              Fans were still arriving at the
                                                                                  PAGE        4
                                                                                  S2254

public house.          I had a conversation with one youth who informed me

that all the draught beer and lager had been consumed and that only

bottled beer was on sale.



At about 2.10 pm i y / K o }   the fans outside the pub were becoming more

disorderly and bottles and glasses were broken on the car park.                         One

youth had to be held up by his friend because of his drunken s t a t e .

Several of the fans continually climbed onto a high boundary wall to

an adjacent      house and were jumping/falling over it into the garden of

that house.      The behaviour had now deteriorated and I was concerned

that   it might get out of hand.         It was not prudent for our small unit

to attempt to restore order at this time.               Assistance was again sought               I

which duly arrived in the form of a second tango unit and dog handler.



Shortly after 2y. 15 pm ri/ri5) the |ans were moved a^5y from the pub in

small groups down Wads 1ey Ln in the direction of the ground.                    The

majority appeared to have consumed a large amount of alcohol which was

reflected in their behaviour.           I did not witness any public order or

violence at tp^lf^time.        We e s c o r t e d ^ ^ ^ f a n s a long the streets to

Leppings I       the designated Liverpool end of the ground.                On arrival

in Leppings Ln I saw many thousands of supporters outside the

turnstile.      It was was apparent that a _crush^waj/rfev e 1o p ing against

the turnstiles arfm their supporting walls and fences.                  I saw mounj^rd
                                                                             i     ----
Police O f f i c e s   in the crowd attempting to restore orderly queues.

Their quest was impossible and no improvement was made.                   I saw several

fans climb the perimeter wall/and enter the ground.                  Superintendent

MARSHALL w a s stood „on a^wa^l near the road overlooking this crowd who

were constantly pressing forward creating a^very dangerous situation.

I heard numerous        requests via radio foj^the gate to be opened one of

which stated that a catastrophy wouifl occur             if the gates were not
                                                                              PAGE         5
                                                                              S2254

opened.     I shared that view.        As the gate w ^ / o p e n e d the crowd surged

through.    PS Miller gave the order to leave the vehicle and gave

instructions to check that          Pans entering the ground were ticket

holders.    Very shortly afterwards        I was instructed by PS Miller that

all Police Officers were required on           the pitch.     I formed the

opinion th>*t a pitch invasion was tak ijKf^p 1a ce .The unit atj^nded                on

the pit/!n where I saw Liverpool         supporters on the play i % / s u r f ace and

numerous    climbing over the perimeter fence immediately behind the

Liverpool   goal.    It was unclear what       was happening and I became

detached f r m y     unit.    I went to an     emergency       to the left        of th«

goalmouth when looking from the pitch towards Leppings Ln.                I assisted

a number of fans th rou gh J i The g a t e , at that time I thought that they
                             yr
were suffering from lack of oxygen because of the volume o ^ t h e

crowded D e n .   I was also aware of a crush in the certtrfal
                                                          —
                                                               pen I saw

other officers in attendance and continued to assist people onto the

pitch through the gate.           Some time after I entered that pen and moved

to my right towards the central          pen I was still unaware of what was

actually happening there.           Upon r^afching the steel barrier between the

two pens    I pulled supporters^^afway from the central         pen it was^at that

moment that I realised w>fat we were dealing with.              I saj»#^a large

number of dead scfid j r fijured persons     lying in a deeQ^pile against to

perimeter ^xal 1 stretching backwards into the terrace.             I remained m

that position and as Police and fans lifted the dead and dying over

the fence to me I carried them to the safety gate of my pen and passed

them through to persons on the perimeter track.              I do not know how

many persons I carried out.           It was a large number and I lost count.

When all the dead and i/fjured had been moved from the terrace

again went onto the ^l t c h and assisted where I could.                  were

using advertisingyooards to ferry injured and dea^Kacross the pitch

towards the Kop/North stand corner.            I assisj^d with this until         I
                                                                             PAGE

         was eventually ordered to form a cordon acros§xt1ne pitch between the

         opposing ends of the pitch.    Whilst on th'^pitch I was accused many

         times of being a murdering bastard and many other things.       Whilst    in

         the cordon I managed to rejoin my unit.      We remained in the xordon

                                           outside the ground.   We remained on

                                          spersed.   At approx 9.30 pm (2130)     the

         unit was stood downyfrom duty.



         I had become aware that PC300 Hays had retired from his duties on the

         Tango one unit,   I joined that unit as his replacement under the

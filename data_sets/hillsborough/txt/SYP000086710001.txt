crowd        who    was     being       supported           by     two      of     his    friends.            His    arms          were

around        their        necks?       one        either    side        of      him,     his    body       appeared           limp,

his     head       was    hung        and    his     friends        were         actually        carrying           him       as    his

feet     w e e re    not       on     the    floor.         Another           youth       I noticed           appeared             to    be

staggering,              his    body        leaned       backwards            at    an    angle       of    about        45    degrees

to     the    ground        and       his    eyes     were       glazed.




By     this    time       Leppings           Lane/Bradfield                 Rd     was    not    so     congested             although

At approx 3 . 0 5 prn I made my way down L e p pings                           Lane    to the e n t r a n c e to

the football            ground on the           instructions           of Sgt H o d q e t t s .     The     road wa

no    longer       blocked but         there was          <st i 11 a number       of supporters           waiting

After a short             time an a m b u l a n c e a r r i v e d and was a l l o w e d access               to the

the    ground        not aware       of what        was happening          inside      the ground,,

Peo p l e   then began to emerge                   from the       ground ashen-faced,              limping,

holding        themselves and            crying.          More and more were            corning from the

T h o s & peopIe        eme rgi ng f rom the g round were                  ofavious 1y very upset.                   ihe

constant          stream of abuse at myself an d other                         officers who were             outs id

the ground saying               it was       our    fault,       we   should    be    inside    doing

som e t h i n g    instead of        being     outside.           Fro m what      they said,        an d others

who were          less angry,        it became a p p arent             to me there had been an

incident          inside     the    ground w h i c h had          resulted      in a number         of    deaths.



I continued to try and keep                        the    road    clear    until      ap/rox    4.3 0 p m w h e n      I

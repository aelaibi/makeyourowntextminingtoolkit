                 spectators.            Once   designated,             a stadium will             require a

                 safety       certificate from the                local     authority.

inspection of a sports                   ground because          these         powers are vested             in it as

7,      An additional             change    brought about             by paragraph 7(1)               affects       the

role and status of the Fire A ut ho r i t y                       in Greater London and the

M et ro po li ta n    counties.           The    converse       of    paragrpah 6 applies                  in respect

of the Fire A u th or it y which,                 from    1 April        1986       (010486),        has    the

status       of " interested            party"    in M e t r o p o l i t a n     counties and Greater

London.         In these areas            the    local a u t h o r i t y       is required to refer

s afety      certificate a p p l i cations             to the Fire Au t h o r i t y and                consult      it

about     the terms and            conditions of a safety                  certificate?             and the Fire

A u t ho r i t y will      have    the    right to a u t horise            entry and             inspection of a
sports        ground.           The    reason for these              changes       is that    the newly

 constituted fire author i t i e s will                        not    (as    in the    past)     be the      same as

the     local a u t h o r i t y .

26 November              1983    <261183),          The S e c r e t a r y of State       takes       the view that

allows       successor author i t i e s                 to consider,         before    1 April       (Q 10486),

SAFETY OF SP O R T S G RO U N D S ACT            1975   (000075)

BACKGROUND

W H E A T L E Y RE P O R T

1«      T t e r m s          of the   inquiry extended to sports              grounds       generally but

oecause tile immediate                concern at the time           related to soccer             grounds,

its Report         c o n c entrated on crowd safety               in such grounds,          and    included

Rugby U nion and R ugby League                grounds.         Lord WHEAT L E Y       had no doubt.

That    the then existing              controls     over safety at football              grounds      were

inadequate.           He found that         the voluntary system of certifi cat ion of

grounds       introduced         by the Football         A s s o c i a t i o n some years    previously,

laid down no          requirements as to the              competence       of persons who           carried

out the annual               inspections    of grounds and there were                 no guidelines

to assist        those       persons    in their asse s s m e n t     of safety standards.

Moreover,        a review of the statutory                provisions       relevant      to the safety

of spectators           at football        grounds      convinced Lord W H E A T L E Y that the            law

also    fell     short       of providing     proper and effective             control      over

football       grounds as a whole.               The    building    regulations,        for example,

provide for         the basic         structural       safety of new buildings wit h i n a

t o o t ud 11 ground ftui tnsy do not apply to exxstinq                       buildings,          except

wnere si ■orations are                to be carried out?          nor do they apply to a ground
 as a whole.           In any      case,     most football            grounds were       built     before

 national       building        regulations wars                 introduced,

2.       Lord W H E A T LE Y     concluded that              only a specially devised statutory

scheme       could ensure          comprehensive             controls at football            grounds       in the

 interests        of safety and he             recommended a statutory                1 i censinq system.

He    proposed that           these     controls should be                introduced     by stages,         the

larger      or more       important        grounds,          broa d l y speaking,      being dealt with

first.        Lord W H E A T L E Y also        recommended that there should be a right                           of

appeal      for the       clubs      concerned against any decision of the                         licensing

authority.           The Report         showed Lord W H E A T L E Y 5s awareness               of the      need to

reconcile the            paramount aim of ensuring                    the safety of spectators with

what would be reasonable and                         practicable         for the   clubs,

3.       Lord W H E A TL EY also          provided,         as a technical         appendix      to his

report,       guidelines         to safety standards at football                      grounds      designed to

assist      the     local a u t h o r i t i e s      in their      task of enforcement,

C O N S U L T A T I O N S ON THE REPORT

4.      wnen the Report was                published,            those   bodies ma i n l y    concerned,

including the           local a ut ho r i t y a s s o c iations           and the football

authorities,          were     consulted about Lord WHEA T L E Y ' s                proposals.          The

football a u t h o r i t i e s made          it clear         that they were a p p r e h e n s i v e at       the

financial         implications         for the         clubs,      but there was       general

agreemen t with the              proposals           themselves.         Detailed     consultations

were    held on the guidelines                    contained        in the   technical        appen d i x   to the

Report and these,              duly amended,              were    finally   published by the Home

D e p a r tme nts    in N o v ember      1973        (001173)      as a special      booklet,       "Guide    to

 Its    primary         purpose        is to set out          principles      ar guidelines which the

 local au thor i t i e s will              no doubt wish to keep              in mind       in enforcing         the

 Act.       she Guide          t h e r e f o r e d e a Is w i t h m a 11 e r s s u c h a s t h e p r a v i s i o n o f

 adequate         entrances and exits,                   means    of escape,      the slope       of terracing,

 the strength and siting of                        crush barriers,          the   c o n s t ruction of

 staircases,            and measures          to ensure          the safe movement         of spectators

 both under            normal     and eme rgency           conditions.        The Guide        is not a set of

 requirements            to be rigidly applied,                   regardless of individual

 circumstances.                As Lord W H E A T L E Y       recognised,      it is important           to

ma i n t a i n the m ax i m u m f lexibility                 in any system of         control      so as to

take account             of the differing                circumstances at         individual       groundss

factors          such as age,          size and mode             of   construction differ widely from

ground       to ground,

6.       While         the    basic    principles         set out       in the Guide are          relevant      to

G EN E R A L A P P R O A C H TO THE ACT

7.       The main            instrument       of    control      under     the Act    is the safety

certificate             issued by the          local a u t h o r i t y .    A safety       certificate         is

needed       in respect          of every stadium which                  is the subject          of a

de s i g n a t i o n order,          made by the Sec r e t a r y of State,               The     certificate

enables          the    local    a ut ho r i t y    to   impose       such terms and       conditions as are

necessary to ensure a reasonable                           standard of safety at the stadium in

question.

S U B ST AN C E OF THE ACT

9.      The first 5 sections                    e s tablish the main system of control                    under

the Act,        that      is 'to say,          the safety     cert i f i c a t e ,   issued    by the local

a u t h o r i t y for the are a              in w hich the stadium         is situated,         w hich    is

required for every sports                       stadium desi g n a t e d for that            purpose     by order

of the Sec r e t a r y of Stats,

ID,     SECTION         1 empowers the S e c r e t a r y of State               by order       to designate

any sports          stadium having a c co mm od a t i o n for more                   than    10,000

s pectators as            requiring a safety certificate.                       Safety       certificates           are

of two kinds,            general         and special,        A general         safety       certificate        is

the main        continuing             form of control and           is issued for an           indefinite

period     in respect            of a specified a c t i v i t y or activities                  regularly

taK.ing place; at the stadium,                        A special      safety     certificate may be

issued at the disc r e t i o n of the                    local   a u t h o r i t y for a special         event or

other     ci rcumstances               not    covered by the general            safety      certificate,

Such an event might                    be an evangelistic         rally which might             call     for

special       a rr a n g e m e n t s    if,    for example,      seating were          provided for        the

c ongregation on the                   playing area,        A special       safety      certificate        can be

issued only           in respect             of a sports    stadium for which a general                   safety

certificate          is alre a d y           in force,

11,     The     contents         of safety        certificates are dealt with                 in SECT I O N 2,

The   local a u th or it y             is empowered to       include       in the      certificate       such

terms and conditions as are                       necessary to secure,               at the stadium        in

question,        a reasonable                degree   of safety,       without        prejudice    to this

general       power,      the section            requires    certificates            to contain terms and
 conditions           relating     to major matters            such as entrances and exits?

means     of escape         in emergency,          the number?           strength and sit u a t i o n of

 crush barriers?            and the m a x i m u m number          of spectators who may be

of doubt?        SUB-SECTION          <3> makes        it clear         that a certificate may

include a condition               relating       to the keeping            of records         relating         to

12,     An earlier Bill?              introduced         in 1973        (000073)»      limited the terms

and   conditions          imposed under a safet y - c a r t i f i c a t e            to what was

necessary to secure a reasonable                         degree     for    "members        of the       public".

There was some            d i fficulty over           this    term because          it might       have

excluded?        for example?          members        of s u p p o r t e r s 5 clubs,       This    particular

problem was by the defi n i t i o n of                   “s pectator"         in    Section       17?   that        is?

any   person occupying a c co mm od at io n                  provided for           spectators.          On the

other hand?           it seemed      right     that all       the    people         present       on the

o c c asion of a m atch or other activ i t y                    for w hich          a ground       has a

certificate           should be taken into account                   for the        purpose       of the safety

certificate?           for example?           people     using a squash            court    or other

facilities at the ground.                     Accordingly?          the general         power      of the          local

a ut ho r i t y under S EC TI ON 2(1)            to    include      in a safety         certificate            such

terms     of conditions as are                necessary omits any reference                       to people and

speaks     only of securing              "reasonable         safety at the stadium"?                    (although

^he terms       "safety"?        as defined           in Section        1/?    does not      include danger

arising from           partic i p a t i o n   in a sport).          Cert a i n      provisions must?

however?      be spe c i f i c a l l y    linked with spectators                   (who are?       after all?

the   people      the Act       is mainly designed to protect and who will                                be

greatly      in the majority).                Thus S E C T I O N 2(2)         requires      the    certificate

to state the           m ax i m u m number of spectators                who may be admitted,

13.     SEC T I O N    3 sets out the broad              procedure        to be followed when                  a

local aut h o r i t y      receives an a p p l i c a t i o n for a safety                  certificate.

       is an         instrument       of      continuing        control.       The     issue of a special              safety

       certificate,            however,         is left to the d iscretion of the                      local    authority,

       as already explained,                   because         only they      can judge whether            it is

       appropriate           to    issue      it for the special              occasion        in question.

    however,       open to a local a u t h o r i t y , .under Section 3(4)                    of the Act,         to

    require,       by notice       in writing,        such further          information of this kind

    as    it may    consider      necessary to enable               it to determine           the terms and

    conditions        to ha included          in the       certificate.
S.       On receipt of an a pp li ca t i o n for a general                    safety certificate,

the    local a ut ho r i t y must        first     determine whether           the a p p licant         is a

qualified       person,       is a person        likely to be in a position to                    prevent

c o n t ravention of the             terms and conditions             to be   imposed   in the

certificate.           If it considers           him to be such a person the a u t h o r i t y                     is

then under a duty to issue a general                          safety    certificate     to him.              In

the    case of a general             safety    certificate,           where   considerations            of time

are    not   paramount,        the     regulations          impose    no specific     time    limit for

such a d e t e r m i n a t i o n .     In any event,          it seems PR IMA F ACIE unlikely

that an a pp li c a t i o n for a general                  safety    certificate w ould       be made             by

an unqual i f i e d     person.        There     is,       however,    a right   of appeal         against a

d e t e rm i n a t i o n by a local     au t h o r i t y    that an applicant        is not a

qualifie d      person       (see    paragraph       10).

3,      In M et ro po li ta n        counties and Greater London               (from 1 April            1986)

(010486)      the    local a ut ho r i t y     is required,           by Sect i o n 3(35     of the Act,

to send a copy of any a p p li ca ti on for a safety certificate                              (general             or

special)      to the ap p r o p r i a t e Chief Officer               of Police and the           fire

authority,       and must       consult them about                 the terms and     conditions          to be

included      in the        certificate.         Els e w h e r e    in Engl a n d and Wales        the       local

a ut ho ri ty must      send a copy to and                 consult with the Chief Officer                    of

Police and the building authority.                           In framing such conditions,                 local

au t h o r i t i e s will   no doubt wish to keep in mind the                    principles         or guide

lines    set out      in the Guide to Saf e t y at Sports Grounds,                         in this

connection       local a u t h o r i t i e s are       reminded that,         this   non— statutory

document      is not a set of           requirements           to be rigidly a p p l i e d        regardless

of    individual      circumstances.             The m a x i m u m flexib i l i t y should         be

m a i n t ai n e d to take account         of the different             circumstances        of

individual       grounds      deriving        from differences           in such matters as age,

size and mode         of construction.               In this        regard,   it should also            be

noted that the Act             provides       that     the   terms and conditions            should          be
such as        "necessary or expedient                     to secure       reasonable       s a f e t y ” and    it

w o u l d be u n r e a s o n a b l e , even         if it were          practicable,      to seek the

absolute           safety of everyone att e n d i n g                  the sports    stadium,

4.        It is en v i s a g e d that there will                      be a good deal      of consultation

between the             local     a ut ho r i t y and the stadium             reprssentatives          in the

process of drawing                 up the        certificate           conditions.        in this way,          if

evidence           is a d v a n c e d    that a ground           is rarely filled to           capacity?         the

local a u thority may                   consider      it proper         to base    its    requirements          on

actual       levels        of atte n d a n c e      over a given          period    rather     than on maxi m u m

capacity.             On the      rare occasions             on w hich a capacity           crowd    could be

expected?           separate        provision might              be mads    for this       c ontingency on the

lines      indicated          in paragraph 7 below.                     Again?    if a stand were           found to

be str u c t u r a l l y weak?            the    local a u t h o r i t y might?      in consultation with

the    stadium          representatives?              offer      the    choice    of having any necessary

remedial           works     carried out or of restricting a d mission to the stand

until      it had been strengthened.

5.       As will          be a p p arent        from the foregoing            paragraphs?       the form and

content of a safety                     certificate        is    likely to vary ac c o r d i n g       to the

circumstances              of the        individual        case.        Accordingly?      a standard form of

certificate would not be appropriate.                                   It must    however     contain full

details        of the terms and                 conditions        imposed     including?       in particular?

the matters            referred to in S ec t i o n 2(2)                  of the Act and have anne x e d to

it a plan of the stadium by reference                                  to which the terms and

conditions will               be framed.            The    certificate when first              issued may

contain        restrictive              conditions which              can then be relaxed or deleted by

a me n d m e n t    of the      certificate.              The    local    aut h o r i t y may find     it

convenient           to    list?        in a covering           letter    to the    certificate?        such

m o d i f i c a t i o n s as will         be s ub s e q u e n t l y    permitted?    eg   in the form of a

statement           of the      increased         spectator           capacities    to be allo w e d        for the

separate           sections      of the ground when the various                      stages     of any future
works    programme agr e e d with the stadium au t h o r i t i e s are               completed.

This ar rang erne n t ? by excluding            from the     cert if i cate    itself      proposed

conditions which w ould a pply only to future works?                          should serve        to

obviate       confusion.      At the same time?            however?    care must      be taken not

to exclude       from the      certificate any           restriction germane         to    current

conditions?          s i n c e S ec t i o n 3(3) of the Act provides for an interested
party to appeal          to the S e c retary       of State against       the     inclusion of

an y thing     in?    or the omission of anything             from?    a safety      certificate

and    these    rights must       not be      prejudiced     in any way       in consequence           of

the    form of the       certificate.

6.      As    regards    the scope      of a general       safety certificate?        Section

2(55    of the Act       provides     that different         terms and    conditions may be

included for different             activities.           Although?    therefore?      a stadium may

be in regular use only as a football ground? in cases where it- is also
used from time to time             to stage      other events        it would   be desirable?

and    in many cases       obviate      the   need for special         safety   certificates?               if

the    terms and       conditions a p p r o priate        to those    events were         to be

included       in the general       certificate.           It is suggested that any such

events       for which    it is considered desirable             to provide might

convenie ntly be         divided     into 2 classes s~

        1.      those    suf f i c i e n t l y similar   in character     to the m ain        purpose

        of the stadium for the normal                terms and       conditions      to be equally

       appli cable ?

       2.       those of a funda m e n t a l l y     different       character?      eg boxing

       matches?       pop concerts?       etc w h i c h may    involve all      or    part    of the

       playing area being given over to spectator a c c o m m o d a t i o n and for

       which separate         terms and       conditions will         have to be devised.              It

       is not?       of course?     necessary to         provide for these        contingencies

       in cases where         no clear need         is foreseen       by the stadium

7.       There may also            be circumstances              in which the terms and                 conditions

a p plicab le      to the no nival a c t i v i t y of the stadium may be found to be

 inappropriate,           eg wnen a special              event?       such as a cup tie or a “Local

Derby"?       is expected          to attract s i g n i f i c a n t l y more          than the usual

attendance.            In the      case e s pecially of cup replays                    these     special

events may arise with only a few day s'' notice,                                 wit h i n w h :lc h i t w o u 1 d

overcome        this difficulty,            it would seem desirable                   for the     local

a utho m i s s       and stadium au t h o r i t i e s          to seek to 'work out            in advance           the

moditlcations           to the      normal      terms and        conditions w hich might                be

to    certain areas          on the      condition        that       extra stewards and           police are

employed,        that notice          is given to the            local      authority?       and so on?         and

to    provide      for their        incor poration            in the general         safety      certificate.

9.      After a certificate              has been granted,              an a p p l i c a t i o n may be mads

for the transfer          of the        certificate          to another       person.       Similarly,

while a local        a ut ho r i t y    is considering an a p p l i c a t i o n for a

certificate and before                 the    certificate        has    been granted,           it may be

a s k e d to substitute        some      person other           than the original           a p p licant as

the    person to whom        the       certificate         should be granted.              These ars,

however,       likely to be rare occurrences                     in the     case of general             safety

certificates,        where an ap p l i c a t i o n will            normally be made             on behalf     of

a club or a stadium o r g a n isation                   by an a u t h o r i s e d official        of    the

club or     representative             of the organisation.               However,        if it does

happen,     the   local    a ut ho r i t y will         be required        in both cases          to

determine whether          the s u b s t ituted nominee                is a qualified           person.

Thereafter,       in the first           case,       the   procedure       laid down       in the

regulations       to giving        notice       of,     and the     reasons      for,     the

not    treat   the a pp li c a t i o n       in all     respects as a new a p p l i c a t i o n          in the

inclusion of anything              in or the omiss i o n of anything                     from a safe ty

certificate or against a refusal                       to a mend or       replace a safety

certificate,        The    regulations             provide     that,     in the     case of a general

safety    certificate,        notice of any such appeal                     shall       be given within 28
days    following       receipt     of a notice        of the       local a u t h o r i t y ’s decision,,

or?    in the     case of      persons who are         not notified?             the    publication by

the    local a ut ho r i t y of its decision             in a newspaper             circulating          in the

locality,

11.     In this       connection?       R e g u l a t i o n 7 requires a local authority?                   on

issuing or amending             a safety     certificate           or   refusing        to do so?        to give

notice     to certain specified             “ interested       p a r t i e s ” and also to advertise

their action          in the    press.      It is regretted that                 it has been n e c essary

to incur        the trouble and expense             of advertising?             but?     since Ejection

3(3)    of the Act         is not specific        in the definition which                    it provides         of

“ interested       p a r t y ” ? no other means        could be found of ensuring                       that ail

persons who might            validly     claim to be "interested                  parties" within           the

meaning     of the Act should be able to acqua i n t                       themselves with the

local a u t h o r i t y ’s decision,        and failure to bring                the decision to their

notice     could result         in a denial       of their         rights      of appeal         or of a

hearing     by the Sec r e t a r y of Stats.            For    the same         reason a similar

oblig a t i o n has     been    imposed on an a p p e l l a n t         (by R e g u l a t i o n 8(7))      to

a u t h o r i t y notice   of appeal?      a c c o m p a n i e d by the      relevant        documents

appertaining          to the appeal.         It will      then be for the               local     authority?

SAFETY OF S P O R T S G R O U N D S ACT            1973     <000075)

P R O C E D U R E R E G A R D I N G A P P L I C A T I O N S FOR    'SPECIAL'      SAFETY C E R T I F I C A T E S

1.      The     regulations           provide      that any a p p l i c a t i o n for a safety

certificate          shall     be made        inthe form          contained         in the Schedule          to       the

Regulations          or      a form to the like effect.                      Part II of the form and                  its

f rontispiece          should be        completed         in the        case of a p p l i c a t i o n s    for

special       safety         certificates.            In any       case where an a p p l i c a t i o n for            a

s pe c i a 3. saf ety ce r t i f i cate      i s no t made         hy the ho 1 de r of t he ge na ra 1

safety      certificate,             it should be a c c o m p a n i e d by evidence               of the

a p p l i c a n t ’s status.          Details      of any         planned      changes    to the      normal

standing and seating a r r a ngements                      for spectators             should be provided;,

together with such further                     information           in support        of the a p p l i c a t i o n

as    is considered necessary to enable                           the    local au t h o r i t y to discharge

its functions             under      the Act,,        However,       it is open to a local

authority,         under Sect i o n 3(4)              of the Act,         to require,        by notice           in

writing,       any further            information of this kind which they may think                                   it

necessar y to have to enable                     them to determine               the terms and            conditions

to be     included         in the special             safety      certificate,

2.      A major       difference          in the grant            of general and special                  safety

c ertificates         is that,         once the        local      a u t h o r i t y has deter m i n e d that an

applicant        is a qualified            person,        the     issue of a general            safety
certificate           becomes m a n d a t o r y , whereas      the    issue of a special              safety

certificate           remains at       its discretion.            But an applicant           has a right

of appeal           to the Sec r e t a r y    of State against a refusal                 (see following

paragraphs           for details).

3.      An a p p l ic at io n for a special             safety     certificate         should normally

be made at           least 3 months          before   the date of the           proposed event,             but a

local a ut ho r i t y has d i scretion to               permit an a p p l i c a t i o n wi t h i n a

lesser        period       if   it is satisfied that         the     procedures        (including

appeals        procedures)         required under        the Act and Regula t i o n s             can,      in the

particular           c a s e , be carried out wi t h i n that           lesser      period,       eg when the

a p plicant         is known to be a qualified              person.       On    receipt of an

a p p li ca ti on for a special              safety   certificate,        the    local a u t h o r i t y must

first determine whether                 the a p p licant      is a qualified           person,      ie a

person        likely to be         in a position to         prevent      contravention of trie

terms and           conditions       to be    imposed    in the      certificate.           The    local

a ut ho r i t y     is required by regulation 5 to make                   this      deter m i n a t i o n

w i t h in    14 days of        receiving      the application. . There              is a right of

appeal        against a d et e r m i n a t i o n by a local          a u t hority    that an applicant

is not a qualified                person     (see p a ragraph ?),        and,    under      regulation 5,

the applicant must               be furnished with          the    reasons      for such a

determinati o n .

4.       It next          requires    to be considered whether             the a p p l i c a t i o n should

be   refused on grounds               other    than that     the applicant           is not a qualified

person.            This   decision must,        in acco r d a n c e with       regulation 6,          be made

wi t h i n 28 days          of the    receipt    of the appi i cation,           not only         in cases

where        the    local a ut ho r i t y has deter m i n e d that the a p plicant                 is a

qualifie d          person but also          in those where        it has d e termined that he is

not and an appeal               has been      lodged and     remains      to be considered.                 There

is also a right of appeal                    against a refusal         on grounds other             than a

d e t e rm in at io n that       the applicant        is not a qualified             person       (see
paragraph 9).                 In the event of such a refusal?                       t h e r e f o r e , the    local

a ut ho ri ty     is again           requi red,     under     regulation 6,            to give the applicant

the    reasons          for    its decision.

3.       When the first 2 stages                    have been completed,                 should      it have been

decided that a special                   safety       certificate          should be        issued,      the        local

a u th or it y    in M e t r o p ol it an      counties and Greater Lo n d o n                  (from 1 April

1986     <010486)>            is required,         by S e c t i o n 3(3)     of the Act,           to send a copy

of the a p p li ca ti on to the Chief Offi c e r                      of Pol ice and to the Fire

A ut ho r i t y and to          consult       them about       the terms and             conditions           to be

included         in the        certificate*           E l s ewhere    in Engl a n d and wales                 the    local

a ut ho r i t y must          send a copy to,          and    consult with,            the Chief Officer                  of

Po l i c e and the building authority.                         The special           safety      certificate

must,      in a c cordance            with    regulation 6(25,             then be       issued not           less       than

£8 days before                the    proposed event          is due    to take         place.

6.       The form and               content    of a special          safety     certificate           is likely to

vary according                to the    circumstances          of each       individual          case and a

standard form of certificate would not be appropriate.                                             (In suitable

cases,      however,           regard may be had to the guide                       lines set out             in the

Guide      to Sa f e t y at Sports Grounds                   (Football)       on the basis            indicated            in

paragraph 3 of the                   paper    relating       to the     ‘‘P r ocedure Regarding

A pp li c a t i o n s    for General          Safety C e r t i f i c a t e s " ,)      Any special            safety

certificate must,                   however,     contain full         details of the terms and

conditions          imposed,          including       in particular          the matters           referred to in

S e ct io n 2(2)         of the Act,          and as      required     by Sect i o n 2(4)           should          be

framed where a p p r o priate                 by reference         to the     plan a t t a c h e d to the

general       safety          certificate.

7.       Once a special               safety     certificate         has   been issued,           subject           to the

d et e r m i n a t i o n of any appeal,             the    terms and        conditions         can be varied

only     by formal            a m endment     of the      certificate.         This may be on the

a p p li ca t i on of the holder               of the      certificate        or at the d i scre tion of
the    local a u thority              <see S ec t i o n 4(2)       of the A c t ).          This    seems an

unlikely ev e n t u a l i t y          in the     case of a special                safety certificate,

otherwise        than      in the exceptional               case where            the    certificate       has    been

issued well          in advance          of the event          to w h i c h       it relates.        Any such

amendmen t must,             however,       be publicised as                in paragraph          10 below,

8.      C o n s id e r a t i o n s    of time     render     the transfer               of a special       safety

certificate          to another          person an equally unlikely                       contingency.           Any

possible       difficulties             in this      connection are               likely to be obviated,

however,       if the holder of the general                        safety         certificate applies             for

the special          certificate.              Nevertheless,          should an a p p l i c a t i o n for

transfer       be made,          the    local a u th or i t y must           decide within          14 days       if

the    proposed transferee                 is a qua l i f i e d     person and,            if    it decides       to

the    contrary,         the     procedure       laid down         in the         regulations       relating       to

giving      notice       of, and the           reasons      for,    the d e t e r m i n a t i o n will      apply,

as will      the ap p r o p r i a t e appeals           procedure,           should the need arise.                    In

the    case of an ap p l i c a t i o n for            transfer        before a special              safety

certificate          has a c t u a l l y been        issued,       there      is no       reason why the          local

a u t h o r i t y should       not treat        the a p p l i c a t i o n    in all       respects as a new

application          in the terms of the original                      and        process       it from the       point

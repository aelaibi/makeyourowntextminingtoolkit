             I arrived at the ground at approximately 2.30 p.m.              It was a sunny day, many people
             were standing around talking.        As I neared the turnstiles the most noticeable thing
             was the absence of barriers sectioning off each turnstile, as had happened the
             previous year.    There were no queues as such, just a mass of people going forward.
             After about 10 minutes or so the crowd built-up so much people started being crushed.
             Many people had to be passed out over the outside wall of the ground.                                Because there
             were no queues it was even more difficult to get into the turnstiles because as one
             person went in people from all directions were attempting to get into turnstiles
             behind them.

             I entered the ground and bought myself a hamburger and an orange drink.                                   I was eating
             my hamburger before I went in and I noticed that the gates at the side were being
             opened.   From what I could see no tickets were checked.                 As people surged in, some
             attempted to git into the stands but the crush was so great (because people realised
             the match was aboul to start), the stewards on the gate closed them, everybody else
             made for the tunnel.        The stewards I have just mentioned were the only stewards or
             Police I can remember seeing, beyond the turnstiles certainly there were no Police
             or stewards directing people away from the tunnel.              This I found very strange as from
         memory of the previous times at Sheffield, Police or stewards have directed people
             away from the middle section because of overcrowding.

             Admittedly on previous occasions in the league, Liverpool have only been given half
             of the away end, therefore Police were there in any case to stop fans going into the
             cordoned off areas.


             In all the years I have been to Sheffield's ground I have never before been in the
         middle section, always in the sections towards the far. right.                             On this occasion I
             found myself carried towards the middle section,              i rapidly went from near the top
             of the section through to almost half way when I found I could go no further.
         Gradually I was moved towards the righthand side of the goal and ended up in front
         of a barrier.        People were screaming at this time to push back but no one could go
    v        back because of the pressure from behind.       As I came to the bar, having had e
         of being crushed on a bar in the past, I ducked under.                      I had to struggle to get up
         f-H* other side,
                    <31   it was then that I knew this was not H i k e other crushes.                                      The
         downwards became worse and worse, people were screaming at the police and as!

       The boy behind me, in front of the bar was screaming that he could not breathe.
       Myself and other supporters tried in vain to push back but found ourselves totally
       unable to move.      I   remembr thinking if ever I was to die in a crush it would be
       this moment.    I   managed to tilt my head backwards and open my mouth so I was able to
       breathe in some air from above.        Other people smaller than me and further from the
       bar than me were not able to carry out this easy function.         People were screaming
       that they could'nt breathe, people were shouting that people were dead, banging on
       the fence and shouting to the police to open the gate or let them out somehow.
       People even started to claw at the wire mesh on the fence to try and pull it down
       such was the panic.


       At 'first the police seemed indifferent to the panic going on and obviously did not
       realise the serious ness of the situation.         The gate was opened to allow people out
       but was shut again quite quickly.       By this time more police had arrived but they
       were pushing E g o ^ e back into the mass and telling people to push back even though
       for some minutes previously people had been trying to draw their attention to the
       fact that no one could go back and that people were seriously injured.         I do not
       know how it happened but a little bit of space, enough just to move on the spot
       appeared.    Myself and other Liverpool fans passed people alive and unconscious over
       the fence to our right.       Even at this stage you could not tell that it was as bad
       as it was.

       After passing people over for what seemed like a long time but what could only have
       been a few minutes a space appeared.       I   went to my left to help people who were          *
       crying and I tripped over a young lad whom I ,       in ignorance, thought was unconscious.
       I screamed at another supporter to help me lift, as we grabbed hold of his arms and
       lifted higher up I was shocked to see that his face was a mottled blue/yellow.            The
       supporter who lifted the lad with me said "Put him down for the time being there are
       others over her alive” .

       We were unable at first to reach the people we could see alive because they were
       trapped in a wall of dead people.       It was at this time I realised that a major
                    had' occurred.     Myself and other supporters were lifting the dead and
               -oyer .the; fence to our right for some time or what seemed like some time before
;      l^i<ie;ipri;ved to give assistance.      Some bodies had been dragged out and left aside
    ; ; . V : w e /tried, to get the injured out.     They were covered with coats, as we lifted
       the first person up the coat fell off his head.        It was then to my horror I realised
       it was one of the lads that had been screaming to me for help.

       When the police first arrived in the section they tried to physically manhandle the
       people who had been helping,away from the bodies even though these people had saved
       many lives, done all they could to help and were still offering assistance.
We pulled one young lad out who to us the fans appeared to be dead.           One lad then said
he thought he saw him in some way respond to him with his eyes I think.            As far as we
were concerned the was dead.       However a St Johns Ambulance-man on hearing this grabbed
hold of the lad and shouted he was alive.       He then gave him resuscitation and the lad
vomited, we knew he was alive.

If it were not for the supporters I am sure the death toll would have been far far
greater.     I myself sustained just     minor bruising but the horror of the day will be
with me for ever.       I have taken a   week off       work to    try to come to terms with the
situation.

To explain some of the confusion, when the advertising hoardings were first being
pulled from the stands some people in ignorance thought that the Liverpool fans were
trying to wreck the ground.

When the dead bodies had been cleared from infront of u s , people who had lost shoes,
                ife —                                                         ■■
valuables etc were: being attacked because people thought they were picking up money
that had fallen onto the terrace.

Again to show how oblivious I was to the scale of the situation I met a friend who
asked me was it true that five were dead.           I replied this was impossible because
we had helped clear a lot more bodies than that and I had seen up to thirty dead.

I could not believe it when the final death toll was announced.

My own assessment of the situation is that whilst the Police could not be blamed for
                                                                                              ’*
opening the gates I feel they fell down in three important areas:

   i)   why were there no barriers outside the turnstiles funneling people in.
  ii)   Why were there no police inside the ground to stop people going up the
           tunnel?   Surely somebody could have radioed through,
 iii)   Why didn’t the police open the gate and let the people out over the top
        when it must have seemed quite obvious that there was a major problem?

This is a true and accurate account of what I saw.

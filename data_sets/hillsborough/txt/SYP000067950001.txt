darkness and got to the end and because of the large volume of people

could go no further,                         passage through the tunnel was quite free. There

was no Police or Siteward control at this point.                                                     I saw no disorder at

from my brother and friends.                                   I was in the middle of the crush,                                   I

with fright or anything                             but with the pressure.

Policeman pushed him back,                                 not in malice,               it was obvious they did not

realise what was going on.                                 I did not actually witness any deaths.

the    ground of my own accord.

I feel      that      the deaths were         caused by the volume                ofpeople      alarge

crowd      in such a small          area.

I heard people saying that other people were thieving                                    from the      bodies

but    I did not        see a n y thing and        cannot        confirm    it.

After      the   initial      incident      I saw       lots     of    people   helping,     fans, Police

all    sorts     of    people,      but now      can    you    plan or     legislate     for    it. Once           it

was    disco v e r e d what       had happened          a number ofPolice          tried to break

down      the fences       but   this was        not    easy.

I feel      that      the ticket a l l o c a t i o n was         totally wrong       so many tickets

go i ng to the wrong t e a m * The               p 1ac ing of the         supparte r s was      t o t a 1 1y

wrong also.           It w ould have       been sensible              to have   given Liverpool          the

other      end of the       ground.       Another       contributing        factor was       the traffic,

it took       us some 3 3/4 hrs            to travel       approx 85 miles.           Also     before     the

start      of the game,          I feel    the    crowds       should have        been o r ganised       into

some      sort of queues,           and not have         been     left    to build up to such an

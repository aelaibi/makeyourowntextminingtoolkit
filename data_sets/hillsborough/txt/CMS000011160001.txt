Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to the Minister for Sport which
has   been  passed   to   this  department   in   view  of   our
responsibilities for safety at sports grounds. I apologise for
the delay in replying to you.

There is no dispute that a tradgedy such as that which occurred
at Hillsborough must not happen again. It's lessons have to be
learned.  Football, including the spectators, must look to the
future.

There is little which I can add to Lord Justice Taylor's very
comprehensive analysis contained in his Final Report on the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.    He recognised that there is no
panacea which will achieve total safety and cure all the
behaviour and crowd control problems at football matches. He was
satisfied that seating does more to achieve these objectives than
any other single measure.   The Report also identified that all
seated accomodation is consistent with the policies of both FIFA
and UEFA. All seated accomodation is, we believe, a major step
towards creating a better, safer environment in which all
spectators can enjoy the game.     That is why we have supported
Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation and are implementing it.

As you are probably aware the government are making available
£100 million to the football industry over a five year period to
assist clubs in installing extra seats.       The Football Trust
expects to provide clubs with a further £75 milliom over a ten
year period, in addition to almost £26 million provided each year
by television and pools companies.      Consequently there is a
considerable ammount of money available to football clubs to make
the necessary ground improvements.

With regards to the passing of the terraces, Lord Justice Taylor
said in his Final report:

" I am not convinced that the cherished culture of the terraces
is wholly lost when fans are seated. ...The communal spirit is
still there and finds ready expression.   To such extent as the
seating limits togetherness or prevents movement, that price is
surely worth paying for the benefits in safety and control."
This is a view with which the Government is in agreement.

I hope this information is of use to you.

                                            Yours sincerely



                                            Steve Bilbe

the teens      to thirties age range.                 There were also dozens of people

arrest the m for o bs tr uc ti on however               this again w o ul d have been

counter p ro du c t i v e     in reducing the Police numbers                in the area.

 I believe      that      there were about 30 to 40 Police officers                   in the

 people,     a mal e and a female,            who wer e trying to enter the ground with

 several     cans     of    lager secreted       in the females large handbag.                Both

 smelled of         i ntoxicants and both a dm it te d having been drinking lager

 prior     to the a t t e mp te d entry.         The    female was arrested for a ttempting

  to enter     the ground       in p os se s s i o n of alcohol,        and the male was

  arrested for o bs t r u c t i n g me       in the e x e c ut io n of my duty        in that he

           formed by a sub st antial             spiked    top fence about 7 feet            in height on

           either side and            running from the front             to back of the t e r r a c e s .     I

           could see that pe o p l e were c l i mbing              from the front RH corner of Pen

           CN into this a l l e y and from there out of gate 5 onto                         the track I

           spent several m i nu te s p u l 1 ing people                out of this gate along wit h

           another     s e r geant     and a constable.          I then forced m y w a y into the

           alley w i th     the co n s t a b l e and we b oth a s s i s t e d people        to climb over

           the spiked fence            from pen CN into the alley.                This was a c c o m p 1 ished

           by a l l o wi ng pe o p l e     to use us as a l a d d e r .       After    5 m in u t e s or so the

           crowd    in this pe n         thinned out s u f f i c i e n t l y for me to see       in at ground

           I S aw that      there was a female form laying on the floor beneath                             the

           front b o u n d a r y wall       of the pen CN close to my position.                  There were 2

           or   3 people knelt           over her giving heart massage and m o u t h              to mouth

           resuscitation.             I cl imbed up and over            the spiked top fence from the

           alley     into the pen and at the same                  time I used the radio to request

           an am b u l a n c e   for h e r .    Once    in the pen I had no sooner checked that

           the w o m a n was be ing          p r o p e r l y treated    than I saw    what appeared         to be a

           fight further          a long     the front fence by gate 4 as shown on the plan.

           This    gate opens onto             the pitch close          to the rear of the g o a l .        I went

           across and saw that               people were      fighting to get         out of the gate.

           There was a h eap of              bodies     laying on the ground under           the wall where

           this gate       is situated,         about     3 or 4    .     Other people were clambering

           on top of these bodies w h i c h a p p e a r e d              1ifeless    in an effort    to get

           out.      people had fallen and the result was a log jam effect through

           w h i c h no p e r s o n could e s c a p e .     I informed control by radio about the

           apparent d ead and r e quested more a m b u l a n c e s .                I then tried to p u l l * -

           pe o p l e away from the gate              in order     to reach the injurred/dead

           underneath.           As   I did so m a n y fought and punched out at m e , m a n y were

            in a b 1ind panic.             I tried to explain that _the danger was over as the

                                                                                                             R47

           crowd had thinned out and I tried to point out the people who                                   they

           w er e treading on but         they w o u l d n 't 1 i s t e n .     Many of these people

           smelled s t r ongly of        intoxicants and              in my opinion m any were drunk.

           T here was an all p er va d i n g s m e 11 of stale alcohol                  in the air.

           1 then saw that o f f i c e r s outside                   the pen on the pitch,     together with

           fans     in the pen were pul 1 ing and                    kicking at the mes h fence at         the

           front of pen C N .         The y suc c e e d e d in tear ing          the mes h away and        via

           this route the bodies were              removed along             wit h 2or 3 who were          carried

           f rom the r e a r .       I then saw other           officers enter the pen from the rear

           who were        in the proces s of clearing people out                   into the rear         tunnel.

           Once pen CN was cleared            I left          it and cl imbed into pen CS wher e

           b o d i e s both    1 ive and dead were b eing removed                 in large n u m b e r s .     I

           a sis t e d    in this process     u n t i 1 this pen was clear and then m o v e d                  to qi

            2   in the S pen where         further people were being carried out from the

            rear .       X then spent quite a long time on the pitch near                         the goal

            a s sisting with heart m as s a g e and sorting out the                    1iving from the

           dead.         This process was being c o n s t a n t l y          interferred with by

            Liverpool        fans who were drunk and being a nuisance although the

           m a j o r i t y of fans    in the area at that time were well behaved and of

            tremendous h e l p .       Du r i n g this period I did see several young male

            fans pick i n g up m o n e y , w a l l e t s and other           items w hich had obv i o u s l y

            fallen from the pock e t s of c a s u a l t i e s .             Some of this ma y have been

           w i t h good      intent but some was no doubt                  theft as the     ’o f f e n d e r s ’ made

            off q ui c k l y w hen I made      to challenge t h e m .

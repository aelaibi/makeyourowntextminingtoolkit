         Dear Chief Officer/Clerk,

        This circular:

        • provides updated guidance to police authorities on financial assistance to police
          officers in legal proceedings.

        • distinguishes between officers involved in civil proceedings, criminal
          proceedings and other types of legal proceedings.

        • replaces HO Circular 77/1987.
 Introduction

 1.      It is important that police officers should be able to carry out their duties in
 the confidence that their police authority will support them, if they act in good faith
 and exercise their judgement reasonably. The following guidance, which has been
 prepared in consultation with ACPO, the Superintendents Association, the Police
 Federation and the Association of Police Authorities, should be read against this
 principle.

 Civil Proceedings

2.      Under section 88 (1) of the Police Act 1996 which re-enacts section 48(1) of
the Police Act 1964, chief officers are liable for torts committed by officers under
their direction and control. Section 88(2) provides that any damages or costs
awarded against the chief officer and any costs they incur themselves (which are not
recovered) should be met from police authority funds.

3.     Alternatively, a court may award damages against individual police officers.
Section 88(4) of the Police Act 1996 empowers a police authority “to such an extent
as appears to it to be appropriate” to pay any damages or costs awarded against
officers (this includes both officers of other forces serving in the police area under
mutual aid arrangements and special constables), any costs incurred by the officers
themselves and any sum paid in connection with the settlement of a claim. It is for
police authorities to decide when to make assistance available, taking account of the
circumstances of a particular case.

4.     Police authorities are reminded that the discretionary powers in sections
88(4) and (5) of the Act, enabling them to provide financial assistance to officers
involved in legal proceedings, apply to civil proceedings only. Sections 88(4) and
88(5) may also apply to police officers who were members at the time of the action
which gave rise to the claim but who are no longer members.

Criminal Proceedings

5.     Section 88(4) does not apply to criminal proceedings, but police authorities
may wish to consult their legal advisers as to whether they have any other power to
provide such assistance (whether in respect of private prosecutions or prosecutions
brought by the CPS). In this context, they may wish to note that section 111(1) of
the Local Government Act 1972 enables police authorities to do anything “which is
calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any of their
functions”. The provision applies to provincial authorities (but not the Metropolitan
or City of London police) by virtue of Section 146A of the 1972 Act (as inserted
by Schedule 14 to the Local Government Act 1985 and amended by Schedule 4 of
the Police and Magistrates’ Courts Act 1994). It could be argued that to allow
 payment to be made to officers (either former or serving) involved in crim inal
 proceedings would in some way facilitate or be conducive to a police authority’s
 broad functions. For example, failure to provide financial assistance could
 adversely affect the morale of the force if officers had to meet their own costs after
 an acquittal.

 6.     It is for individual police authorities to decide in the particular circumstances
 of a case, and on the basis of legal advice, whether to make financial assistant
 available to officers in criminal proceedings.

.Other types of legal proceedings

7.     Similarly, there is no express statutory authority for providing financial
assistance in proceedings brought against police officers in tribunals other than the
courts. It is for police authorities outside London (bearing in m ind the
recommendations of chief officers) to decide whether to make financial assistance
available to officers (either former or serving) involved in Public Inquiries and
Tribunals. Police authorities will therefore need to consider whether section 111(1)
of the Local Government Act 1972 provides sufficient scope to enable financial
assistance to be given in any particular case. In this respect tribunals may include
certain industrial tribunals where it is clear that officers have acted in good faith in
pursuance of their duties and the interest of the force as a whole is involved. It is to
be expected that, where appropriate, the service’s grievance procedure
arrangements should be exhausted before there is recourse to legal proceedings.
These arrangements are set out in Home Office Circular 16/93, issued 10 March
1993.

8.      There are specific provisions in the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975 for compensation, costs and expenses awarded against the
chief officer of police and any sum required for settlement, if approved by the
police authority, to be paid from the police fund.

9.      There is no express statutory authority for providing financial assistance to
an officer wishing to initiate court proceedings. The considerations set out in
paragraphs 5 to 7 above apply to such cases.

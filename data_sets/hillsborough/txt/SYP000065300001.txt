                On S a t u rd ay     15th April         1989    I left my house with a friend                                who

                lives       by me,    at about         11.00 am to go to the football                    match

                Liverpool          v Notts Forest         at Sheffield.               We went      in               car,    we

                t r av el le d to O r m s k i r k and joined             the MSS towards            the M 6 .

               __________ had a ticket             but    I didnt       but     I had heard that          I could buy a

                ticket at the football                  ground so        I deci d e d to,go         on this      premise.

                We tra v e l l e d direct       t o" S h e f f i e l d not stopping             off anywhere       en-route.

                Whi l s t    on the M63 we en c o u n t e r e d traffic                    ,/a.n> froifi junction 12-13 and
                                                   *                              — V
                due to this traffic             jam      it took       us an hour            to travel   just     10 miles.

                We event u a l l y a rr iv ed          in S h e f f i e l d at about 2.2 0          pm and      parked the       car

                in Fox Hill Road.

                After       parking the     ground,         we made our way                 to the ground,       I didnt    see

                any Police          directing      people       to the ground,               nor did    I see any disorder
                                                                                                                         PAGE

           only a few          lads singing and when they were a p p r o a c h e d by a PC and

          a sk e d to stop they d i d .

          We a r r i v e d at the entrance                   to the ground at about                 .30

           saw that        there was a mass                 of people where             the queries should be.

           It was       here    that                        said he was going             iiuo    the ground and wished

          me     luck    in finding a ticket,                   I wal k e d up and down/a             couple        of times

           but     di dnt see anyone             s s 1 1 i ng tickets.

           At about 2 .40          pm the Police              closed the outer vjates to the ground and
          £.--------- ——                                            '      ~     -
          told      people      to move         out    of the way.             I couI'd see at this             point    people

           climbing        onto the wall,              the wall          that separates          the two       lots of

          turnstiles.

           I reckon that 28-30                  people were             on the wall       above    the turnsfyiles

            felt    that they were waiting for a chance to get                                   into the ground.                 I

           rea 1 ised that         I di.dnt have much                   chance       of ge11ing    into the       ground so

           I m o v e d back      from the ground towards                       the outer        gates away from the

           crowd.

          By now        it was about 2.45                  pm and       I deci d e d to go around the other                   side

          of the ground just to have a look and                                  perhaps       gain access       to the

          ground.          This was           unsucces sful         and so       I eventually       returned to the

          L e p p i n g s 1...a n e e n d .

           ihe time        by now w^is about 2«55                   pm And. I noticed that            gate       ’A ’ was

           open,     about      18"/      There were 2 policemen on the O u t s i d e and some

           stewards        on the      inside         so    I went       through the gyate.          I stood just

V N W m    inside the gate for a minu te                       or so and then             I decided to leave the

           ground,       so I walked            out onto Leppings Lane and went                      to the       chip shop

          along      the    road.

          W he n    I came out of the                 chip shop          people were       starting       to    come out of

           the     ground and so              I e v ent ually made my way                back    to the    car where          I

           later met        up with                        and then we made our way home.                        B o t h of       us

           safe and well.

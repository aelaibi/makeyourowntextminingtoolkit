                         Matters      concerning          se gr eg at io n of fans was          discussed as was         the

                          tr an sp o rt a ti o n of fans       from M i dl a nd and Wads le y R ai l wa y Stations.

                         Chief S up er in t en d en t Mole m e nt io ne d          the    fact that Liverpool            F.C.      had

                          lodged a complaint w it h the F.A.                   regarding        the venue,      their    choice

                         a pp ar e nt ly being Old Trafford.

                         Chief S up e ri n te n de n t Mole also            told the meeting         that all       traffic

                         matters,      choice       of     routes,    signing and        policing    of routes w o ul d be

                     AS** As   the m atch was           to be a repeat       of the      previous year it was            decided

      r.                 .not to    change        the    routes.      The   route for Liverpool           was    s im pl ic it y
           '*fo
              \r         itself,     namely,        M62,    Ml, A 6 1 , a l t ho u gh    traffic    deciding      to use the
VP              .c
                         A 628 or A 616 were             catered for.        Liv er po ol    traffic was        diverted away

                       ^fr°m      the A57 at Hyde            by the e re ction of a traffic sign at the

                         A57/A628      junction.

                 '       N o t t i n g h a m Forest      had a more     torturous        route through built            up areas
                 I
                                                                                                     PAGE   2
                                                                                                     R58

To assist        traffic    reaching the ground                in good time     it was decided to

improve on the quant it y and quality of the signing                            used the      previous

year.      To assist       in this       endeavour       the A utomobile A s so c i a t i o n was

c ontracted to erect             signs along       the    routes     for Nottingham.          These

routes     consisted of the            primary,     sec on da ry and e mergency          route.        It

was decided        that    it w ould only be ne ce ss ar y to sign an e mergency

route off the m ot or w ay          for L iverpool         traffic.

In a d d i ti on to the signing            provided       by the A .A , we decided to use

for the very first           time,       signing    on the motorway.            In previous years

the D.O.T.        had o bj ected to us erecting                 n o n- st an da rd signing    on

motorways,        there    being a legal         impl i cat i o ri i f they     caused an

accident.         In this    event,       however,       the D.O.T.      agreed    to m an uf ac tu r e

and erect sin        signs       for the event.           Four    of these signs were          erected

on the Ml        northbound,       two below J u n c ti o n 33        (C a t c 1 i f f e ) and two

between Ca tc li ff e and J un ct io n 34            ( T i n s l e y ) , these being     for the

benefit     of N o tt i n g h a m Forest     traffic.          The two below J u n c ti o n 33 had

been designed so that              the    legend    could be altered to bring                traffic

off at J u nc t io n 33.         The     remaining       two    signs were erec te d on the M1

s outhbound       carriageway,         north of J u n ct i on 36 ’(Tankers 1e y ) directing

Liverpool        traffic    off at that junction.

It was     realised that          the S t oc ks br id ge       by~pass had been opened since

the    previous     year's m at ch and        it was       thought      that some     congestion may

well     occur    if Liverpool         traffic     decided       to strike off along          the A616

from The Flouch.            To    counter this three             traffic officers were

a p p o i n te d to man the       roundabout,       in the event         traffic did become

congested at that           point and had to be                redirected    back down the by~pass

to Deepcar,

The only other        change       from the      previous year was           that the key          road

junctions were m an n ed by e x pe ri en ce d Traffic                  officers,      in previous

y ears    such junctions,          when they were          the    r es ponsibility of

                                                                                                            R5S

            Territorial       Divisions,       had been ma nn ed by Traffic W ar d en s and

             i ne x perienced Police Constables.

            O ff icers     nom i na te d to work     point duty      paraded at the Force Driving

            School     at 0 900 on the day and were            briefed as to their duties                 by

            Police Post       by Chief     Inspectors Lax and Shaw at 0 83 0 on the day.

            law in an attempt          to keep traffic moving.

             Inspector S c ho l ey     prepared an Operat io na l        Order    covering         the

            involvement       of Traffic D iv is io n and three days             before      the    event

                    SUBJECT:   Planning of Traffic Duties re F.A. Cup Semi-Final - 15/4/89



                      On Wednesday, 22 March 1989, I attended a meeting at F Division HQs
                      to discuss details of the above Semi-Final. The meeting was
                      presided over by Chief Superintendent Male.

                      Matters concerning segregation of fans was discussed as was the
                      transportation of fans from Midland and Wadsley Railway Stations.

                      Chief Superintendent Mole mentioned the fact that Liverpool F.C. had
                      lodged a complaint with the F.A. regarding the venue, their choice
                      apparently being Old Trafford.

                      Chief Superintendent Mole also told the meeting that all traffic
                      matters, choice of routes, signing and policing of routes would be
                      the responsibility of Traffic Division.

                      As the match was to be a repeat of the previous year it was decided
                      not to change the routes. The route for Liverpool was simplicity
                      itself, namely, M62, Ml, A61, although traffic deciding to use the
                      A628 or A616 were catered for. Liverpool traffic was diverted away
                      from the A57 at Hyde by the erection of a traffic sign at the
                      A57/A628 junction.

                      Nottingham Forest had a more tortuous route through built up areas.

                      To assist traffic reaching the ground in good time it was decided to
                      improve on the quantity and quality of the signing used the previous
                      year. To assist in this endeavour the Automobile Association was
                      contracted to erect signs along the routes for Nottingham. These
                      routes consisted of the primary, secondary and emergency route. It
                      was decided that it would only be necessary to sign an emergency
                      route off the motorway for Liverpool traffic.

                      In addition to the signing provided by the A.A. we decided to use,
                      for the very first time, signing on the motorway. In previous years
                      the D.O.T. had objected to us erecting non-standard signing on
                      motorways, there being a legal implication if they caused an
                      accident. In this event, however, the D.O.T. agreed to manufacture
                      and erect six signs for the event. Four of these signs were erected
                      on the Ml northbound, two below Junction 33 (Catcliffe) and two
                      b^:w®n Catcliffe and Junction 34 (Tinsley),     these being for the
                      benefit of Nottingham Forest traffic. The two below Junction 33 had
                      been designed so that the legend could be altered to bring traffic
                      off at Junction 33. The remaining two signs were erected on the Ml
                      southbound carriageway, north of Junction 36 (Tankersley) directing
                      Liverpool traffic off at that junction.

                      It was realised that the Stocksbridge by-pass had been opened since
                      the previous year1s match and it was thought that seme congestion
                      may well occur if Liverpool traffic decided to strike off along the
                      A616 from The Flouch. To counter this three traffic officers were
                      appointed to man the roundabout, in the event traffic did become
                      congested at that point and had to be redirected back down the by­
                      pass to Deepcar.

                                                                         Continued
The only other change from the previous year was that the key road
junctions were manned by experienced Traffic officers, in previous
years such junctions, when they were the responsibility of
Territorial Divisions, had been manned by Traffic Wardens and in­
experienced Police Constables.

Officers nominated to work point duty paraded at the Force Driving
School at 0900 on the day and were briefed as to their duties by
Inspector Scholey.   Their brief was to give priority to football
traffic.

Officers nominated for patrolling traffic routes, together with
officers nominated for manning static points o& the motorway and
Public Order Patrols at Woodall Service area, were briefed at
Woodall Police Post by Chief Inspectors Lax and Shaw at 0830 on the
day. Their brief was to maintain patrols and ignore petty breaches
of the law in an attempt to keep traffic moving.

Inspector Scholey prepared an operational Order covering the
involvement of Traffic Division and three days before the event
contacted the Press Liaison Dept at Headquarters and asked for
maximum publicity to be given to the chosen routes.

Traffic arrangements appear to have been successful.


The Nottingham Forest routes were clear by 1400, the traffic lights
being switched back on at 1420.

The Liverpool routes appear to have flowed freely, and routes being
back to normal at 1420 hours.

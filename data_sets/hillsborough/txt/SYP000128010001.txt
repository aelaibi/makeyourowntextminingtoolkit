           I am a General Medical Practitioner by profession and have worked in

           this capacity since 1964.        I practise from the Stannington health

           Centre, Uppergate Road, Sheffield.

           I have provided a G P service to the Sheffield Wednesday Footall Club

           since 1976.       The position is generally referred to as Club Doctor but

           this is misleading so far as the duties are concerned and it would be

           proper to regard the task as Team Doctor.         I am the General

           Practitioner to both the Players and the office staff and attend all

           First Team matches to render emergency medical assistance to injured

           players-        I either attend or am on call for Second Team games and have

           attended at FA Cup Semi Finals held in previous years at Hillsborough.

             I hold a Sports Injury Clinic for players twice weekly and am nearly

           always on call when Reserve and Youth games are held.It is not part of
                                                                   PAGE     3


my duties to be on call generally at the Ground as a

Doctor.     St John's Ambulance Brigade provide First Aid facilities to

Supporters at First Team games.      I would not normally expect to learn

about Spectators being taken ill or injured unless this happened

within     my sight.

There have been a small number of occasion over the years when people

have collapsed or been injured fairly near to where I was seated and I

have of course gone to help these people.

I do not have any written contract with the club but the duties that I

describe above are those which have been carried out by the "Club

Doctor" for very many years and the way that I have dealt with the

matter is in     no way different from my predecessors.

I do not have a direct relationship with the St. John's Ambulance

Brigade.     They have their own Medical Officers one of whom I believe

is Dr.                 The club provides a First Aid Room for the use of

the St. John's Ambulance Brigade.      I do not have a key to this area

and have only been in on one occasion that I can remember.      I have no

control whatsoever over the operations of the St. John's Ambulance

Brigade personnel,

At the club there is a treatment room which is primarily the area

where the Club Physiotherapist Alan Smith treats injured players.

This contained two couches, three physiotherapy machines and stocks of

bandagges,    dressings and some drugs.   This room is often referred

to as the "Medical Room" but really it should be called the

Physiotherapist Room although I do use it occasionally.      A player

injured on the field would be taken to this room and then if necessary

to hospital.     There is a stretcher kept in the corridor just outside

this room.

About four or five years ago a former Director of the Football Club

Mr.            , collapsed with a cardiac arrest near to me in a
                                                                      PAGE    3


Reception Lounge at half time.      I was eventually successful in

resusciting Mr            ,   I was assisted by a Doctor from the Norwich

Football Club who had an Ambu-bag and airway with him.      The Abu-~bag is

a substitute for appplying mouth to mouth resuscitation.      The purpose

of the airway is to pass a pipe over the tongue and down the mouth to

create a clear passage.

The next morning I was asked to speak to the Club Chairman Mr McGee,

by chance there was an article in the current British Medical Journal

about portable defibri1lators and I tore this out to take with me.

When I met Mr McGee we discussed the events of the night before and I

told him that I felt the Club needed a defibri1lator and showed him

the article.     However Mr McGeee told me to obtain an Ambu-bag and

airway as the Norwich Doctor had used,     This I did soon afterwards.

Ever since I have always carried an airway in my pocket at every match

and keep the Ambu-bag in my case.     My normal practise is to leave my

case in the physiotheraphy room.

A defibri1lator can only be used in certain circumstances.      For

example an area must be cleared around the casualty before the charge

is delivered to ensure that anyone standing nearby does not receive an

electric shock.

It would not be possible for a St. Joh n ’s Ambulanceman or indeed a

qualified Nurse to use such a piece of equipment as in general only

qualified Doctors may do so.     Since my discussion with Mr McGee there

has not been any occasion when a defibri1lator would have been

required.

On the 15th April 1989 (150489), my wife and I had been invited by the

Club to the f „ A. Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough.    My wife was given a

seat in the Stand but I had been asked previously by Graham Mackrell,

the Club Secretary,    to take a seat behind the dugout at the s ide of

the pitch.     This was because of an incident   at a Football match
                                                                   PAGE       4


elsewhere in which a player nearly choked by swallowing his tongue

when knocked out*    The Football Association had made a direction that

a Doctor should be near the pitch.     Where I was to be seated was a

much more convenient place for getting onto the pitch quickly than

being seated in the Stand.

My wife and I attended a luncheon in the Executive Suite before the

match and I actually got to the area where I was to be seated at about

2*40 pm*     I did not notice anything about the crowd at that stage*

Indeed I cannot say that I noticed anything unusual prior to the match

being stopped*     I had not particularly looked at the Leppings Lane end

of the Ground.

When the match was stopped I simply thought that the Police

were dealing with a crowd invasion.     I had seen somebody running

across the pitch being chased by two policemen immediately after the

game was stopped.     I could see that people were being lifted   into the

Stand above the Leppings Lane enclosure but still thought that it was

a crowd disturbance due to the number of spectators and Police

milling around in front of the crowd barriers at that time*

Within about three or four minutes of the game being stopped I saw        a


Policeman lifting somebody out fo the crowd over the fence and

realised immediately that this was peculiar and that the situation

required further investigation*     I hurried to that end of the Ground

and found    a number of people lying or sitting on the edge of the

pitch,     I went around these looking for anyone seriously

injured but wihout exception these people were all conscious and had

suffered only minor injuries.     This would have taken me about two

minutes. I then came upon a casualty u^ho was obvsiously asphyxiated and

who was being resuscitated by two people I now know to be Dr* Glynn

Phillips from Kilbride and Mr.                [from Liverpool.I stopped to

assist these two and we were joined by a fourth person
                                                                        PAGE           5


who I cannot identify.

This was a male aged between forty and fifty who was obviously a First

Aider but I cannot recall whether he was in a St. J o h n ’s Ambulance

Brigade uniform or not.

I spoke to a Policeman who was near to us and told him to bring any

asphyxiated people that he could find to the area where we were.              I

could not identify this Policeman again but within a short space of

time there were a number of people who were asphyxiated laid on the

ground near to us.     The four of us split into two teams,     I was working

with Mr.          Prom Liverpool who I later ascertained was a Nurse

Manager working on the Cardiac Unit at Broad Green Hospital.

It must be understood that we were working in the middle of a large

crowd.     We were slightly to the left of the Goal Posts as       you look       at

them on the pitch, about    two or   three yards onto the Pitch.     There

were hundreds of people in that immediate area and it certainly

wa s n’t possible to see through the crowd to the fencing.         I therefore

had no idea what the scale of the casualties would be but the evidence

before me at that time suggested that people were either going to be

asphyxiated or only comparatively lightly injured.         It was obviously

appropriate to turn my attention to the asphyxiated first of all.

This was a question of working on one person until such time as it

seemed that there was no real prospect of them breathing unaided again

and then moving on to another victim to try and assist.        In

doing this one would pick whoever looked least cyanosed and whose

pupils were least dilated.I can't say how       long Mr.           and I

worked in such a fashion    or how many people we worked upon but it was

quite a long time.

I have to say that in general the people that we treated were cyanosed

to such an extent, and their pupils were so dilated, that it seemed to

me that they had probably not been breathing for some minutes before
                                                                    PAGE   6


we were able to try and helpt them*

I had two Brookes airways in my pocket which were used but proved

useless as they became chocked M/ith vomit very quickly.

I remember that during this period I spoke to a Policewoman and told

her that there was a stretcher in the players tunnel which she should

go and fetch,    I never actually saw her with the stretcher but to my

knowledge the stretcher has gone and not been returned to the club*

When there seemed to be no more that we could do on the pitch, Mr,

      and I ascertained that there were casualties in the Gymnasium.

We made our way off the playing area and round the back of the North

Stand where we came upon a number of casualties laid on hoardings,

most of whom were obviously dead but there was one lad aged about

twelve years in a red shirt (possible a Liverpool Football Club Team

Strip) who did not appear cyanosed.

He was not breathing and there was no pulse so Mr.         and I started

work upon him.   We maintained that task until an ambulance crew took

over and moved him from us.    I would add that there was a lorry

parked between where this lad was laying and the First Aid Room so

that the people in the First Aid Room (which was dealing with a number

of minor casualties at the time) would not have been able to see him

lying there.

Mr        and I then went into the Gymnasium which was divided into two

halves.   One area was laid out with a number of bodies and in th other

area there were probably half a dozen or so casualteis.    These were

already being tended by a number of Doctors and Nurses*I was made

aware that most of the bodies had already been certified

dead by the Doctors who were there.At this stage I was approached by

an officer from the South Yorkshire

Police, PC Cheetham, who asked me to certify one of the victims as

dead, the Officer indicated that I had been attempting resuscitation
                                                                     PAGE         7


on this particular     person*   Because of the number of people that I

dealt with and the circumstances in which this work was carried out I

M>as quite unable to recognise    any particular victim.   As far as I am

aware another Doctor subsequently certified this person as dead.

It appeared that there was nothing further we could do and Mr

was anxious to leave the ground to meet up with his brother from whom

he had become separated in the crush.      I ensured that Mr         had

appropriate directions and then made my way to the Physiotherapy Room

in the south Stand where I found that there were two casualties.           This

surprised me because I thought that all the injured people had been

removed from the ground by that stage.      These people were not

seriously injured and were being looked after by Alan Smith the Club

Physiotherapist.     At the same time that I arrived an Ambulance crew

came in to take them away and there was nothing that I needed to do.

whilst in the Gymnasium I had spoken to a Police Officer M>ho told me

that there were known to be at least 75 dead at that stage.         I went to

report his conversation to the Club Chairman Mr McGee u>ho was in the

Director’s Box.    A short time later I left the football Club with my

wife and returned home.

   Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to thank you
   for your letter of 22 August about the flip-up
   safety barrier. He was grateful to you for
   writing about this. He and his Assessors would
   find it helpful to have further information and
   evidence on this, as you suggest. Perhaps you
   could be kind enough to send further material
   to me at this address.

                        DESCRIPTION FLIP-UP SAFETY BARRIER.


                 The Flip-Up Safety Barrier Is designed to give an automatic and Immediate escape
route when a crowd of people are pressed against any section along the barrier frame, whether
It be In the centre or either end the force required to open the barrier or barriers Is linear.
                  The adjustment of the force required to open any one Flip-Up barrier Is simple
requiring only simple tools. The barriers can be tested by using a special yoke attached to specifier!
sections of the barrier frame and coupled to a heavy duty spring weighing unit which isattached
to a tractor. The tension on the safety release should be at the minimum adjustment and gradually
 Increase the tension until you can hold the barrier between 400 and 500 Kg. The tractor should
 make a steady pull, avoid Jerking.
                  The safety barrier consists of a rectangular ’portal' section constructed of square
 and rectangular steel tubing forming a frame to carry the Flip-Up barrier which is suspended from
 the top of the 'portal' frame.
                  As It Is Important that the fllp-up section has maximum rigidity with a minimum
 of weight at the bottom end.lt Is constructed with a section at the top of the frame where weight
 Is not Important. This beam section Is built at 90 deg. to the fllp-up frame and allows for vertical
 stays to stabilize the lower region without adding too much weight to the bottom end of the flip-up
 frame.
                  The construction of the beam section also provides suitable arms for attaching
  the laminated     leaf springs which create the force to swing the fllp-up barrier up. A six metre
  barrier requires four springs mounted at Intervals along the top of the portal frame. The bottom
  of the fllp-up frame Is locked at Intervals along Its length by cams or arms attached to a transv^^
  shaft controlled by a lever attached to one end of the shaft.
                  A control box mounted on one of the vertical portal pillars Is fitted with a mechanic-!1
  safety release to which Is locked the control lever. The safety release can also be operated by
  Etfi electro/magnetic actuator which Is operated by,a remote Telp/Command by an ’ In-Field' official.
                 Attached to the barrier frame and the pillar mount, are two small hydraulic cylinders,
which control the upward swing of the barrier, when released. They also check that the barriers
w ill not return to the ground, until the valve Is turned. Two men are required to close a ban let
and lock It Into place.
                 The basic locking of a barrier consists of a chassis fitted below ground level,
which has a shaft running the length of the barrier, and mounted on suitable bearings. Attached
to this shaft are cams, or arms, at two metre intervals along the barrier, and at one end a strong
 lever, 70cm long, controls the locking when held by a spring loaded notched arm. and is releasrd
only by excessive pressure on the barrier (by a crowd), which w ill automatically release it;
or by a controlled signal from an electric activated release or Tele/Command signal.
                 The Control Box and lever are protected from the public by the panels mounted
on the outside, between the two portal pillars of each barrier. The control box houses the locking
and safety release adjustment, and has provision to mount an electro/magnetic actuator, a 12
volt battery, a Tele/Command receiver and associated components, and Ant.
                 The mechanical locking chassis Is a completely assembled module, and Is designed
to fit below ground level, to each mounting pillar.
                 The safety release Is a spring loaded notched arm, which holds the cam locking
lever. The notched arm can be loaded according to the prescribed release force. The adjustment
can be as low as 300kg or as high as 1.000kg.
                 All Flip-Up Safety Barriers are supplied In units of six or nine metres, to suit
an Installation plan. A three metre long static barrier Is available which can be fitted between
two adjacent barriers, where they change direction and make a short angle, which may cause
them to touch.
            * FLIP-UP GATE.
        /                   A hydraulic 'Flip-Up Gate’ Is available for entrance or exit on Sports g ro u n d s
             for emergency Services, Official cars, (or the public In an emergency).
                            The necessity for emergency services and official cars to enter or leave the gro»jnd%
             without gate delays or obstructions Is Important.
                            The 'Flip-Up Gate’ can be opened and closed by a hand held coded Commrtnd,
             or a key switch by the gate. It can be opened and closed In less than ten seconds with
             hydraulic power from a hydraulic accumulator, which maintains stored energy even if the electric
             power has been cut. A small electric/hydraulic pump, keeps the accumulator fully charged.
                               When a command Is made to open the gate, the lower section (or panel) Is swing
              upwards, followed by the main gate frame. The action of swinging the bottom section of tho
              gate, up; re<fcjces the arch of the main gate frame. This allows vehicles to stop within 2 metres
              of the gate, without Interference.

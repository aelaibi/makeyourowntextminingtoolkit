SUMMARY

This Circular summarises and updates advice and practice about the control and use o f
ambulance transport.

GENERAL

1.     Section 3(1)(c) o f th e N ational Health Service A ct 1977 places a d u ty on th e S ecretary of S tate to
provide a m b u lan c e services to such e x t e n t as h e considers necessary to m eet all reasonable requirem ents. This
d u ty has been devolved to A rea H ealth A uthoritie s e x c e p t in m e tro p o lita n counties w here th e provision of
am bulance services is th e direc t responsibility of Regional Health A uthoritie s; S o u th West T ham es RH A is
adm inistratively responsible f o r th e L o n d o n A m bulan ce Service.

2.       A m b u la n c e services are req u ired to provide or arrange th e provision o f suitable tra n sp o rt, fre e o f charge,
norm ally t o th e nearest hospital o r tr e a tm e n t centre w ith hospital based facilities w here th e necessary
tr e a tm e n t car. be o b ta in e d , to NHS convalescent ho m e s, dentists' surgeries or Artificial Limb Appliance and
A ssessm ent C entres f o r any p a tie n t (em ergency or non-emergency) w h o is considered by a d o c to r, dentist* or
m idw ife* to b e m edically u n f it to travel by o th e r m eans (see also paragraph 4). It may also be ap propriate to
provide tr a n s p o r t for th e p e r m a n e n t removal o f patients from o n e address to a n o th e r. A m b u la n ce tran sp o rt
should n o t be provided fo r p atien ts w h o se medical c o ndition does n o t prevent th e m fro m travelling by other
means ie o n fo o t, by public or private tr a n s p o r t (either their ow n tra n sp o rt or t r a n s p o r t provided by relatives,
friends or vo lu n tary services). Nor sh o u ld it be used to convey a person on holiday or o n recreational journeys
w here th e need is based o n social or e c o n o m ic grounds rather th a n medical (other th a n jo u rn ey s made under
jo in t tra n s p o r t arrangem ents - see paragraphs 5 and 27). T ra n sp o rt should n o t be provided for patients merely
because th e y c a n n o t afford public tr a n s p o r t fares (see also paragraph 30).

3.        Responsibility for d eterm inin g w hich tr e a tm e n t centre is m o st appropriate fo r each p a tie n t for w h o m
am bulance tr a n s p o r t is o rd ered rests w ith th e d o c to r, d entist o r m idwife concerned, b u t bearing in m ind the
high cost o f tr a n s p o r t p ractitioners s h o u ld , as far as is practicable, ask th e service to convey a p atient to the
nearest suitable hospital or ce ntre. W here a p a tie n t is travelling to a d istan t hospital for prolonged out-patient
t r e a tm e n t eg p h y sio th e ra p y , careful con sideration should be given t o th e possibility of arranging for this to be
provided at a suitable hospital nearer th e p atie n t's hom e.

At a meeting held at the South Yorkshire Police Headquarters, Rotherham
on 12 August 1986. Present Inspector Mrs Wood, Inspector Cook, South
Yorkshire Police, ADO Reilly, Station Officer Housecroft, South
Yorkshire Fire Service, Station Officer Aston, Station Officer Horner,
SYMAS.

It was agreed that from SYMAS the initial response will be one vehicle
to the front gate by turnstiles 1 - 5 .

Other vehicles will park on Armour Street.

Vehicles will preceed to Millmoor or Armour Street via Moorgate Road,
Alma Road, Canklow Road, Old Sheffield Road, Sheffield Road and
Centenary Way. They will return to Rotherham District General Hospital
by the same route.

The entrance to the forecourt at Millmoor would be kept free of Fire
Service vehicles and Police vehicles to allow access and egress for
Ambulances. Ambulances would stay in the holding (parking) area until
the vehicle being loaded was ready to leave. This would ensure only
one Ambulance being on the forecourt at any one time.

The small passageway between Coronation Bridge^and the Terraces will be
kept clear of spectators etc for Fire and Ambulance Service use.
EVACUATION PLAN - MILLMOOR FOOTBALL GROUND


Millmoor Football Ground is situated at Masborough Street,
Rotherham.

It is the home of Rotherham United Football Club.

The Club Secretary is                      His telephone number
is

The Chief Steward is                                    Rotherham.

The ground capacity is 17,913.

A map of the ground and surrounding area is attached as
Appendix A.


Geography of the Ground

The. ground frontage is on Masbro' Street where turnstiles
1-5, 6-9, 10-13, 14-17, 18-22, 23-27 are situated from right
to left when entering the ground, together w i t h the entrance
for Directors, Players and Officials which is below the
General Office.   Five sets of large wooden double gates are
set into the frontage between the blocks of t u r n s t i l e s . All
gates are manned by stewards on match days and open o u t w a r d s .
They are unlocked prior to the crowd entering the ground and
are opened by swivelling a centre bar to the upright position

Turnstiles 1-9 give access to the terrace and main grandstand
to the right of the ground when entering.  Turnstiles 10-27
give access to the Tivoli Terrace and the left of the ground.


The Tivoli Terrace

The Tivoli Terrace is a covered terrace which is immediately
inside the front of the ground and which extends the w i d t h of
the ground from right to left.   It is of concrete and asbestos
construction and is not- considered a fire risk.  It is kept
solely for use by the home supporters (mainly young and
teenage) and accommodates 6034 standing fans.

Policing of the Tivoli Terrace is by Serial 5 and in the main
the same officers are present for all home matches.  The
relationship between police and fans is good and control of the
supporters in this area of the ground is excellent.


The Railway End Terrace

The Railway End Terrace is at the opposite end of the ground
to the Tivoli Terrace.   It is a covered area constructed of
asbestos and concrete and again poses no threat of fire.
The terrace is shallow and therefore the risk of crushing is
minimal.  This terrace accommodates the visit ing fans and is



                             \0
 totally caged to prevent infiltration of the adjoin-ing sides
 of the ground.  The Railway Terrace holds 5768 standing fans.

 Access is via Millmoor Ldne and in particular, turnstiles
 29-30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36 and 37.     Egress is by way of a
 large wooden double gate wh i c h opens onto Millmoor Lane,
 allowing fans to turn right without restriction to where
 vis iting coaches are parked at the rear of the railway end
 perimeter fence.   Such coaches and fans leave the area via
 Armer Street onto the inner bypass - (Centenary Way), without
 coming into conflict with the home fans.

 The gate is manned by a regular steward on m atch days. Visiting
 supporters wishing to turn left into Millmoor Lane are c o n ­
 trolled by Mounted Branch Police Officers to prevent the two
 sets of fans coming into conflict at the point where Millmoor
 Lane joins Masbro' Street.  It is generally visiting fans
 travelling by rail who have to turn left into Millmoor Lane.

 The Millmoor Lane side of the ground is the left side when
 entering from the front and is split into three seperate
 areas.

 The Spion K o p .

 The Home T e r r a c e .

 The Visitors'      Terrace.

The Spion Kop is an open terrace of concrete construction
and is used by the home supporters.  It is an extension of
the Tivoli Terrace and accommodates standing fans.  It extends
about a third of the way along the length of the ground
towards the railway end and is parallel to Millmoor Lane. There
is no fire risk in this section of the ground and due to the
gentle slope of the terracing little chance of serious crushing.

Access to this part of the ground is via turnstiles 14-27 at
the front of the ground.   Egress is by two of the wooden gates
in the frontage wall.


The Home Terrace

This is a continuation of the Spion Kop and is a covered area
w h i c h seats 748 fans. There is no standing facility in this
part of the ground and little risk of fire, the fabric of the
covered area being asbestos roofing on a concrete base with a
metal superstructure.

Access is by transfer from the Kop and via turnstile 28 in
Millmoor Lane. Egress is by way of the Spion Kop and also a
double gate into Millmoor Lane.


The Visitors'      Terrace

Is for the visiting supporters and is identical to the Home
Terrace.  It holds 1288 seated supporters.  Access is via
turnstiles 29-37 and transfer from the Railway End Terrace.

Egress is identical to that of the Railway End Terrace.
The Grand Stand and Main Terrace

The Main Terrace is at the right hand side of the ground
when entering from thte front of the stadium.  It extends
from the Tivoli Terrace to the pass ageway which gives the
players and officials access to the playing pitch (players
tunnel).  The terrace holds 2704 standing supporters who are
in the main home supporters.   The terracing abutts the playing
area and the Grand Stand# is of concrete construction and
slopes gently   to the pitch.  There is no fire risk and only
minimal chance of serious crushing.   Gates are built in to the
playing pitc h perimeter wall to give access to the playing
area from the Main Terrace.


The Grand Stand

This is a wooden stand and is considered the main area of
danger within the football ground.     Whilst it has undergone
much fire prevention - by treatment with chemicals, lining
w i t h asbestos and other improvements, there is little doubt
that this is the area giving concern for safety.     Fire
extinguishers are placed in the following locations

2   fire extinguishers in each of the bars below the stand.

2 fire extinguishers on the mezanine floor alongside the
main girders at the back of the stand.

The stand is all seating and holds 1371.  It is quite steep
and is constructed high above the ground level. Supporters
of both favours use this stand.

There is no void beneath the wooden floor and no gaps in the
floorboards.  The underneath of the Grand Stand is open and
contains the various bars, changing rooms, toilets and
laundry facilities.  Access is through the front of the ground
- turnstiles 1-9,along the passageway at the rear of the
Main Terrace and through a mezanine floor down steps into the
bar area before similar steps into the Grandstand.

Egress from the stand in normal times is by w a y of the same
steps.  However, in the event of an emergency the stand would
be vacated through the egress gates which are built into the
front apron of the stand and which have steps leading down
onto the main t e r r a c e .

The Grandstand is fitted with a fire alarm which operates
   illuminated and audible warning system in the police control
room and a 'sprinkler' system.

Both are regularly tested and maintained by Lillekers of
Rotherham.  Fire extinguishers -are situated throughout the
stand and are clearly identified.   They are regularly checked
by the fire brigade.

The bars below operate on a registration Certificate and are
in use just prior to the start of the game, during the half
time interval and immediately following the full time whistle.

Regular staff are employed.       Members and their guests are
allowed a c c e s s . Evacuation of the bars would be through the
players'   tunnel onto the field of play.

Evacuation of the Main Stand and bars would take six minutes
at the outside.  The fire brigade have allowed eight minutes
for evacuation.


Public Address

The football ground has a modern public address system to
speakers on the floodlight pylons at all sides of the ground.
In normal times the system is operated by the disc jockey
from the kiosk situated above the players' tunnel.          The
system is such that a 'cut out' f a c i l i t y ,situated in the
police control box, can be operated and the p ub lic address
immediately taken over by the Police Superintendent in
charge of policing the game.


The Police Control Room

The Police Control Room is a brick building w i t h glass
windows giving vision to all parts of the ground.        It is
elevated at the back of the Railway Terrace extension on the
far right hand side of the ground when entering from the
front of the stadium, adjacent to the players' tunnel and
the disc jockey's kiosk.     It has a telephone facility connecting
w i t h the Detention Room below.   The telephone, is an internal
line from the Main Street Police Station number 2207.        It has
a facility for outside calls.     An independent police radio
control system is in use from the Police Control Room,
connecting the ground with Divisional Control Room Main Street
and Force Control Room Sheffield Headquarters.

The Detention Room is situated immediately be l o w the Police
Control Room and also has a telephone facility for outside
calls   Prisoners are kept in the Detention Room until
processed and then taken to Rotherham Divisional Headquarters
Main Street for charging and bail.


St.   John Ambulance

The St. John Ambulance Department operate w i t h i n the football
ground from various sites around the perimeter of the pl aying
area.  All are uniformed and readily identifiable.       The
organisation have a First Aid ambulance post of brick
construction in the left hand corner of the ground when
entering from the front of the stadium.  The post is situated
between the Railway Stand Terrace and Millmoor Lane and is
manned on match days.  An ambulance is in attendance t h r o u g h ­
out the game.

Egress from the First Aid/Ambulance post is v ia the double
gates in Millmoor Lane, Millmoor Lane, Masborough Street to
Centenary Way.
  Evacuation Plan

  Due to the construction of the football stadium it is
  considered that any emergency evacuation would be as a
  resuit of fire or bomb hoax call.      in the event of fire
  1 k -1 v            such would be confined to the main stand
  w h i c h is of wooden construction, therefore, evacuation has
 'been planned with this in mind.

 Should fire be indicated on the fire control panel in the
 Police Control Room or be established by the police, the
 Police Controller would be made aware immediately.  Similarly
 the Superintendent in charge of the football match policing
 wou ld be informed.                                       y

 The Police Controller will cut into the public address system
 and pass the coded m e s s a g e :-

       "THE ATTENDANCE OF MR M E A D O W S IS URGENTLY REQUIRED
        AT POLICE C O N T R O L ^                        — ----

 The officer at the players' entrance would go into the field
 of play and inform the referee.         The Police Officers on the
 p i t c h perimeter wo u l d immediately open the gates in the
 perimeter wall allowing the fans on the terrace in front of the
 main stand to clear the terrace onto the playing area.
 Simultaneously the stewards on the double wooden gates at the
 ground frontage and Millmoor Lane would open the gates to allow
 egress.

 The gates in the perimeter wall in front of the Tivoli Terrace
 wo u l d be opened by the police officers in Serial 1 to allow the
 public to leave the field of pla y thorugh the Tivoli Terrace
 and into Masbrough S t r e e t .

The egress gates in the apron to the Grand Stand would be
opened and the crowd in the stand expelled from the stand
onto the terrace and onto the pitch, leaving the same via
the Tivoli Terrace and out into M a sbrough Street.

The people under the stand would be directed by the stewards
onto the playing area via the players' tunnel.

The Railway Terrace would be cleared into Millmoor Lane and
p eople in the Kop, Millmoor Terrace and the Millmoor
Visitors Terrace w o u l d leave via Millmoor Lane and through the
Tivoli Terrace extension.

The Police Control would inform C Division Control Room of
the emergency, requesting Fire and Ambulance.

Force Control would be informed of the evacuation.

The Superintendent in charge of polici ng the ground will direct

within Sports areas, I have decided to delegate one of my            "he  e
specific task of liaison with the Football Clubs within the South Yorkshire
b o u n d ar i e s.

This Officer »ill have the task to ensure that advice and, if necessary,
1-rainine can be provided by this Service to members of your staff,
to be his responsibility to ensure that the South Yorkshire Metropo 1 an
Ambulance Service are totally aware of the geography of y°ur ^ ° u n d and   J
Incident Plans which you may have drawn up in order to ensure the safety of the
general public.

Obviously    in order for this task to be successful it is necessary for you to
^rrint i n ’orinciple  our involvement and I should be grateful if you would
consider this proposal and communicate with me when you have made a decision.

 I will ensure that if you require a visit or any form of advice associated to
 t h i s suggesrion an Officer will be made available to meet with you or your

 I look forward to hearing from you with any comments you may wish to make.

         EVACUATION OF SPORTS STADIA
         I have pleasure                     in            enclosing a copy of Appendix ‘L 1                                            of our Force Standing Order
         on the policing                     of            football matches.   You will see                                             that it incorporates most of
         the points made                     by            Mr. Justice Popplewell following                                             the Bradford Fire.
         I hope that you can find the time to read through the Appendix prior to our
         meeting at Bramall Lane at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday 10 July 1986, as obviously it
         will assist our deliberations and hopefully, agreement, in respect of crowd safety
         during the forthcoming football season.
         I look forward to. meeting you on Thursday but if there is any point on which you
         require further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact myself or
                   Godwin at West

Dear Mr Chester

Following your recent telephone conversation with Mr Wilkinson on 28th July 1986
in regard to your Club supplying passes for Officers from the South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service, I am submitting the following information for
you to discuss with your fellow directors.

On the 16th July 1986 Mr Wilkinson visited your Club along with two other Officers
from the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and Sergeant
of South Yorkshire Police. The meeting was held with Mr         Senior Groundsman.
After touring your complex and discussing evacuation plans with South Yorkshire
Police, it was felt that the Ambulance Service would normally only become involved
in any events after they had already occurred and therefore, slight delays could
be experienced on occasions in responding to the incident. To avoid this I would
ask if two passes could be supplied to the Ambulance Service which would enable
us to ensure that an Ambulance Officer was in your ground at all home fixtures.

There would be no cost to the Club for this facility, and it would improve ground
safety. In the event of any untoward occurrence my Officers would be in a position
to identify problems prior to them happening and would therefore be in a much
better position to respond to any emergency.

If you require any further information then please do nothesitate to contact
Mr           on Rotherham        extension 259, who will ask one of our
Offciers responsible for the safety of your ground to contact you.

Dear Sir,

Do you provide the best standards of Ambulance Care for the large number of
Employees and Members of the Public whilst they are on your premises?

Major Sporting Events have always relied heavily on the resources which are
provided by the Voluntary First Aid Organisations.

We acknowledge the very valuable contribution which the St John Ambulance
and British Red Cross Society make. There are, however, areas where the
level of care which we can provide, of necessity, exceed those which can be
provided by the Voluntary Societies. These include Advanced Ambulance Aid,
Treatment   of   Fractures  with  the most     modern  equipment   available
(particularly Spinal Injuries), Stabilisation of patients with Head
Injuries,    Intubation,   Intravenous    Infusion,   Cardiac    Monitoring,
Defibrillation and the Administration of Drugs.

Can we be of assistance to you ? If so, get in touch with                                           on
Rotherham (0709) f     to discuss your requirements.

If we can't help with your immediate requirements, please place this letter
on file for any future occasion when we may be able to assist.

I am sure that you will be more than happy with any the facilities which we
are able to offer.

Yours faithfully,




A. Page.

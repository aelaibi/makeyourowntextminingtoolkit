              for them.           This a s s u m pt io n      proved       correct and by 3 p.m.                     about 500

REPORT
Inspector C W Calvert, HQ - Discipline

On 15 April 1989 I came on duty at Sheffield Wednesday football ground at
9.30 am and attended briefing. I was responsible for two serials on the
Spion Kop. Following briefing and refreshments I took both serials onto
the Spion Kop terraces at about 11 am and briefed them. I also briefed the
stewards allocated to the Spion Kop at about 11.30 am. The turnstiles opened
at about this time.

It had been anticipated that Liverpool supporters would enter the Spion Kop
with tickets allocated to Notts Forest fans. To contain them an area
adjacent to the North Stand had been set aside for them. This assumption
proved correct and by 3 pm about 500 Liverpool supporters were in the area
under close police supervision. The majority were not, from their accounts,
from Merseyside. Those from Merseyside numbered 200 + - some said they had
obtained tickets from friends in Nottingham, others said from touts both
in Liverpool and around the ground.

Drink in excess was evident in a considerable number of supporters, both
Liverpool and Notts Forest. This included those in a drunken condition and
in possession of drink. The extent was such that I gave instructions that
only those in an extreme state would be arrested in order not to deplete
manpower.

At about 2.45 pm it became apparent there was a fault on the radio.
Transmissions from control were becoming broken, although still audible.
I informed control of this.

I was on the Spion Kop at 3 pm with the serials I had detailed to supervise
the area containing the Liverpool supporters. An apparent piteh invasion
shortly after kick off created a situation which incensed the Notts Forest
fans and the actions of some of them towards the Liverpool group of
supporters suggested there would be a public disorder situation on the Kop.
I therefore remained at this location with my serials until the ground
cleared. I took no part in the events on the Leppings Lane terrace.

Prior to early 1988, I was responsible for several years (9) for police
liaison in connection with policing at Hillsborough. In connection with
this I made various suggestions in regards to the ground - in particular
in respect of the Leppings Lane end of the ground where, due to the
restricted access, problems had been apparent at games with large crowds
of away supporters. This included re-designing the turnstile access and
provision/extension of the public address system to cover the outside of
the turnstiles. I can give further information if required.

 1.   Radio fault - best described as a warbling/clicking - missing out one
      word in three.

 2.   I went to Leppings Lane end of ground with 'C' Div PC and Inspector
      White. PC identified gate (B) he said was opened by a steward - details
      given to C/I Beal.

 3-   In 1984 I (and other officers) realised that after Sheffield Wednesday
      Football Club's return to Div 1 problems were evident at Leppings Lane
      turnstiles due to increase in away fans. I suggested with a rough sketch
      that the whole of Leppings Lane turnstiles - then a crescent shape -
      should be demolished with new ones built parallel to and near rear of
      stand with access to individual pens and to stand. This was discussed
      with then senior officers - Ch/Supt Moseley and Supt Lock - agreed should
      be put to club. Then secretary - Mr Chester - came forward with
      compromise as turnstiles are laid out now - new turnstiles A/G built
        in the light of climate then prevailing on spending at football grounds
      accepted on basis that anything is better than nothing.
      The intention was twofold (1) on the practice then operating to allow
      different sets of supporters into different pens and (2) to give greater
      space at the turnstiles.


1987 Semi Final - Leeds Utd v Coventry

Leeds on Leppings Lane Terraces - played on Sunday with lunchtime kick off.
I was on duty outside the ground before kick off. Despite time numerous
drunks arrived. In planning this match we had, because of Leeds Utd
reputation, gone to great pains to:

(1)   prevent fans arriving without tickets
(2)   taken steps to contain those Leeds fans who arrived without tickets.

In the event there were no problems at Leppings Lane - that end of ground
filled to capacity. The only problem was Coventry Fans arriving late because
of traffic on Ml - kick off time delayed.

To the best of my knowledge there was no pitch invasion.

There was, however, a pitch invasion in 1981 semi final. Spurs v Wolves.
This was caused:
(1) By the Spurs fans purchasing Wolves tickets to the Kop terraces then
     being allowed into Leppings Lane Terrace and

(2)   Late arrival of Spurs fans who rushed onto terrace shortly after kick
      off causing surge.

We took this into account this year and last by ensuring that fans who had
tickes for Kop but were not Notts Forrest fans were not transferred to other
ends of ground so capacity would not be exceeded - were held on area of Kop.

It should be noted that in 1980 semi final Arsenal v Liverpool that capacity
was exceeded by at least 1000 due to forged tickets - no problems
experienced.

^               During     this      period     it became apparent                  that    despite      stewards          tieing

                employed by the               club many were          failing         to do anything            other than

                out their         duty.        It was also appar e n t               that many of the stewards                       had

                no    real     idea what        they should do.                One    of the      problems       on m atch clays

                was     that    the    club had no overall                  mana g e m e n t    of their     stewards.

Inspector Calvert - Headquarters - Discipline &. Complaints

From 1979 to late 1987 I was responsible for liaison and in organisation
of (in consultation with senior officers) police functions at Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club.   Prior to this the task was undertaken on an ad
hoc basis, usually by a shift inspector or sub divisional chief inspector.
Following the publication of the Standing Instructions on policing football
matches I took over the duty of liaison officer.

During this period it became apparent that despite stewards being employed
by the club many were failing to do anything other than attend at the ground
and disappear if problems arose - many failed to wear their tabbards and
others were physically incapable of carrying out their duty. It was also
apparent that many of the stewards had no real idea what they should do.
One of the problems on match days was that the club had no overall management
of their stewards.

In August 1981 I remember that I received a memorandum from then Chief
Superintendent Herold concerning the ineffectiveness of stewards at Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club.

I brought Mr Herold’s comments, and further views of my own, to the attention
of all stewards at a briefing held at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on
22 August 1981. I have continued to stress these points in all the informal
and formal discussions I have held with Stewards and the club since that
time.

The situation improved with the appointment of Mr Lock as security officer
(in I985 I think) who on match days acted as the club’s ’link* man for their
stewards and the subsequent adoption of a personal radio system to maintain
contact with their chief stewards in various areas of the ground.

Over the period I was liaison officer I had frequent and various contact
with club officials - the secretaries usually, when I pointed out problems
with stewarding - this included the clubs responsibilities for spectators
on the terraces as well as in the stands. I am aware this theme was
frequently repeated by senior officers both to the secretaries and the club's
board. I also brought this up with the club's security officer on several
occasions. I gained the impression that the club believed that because,
out of necessity, the police occasionally performed the function of crowd
packing, they had no need to show interest or responsibility for the standing
crowds.

For several years to 1987 I attended the annual meeting of the club stewards,
usually shortly before the start of the season. During the course of my
presentation I outlined what the police function and responsibilities were,
what their duties were in relation to the crowd (including on the terraces)
and what the safety procedures were.

Prior to commencing my briefings - in (1984 or 1985 I think) I obtained a
copy of the club instructions to stewards which was completely inadequate
- giving only information on conditions of service and an outdated evacuation
procedure. I made certain suggestions which were incorporated in new
instructions for stewards. These instructions were circulated at every
annual meeting and explained by club staff.

                During          this       period           it became apparent                       that despite           stewards           being

                out their             duty.             It was also a p p arent                      that many-of           the    stewards              had

                 no    real       idea what               they        should do,,              One    of    Che    pro Diems       on match clays

                 In August            1981          I remember               that      I received a m e m o r a n d u m            from tnen

                Chief S u p e r i n t e n u s n t Hero Id concerning                                  the     ineffectiveness                of

Football      Club     on EE A u g u s t , 1981             (E E Q S 8 1 )*     I have continued to

stress      these    points       in     all    the    informal          and formal discussions                  I     have

held with Stewards and                   the    club s i n c e       that      time,,

The s i t uation       improved          with the a p p o i n t m e n t of Mr. Lock as                 security

officer       (in 1985      I think)         who    on m atch         days actea as the              c l u b ’s

5 I ink'   man for      their      stewards and the                 subsequent a d o p t i o n        of a

personal      radio system to m a i n t a i n                 contact with their              chief, stewards

Over    the   period     I was         liaison officer              I had frequent            and various

contact with         club officials                 the       secretaries           usually;,    when       I pointed

out    problems with stewards                  ■■■•• this     included the           clubs    r e s p o n sibilities

tor spectators          on the terraces as well as                            in the    stands.       I am aware

this theme was          f r equently         repeated          by senior officers.-                I also made

this    comment      to the       club's       security officer                 on several       occasions.              I

gained the       impression that the                  club believed that                  because,      out       of

necessity,       the    police         occa s i o n a l l y    performed the            function of          crowd

packing,      they had no need to show                        interest         or   respons i b i l i t y   for the

standing       crowds.

For    several      years    to    1987       I attended           the annual          meeting     of the

stewards,      usually       shortly before                 the    start       of the season.           During          the

course     of my     p r e s e ntation        I outlined what                 the   police    function and

r e s p o n s ibilities were,           what     their        duties were           i n relation      to the           crowd

(including       on tne      terraces)           and what          the   safety        procedures were.

Prior      to commencing my briefings                          (in 1984 or           1985    I think)        1

and explained          by club staff.

We took this            into account          this year and          last by ensuring           that fans

who    had tickets            for the Kop who were               not Notts.      ?■orsst     fans were      not

they were         held     on segregated area              of Kop.

It should         be noted that            in 198C Semi          Final    Arsenal       v« Liverpool       that

capacity was e x c eeded               on Leppings         Lane     terraces      by at     least    1000 due

               At this meeting            various matters were            discussed       including         the   new

               secondar y     radial       fence 2 m . f r am the       existing    radial      fence,       dividing

               the North from the Central                 pens.

               At this time          it was agreed that           the    gate at the       perimeter         fence

               (number 5) w ould           still    be a v a ilable      for use for eme r g e n c y agress               by

               of the gates.

               I explained that            our    control      of the gate was          only exercised, w h e n the

               gates were          closed to effect           segregation.        If the     gates     in the        radial

               fences      remained       open and fastened         back,    then s e g r e gation was            no

               longer an       issue and a police              presence was       not    required.          This was;

               a l r e a d y our    practice      at the existing         gates    in the      radial       fence — no

On 7 August 1985 I attended a meeting at Hillsborough Football

Ground of the Officers Working Party in relation to Safety in

Sports Grounds.

At this meeting various matters were discussed including the new

secondary radial fence 2m from the existing radial fence, dividing

the North from the Central pens.

At this time it was agreed that the gate at the perimeter fence

(number 5) would still be available for use for emergency egress by

fans.     These would be directed by the police officer who had

control of the gates.

I explained that our control of the gate was only exercised when

the gates were closed to effect segregation. If the gates in the

radial fences remained open and fastened back, then segregation was

no longer an issue and a police presence was not required.         This

was already our practice at the existinggates in the radial        fence

- no objection was made by any person present.
At this time there was no common key and the practice employed was

for gates in radial fences when closed, to be bolted but not

locked.    The introduction of a commen key was to facilitate ease of

access for supervisory police officers and club officials to all

parts of the ground.     The gates in radial fences still remain

closed but not locked on match days when segregation is an issue or

small crowds attend.

            Further to my           previous       reports and s tatements           concerning H i l l s b o r o u g h

            Footba ll    ground,       p a r t i cularly R 55D dated           19 May    1989,    and R55 E dated

            •16 June    1989.

            I gave evidence           to L ord Justice T a y l o r ’s enquiry on 28 June                   1989.

            I have e x a m i n e d 3 items of copy corresp o n d e n c e                from the s ubmissions

            to the enquiry by S h e f f i e l d City Council,                   as followss

            1.       Copy     letter 2 . 5 . 8 5 - SYCC to E a s t w o o d and Partners.

            2.       Letter 8 . 5 . 8 5 - E a s twoods          to SYCC.

            3.   Cop y letter         10.5.85 - SYCC to E a s t w o o d and Partners.

            In      the first       letter     (1) above,        a proposal for new         radial fences,

            mention     is made       of two gates         to be      installed,    and    sec o n d gates     to be

            installed       in existing        fences.

            In the     letter,       item    (2)    this s u g g e s t i o n   is resisted on grounds of

            expense of stewarding.

            In the     letter       item    (3) SYCC say that              "The Police are       prepared to

            concede the        request       for two gates          per    radial   fence".      T here   is a note

            ha n d w r i t t e n on this     copy as followss              "Agreed over the       phone with

            Cl Clive Calvert".

            At this time a c o n s i derable               number     of    changes were    being

            considered by the              club.     The    idea of extra gates           in the     radial    fences
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               R55F

         was only a small              part of the whole.

         The Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     *F* D i v i s i o n at the time was Mr B rian

         Moseley,          who died     in 1986.       He was very          interested       in ground

          improvements,          and    I w ould say that        it was very m uch his               personal

         decis i o n as to what            took    place.     The    extra     radial       fence gates were

         his     idea.       He took     control at the ground on all major matches,                           and

         w o r k e d from the        control      room overlo o k i n g     the L e p pings Lane

         terraces.           He was therefore familiar w i t h the problems                         that arose

         the r e .

          I was      the    liaison officer,         but on most matters                 I would    consult Mr

         Moseley,          and on a q u e s t i o n like this the            police w o u l d      present a

         single       policy,       over w h i c h Mr M o s e l e y was      the    controlling       influence.

         To my       recollection,         I was    contacted by Mr Vaug h a n of SYC C about                   the

          club's      o b j e c t i o n to the    radial    fence gates,           and    I consulted Mr

         Moseley,          before    replying to him that            the     police were w i s h i n g to

          concede this          point.      There were       other    requests w h i c h were          thought       to

         have greater           priority.

         The     reason for o r i g i n a l l y     requesting gates           to be       installed       lower down

         the terrace,          adjacent      to the     perimeter       fence,       was two fold.          First to

         a l l o w better access           by the     police to the front of the terraces                      to

         sort out          crowd trouble?         second,    to a l l o w    easier m o v ement       of

          spectator b e t w e e n       pens.      In my o p i n i o n the first of these two

          reasons was most             important to the         police at that time.

              Further to my previous reports and statements concerning Hillsborough

              Football ground, particularly R55D dated 19 May 1989, and R55E dated 16

              June 1989.

              I gave evidence to Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry on 28 June 1989.

              I have examined 3 items of copy correspondence frcm the submissionto the

              enquiry by Sheffield City Council, as follows :

              1.      Copy letter 2.5.85 -                                   SYCC to Eastwood and Partners

              2.      Letter 8.5.85 - Eastwoods to SYCC

              3.      Copy letter 10.5.85 -                                      SYCC to Eastwood and Partners.

              In the first letter (1) above, a proposal for new radial fences, mention

              is made of two gates to be installed, and second gates to be installed in

              existing fences.

              In the letter, item (2) this suggestion is resisted on grounds of expense

              of stewarding.

              In the letter, .item (3) SYCC say that "the Police are prepared toconcede

                                          STATEMENT OF WITNESS                - 2 -

                         (CJ Act, 1967, s.9: MC Act, 1980, s.102: MC Rules, 1981, r.70)


        Continuation of statement of       CLIVE CALVERT

        the request        for two gatesper radial fence."             There is a note handwritten

        on this copy as follows : "Agreed over the phone with Cl Clive Calvert."

        At this time a considerable number of changes were being considered by the

        club.        The idea of extra gates in the radial fences was only a small part

        of the whole.

        The Chief Superintendent 'F' Division at this time was Mr Brian Moseley,

        who died in 1986.          He was very interested in ground improvements, and I

        would say that it was very much his personal decision as to what took

        place.        The extra radial fence gates were his idea.              He took control at

        the ground          on all major matches, and worked from the control rocm

        overlooking        the Leppings Lane Terraces.            He was therefore familiar with

        the problems that arose there.

        I was the Liaison Officer, but on most matters I would consult Mr Moseley,

        and on a question like this the Police would present a single policy, over

        which Mr Moseley was the controlling influence.

        To my recollection, I was contacted by Mr Vaughan of SYCC about the club's

        objection to the radial fence gates, and I consulted Mr Moseley, before

        replying to him that the Police were willing to concede this point.                   There

        were other requests which were thought to have greater priority.

        The reason for originally requesting gates to be installed lower down the

        terrace, adjacent to the perimeter fence, was two fold.                       First to allow

        better access by the Police to the front of the terraces to sort out crowd

        trouble;       second, to allow easier movement of spectators between pens.               In

        my opinion the first of these two reasons was most important to the Police

        at that time.

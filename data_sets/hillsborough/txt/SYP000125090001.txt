 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

  INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE BOBBIES WHO WERE DOWN BY THE GOAL ALREADY WERE GREAT HELPING OUT THE FANS

 T(jjjjjjiET OVER THE FENCE AND TREATING THEM A BIT ETC., BUT A BIG LINE OF BOBBIES

 WERE ACROSS THE HALF-WAY LINE AND ANOTHER LINE IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND.

 THEN A 3RD LINE APPEARED WITH DOGS IN FRONT OF THE FOREST FANS. ONE OR TWO DID
 HELP SOMEONE BRIEFLY, THEN GOT BACK IN LINE. IT WAS OBVIOUS                         THEYHAD BEEN TOLD

 TO STAY THERE AND NOT GET INVOLVED.                THE LINE IN THE          MIDDLE HADTOOPEN    TO LET

  THE MAKE-SHIFT STRETCHERS THROUGH SO THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN PEOPLE WERE INJURED.

 THE USE OF THE TANNOY SYSTEM WAS PATHETIC AND COULD HAVE BEEN USED TO CONTROL

 EVERYONE BETTER AND INFORM PEOPLE MORE.

      IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

  VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

  LAST YEAR THERE WERE A LOAD OF FOOT BOBBIES CHECKING TICKETS OUTSIDE THE
,/T

  EXTERIOR GATES, INSTEAD OF LETTING YOU FIGHT FOR A TURNSTILE.

  THIS DISASTER COULD WELL HAVE HAPPENED LAST YEAR. THE ONLY MAIN DIFFERENCE

  WAS THE SIDE GATE WASN’T OPENED LAST YEAR SO THERE WAS NO SURGE ONTO THE

  TERRACES.

Q52

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

THE ASSAULT ON THE POLICE INSPECTOR.

AFTER THE AMBULANCE HAD BEEN DRIVEN ONTO THE PITCH I SAW A LINE. OF POLICE

OFFICERS MARCHING ON ALONG THE TOUCHLINE TOWARDS THE LIVERPOOL E N D , THE

PERSONS SEATED AROUND ME AND MYSELF APPLAUDED BECAUSE WE THOUGHT THAT THE

POLICE WERE GOING TO HELP AT THE FAR END. SOMEONE COMMENTED AT LAST WE CAN GET

THE GROUND CLEARED,       INJURED PEOPLE CAN BE ATTENDED TO. AT THAT TIME WE HAD NO

IDEA PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED.

WHEN THE POLICE GOT TO THE HALFWAY LINE THEY HALTED AND TURNED TO FACE THE

      PLE IN THE NORTH STANDS, THEN THEY WERE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER COLUMN, WHO

K     MED TWO ABREAST ACROSS THE PITCH BY THE CENTRE LINE.

THERE WAS AN OUTBURST OF TREMENDOUS ANGER,       I DIDN’T THINK I HAVE EVER SEEN IT

AS BAD BEFORE THE CROWD WERE INCENSED, THEY FELT THAT THE POLICE WERE TAKING
                                                                       UFA           bU

WHAT LOOKED LIKE A BIG M A N ,                                   iUMPED ONTO THE PITCH
'                    --
FROM THE SEATS SEIZED HOLD OF THE POLICEMAN WEARING A FLAT CAP.              I THINK HE

WAS THE INSPECTOR THE MAN THEN POINTED TOWARDS THE LEP PINGS LANE END AND WAS

OBVIOUSLY SCREAMING TO TAKE HIS MEN AND HELP.

THREE POLICEMEN CAME TO RESTRAIN HIM AND AS THEY PULLED HIM AWAY HE SEEMED TO

      OW A PUNCH AT THE INSPECTOR.    THE THREE POLICE OFFICERS MARKED HIM DOWN

THE TOUCHLINE AND THEN THEY RELEASED HIM PUSHED HIM BACK INTO THE CROWD.                  THE

PEOPLE IN THE CROWD CHEERED THE POLICEMEN WHEN THEY DID IT.

AT THIS JUNCTURE I FELT THAT POLICE DISCIPLINE BROKE DOWN, AND IF I MIGHT SAY

TO A GOOD THING TOO IN SO FAR AS MANY POLICE OFFICER CONSTABLES, DESERTED THE

LINES AND WENT TO HELP THE INJURED REALLY^OjJT OF COMMON HUMANITY I THINK.

COMMUNICATION

THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION GIVEN OUT BY ANYONE I SPOKE TO THE NOTTINGHAM

SUPPORTERS IN THE KOP I MOVED TO THAT AREA.         THEY WERE TOTALLY UNAWARE ABOUT

WHAT WAS GOING ON AT THE OTHER END OF THE GROUND.




                                                                                                 J

 THERE WAS A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCMENT ABOUT 10 MINS AFTER THE SURGE IN PENS 3 +

 4 STATING "THOSE SPECTATORS ON THE PITCH, WILL THEY GET OFF SO THAT WE CAN

 START THE GAME" SOMETHING VERY CLOSE TO THAT, AND THAT INCENSED THE CROWD.

 I THINK THAT COMMUNICATIONS COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1 ) I FEEL THERE WAS A SAD LACK OF AWARENESS BY & B t? IC E /MEDICAL

 SERVICES OF THE ENORMITY OF THE DISASTER              HE POLICE

WERE SLOW TO REACT AND ALLEVIATE TbHS: PROBLEM. I CAN UNDERSTAND

 THE FEELING INITIALLY THAT     iT’WAS A PITCH INVASION.

 2) MY OVER-RIDING IMPR£8S>I0N IS ONE OF TOTAL MISMANAGEMENT

       START TO FIN]    BY POLICE & STEWARDS.


G15

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT Y#U WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAy' INQUIRY?

 •1) DESIGN OF GROUND A S FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED.     THE ENTRANCE

 PARTICULARLY SO FQfC VISITORS TO A SEMI FINAL FIXTURE. ITS

 NOT RIGHT TO EXPECT 23,500 SUPPORTERS TO       CONVERGE IN SUCH

A CONFINED AREA. (LEPPINGS LANE END). THAT MUST BE CHANGED

 TO ALLOW BETTER ACCESS.
                                                                                   PAGE      9
                                                                                   G S L3532

 2) I I7EEL THE SEGREGATION OF TERR AC ING J ^ C R IM INAL.

 3) THE GOVERNMENT MUST FIND FUNDS F^^SPORT ESPECIALLY SOCCER

 TO IMPROVE SAFETY. PERIMETER F E E I N G MAY WELL BE NECESSARY BUT

 NOT IN ITS PRESENT FORM (ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED AS IN FRANCE

 PERHAPS).

 4.   I FEEL I.D.CARD SYSTEM WILL ONLY CAUSE PROBLEMS, WITH CROWD

 CONTROL.

 3. IMPROVED DIRECTIONS               IDE TERRACING LEPPINGS LANE.

 6.   THE POLICE CQftflfl&L ROOM DID NOT DO THEIR JOSS.        THEY FAILED TO DO

 THEIR JOBS AND ALLEVIATE PROBLEM IN TEFJft*?tflNG.

 7 ^ WHEN POLICE & DOGS LINED UP M & N G FRONT OF NORTH STAND I FEEL THIS

WAS INTIMIDATING.

 S.   ^ALTERNATIVE TRAFFIC ROUTES SHOULD BE ADVISED BY POLICE ON OCCASIONS

SUCH AS THIS AND WELL PUBLICISED.

 9.   KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

 10. AT OLD TRAFFORD 7 MAY 89 (070589) THERE WERE OBVIOUS TRAFFIC PROBLEMS

 AT END OF M62.   THIS WAS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF LACK OF PRE-PLANNING & THOUGH

FOR FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS TRAVELLING TO GROUND.             ALTERNATIVE ROUTES SHOULD

 AGAIN HAVE BEEN ADVISED.

 •1^ WHEN WE ARRIVED AT GROUND POLICE WERE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO ENTER

 GROUND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE OBVIOUSLY SESRE THAT THERE WOULD BE MORE

 PEOPLE TO COME AND NOT SUFFICIENT POLICE TO DEAL WITH A BUILD U P .

  IN THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH COULD HAVE DONE MORE.          OTHER POLICE WERE DOING THEIR

  B jg f r   TRYING TO RIP THE PERIMETER FENCE OPEN.

, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH          YOU FEEL IS

  VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?
  1) THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS. LIVERPOOL HHAVE A FAR BIGGER AVERAGE ATTENDANCE.

  GROUND THROUGH THE ONE GATE.

  SUPERIOR.

ABYSMAL.    THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN ELEMENT OF PRIORITY TO GET THE FANS TO

 THE GROUND AND TRAFFIC DELAYS AT LIGHTS AND ROUNDABOUTS COULD HAVE BEEN

^|IDED.     I HAVE BEEN IN CROWDS OF BETWEEN 50 AND 70,000 PEOPLE, NEVER BEFORE

HAVE I SEEN SUCH UNBELIEVABLE DISORGANISATION AND CHAOS IN THE LEPPINGS LANE

 THE LATERAL BARS IIM THE 2 CENTRE PENS PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM GETTING ACROSS

 INTO THE EMPTIER PENS.

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 4.45 PM (1645). ON LEAVING THE GROUND I SAW BODIES BEING CARRIED OFF

 ON MAKESHIFT STRETCHERS.    UNDERNEATH THE NORTH STAND THERE ARE LOTS OF LITTLE

 COFFEE BARS - THESE WERE BEING CLOSED - WHICH WAS A SHAME WHEN PEOPLE WERE IN

 SHOCK AND NEEDED A DRINK BUT I DON’T THINK THE COFFEE BAR PEOPLE KNEW WHAT

 HAD HAPPENED.

       YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 G52

 NO.

 G53

 D ^ T O U HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 FIRST IMPRESSION WHEN EVERYONE CAME ONTO THE PITCH WAS IT WAS CROWD SPILLAGE,
 SO DELAY IN RESPONDING WAS UNDERSTANDABLE FOR THE FIRST FEW MINUTES BUT THEN

 THINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER/ORGANISED.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY.

 1. WHY DID ALMOST 10,000 PEOPLE HAVE TO GO INTO THE NORTH STAND VIA LEPPINGS

 LANE PUTTING EXTRA PRESSURE ON THE POLICE AND THE TURNSTILES?    THE NORTH

 STAND TICKET HOLDERS COULD HAVE ENTERED VIA TURNSTILES IN PENISTONE ROAD.       I
                                                                           PAGE       9

 SUPPOSE IT WORKED LAST YEAR SO THEY USED THE SYSTEM AGAIN, AS FAR AS I’M

 CONCERNED IT SEEMED TO WORK LAST YEAR, WHY NOT THIS YEAR?     ALLOCATION OF

 TICKETS WAS MISHANDLED„                             ^

 WHY WASN'T THERE COMMUNICATION INSIDE AND O U T ^ D E THE GROUND WHEN THOSE PENS

 WERE FILLING UP AND HAD THE KICK OFF DELAYED?

 SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER CONTROL ON MAIi>/GATES BEFORE KICK OFF,

 WHY DIDN’T VIDEO CAMERAS PICK UP^TH^SITUATION IN THE MIDDLE PENS, THE CROWD

 WAS GETTING CRUSHED FROM 2.40 PM (1440) ONWARDS.

 NO IMMEDIATE COMMITMENTS.

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO.
J
Q53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1. I WAS SURPRISED THAT THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY SORT OF PLAN AND IT

ALL TOOK SO LONG BEFORE PEGP/e WERE RESCUED AND GOT OUT.

2. IT WAS OBVIOUS THERE WERE PROBLEMS IN THE PENS ftEFORE THE GAME STARTED AND

T ^ GATES AT THE FRONT OF THE PENS WERE NOT OPEJ*ED SOON ENOUGH

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

AS THE GATES AT THE FRONT OF THE P E N D E R E SO SMALL THEY OBVIOUSLY RESTRICTED

PEOPLE TRYING TO GET OUT TO SAF e V y ^

THE FANS WERE ROCKING THE MESH ON THE FRONT OF THE PENS TO GET THE PEOPLE

OUT.   ALTHOUGH I SAW 1 POLICE OFFICER HELPING, THE POLICE SEJ5MED RELUCTANT

 TO HELP IN THIS MANNER.    I FEEL THAT AS IT WAS VERY BAD LN THE PENS, I COULD

E ^ p SEE THIS FROM WHERE I WAS.     IN VIEW OF THIS I THINK THAT THE KICl^OFF

SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

 I WAS DISTRESSED TO SEE THAT FANS WHO HAD GOT OUT OF THE PENS ONTO THE PITCH

WERE HYSTERICAL AND I SAW POLICE OFFICERS TACKLING THEM AND TAKING THEM OFF

 THE PITCH WHEN IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE FANS WERE NOT TRYING ^ 6 DISRUPT THE

GAME BUT WERE HAVING SERIOUS PROBLEMS.

 I WAS SURPRISED ABOUT THE LACK OF ANNOUNCEMENTS OVEf     [E TANNOYS.   I FEEL

 THAT IF THERE HAD BEEN MORE ANNOUNCEMENTS THE pEOPLj     lULD HAVE BEEN MORE

 AWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

 THERE WAS A CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERS DEPLOYED ACROSS THE PITCH AND I FELT

 THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING THE FANS IN THE PENS,,

                                                                           GSL353S

 X THINK THAT DUE TO TRAFFIC DELAYS MAttfY FANS ARRIVED LATE AT THE GROUND AND

 THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE ADEQUAT^PLANS TO DEAL WITH THIS LATE CROWD.      WHEN WE

 W
 ERE IN THE SEATS AT ABOUT fc><05 (1505) THERE WERE MANYSEATS AROUND US THAT

 WERE NOT FILLED.    AS THE GAME WAS A SEMI FINAL AND OBVIOUSLY A SELL OUT THE

FANS WERE OBVIOUSLY LATE AND WERE SOMEWHERE PERHAPS TRYING TO GET IN.

AT ABOUT 50 YARDS FROM THE TURNSTILES I WAS ASKED ABOUT 3 TIMES IF I HAD A

SPARE TICKET.   I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THERE WERE NOT AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT

 OF PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS IN MY EXPERIENCE WITH GOING TO LARGE MATCHES.

 THE LOCAL SHEFFIELD PEOPLE WERE VERY HELPFUL AFTER THE DISASTER IN THE USE OF

 THEIR TELEPHONES ETC.

        ED IT? (BRIEFLY)                    .

 YES THE CROWD REALLY PUSHED FORWARD AT /H E BEGINNING OF THE GAME WHEN A

 LIVERPOOL PLAYER HIT THE CROSSBAR. A/tOUPLE OF MINUTES LATER THE GAME WAS

 STOPPED AND MY ATTENTION WAS DRAWN TO WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE PENS.

 JUST THE SHEER WEIGHT OF PEOPLE COMING IN BEHIND AN ALREADY PACKED AREA.

 PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCES AND GOING UP INTO THE STAND AT 2.20PM

 (1420). THAT•S HOW FULL IT WAS EVEN THEN.

 G50

 ABOUT 4.00PM (1600).

 A STEWARD, A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 ON DIRECTION OF THE LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT TELLING US THE MATCH WAS

 ABANDONED.

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATipN^ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE'MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE DID NOT SEEM ENOUGH    ISTANCE GIVEN TO THE FEW POLICEMEN WHO WERE AT

 Ty^LEPPINGS LANE END. JWEY SEEMED ISOLATED. EVEN WHEN THE LINE OF POLICEMEN

 APPEARED THEY DID NOT HELP THEM.

 I ALSO THINK THAT THE LOUDSPEAKER X QULD HAVE BEEN USED ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO

 HELP INJURED AS I AM A NURSE. PEOPLE'S HELP WAS BEING REFUSED BY POLICE.

 LACK OF COMMUNICATION IN GENERAL, I.E. TELLING PEOPLE THAT THE PENS WERE FULL.

 DIRECTING PEOPLE TO A ®IF&0?ENT AREA.

 THERE JWftS CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH POLICEMEi^lN THE AREA WHEN I WENT IN AND IT

 WAS QUIET THEN, SO OBVIOUSLY THERE      NEVER ENOUGH THERE TO COPE WITH THE

 DEVELOPING SITUATION.

 I EVEN SAW A VAN GET STOPFgD^fWICE BY POLICE FOR A SEARCH.   OBVIOUSLY IF THIS

 KEPT HAPPENING THERE WOULD BE MORE OF A TRAFFIC BUILD UP.

YES.

AT 3.15 (1515) I WENT DOWN ONTO THE PITCH AT A POINT WHERE THE NORTH STAND

MEETS THE SPION HOP TERRACES THERE WAS EIGHT TO TEN PEOPLE IN THE PENALTY AREA

 I IDENTIFIED MYSELF TO A POLICE OFFICER AND HE DIRECTED ME TO THAT AREA.          A

NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO RESUSCITATE THEM, UNFORTUNATELY THEY WERE

BEYOND HELP AT LEAST SIX OF THEM WERE DEAD.        THEY HAD NO EXTERNAL INJURIES

THEY WERE ASPHYXIATED.       I THEN WENT TO TELL THE POLICE OFFICER AND HE DIRECTED

 ME TO THE BACK OF THE STAND AND UNDERNEATH DEFINITELY NOT THE GYMNASIUM.

T^p?E WAS ABOUT FIFTEEN PEOPLE LYING ON THE GROUND HALF OF THEM WERE DEAD WITH

COATS OVER THEIR FACES.       SOME WERE SEMI-CONSCIOUS SITTING UPRIGHT AGAINST THE

WALL, I REMEMBER SEEING ONE LAD LYING ON HIS SIDE HE HAD A CHAROTIA PULSE, HIS

PUPILS DILATED AND HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS,       I INSTRUCTED A ST. JOHN'S AMBULANCE

CADET TO STAY WITH HIM.       THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION ONLY A NURSE IN UNIFORM

AND THIS 12 YEAR OLD ST. JOHN AMBULANCE CADET.        THERE WAS A CONTINUAL FLOW

OF BODIES COMING INTO THE STAND AtlL COJXSISTENT WITH BEING CRUSHED AND

 ASPHYXIATED.       I WENT BACK OUT ONTO THE PITCH INTO THE GOAL MOUTH AND SAW THAT

 A NUMBER OF OTHER DOCTORS WERE TREATING INJURED FANS.       THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY

 FROM SHEFFIELD AS THEY WERE WEARING COATS WITH THE WORDS ’DOCTOR’ WRITTEN ON

 THEM.       I WENT AND SAT ON THE WALL OF THE NORTH STAND AND THE AMOUNT OF BODIES
                                                                           PAGE    8

  RECEEDED AND THEY WERE PLACED IN AMBULANCES.

  I MUST POINT OUT THAT I WENT DOWN TO THE PITCH OF MY OWN ACCORD I DID NOT

  HEAR ANY ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM REQUESTING THE PRESENCE

  AND ASSISTANCES OF ANY DOCTOR OR NURSE.

  I AM UNABLE TO DESCRIBE ANY OF THE PERSONS THAT I ATTENDED AFTER THE DISASTER

 HAD OCCURRED.


Q17

  G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

  INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?



 Q5Q

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 4.30 PM (1630).

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

  I LEFT AS A RESULT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER ENSURING THAT MY ASSISTANCE WAS

 NOT REQUIRED.


Q1#
 Q52

| DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

i Q53

  DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

  AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

  YES THE MAIN POINT WAS THAT THERE WAS NO/TOGANISATION OF MEDICAL SERVICES AND

  MEDICAL EQUIPMENT NON EXISTENT WHICH J/& THE SAME AT MOST FOOTBALL GROUNDS.    IT

  WAS CHAOS AND NO-ONE COULD HAVE FORESEEN THIS DISASTER.   THE CLUB OFFICIALS
                                                                              PAGE      9

 SHOULD HAVE ANNOUNCED TO THE FANS WHAT WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING,       IT WAS NOT

 HOOLIGANISM OR PITCH INVASION.

 <354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE MEDICAL FACILITIES AND BACK UP WHERE THERE ARE MAJOR EVENTS WITH LARGE

 ATTENDANCES,    I FEEL THAT IT SHOULD BE MADE COMPULSORY THAT MEDICAL TEAMS ARE

 PRESENT AT THE EVENT WHICH INCLUDE DOCTORS AND QUALIFIED PEOPLE.

 I AM SURE THAT IF THE GATES AT THE LEffFINGS LANE END IF THEY HAD NOT BEEN

 OPENED TO ALLOW THE MASSED F'ANS^ffifo THE GROUND THERE WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE

 BEEN FATALITIES OUTSIDE OF THE GROUND.

 WHEN THE MATCH WAS STOPPED A LINE OF POLICE
                                       3LICE CAME ACROSS          \HALFWAY LINE.     I

 THINK THAT THESE OFFICERS COULD HAVE                               PEOPLE WERE

 COLLAPSING NEAR TO THEM AND THEY DID MOVE OR CAME TO HELP ANYONE.       IN FACT THE

 LINE OF POLICE GOT INTO THE       WAY OF FANS CARRYING BODIES AND THE INJURED. JUST

AFTER THE MATCH WAS ABANDONED A POLICE MESSAGE ON THE PA ASKED PEOPLE TO CLEAR

 THE PITCH AND TO RETURN TO THE TERRACES.      OBVIOUSLY THE POLICE DID NOT REALISE

EVEN AT THAT STAGE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?    .   ^    ^ ^         _-

 TME F A HAVE GOT TO TAKE! &0ME OF THE BLAME FOR HAVING THE GAME AT HILLSBOROUGH

THE FENCING IN THE/GROUND IS NOT SAFE.       ALSO THE TICKET ALLOCATIONS WAS VERY

UNJUST.    THERE WAS^A LACK OF STEWARDS INSIDE THE GROUND AND FOR THE SIZE OF

THE CROWD VERY FEW ST JOHNS.       THERE WAS NO EQUIPMENT.   THE KICK OFF SHOULD

HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

THE LARGEST PROBLEM WAS THE LACK OF CROWD CONTROL HALF INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE

GROUND.

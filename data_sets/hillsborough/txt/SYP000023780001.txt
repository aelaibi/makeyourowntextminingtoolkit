Chief Inspector M Jones
18 Furnavall House
Sheffield


Dear Chief Inspector

I enclose a copy of a letter from a football fan who claims to have been at
Hillsborough on the day of the disaster. Make of it what you will, but I
felt you should at least see it.

I have obtained a telephone number for the writer of the letter
        though I have not called him.

The writer has addressed his letter 'Dear Mick' because 'Mick's Mailbag' is
the name of the letter page in my magazine, a copy of which is enclosed.
This letter has not been published in MATCH.

Yours sincerely


                              -

   Stuart is convinced th at next

   "The club has suffered from

   "But I suppose w e never

   prospect of facing the
   fearsome foursome - Steve
   Bull and Andy Mutch of
   Wolves and the Sheffield
   United duo of Brian Deane
   and Tony Agana.
       Between them , the quartet
    have fired an astonishing 133
    goals as their teams stormed
    into first and second spots
    respectively - and are now
    preparing for life in a higher
    echelon.
      Bull and Mutch proved their
    m ettle in Wolves' Fourth
    Division Championship side
   and have just been paid the
   marvellous complim ent of
   being invited on the England B
   tour.
      The pair from Bramall Lane
   w ere the surprise packet of the
   season, however, being
   brought together by Dave
   Bassett w ho took Tony Agana
   from his form er club W atford
   and then signed Deane from
   Doncaster in the summer.
      They w ere an immediate hit
   and grabbed almost as many
   headlines as their better-known
   rivals from Molineux.
      But just how good are the
  tw o partnerships and how will
  they fare next season?
      MATCH put the question to
  Bury defender Kenny Clements,
  now 34, w ho has had a wealth
  of First and Second division
  experience w ith both
  Manchester City and Oldham.
      And he came up w ith some
  answers th at should be of great

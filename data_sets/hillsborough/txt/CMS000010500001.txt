           POLICING OF RUGBY UNION FOOTBALL GROUNDS - THE TAYI OR RFPQRT
           The Leicester Rugby Football Club, situated on Aylestone Road, Leicester,
           is subject of a Safety Certificate issued by the Fire Service.
           The requirement for Police Officers to attend this ground is set out in
           Schedule 2, paragraph 26 of the Safety Certificate, which gives the Chief
           Constable the discretion to deploy a sufficient number of Police Officers
           to 'secure the orderly and lawful behaviour of the spectators.7 There has
           been no history of serious crowd disorder and in consequence, the Police
           attendance is minimal.
           During the last season, the Police presence was increased for the major
           match of the season, which occurred over the Christmas period. However,
           even for this fixture, the number of Police Officers deployed was
           substantially lower than that used for a match at the Leicester City
           Football Club, with an equivalent crowd.
           There has been no definitive guidance from the Home Office in relation to
           the application of the Taylor Report recommendations to Rugby Union
           grounds.

           I do understand the many difficulties which would be presented to Rugby
           Clubs if Taylor were to be applied to them, but I would be most grateful
           for any advice you can give in this matter.

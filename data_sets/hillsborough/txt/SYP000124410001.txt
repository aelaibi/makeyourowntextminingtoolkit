 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 WHAT HIT ME WAS WHEN SOME LADS WERE TRYING TO CLIMB THE FRONT PERIMETER

 EXPERIENCED ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1. THE GAME SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HELD AT HILLSBOROUGH

 2. THE TICKET ALLOCATION WAS PATHETIC

 3. BAD POLICE CONTROL OUTSIDE THE GROUND

 4. BAD STEWARDING

 5. GOVERNMENT SHOULD PUMP MONEY        INTO THE FA TO IMPROVE GROUND SAFETY

 6.    I AM JUST ANGRY ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

 ^LACK      OF CONTROL ON TICKET INSPECTION.

UNCOMFORTABLE THIS WAS POINTED OUT TO HIM, HE REMARKED,,             THAT ITS ONLY YOUR

OWN THAT ARE DOING IT THUS IMPLYING THAT WE WERE CHOOSING TO CRUSH EACH

OTHER AND HE WAS DOING NOTHING ABOUT IT.

6.   THE GATES SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OPENED WITHOUT FIRST CHECKING THAT THE

TUNNEL WAS CLOSED TO PREVENT PEOPLE SURGING             INTO IT AND THUS OVERCROWDING

PENS THREE AND FOUR THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN POLICE AND STEWARDS DIRECTING

^PPLE       AWAY FROM THE TUNNEL TO THE SIDE T E R R A C E S .

7.   IN MY OPINION THE POLICE WERE TOLD NOT TO ALLOW ANY FANS ONTO THE PITCH

AT ALL COSTS.        THE DECISION TO DELAY THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE

EARLIER AT APPROXIMATELY H.3D PM <1430) WHEN IT WAS CLEAR FOR ALL TO SEE

THAT THERE WAS A LARGE NUMBER OF FANS ARRIVING LATE.

8.   I WAS TALKING TO A STEWARD WHO REMARKED TO ME THAT IT WAS THOSE

BASTARDS FAULT       I TOLD THEM NOT TO OPEN THE GATE HE WAS POINTING TO THE POLICE

IN GENERAL.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL .IS VITAL TO THIS

 J^pCIAL      INQUIRY?

 THERE WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POLICE"PWISjJ)fc AND INSIDE THE

 GROUND.      THE FENCES SEPARATING THE INDIVIDUAL PENS PREVENTED PEOPLE SPREADING

 OUT FROM THE CENTRE PENS.

 MORE INFORMATION SHOULD BE GIVEN SHOWING FANS THAT THEY CAN GET TO TERRACING

 AROUND THE SIDES OF THE STANDS AS WELL AS THROUGH THE TUNNEL.

INFO      »  I GOT TO THE GROUND AT 2:40PM THE TWO CENTRAL PENS IN THE WEST
             STAND WERE EXTREMELY FULL THE OUTSIDES WERE EMPTY. IT WAS HARD TO
             TELL HOW SERIOUS IT WAS FROM WHERE I WAS. I DID SEE PEOPLE
             CLAMBERING OVER THE FENCING. IT WAS 5 OR 10 MINS BEFORE THE
             POLICE STARTED TO HELP. THE FENCE BENT BACK INTO ITSELF SO MAKING
             IT DIFFICULT FOR THE PEOPLE TO GET OUT.

CONTD.
THERE WAS A TANNOY BUT IT WAS NOT VERY CLEAR. THE SCOREBOARD WAS FLASHING
ADVERTISEMENTS BUT NO MESSAGE WAS PASSED THROUGH ON THIS.
I KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING BY LISTENING TO A RADIO BEHIND ME.
THE POLICE DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING IT LOOKED LIKE A PITCH
INVASION AND A CORDEN WAS MADE BY THE NORTH STAND.
THERE WAS NO REAL CO ORDINATION BY THE POLICE OFFICERS.
IT WAS SLOW FOR MEDICAL ATTENDANCE TO GET TO THE GOAL MOUTH AND ADVERTISING
 1^>]
HQftDINGS WERE BEING USED AS STRETCHERS. THERE WAS A GENERAL MELEE.
I WENT WITH                 ALREADY TELEPHONED
             MDDRESS NOT KNOWN
             ^ADDRESS NOT KNOWN
I WILL ASK THESE TO CALL

BEFORE THE GAME IT WAS NOTICEABLE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLICING THIS AND
LAST YEAR.

INFO      »  I GOT INTO THE STAND AT 2 OCLOCK, AND BY 2.30 I COULD SEE IN THE
             LEPPINGS LANE STAND THAT THE PEN BEHIND THE GOAL WAS FULL, BUT
             THERE WAS SPACE IN THE PENS ON EITHER SIDE. WHEN THE SURGE
             FORWARD CAME AT JUST AFTER THREE IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THERE WAS A
             CROWD PROBLEM WHEN THEY STARTED CLIMBING OVER, BUT OF COURSE IT
             WASN'T A CROWD PROBLEM.

«   WHO WITH   »

I WENT WITH MY BROTHER IN LAW
CLEVELAND AND HIS SON       AND ALSO         SON
I DIDN'T SEE ANY VIOLENCE OTHER THAN WHEN A PHOTOGRAPHER TOOK A PICTURE OF AN
INJURED FAN, AND A POLICEMAN PREVENTED ANOTHER FAN FROM HITTING HIM.
IN THE LEPPINGS LANE STAND, I SAW A LOT GET OVER THE SIDE OF THE PENS TO THE
PENS ON EITHER SIDE. THEN I SAW SOME CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT FENCE, AND THE
POLICE WERE TRYING TO HOLD THEM BACK. THEN THEY REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING
ANj^ STARTED TO HELP THEM OVER. I JUST THINK IT WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION,
i m S NEXT TO THE POLICE OBSERVATION BOX AND THEY MUST HAVE SEEN WHAT I
SAW, THAT THE PEN WAS FULL AND NO MORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LET IN.
AFTER WE HAD PARKED THE CAR AND WERE WALKING TO THE FOOTBALL GROUND, A LOT OF
PEOPLE FROM LIVERPOOL APPROACHED US AND ASKED IF WE HAD TICKETS TO SELL TO
THEM AND IT SEEMED THAT A LOT OF LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS HAD TURNED UP WITHOUT
TICKETS.

HIS MAIN COMMENTS WERE THAT THE ORGANISATION OF THE WHOLE EVENT LEAVED MUCH
TO BE DESIRED. THE GENERAL ATTITUDE OF THE POLICE BEFORE AND AFTER THE
TRADEGY WAS UNACCEPTABLE-THEY SEEMED AGGRESSIVE FOR NO APPARENT REASON. THE
CALLER FELT THAT THE FIREMAN DID A GOOD JOB ON THE DAY BUT MANY OTHER PERSONS
IN AUTHORITY STOOD AROUND WATCHING OTHERS.

THE POLICE AND THE FANS WERE PULLING AT THE WIRE MESH TO THE TRAPPED FANS.
I SAW PEOPLE COLLAPSE ON THE PITCH. IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE SERIOUS BUT AS

THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CLUB AND THE PEOPLE IN THE GROUND WAS VERY POOR

MINUTES BEFORE ANY AMBULANCES ARRIVED AND THEN THERE WERE ONLY 2. I DID NOT
REALIZE THE SERIORITY UNTIL I SAW A PERSON BEING GIVEN THE KISS OF LIFE. IT
WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE TO DETERMINE WHO NEEDED HELP AS THERE WERE LARGE
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ON THE PITCH. I ARRIVED EARLY AT THE GROUND AT 1300 WHERE I
WAS APPROACHED BY FANS FOR ANY SPARE TICKETS. AFTER THE MATCH I SAW PEOPLE
WHO STILL HAD THERE WITHOUT BEING USED.

                 THERE WAS 1 P.C. STANDING BY THE TURNSTILE ENTRANCE. IT TOOK

CONT.T
THAT THE FANS WERE FILTERED BEFORE YOU REACHED THE TURNSTILES. THE POLICE AT
THE KOP END OF THE STAND DIDN'T APPEAR TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON, & SEEMED TO
WALKING AROUND IN A DAZE WITH NO ONE TELLIUNG THEM WHAT TO DO. THEY SEEMED
MORE CONCERNED WITH UNRULEY SUPPORTERS.
WHEN THE MATCH BEGAN & THE PEOPLE STARTED TO GET ONTO THE PITCH THE POLICE
BOUGHT THE INJURED IN FRONT OF OUR STAND. I KNEW IT WASN'T BAD BEHAVIOUR AS
ONE FAN RAN ONTO THE PITCH TO ONE OF THE PLAYERS TO TRY & STOP THE MATCH. THE
ANMQ1UNCMENT SYSTEM STATED AT APPROXIMATELY 1530HRS FOR THE FANS TO GET OFF
t h 9 PITCH,
      j      THESE FANS WERE ACTUALLY HELPING THE DEAD & INJURED.
I SAW ST JOHNS AND MAINLY FANS HELPING THE INJURED, THE POLICE DIDN'T SEEMTO
BE HELPING AT ALL. ALL THIS WAS OCCURRING AT THE NORTH STAND SIDE. THERE WERE
NO BLANKETS OR COVERING FOR THE DEAD PANS THEY JUST PULLED THEIR T SHIRTS
OVER THEIR FACES.
I WENT TO THE MATCH W I T H __________  TEL;
I THINK HE HAS ALREADYMADE A STATEMENT TO THE POLICE.

MY DAUGHTER WAS WITH ME |                      12 YEARS,
SKELMSDALE MANSFIELD.
I BELIEVE I HAVE ALOT OF INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP AND I AM WILLING TO MAKE A
STATEMENT. I SAW ALOT OF PEOPLE COMING INTO THE WEST STAND EVEN THOUGH THE
GAME HAD BEEN STOPPED AND THEY WERE PULLING PEOPLE OUT, AT THE SAME TIME AS
THIS WAS GOING ON THERE WERE NOTTS FANS IN THE SPION KOP END SHOUTING TO THE
POLICE SAYING THERE WERE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS IN WITH THEM CAUSING TROUBLE. I
W B H TO THE GAME EARLY AND STOOD IN THE FAR LEFT CORNER OF THE STAND AS LAST
YEM WHEN I ATTENDED I STOOD IN THE MIDDLE AND WAS NEARLY CRUSHED THEN.
YOU CAN CONTACT ME ANYTIME THROUGH MY MOTHER AT THE ADDRESS I HAVE GIVEN. I
WORK AWAY TRAVELLING DURING THE WEEK BUT I CONTACT HOME ON A DAILY BASIS SO A
MESSAGE COULD EASILY GET TO ME

«   WHO WITH     »

I WENT WITH MY HUSBAND                       WHO LIVES WITH ME.
THERE WERE 50 CAMERA MEN WHO JUST TOOK PICTURES, AND COULD HAVE HELPED.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WHO USED OUR PHONE WERE
SMASHING.
THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS BEING DRUNK, I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THAT, BUT I SAW A LOT OF NOTTINGHAM FOREST SUPPORTERS WHO WERE
VERY DRUNK.
IN THE SPION KOP END THERE SEEMED TO BE A LACK OF STEWARDS OR POLICE, AND
T ^ K E WAS A LOT OF 'WAVING' OF THE FANS, WHO WERE MORE TIGHTLY PACKED IN THE
MITOLE. OBVIOUSLY NOT TO THE SAME EXTENT AS THE LEPPINGS LANE END, BUT
INDICATIVE OF THE LACK OF POLICING.

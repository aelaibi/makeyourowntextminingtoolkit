                    I am writing to add my voice to all those
which have been raised in praise of the Final Report into the
Hillsborough Disaster, and indeed of your whole conduct of the
Inquiry including the interim report .
                    As one of the 1610 members of the general
public who wrote to you , I argued against the statutory
identity card scheme and for the examination of the use of
electronic tagging as an effective measure against hooligans.I
was naturally delighted to see tagging included in Chapter 11,
and to follow your powerful arguments in Part IV.
                    As a member of the Football Supporters
Association I warmly welcome your endorsement of the need for
more consultation with the supporters , and your clarion call
for a new era for the professional game .There is a need for
new attitudes and better leadership on the part of all those
involved - the football authorities , the clubs , the
spectators, and the police - and nobody can afford to be
complacent .
                    Few of those who go to football matches can
have had much expectation that a Government appointed inquiry
would have gained such an insight into their experiences or
produced such an urgent and no-nonsense charter for the future.
                    Thank you,




The Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylo

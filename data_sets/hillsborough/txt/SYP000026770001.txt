                                 We are acting on behalf of the parents of the Family of Gary Philip Jones
                                 who was one of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster on the
                                 15th April, 1989.

                                 An Interim Certificate was issued on the 20th April, 1989.

                                 The Family are particularly concerned to know so far as is possible how
                                 and when Gary died . Gary was seen on television getting over the
                                 barrier, taking a few steps on the pitch and then collapsing. His
                                                     who was with him at the time observed him being
                                     ---------- _-------------------------------- 1                                      ------ —   — ~         v n_»       11X111

                                 taken into an ambulance, but, the family have no information as to whether
                                 he was alive at that time.

                                 The Family would therefore be most grateful to learn whether any further
                                 information can be provided with regard to Gary and in particular whether
                                 it may now be possible to indicate the medical cause of death.

                                 Yours sincerely,

                               Dear Dr. Popper,



                               Re:- Gary Philip Jones                                                                                                                           Merseyside


                               We are acting on behalf of the parents of the   Family of  Gary Philip Jones
                               who was one of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster on the
                               15th April, 1989.

                               An Interim Certificate was issued on the 20th                                                                      April, 1989.

                               The Family are particularly concerned to know    so far as  ispossible how
                               and when Gary died . Gary was seen on television getting over the
                               barrier, taking a few steps on the pitch and then collapsing. His
                               ________________________ was with him at the time observed him being
                               taken into an ambulance, but, the family have no information as to whether
                               he was alive at that time.

                               The Family would therefore be most grateful to learn whether any further
                               information can be provided with regard to Gary and in particular whether
                               it may now be possible to indicate the medical cause of death.

                               Yours sincerely,




                                                                                         f F        -7L.

   Dear Sir

   RE GARY PHILIP JONES

   With reference to your letter dated 8.6.89 concerning the above named I can
   confirm that the originally described sighting of this man climbing the fsnce
   in the ground was not a correct identification.

   The family have since been shown further visual evidence and have now actually
   identified Gary Philip Jones on the terracing alive.

   We have confirmed that death was certified by Dr Doore at the Northern General
   Hospital betveen 1545 and 1600 hours on 15 April 1989.

   Yours faithfully




   K J FOSTER
   DETECTIVE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT

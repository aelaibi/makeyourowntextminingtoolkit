A q u a n t i t y of        cans were      removed from several               F or d T r an si t       vans.



POL PC R o g a n           caused one van to stop a nd               I spoke        to the driver a nd his

three      passengers.              Only one of whom had a ticket.                            I brought this to

the a t t e n t i o n of the sergeant who                  spoke     to the       lads and was a s s u r e d                by

them that they were                 collecting        their tic kets          from a friend at

H i ll s b o r o u g h .      I then      informed them that             if t he y did not             in fact have

t ickets       they w ould d e f i n i t e l y not be seeing a ny football                           and one of

the     lads     replied,        ’W e ’re Liverpoo l         fans,     we    can get         in a n y w h e r e ! ’



I saw an ot he r           van pull       up in the       layby and a         lad got out and sold a

t icket to a           lad in a car w hi ch had              pulled up behind                it.



We n oticed that from about                      1-1.30p m     (1300-1330)          the traffic was              so

c o ngested a long            the   road that the          cars were at a standstill.                          H ow ev er

by a bout 2pm              (1400)   the    road was v i r t u al l y empty.                 At a bo ut 2 .30          pm

(1430)       we st op pe d two         coaches w h i c h were          t r av e l l i n g    together and fans

w ere    c omplaining          that the drivers were               going to make              them     late for

the game.



At approx.           2 . 4 5 pm (1445)      we    left T a n k e r s l e y   I n te r se c ti o n en route to

Claywheels           Ln for our meal.



As we      passed by H i l l s b o r o u g h       I saw that        there were a lot of L iv er po ol

fans still mi ll in g about at about 3 p m                        (1500)      and     I c om me nt ed that             if

the fans         d i d n ’t hurry they w o ul d miss              the start         of the game.



At about 3 . 0 5 p m          (1505)      a call     came to us that we were                    requ ir ed at

Leppings         Ln.         We a s s u m e d fighting       had broke out.

                                                                                                       S25S5

On arrival        at H i l l s b o r o u g h our    Inspector and S er g ea n t          told us to make

sure    that we stayed together as a serial.                           Once we got to the gate at

the L ep pi n g s Ln      I saw several            h undre d L iv er p oo l    fans s t an di ng o p po si te

the gates w h ic h        lead    into the ground.



At    first we were told to form a cordon a nd                        I thought        this must       be

b ecause     the fans were going             to storm the t ur nstiles.                   At this      time

rumours      began to cir cu la te that              the game had been stop pe d and some

L i v er po ol   fans had sp il le d onto the              pitch.



A Live rp oo l     fan came up to me and a s ke d why he was                        not being a l l o w e d

in a nd s ho we d me his ticket and                   I e x p l ai n ed the s i t u at i on to him.            As

we were      s peaking an a mb u l a n c e a r ri v e d and the             lad a sk ed w hy the

ambulance        had arrived.           I said that some one must have been                         injured

in the     crush and he          replied,      ’Oh good       if they get some out t h e r e ’ll be

more    room for u s ’ .



Just as the a m b u l a n c e was making               its way     into the g ro un d a call            came

over a t an no y s ystem          r equest im ^j       that the fans make no a tt em pt                to gain

e ntry to the g round but a ssist P o li c e                  in brin gi ng       out the      injured.

Our    serial was then told to enter                    the ground.            Once we      passed t h ro ug h

the outer gates           I lost     contact w it h our S e rg e a n t and             Inspector and

d i d n ’t see them a g a i n until          after      the L iv er p oo l     fans had      left the

stadi um.



The    first     person    I saw as we         passed t hr o ug h the gates was a man                   in his

mid 2 0 ’s who was         sat w i th his head b et we en his                 knees    crying.         I then

saw a m an       in his m id 3 0 ’s laid on the g r ou n d w i t h a teenager                       knee li ng

at his side.            The m a n was      having d i f f i c u l t i e s     b re a th i ng and a p p e a r e d

to have an        injury to his         ribs.
                                                                                                        PAGE       4
                                                                                                        S25S5



I knelt       beside him a nd h elped him               into a more        c o mf or ta bl e    p os i ti o n to

a id his      breathing.



I then w a l k e d over           to an a m b u la nc e w h i ch was      parked next          to Gate     'C'.

I could see two men                lying on the floor who were                  o b v i ou s ly dead.

A m b u l a n c e m e n were giving another man oxygen.



I then h el pe d a nother PC to move these                      corpse to one side              in order to

make a space for a m b u l a n c e s           to get up a nd down the alley.



At   this     stage fans          began    coming t hr o ug h Gate        *C*    in greater         numbers

a n d more     bodies a nd         casualties were         brou gh t    from the        pitch area.

M an y of the fans who              came out were         very host il e        towards     the Police,

passing       comments      such as        'It's all your         bastards       fault'     a nd    'Don't

just    fucking      stand there you bastards'.



I saw one fan say to several P o l i c e m e n who                     had f ormed a cordon a r o u n d

the bodies        of the dead,            'You bastards are           going to        pay for      this,   some

of y ou will        die for w hat's           hap p en e d here      today*.          M an y of the fans

were    quite drunk and some who were                     g e n u i n e l y trying     to help the P ol ic e

were    really      little more           than a h i n d er a nc e    due to the amou nt            of alcohol

t h ey 'd   consumed.



As the      injured were           brought     out we     placed them to one side,                  a lo ng a

wall    and    I went along           this wall      giving a d vi c e     to the friends            of some

of those       injured a nd         placing      people    in the      r e co ve ry    p o si ti on and

a d m i n i s t e r i n g minor    first aid etc.



M a n y of the sergeants              s eemed to be       in a state       of shock,        as we all were
                                                                                                    PAGE       5
                                                                                                    S25S5

and     I saw a Chief             Inspector    take hold of one serg ea nt who was s t an di ng

next     to me and say to him                ’Come on,       it's up to y ou s er ge an ts        to take

control        of this!'            The sergeant        s im pl y   looked a wa y as     if h e ’d not

h e ar d the Chief           Inspector.



A Doctor         then came over      to me and e xp l a i n e d he w o u l d like to help.
                                              /si
(I found out              later this was Mr Ashton).          I d i r e c t e d him to a m an who

was     lying face down on the ground s u r r o u n d e d                  by his   friends.        When

the Doctor          knelt        down next    to the m an one of his friends               said    ’What do

you want y ou b astard fuck o f f ’ .



I told him the man was a Doctor and had                             come to offer a s s i s t a n c e a nd

he replied,              ’Well    he should get my mate             to fuck in g h o s p i t a l ’ , I told

him to       calm down a nd do wha te ve r              the D oc to r    told him to.



I then j oined a nother m a n who was                    lying on the floor and was               having

d if f i c u l t i e s   breathing.          H owever    he was      c onscious and was        talking.

I told his           friend to make          him more      comfortable.           I then w a l k e d over

to where         fans were         leaving by Gate         ’B ’ .     M a n y of the fans were       o penly

crying and m any were                s houting    obs ce n it i es    at m ys el f and the other

p o l i c em en w it h me.



I then w a l k e d over            to the opposite         side of the a ll ey w here a m an was

lying on his             side.       This was     in fact the m an          I had first      seen as     I

e n te r e d the ground.              I was    s hocke d that he was           still   lying    in the

p os it io n because             it must   have been 30 m in u te s         or so since      I had first

s p o k e n to him and his            companion.           The y oung      lad w it h him told me the

D octor      had seen his uncle and had said he must                         go   in the next

a v a i l a b l e ambulance.
                                                                                                       PAGE    6
                                                                                                       S25S5

At this       time   I saw an a m b u l a n c e         coming t hr o u g h the m a i n gate and

h eading      towards      us.             I went      over a nd spoke w i t h the a m b u l a n c e driver

and was       then j oined by a sergeant who was                       busy o rg an i si n g   the

t r a n s p o r t a t i o n of the    injured.            I info rm ed him of the s i t u a t i o n and

then     r eturned to the            injured man.



At this stage a y oung m an                  came over to me a nd told me he was a medical

student.           I told him to go along the wall                      at the far side of the

a l l e y w a y and examine          the    injured.



A few more m inutes              passed before            I was able     to get the      injured m a n who

was    lying on the floor               into an ambulance.



W hile all        this was       h a p pe ni ng    I kept     coming    in contact w it h some of the

officers who were            in my serial.                 P a r t i c u l a r l y Pol PC 297 Barnes     and

Pol PC      1629 Rogan.              Ho we ve r    I had    lost t ou ch w i t h the     rest    of my

serial.           At this    stage a sergeant               came a lo ng and told us to go to the

m ai n gate and        I r emained there as the West S t a n d was e mp t ie d of

L i v e rp oo l   fans.



The a t m o s p h e r e at   this       time was        very tense a nd the m a j o r i t y of the

fans were         very hostile and            I p er so na ll y a lm os t     'expected'       to be

assaulted.



One young m an         came up a nd a s ke d me             if I knew w he re a p a rt ic ul ar         pub

was and       I said      I did not.              He   replied    'You bast ar ds you d o n ’t know

fuck a l l '.



A n ot h e r L iverpool      fans a p p r o a c h e d m ys el f and a PC who was               s ta nd in g

next     to me and said,             'Do you think the game will                 be played today'.
                                                                                                      P AG E
                                                                                                      S2585



I replied,         *1 very m uch doubt            it'.



He   replied,       'Why not,        they did at H e y s e l ’ .



D ur in g   the time       that    I was     on duty at these gates               I m ys el f and

o fficers w it h me were             s ub j e c t e d to a constant       flow of verbal abuse.

We   ignored the          comments       that were made        because,         first,     it s e em ed

improper       to react         in any other way as m a n y of the fans were                     g e n u in e ly

d i s t r e s s e d and upset      by what they had exp er ie nc ed .                   But more

i mp or t a n t l y for the s ec on d        reason that        it would,        in my opinion,           have

been    ’very dangerous'            to have       reacted     in any other w ay other              than to

ignore the        comments and a c c u s a t i o n s       leve ll ed at        us.



At approx.        5 .1 5 p m    (1715)     we were j o in ed by our S er g ea n t and             Inspector

a n d our serial was             reformed.          We then     r et ur ne d to our F or d T r an si t

van and      c ommenced m ob il e          patrol    on P e n i s t o n e Rd.         We then r et u rn e d to

C l a y w h e e l s Ln.        F ood was    provided a nd we were           then t r a n s p o r t e d back

to Thorne.



At no time        during this         incident       did I m ys el f     have acce ss        to a radio.

I accept       that even         if I had had access           to a radio         it w o u ld not have

s er ve d a ny    real     purpose       in the     c on fu si on that e ns ue d f o ll ow in g       the

      Lord Justice Peter Taylor                                                          PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL
      Royal Court of Justice,
      The Strand,
      LONDON, W C 2 .


      Dear Lord Justice Taylor,

      I understand that you are hoping to start taking formal evidence on
      the 15th May 1989.

      Rule 36 of the Coroner’s Rules provides in a nutshell that an inquest
      should deal with the question of who' the deceased w a s , and how, when,
      where he caftie by his death. In other words the scope of the inquiry
      is limited and circumscribed.

      I am very concerned that as far as is conveniently possible our
      inquiries should dovetail together rather than overlap substantially.
      I fear we otherwise might unnecessarily increase distress to the
      deceased relatives 1 and to witnesses.

      For this reason I think it would be very helpful if we could meet at
      a convenient time so that you could perhaps indicate to me what is in
      your mind with regard to the Judicial Inquiry and in particular to
      what extent, if at all, it would impinge or overlap the Inquest,

      I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.


                                                                                                           Cc      IV &Wv. >V\   dlA
      Yours ^incerely,

                          HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


        I am afraid that the Home Secretary's minute to the Prime
    Minister of 2 August contained an error. The press will have
    embargoed copies of Lord Justice Taylor's report at 9.30 am on
    Friday 4 August.

        I am copying this to Private Secretaries to recipients of
    the Home Secretary's minute and I should be grateful if they
    could make this alteration.  I apologise for the mistake.




                                                                     MISS C J BANNISTER




    Ms Caroline Slocock
    Private Secretary
    10 Downing Street
    LONDON SW1

were     unaware        of the        people         in Bki^stress.

1 believe at             this      point       that      the ma>tch had started and there was an

h or r e n d o u s    volume       of n o i X        from the           crowd.      It was      not    possible    to hear

I step p e d         back and       checked the               right       hand    pen to see          if there was

P eo pl e at the front              of the          crowd were         now shouting and screa ming                   for

people       in the        crowd w o u ld       be s er i ou s ly        injured.         Yet    there was     still         a

crescendo           of    noise    from the m ai n body of the                       crowd who were         e n gr os se d

T o g e t h e r w it h half a dozen O f f \ c e r s                 from my serial,              I became    emb r o i l e d

in frantic             efforts     to    pull       p e op i e X J j r o u g h the    gate.      I lost    track     of

time and was              t o ta ll y unaware          of events         other       than those         i mmediately

s u r r o un d i n g     that   gate.        In spite of all             our efforts we did not seem to

be having any              impact       on    releasing         the    pressure of the             crowd,    no

mat t e r    how man y we          pulled t hr o ug h the gate.

I am sure           that    people       only a short              d is ta nc e    back    into the terracing

were w a t c h in g        the game and were                unaware       of the       crush at the front.

P a n i c and d e sp e r a t i o n       then seemed to               pass thro ug h the           crowd    rapidly.

P e o p l e a p p e a r e d from about              ten deep,         rolled over the top of the                    crowd

in front          of them and           down to the gate.                1 was       now aware of more Police

s p i l l e d onto the          pitch.

The     gate was a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 ""“S ’ wide.                Access a ro un d the gate was                 very-

r estr i c t e d because           of two       factors.           The first was           that    the gate

o nly    opened to form a right angle w ith fence.                                    Therefore,        only two

O ff i c e r s    of a time        could e f f i c ie n tl y work at                 pulling      people    free     by-

approaching              from the       frNsnt and        left      hand side.         In our obvious          frantic

efforts          to assist we w e r e N l n e v i t a b l y           getting        in each others way.             The

se c o n d factor was that ad v e r vise/i ng hoar d i tigs , set at an angle                                  from the

floor       to knee height,             were        up against         the fence an d right up to the

edges       of the gates.

The     s i t ua t i on was       now desperate,              people      five       or six deep wi th in the

that    people were          being         t r a m pl e d u n de r ne a th their       feet.    There was

nothing we        could do          but     pull      people    through       the gate one at a time.

Some were at s ho ul d er                 height,      some at waist          height and some were

d ra g ge d out along            the floor.

I was    unaware       of time,            but after      being at the gate for some

c o ns id er ab le    time,       two      p articular me n became             stuck at the         bottom of

the    gate.   The y were           pleading          for help,    but we       could not move them.                 We

had to     pull      many    people         t hro ug h over      the    top of them inevita bly

causing     them to be t r a m pl e d on.                I was a fr ai d       for the      lives      of these

m e n at this        point,       but there was           nothing       to be done for them until                    the

crush was      relieved.            Still        people further         back    in the      crowd,      who    did

not appear        to be      in     real      danger,     were    jumping and           rolling     over      the top

of the    crowd down to the gate.

A rniddrle aged m an               in\      grey anorak         had been\ palled t h ro ug h the               gate

in the    crowd near             to the gate.           He was    in a blind           panic avid all         he was

my fist     in an effort             to keep him a way from the gate.

I could now see that                 there were          spaces    on the       terrace        only a short

d is ta n c e awa y from the               fencing.      We shouted, at the             crowd a ro u n d the

gate    to turn an d         look         back   but    they were       oblivious        and    continued to

push towards          the gate.            Not   until    Police O ff ic e rs          had pulled       people

away    back   into the t e rr ac in g                did the    pressure at           the gate     subside.

The    two men who          had been t r ap pe d at the                foot    of the gate        for several

minutes     must     have        been s e r i o us l y    injured.      The     f i rst was a white male,

                    The    se c o n d man was         a w hit e     male,    late teens,           plump build,           we aring a

                    a f t e r a few minutes.             He was      still       in the same        position,          b rea thing and

                    r e sponsive       to my questions.              I did not       see     either       of these        two men

                    again.

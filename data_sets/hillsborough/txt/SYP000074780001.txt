              I am the Lic en ce e             of the above        public house and have been                running          it

              since     1983 with my wife.

             On S a t u r d a y    15 April       1989    (150489?,           the day of the Semi-Final,             I

              op en ed the        pub as       normal    at    11am     (1100).        I went   outside to see to the

              tables when          I came back my barmaids were a l re ad y serving two fans of a

              group of about             12,    I found out they were                  part of a mini     bus group

              and they were young                lads and       1 didn't        like the app ea ra nc e      of them,          so

              I told them t h e y ’d have to                  leave and tried to explain why,                 one

              i mm ed ia te ly     began swearing at me and                    I said to the group,          "If you have

              left    him at home you might                   have got served."            I stood my ground and

              e v e n t u a l l y they    left.    Fr o m them on         I stood on the door mo ni t o r i n g               the

              numbers      going     in the       pub and also           refusing entry to some.             I only

              really     let m i d d l e - a g e d groups         in,    I let one m i n i — bus with about              12

             licencee       of the

            and they were           very well    behaved.     In all   I had about ^50 fans    in the

             pub    including the m i n i - b u s    group.   There were    no problems or damage

             caused and I was          pleased with their        behaviour and my takings       for a

            Saturday        doubled.

            After     the match a mi ni - b u s      called at the      pub to use the telephones.

            The     bus was or g a n i s e d by the Fa rmers Arms,       Liverpool    (Tel Liverp ool

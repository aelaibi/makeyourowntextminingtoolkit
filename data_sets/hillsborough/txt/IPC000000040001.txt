                      COMPLAINTS AGAINST CHIEF CONSTABLE TO BE INVESTIGATED

                South Yorkshire Police Authority today (Thursday, March 22) ordered
          an investigation into complaints arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy
          made against Chief Constable Peter Wright.
                The complaints by Mr Trevor Hicks, Mr Phillip Hammond and
          Mr B W Devonside arose out of statements made by Mr Wright to the local
          press at the time his impending retirement was announced*
                A special meeting of the Authority decided, after studying the
          complaints and listening to the advice of the Authority's Solicitor, to
          refer the complaints to the Police Complaints Authority to supervise the
          investigation. The Chief Constable of the West Midlands will investigate
          the complaints, as he has all other complaints arising out of
          Hillsborough.
                Agreement to this referral at this stage does not imply acceptance or
          otherwise of the validity of the complaints.

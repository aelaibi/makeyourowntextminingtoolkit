The Right Hon. the Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
The Hillsborough Scrutiny
Room 1106
50 Queen Anne’s Gate
LONDON
SW1H9AT

Dear Lord Justice

Thank you for your letter dated 13 October.

I enclose copies of my correspondence with South Yorkshire Police about the
tapes. This consists of our original letter of application to the Chief Constable
and a reply from his deputy. These appear to be the best copies on our files.

I am sending our tapes to you by courier. These are 12 X 60-minute Betacam
SP tape copies of the VHS tapes we borrowed from South Yorkshire Police.
Although I have no special technical knowledge of the copying process, I
believe that the quality of the pictures on our tapes is neither better nor worse
than the tapes which the police lent us. I do not know if those police tapes
were the original tapes recorded at the ground, or copies. We have noticed an
apparent defect in the recordings at around 2.35 pm (the pictures slow down)
and around 2.54 pm (the pictures speed up) which we are unable to explain.

Our tapes are labelled on the spines of the cases as follows:

        FT Hillsborough # P1                    (Part 1)

    These labels were written by me when we were making our programme, and
    were simply for our reference, "FT" standing for FIRST TUESDAY, the name
    of our series, and "P" as in "P1, P2" etc standing for Police.

    During our research for the programme, West Midlands Police gave us a copy
    of their summary of the audio-visual material available to them, and I enclose
    a copy of that document for your reference. It does not directly relate to the
    tapes lent to us by South Yorkshire Police. I also enclose our list of some of
    the content of the tapes. While this is not comprehensive, I hope it may be
    helpful to you.

    Yours sincerely

         Dear Mr Bryer

         I refer to your letter dated 4 July addressed to the Chief
         Constable, Mr Wright.

         I thank you for the opportunity of discussing the general nature of
         the documentary and South Yorkshire's possible contribution.

         With regard to your request to copy of way of illustrative material
         the video tapes and still photographs supplied by South Yorkshire
         Police to the West Midlands Police for use in the Inquiry, I am
         pleased to give you that approval.  I would hope as a matter of
         courtesy that we will be able to discuss further the illustrative
         material gained from that source and intended to be used in your
         national network television documentary.

         Yours sincerely
INQ11-24

                          VIDEO/PHOTOGRAPHIC SECTION

VIDEO

In terms of video footage the section has possession of 71 hours of
original footage relating to the 1989 game taken from the BBC, South
Yorkshhire Police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, and other sources.
A further 33 hours of material has been obtained in relation to games in
1981, 1987 and 1988 from similar sources.

All of the video material has been viewed, scheduled for content, indexed
and copied.

PHOTOGRAPHS

The section presently has possession of 2,302 photographic prints or
slides drawn from a total of fifty eight sources. A total of 663 of
these originate from South Yorkshire Police, with the remainder coming
predominantly from local and national newspapers.

Each photograph has been individually examined, numbered and scheduled for
content, and indexed.

The manual schedules created for both video and photographs have now been
inputted onto an ’Apple* computer.

AUDIO

The South Yorkshire Police Force command and control tape covers a 24 hour
period and has 25 separate sound channels which have been copied in their
entirety onto 900 individual 40 minute cassette tapes.

Of these a total of 22 hours and 40 minutes covering periods of particular
relevance have been transcribed.

The ongoing priorities to date, can be categorised as follows:

(a)     The supply of material to the Judicial Inquiry both written, in the
        form of schedules, and visual, in the form of composite tapes,
        generation copies of specific tapes, copies of photographs and
        Maps. Up to the present time 104 hours of footage has been
        supplied.

(b)     The supply of material to the Health and Safety Executive in the
        form of enlarged photographs and 12 hours of blow up sections of
        video tape relevant to gate openings, turnstile operations, crowd
        flows and surges.

(c)     Examination of all visual material with a view to identifying the
        location(s) of deceased either prior to, or following their death.
        At this time, 54 persons have either been positively or possibly
        identified in the pens or on the pitch.

        95 Individual folders containing visual and photographic evidence
        are being prepared in relation to each deceased for use at the
        Coroners Inquest.

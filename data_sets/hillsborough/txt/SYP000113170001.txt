               Whilst at the Don c a s t e r Police S t a t i o n                      I checked that all my m a n p o w e r

               learned that one man PC                                           had   requested        p e rmission to go

doubled       up with the              officer          due    to being        one man down on my detail.

Numerous Liverpool                   fans had alre a d y started to arrive                               and    it soon

became apparent                 t h a t .the        busiest        stre t c h of road would               be Middl e w o o d

Rd from Wads ley Lane                    toCatch Bar Lane.                     This       stretch of           road    is

p.redorrd nent'ly shops                and         take     away fast         food     premises.          ihe re were a

large amount              of Liverpool               fans     in    this area.

As      I patroled along M i d d l e w o o d Rd                     large amounts of              fans were

arriving, 1 was a s k e d               two main questions.                          In fact       only two

questions?            the     second          always        followed the        1   st.

1   .                 Where       can,I park?

E„                    Where       can        I get a drink?

If the fans were                  walking           the question was            restricted to              'Where       can    1

get a drink!                On each occasion                  1 was a s k e d where           intoxicants             comd     De

bought       1 decli n e d          to tell          them stating            that    I was from D o ncaster and
d i d n ’t know the area.

Word soon spread betw e e n fans as                   if by telepathyxtfher-e both off

licences and public                houses were -situated

About     1.30 pm there 'were a large numbc-y^uf drunken Li v e r poo 1 fans                              sat

in the       pub car       park of       'The Park* .    They were      roudy.       Insp Hufnpries

told me that          he expec t e d a bit of trouble and asked me to                       provide        two

men from my detail                to stand on the       corner    of wads l e y Lane and

M i d d l e w o o d Rd.     PC Thornton and Ma r t i n         took   up this      position about

•1.45pm.       1 also       remained       in the    location with PC Shaw.             The

pedestrian traffic                had been heavy but       no trouble        had occurred.            When

we arrived          back at       the    location the    drunken fans had           left    the area.

I noticed        that      the m a j o r i t y of the fans were        the worse      for     drink ana

many were       drunk         and staggering.          1 also noticed       Chat    very few        people

were walking          to      the ground the m a j o r i t y were walking           up W a d s l e y Lane

to an Off Licence                I was    informed had stocked up fully with

intoxicants and had six                   staff working and also          to a pub some            distance

away.

The m a j o r i t y of      people were       just    stand or sitting        on the       pavement,

service       road at         the junction of W a d s l e y Lana and M i d d l e w o o d Rd and

the    car    park of         The Park.       I w a t c h e d them drinking a range           of

intoxicating          drinks       i n c l u d i n g , Car Isberg Special    Brew,    Guinness,

Numerous       brands       of    lager and beer.        This    beer/lager was         contained          m

either       four    pack    cans       or 2 litre    or 2 1/2. litre bottles.              Myself PC

Shaw and       Insp Hum p h r i e s made       numerous     comments      to each other            about

the sheer amount             of drink       that was    being    consumed.         We spoke about

our feelings          of the Off Licence             owner and    publican selling            so much

drink     to drunken         people.        I stated    that    1 hoped     if any damage was

caused       it would       be    to their    property    in such large amounts               that    they

would     never      open for a football             m atch again.      .1. never    returned        up

M i d d l e w o o d Rd a gain      it was    obvious that my services were                 of more        use

                                                                                                          R ii4 6

at    this    junction.        About 2 . 15pm I heard a radio t r a n s m i s s i o n that

th e r e    w e r e a group of people at the public house a l r e a d y for                            causing

trouble.        Public Order          vehicles were           deployed.       I a gain made           the

comment       that    it would       be nice      if these        fans   caused any damage,               it

would       he to the       pub,

Many       fans were       standing about and           it became apparant            that        they did

not have 't i c k e t s .      I was a p p r o a c h e d    b y many youths asking^t'f I knew

w here .they., could get            some,      I saw and heard many             s^fng.            ’Have you

got any spares'              I also heard quite a few people                   say    ’Come        on we'll

get    into    the ground wit h the             crowd t h e y 511 let us         i-r*' .     Whe n    1 heard

these and similar             comments        I remember         thinking    'You've       got another

thing       coming mate?       o b v iously you haven't             been to S h e f f i e l d      b e f o r e ' .'

Up until 2 . 3 0 pm pedestrian                traffic      going    towaras    the ground had been

light.        At -.2.30pm as        if by someone          pressing a button the              situation

had    reversed.          Everybody         now was    heading      for the ground.               Looking       up

W a d s l e y Lane    the    pedestrian traffic             grew and grew.           At    first      the

pavement was          blocked but           then naif      the    road was    covered with

Liverpool        fans,       The    vast m a j o r i t y of      these   people were         the worse          for

drink.        Many still       carried four           packs      of beer and     lager.           i couldn't

imagine       how    they were       going     to consume         such quantities          before

entering       the ground,          particularly as man y were               unsteady        on their

feet.        I remember       thinking        quite    naively      'This    lot has        no hope       of

getting       in,    in tneir       condition',

I positioned myself                on the     corner    of W a d s l e y Lane and rliddiewood Rd

so they would             see a uniform        presence as they           came down the hill.                   1


looked to -my.rear            towards Leppi ngs Lane ana                 I saw the         road    completely

blocked up with             pedestrians,          I d e p loyed PC T h o rnton        to .stop all

vehicular        traffic      going     down Leppi ngs Lane and send                 it all        down

M i d d l e w o o d Rd.

As    the    crowd    continued        to    come down W a d l s e y Lane       1 had o c c asion to
                                                                        '                                              i"fvje.

speak      to many         people about            their    foul    language and behavicsur.                           In

the    time    this     being    directed       I believed at the Police.                        Whilst        in the

remember       thinking        "when this       is over we are           going       to have       one hell              of

.1 saw many Police Officers                   in the     pens    in deep shock.              After           tne

bodies were       removed        I spoke to several              officers       in particular                 young

W H O ’s who    looked     close       to cracking        up and had          Lears    running           down

their     cheeks.       All     declined a s s i s t a n c e     or to leave the area.                        I was

so    impressed       by young        officers       o b viously    in early days of               service yet

wanting       to do so much to help.

I became aware           of a fan very upset who was                    looking       for    his     friend.              1


saw him t r y     to     get    to    the    pitch    avid a Police O f f i c e r       wa        te 1   1   i n g h im

to go the other way.                   Pushing       d e veloped and      I i nterveened

immediately       pulling        the PC away.           Another        officer       I believe           a Sgt

spoke     to trie fan who            fcroke down      in tears,        Pie was       taken away,                ihe PC

was    obviously        suffering with stress              from tne       incident and friendly

a civ ice only was        given but the mood of the                    fans    pointed out           to him and

the    effect    it     could have          on all    of us.       Whilst      in the       pen    I spoke           to

Sgt Michael       Roddis        from DZ A tt e r c l i f f e ' f o r a matter          of a few seconds

o-r so.

I then     returned       to the       rear yard at L e p pings Lane and                    close        to the

gate    1 saw a PC giving mouth to m outh                       to a male       on    i<he f .loor «

Another PC was a s s isting with                 cardiac massage.              This     fan was              dying

and    reviving.         I was       told he had done           this    twice.        insp H u mphries was

also    there,        I was asked to find some                  oxygen.        I went       outside and saw

an ambulance          stuck     in the middle          of fans      on. the     road.        1    fought my

way    through the fans and the abuse                     that     followed wit h my              presence.               i

                 without      tne ambulance,               waiting       for    it all    the time..       1    took hold of

                 him by the h a n d / a r m and said ."Please                     corns, we have         some    one being

                 I then went        to the         service        road at the       rear of the          compound w hich

         My fears       of the        incident were         restricted to the       h o s tility of the

the    front          of       the       terraces           were          crushed         against          the m e t a l          mesh       fencing

obviously             distressed                 appeared             in orde r,              but    I was        aware          that

a teenaged                female          who     was       pressed               tightly       against           the     fencing            looked

fence        with         her       hand     but       she       had       been         pushed       so    far     forward             t hat    her

by    shouting            to    them.          The     tan s        were    shouting              ba ck      to    us    that       they were

unable        to     go      back.

At    th is    time          there        w as     only        s m al l    number        of P o l i c e           Officers          at    the

I go t       down       from        the    ledge          and       walked        along       the          length       of    the     centre

section        of       the     terraces.              I could            see     that       by       now a       l a rge     number          of

fans     appeared              to    be    distressed and                    in    pain.          The       girl     I had      seen a

short        time       earlier           appeared             to    have       lost     consciousness.                      I again          stood

on    the     l e d ge       and     looked          into       the       centre        section.             There       was    no       sign       of

the     crush        easing.             All     the      fans       in t h i s     section                were    packed       tightly

together.

A    number        of     fans       in the            s e c t i o n to the         left              of   the     centre       s e c t i o n were

becoming           very        angry and               a b u s i v e to us        by     this          time.       There       was       no

problem        in th is             section.

A short        time          l a t er     there        appeared            to     be a       larger          Police          presence          in

that, a r e a        and       more       Police          Officers           stood       on       the       concrete          ledge,,         As

peach        over       the     fen c e ,        take      hold        of t h e m a n d           drag       them       up a n d      over

the     f en c e .      At     this       t im e       I assisted a number                            of   f ans    t o get         s a f e l y over

the     top    of       the     fencing            and     down       onto        the    perimeter                trac k.      The       fans       I

assisted           were        able       to w a l k       away        from       the    area          themselves,             although

they     were        obviously             very        frightened and                   shaken             none    appeared           badly

injured.

A    short     time          later        there        were         so m a n y     Police             Officers          near    to       the

fencing        that          I wa s       unable          to    get       b ack    onto       the          ledge,       so    X went          onto

the     pitch        near       to       the     g o al    a re a .       It wa s       at    this          time     that      I noticed

                I saw        that     two       Officers             were       having        difficulty              in    carrying             a youth        so

                The     youth        was        very          pale    and       appeared           unconscious.              We       laid       h i m on his

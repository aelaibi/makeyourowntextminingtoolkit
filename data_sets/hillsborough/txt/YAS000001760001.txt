1.   I am employed as a Control Assistant for SYMAS.


2.   My date of birth is 10th August 1956.


3.   I joined SYMAS on 22nd April 1985.



4.   I was not on duty on 15th April.              I had arrived back from
     shopping with my fiance,                         who also works for
     SYMAS, shortly after 1500.        We put the television on and saw
     scenes on Grandstand from a football ground.              The pictures

     went off and came back a few minutes later and it was only
     then    that   we   realised     that   the    pictures   were    f rom
     Hillsborough.



5.   David asked me to telephone SYMAS Control and I did so to

     tell them that he was on his way and I asked if they wanted
     me to come in as well.     They said that they did.



6.   We arrived at Control at about 1530 and I went straight to

     work.   The telephones were ringing constantly.           By the time
     we had arrived the incident room had already been set up and
     Mr Clarke and                  were in there.                    was on
     the emergency control board and Mr                     on the normal
     outpatients board.

                               33 0
    7.   I do not recall receiving any calls to do with the incident

         other than press calls.     A separate telephone was set up to
         deal with press calls shortly after I came in.    I also dealt
         with a number of "routine" 999 calls.



    Dated this   %   day of   h A st~ ^j   1989.

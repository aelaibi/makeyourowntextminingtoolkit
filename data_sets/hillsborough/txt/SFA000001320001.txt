          For the attention of Ms. Oates, Legal Department                                                                            4th July, 1989




          Dear Mad a m ,

                                                           Re: Miss Susan Davies

                    I refer to our previous discussions on the telephone
          concerning the above named member of my Trade Union clients, the Fire
          Brigades Union.

                    I confirm that it is now intended to bring a claim for
          libel  on   her  behalf   against  Newsgroup   Newspapers,  including
          litigation should no voluntary satsifactory proposals be put forward.

                    In these circumstances I would be obliged if the Fire
          Authority would refrain from making any complaint to the Press
          Council, as to do so would involve my client having to waive her
          right to bring such a claim and in any event could prejudice the
          claim.

                    Bearing in mind, also, that the libel against my client
          arose purely out of the performance of her duties with the Fire
          Authority, and I understand that the Fire Authority are satisfied
          that her duties were correctly performed, is South Yorkshire Fire and
          Civil Defence Authority prepared to make a contribution towards the
          costs of bringing this litigation?

                          I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.


                                                               Yours faithfully,

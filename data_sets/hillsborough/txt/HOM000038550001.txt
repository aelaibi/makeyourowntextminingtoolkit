I ANTHONY JAMES EDWARDS will say:                I was b o r n o n



I work as an ambulance man on day work.                 I joined SYMAS in

September 1988.     I started part time and was promoted to day
                                              '/
work   on    6th March 1989.    I had previously been in the

ambulance     service   in    1973   in   Liverpool     and    had    received

qualified status.       I had done further training which lead to

me   being   admitted   as     a   Fellow   of   the   Ambulance      Service

Institute.       This    is    a   qualification       above    the    normal

standard but it is not a paramedics course although it is an

introduction to it.          I left the service in 1982 and went to

Sheffield Polytechnic to do social studies.                    I worked in

adult education until I rejoined the service.



On Thursday and Friday I worked a shift of 0800 hours to

1630 hours.



On Saturday I was to work from 0900 hours to 1730 hours.                     I

        was with             who is a qualified ambulance man and

was acting as driver.



The first I remember about the Hillsborough incident is when

we were taking a patient to the Northern General Hospital.

We heard control telling a crew from Rotherham to go to the

gym at Hillsborough where they would be met by a station

officer.      I thought that it would be some form of a fight

going on.     Our radio was on the day frequency which I think
is channel 1^.        We stayed on the channel all the way through

the     day.     We    did          change       to    ERC
                                                                                 u

It was about 1510 to 1515 hours when we wejpe on our way to

the   Northern        General     Hospital.       We    arrived   at     Northern

General about 5 minutes later.                There were various messages

coming over the radio but I was concentrating on the patient

in the ambulance.          We took the patient into the hospital and

it was sometime before 1530 hours when we got back to the

ambulance and started to clean up.                We then gave the call to

control that we were clear.               I made the call on channel

Control    then told us           to go   to Hillsborough gym entrance

where we would be met by an ambulance officer.                     We did not

know which side the gym entrance was on and I was going to

use the radio to try and find out where the entrance was.

We went down to the traffic island on Herries Road which is

about    one   and     a   half   miles   away.        Control    then    gave   a

message to all mobiles.             They repeated that it was for all

mobiles    and     said    that    they   were    to    proceed   to     the   gym

entrance at Hillsborough as they had notification of some

fatalities.      I think this was around 1530 hours.                We arrived

at the ground at about 1532 hours.                    There were no problems

in approaching the ground until we reached the junction of

Herries    Road,      South and     Penistone Road.          There were        two

ambulances in front of us and a police officer was directing

us to park behind them.              A short time later,          probably no

more than a minute we were moved into the entrance while the
next ambulance was sent to the further gate.                            I saw

       standing outside the first entrance and pointing for us

to go into it.          The police officer shouted to us that if we

went to the second entrance then we would be, able to get out

via the first entrance.                     said no and that he wanted us

to go into the first entrance.                   We did so.          We were met by

Mr.Hopkins        the        Assistant         C h ief     Ambulance         Officer.

Mr.Higgins was         also there.          Higgins        told us      to drive up

behind an ambulance which was already parked and almost at

the same time Hopkins told us to go on to the field.                                     At

this    stage     there       were      rows    of    police         with   vans        and

stretchers coming out of the entrance on to the pitch.                                   It

was clear that there were dead bodies on at least two of the

stretchers.       I would say the time was about 1535 hours.



We were stopped by a police officer at the entrance to the

corridor to the pitch.               The officer at the front of the

ambulance said that we could not get through.                               Spectators

were shouting at us about a body on a stretcher.                            We stopped

and Hopkins came up to the ambulance and opened the door.                                 I

said   that   the      police officer          said      that   we    could       not    go

through    and    he    replied      that      he    wanted     us    on    the    pitch

immediately.          He said that there were casualties at the far

end of the ground and he needed us on the pitch and that we

were not to stop for anyone until we got to the far end of

the ground.           He told us to put our two tones on and go

through.         We    did    as   we    were       told    and      went   past        the
                policemen.   It was slow progress getting on to the pitch but
                            <e»— --- —------                            —--
                we certainly did not get stuck. On the pitch we saw five to

                six   boards      being       used   as    stretchers      with   bodies    thereon

                being carried by fans.                We drove past them^while they were

                screaming        at    us     to   stop.      The   St.John's      ambulance     was

                leaving     the       pitch    as we      came   through    the   entrance.       It

                waited until we were out of the way before going off the

                pitch.      We were the only ambulance on the pitch by this

                stage.      We drove up to the 18 yard box in front of the west

                stand.      There       were people everywhere. My driver was looking

                for an officer but we could not find one anywhere.                            There

                were fans bashing on the ambulance wanting us to stop and

                help their friends.                We were approached by a woman and she

                sh o uted    through           the   window       and    said     that     she   had

                resuscitated a casualty.                   I got out of the vehicle with a

                bag, mask and airways, and went to a body which was lying in

                front of the goal in the 18 yard area.                      Someone was giving

                mouth to mouth resuscitation.                    I noticed the colour of the

                patient and was doubtful whether the patient had in fact

    ^           been revived.           All the time there were people shouting at me

                for oxygen and all I could remember shouting was "one at a

                time."       I    knelt       down   over    a   male    casualty   and     someone

                deliberately kicked me in the back and said "what about my

    uovvA       daughter."        I    continued co look after the boy on the floor.

            J   I decided that we needed to move him.                        I told the people

‘               around me to pick him up and I shouted to someone to bring a

                girl that I had also briefly seen.                      I would say it was now
about 1540 hours.          I looked for my driver and he had driven

over to the other side of the goal towards the corner flag.

We carried the bodies over to the ambulance and I was being

followed by people carrying other bodies.                     Wfien I got to the

ambulance I saw that someone had already opened the back

doors.      I asked a police officer to stay with me to look

after me after I was kicked.                We put the young boy on the

left   hand     side    and    the girl     on    the   right hand      side    and

someone else put another body on the floor down the middle.

Then someone tried to get another person into the ambulance.

I shouted to the policeman to take the person off and he did

so.



When     I turned      round    again   the      ambulance was     packed with

people and so I asked the police to clear the ambulance.

The doors were closed but X could hear people kicking the

back doors and wanting attention.                    In the ambulance there

were     now    three     bodies,       a   nurse,      two    policemen,      two

spectators,      my driver and me.               One of the spectators was

trying     to   revive        the   young   boy.        The    nurse    was    from

Nottingham.      She had been a spectator who had volunteered to

help during the chaos on the pitch.                  She was using a bag and

mask correctly.          The other spectator was holding the head of

the girl.       I told                      o get going.               put on the

lights and horns and drove off the pitch.                       I have no idea

what time it was by now.             I assume that the man on the floor

was dead.       I tended to the girl and showed how to do mouth
to     mouth   resuscitation       while    the    spectator    did    cardiac

compressions.          I was very upset by this stage.                I cannot

remember anything about getting out of the ground and I do

not    know    what    time   it   was.     I remember     nothing     of   the

journey up to the Northern General Hospital.



We took the three bodies into casualty and I assisted the

doctor for a few minutes.            We then loaded trolleys back on

to the ambulance.         I asked the spectator nurse to come back

with us and she agreed.            I cannot remember any instructions

as to what we were to do next.               We drove back down to the

ground and I could hear conversations on the radio to do

with Hillsborough but I was not really taking them in.



There were no problems in the approach to the ground, with

police    cars    everywhere.        This   time    we   went   through     the

second entrance.         There were a couple of ambulances ahead of

us.     I also saw a West Yorkshire ambulance.              I said to

          that I would report to an officer to see what wanted

to be done.           I went to an ambulance officer in the yard

although I do not know his name.              He said that

was to stay with his vehicle and that I was to help as much

as I could.           I went back to the ambulance to tell                   to.

stay with his vehicle but discovered that he had gone.                        I

went to the next ambulance and helped myself to a first aid

box.     Just then a casualty on a trolley was brought up.                   He

appeared asthmatic and semi-conscious.                   I put him on the
second     ambulance.      Then   the    attendant       on   the    second

ambulance,                 , arrived with another casualty.            Once

they were loaded,       that ambulance set off to the hospital.

                                                     /
I then met another officer whom I did not know.               He told me

to help some of the casualties out and pointed towards the

gym.   I did not realise before this that the casualties were

in the gym.      I went into the gym and met Station Officer

Higgins.     He said that I was to assist priorities.                I then

helped with trolleys and directed arriving ambulance men to

priority casualties.       Each time I loaded a priority onto a

trolley I went back to the senior officer in the yard to

tell him what I had done and asked for more instructions.

He would then tell me to go looking for priorities again.



At one stage I offered to be a runner because there appeared

to be no communication system between the officers at the

ground as the radios were not working.         Within a short space

of time we did not need trolleys and were onto the walking

wounded.     By this time I felt exhausted and explained to

Station Officer Higgins that I had been kicked.               He told me

that I had to go to casualty.           I did not want to.          He said

that there was a vehicle going to Hallamshire Hospital and

said that I should go with it.



I was at the Hallamshire for about 20 minutes.

then arrived with some doctors who were needed at casualty.
      it was quite by accident that we met up at the Hallamshire.


14.   The control officer on the radio told us to have a drink at

      the Hallamshire.            We did so and we took |wo transfers to

      King Edward Hospital.              We finished at King Edwards at about

      1900 and then control told us that we were finished.                   We

      went back to the station, cleaned the ambulance and went off

      shift.



15.   I was not aware that there was any Hillsborough plan or of

      the role that the gym was the play in it.             I did not realise

      that     the   gym    was    the    casualty   clearing centre   or   the

      temporary mortuary until I was told by one of the officers.

      I was aware of the major incident plan prior to this.

     Dear     Lord     Justice          Smith,


                                      My     name        is     Anthony             James       Edwards        and        I    am

    writing       to y o u        in c o n n e c t i o n       with       your       investiaations               into        the

    Hillsborough             football            stadium           disaster         on    15th April,             1989.            I

    was     an   Ambulance            Attendant           on       the    day       of    the    in c i d e n t    and        was

    present       at    the g r o u n d           that       afternoon.              Since       that     time       I have

    left     the A m b u l a n c e       Service         an d      am now       li vi n g       in Scot lan d.

    S o m e time a g o I wa s info rme d,                     by r e p o r t e r s f r o m "The C o o k R e p o r t "

    not    presented         at       the C o r o n e r ' s        i nqu es t       into    the     d e a t h of     Kevin

 Williams.             My        ambulance          arrived          at    the       Hillsborough             ground          at

 approximately                   15.35       that      day         yet    no     mention          was    made        of       my

 ambulance           a nd    this        w as     in   fact        used    as       a means       of    discrediting

 the      evidence          of    P -c - B r u d e r ,        an    off    duty          policeman.           This       fact

wa s       confirmed             by    the       Coroner           himself,          Mr     P opper,        during            an

 in terview with             Roger         Cook        for    the        television proaramme.                     As     vou

pitch        concurs         almost        exactly            with       the    original         statement           given

by     P.C.      Bruder.

Six m o n t h s        before         Kevin's          inquest,           on   21st       O ctober       1989,      I was

I ANTHONY JAM ES EDWARDS will say:


I make this statement further to my statements of 7th May 1989 and 25th October 1989

appended hereto.



In my statement of 7th May 1989, at paragraph 7 ,1 describe how, when attempting to

enter onto the pitch at Hillsborough I was prevented from doing so by a police officer.

Both myself and the driver proceeded onto the pitch. We were obstructed from doing

so by a line of approximately ten policemen who had formed a cordon across the

entrance to the pitch. One of those police officers left the cordon and approached the

ambulance. He was not a senior officer he was a police constable. He stated “You

can’t go on there, they’re still fighting”. The time then was approximately 3.25-3.30

pm.



My driver then shouted Alan Hopkins (the Assistant chief Ambulance Officer). I told

him that the police officer had said that we could not go on the pitch. Alan Hopkins

stated that he did not care who said we could not go on. He told us that he wanted us

to go to the top of the field and not to stop for anybody until we saw Paul Eason. This

surprised me because I thought Paul Eason was actually outside the ground.

He then told us to put our two tone horns on. He actually reached across and put the

horns on for us.

I was later informed that Alan Hopkins had seen the chaos at the Leppings Lane end

because he had been involved in getting the 10 year old victim into the first ambulance.



In order to reach the Leppings Lane end of the ground we actually drove onto the
grass. I was unable to see Paul Eason in the melee of people at the Leppings Lane end
                                   I
of the pitch. One possible reason is that SYMAS officers wore police officer type

uniforms (White shirt, black tunic and trousers and black tie). It was impossible to

spot an ambulance man amongst a whole load of police officers who were at the scene.

As I alighted from the vehicle just in front of the goal, I started to try to do some

triage but it was clear that there were no other ambulances coming onto the field.



 In my previous statement dated 25 October 1989,1 also refer to somebody kicking

me. The West Midlands police had interviewed me and kept referring to this incident.

They seemed to think that the person who had kicked me was Trevor Hicks and they

were simply trying to help me to identify whoever it was. They kept referring back to

this incident but on the scale of things it was not important. It had shocked me at the

time but it was only a minor incident. Ambulance staff regularly receive minor Assault

in the course o f their duty. They wanted me to prepare a statement and asked if I

wanted to prosecute the person who had injured me. I cannot recall the names of the

West Midlands police officers. They also showed me some photographs and a video

of my ambulance coming onto the pitch at 3 .35 pm.



In paragraph 8 of my statement of 7th May, I describe how my ambulance was loaded

i-with three casualties, ajiurae, two policemen, two spectators, my driver and me. The

two spectators were Trevor Hicks and the nurse. I would like to add that I had

assumed that when we got to where the other ambulances were collecting ie the

gymnasium entrance the bodies would be taken off and triage carried out. However,

before I knew where we were, we were on Herries Road on our way to the hospital.

At this stage I would add that we had no difficulty in negotiating the ramp either onto
the pitch or when we were exiting. This is contrary to a comment in the Taylor

Report. (See paragraph 302).                 the driver of the ambulance can confirm

that we had no difficulty in negotiating the ramp when entering or exiting the pitch.

After unloading the casualties at the Northern General Hospital we returned to the

ground. I have since discovered that an Ambulance did get stuck on the ramp. It was

driven by                      jrom Langley Ambulance Station, however, this had

taken place before any Ambulance was ordered onto the Pitch.



I recall that the scenes in the gymnasium were chaotic. It was full of police officers. I

can remember a young policewoman crying. I did not see many Senior ambulance

officers except for one a lead Ambulance man from Middlewood Ambulance Station

who set up a drip in the gymnasium at around about 4.00 pm. Police officers were

laying bodies out in rows. Many of the bodies had shirts over their faces. I can

remember row upon row o f blue jeans and trainers sticking out. Whilst attempting to

treat casualties I ran out of orofarangeal airways. We only had five or six of these on

our vehicle. The vehicle was not classified as an emergency vehicle. We were just on

routine duty that day. One of the things that occurred to me as I saw police officers

laying bodies out in the gymnasium was how few bodies had airways in them.

Inserting an airway into the mouth is one of the basic techniques one would expect to

use if someone had suffered unconsciousness from crush injuries. I always wondered

how many of those who died actually had resuscitation attempted on them by anyone

with basic medical knowledge.



At no time can I remember Hillsborough being declared as a major incident. I recall

that a Senior Ambulance Officer, Doug Marshall, was sent to fetch the major incident
vehicle. When he arrived at Hillsborough he did not know how to use it. Also, there

were paramedic crews standing by on Upper Thorpe awaiting further instructions.

These were never received.



I was not involved in any formal debriefing except an interview with a SYMAS

solicitor. The only debriefing took place in the mesh room, where many questions

were raised by staff, many said they phoned SYMAS and offered their services as they

watched the disaster unfold on TV.



A question I repeatedly asked myself after the disaster was ‘why on earth the

ambulance staff were not sent to the epicentre of the disaster with their equipment?’.

The ambulance staff were either outside of Leppings Lane or at the other end of the

football pitch outside the gymnasium. In my opinion the Ambulance crews ought to

have been ordered onto the pitch with instructions to triage. It was wrong to send

only three vehicles onto the pitch. Even basic medical equipment was not available at

the epicentre of the disaster, with injuries such as those suffered at Hillsborough, basic

but swift medical attention is required:

(a)    putting the injured into the recovery position;

(b)    clearing the airway so that the patient can breathe - often done by inserting a

        simple plastic tube of the kind carried by all ambulances.

        It was largely young football fans who carried the dying and injured the length

        o f the football pitch on makeshift stretchers before they received any kind of

        qualified medical attention. Many of the injured were carried on their backs

        rather than in the recovery position because of lack of basic medical

        knowledge. It would be unheard of in an equivalent disaster, on a train for
                example, for ambulance personnel to wait up on an embankment whilst the

                passengers carried bodies off the train.



12.   Only fourteen of the victims were taken to hospital and three o f those were in my

      ambulance. I believe that more people would have survived had the ambulance

      personnel together with their equipment been directed to the Leppings Lane end of the

      pitch as soon as the disaster unfolded. I repeat my remark from my previous statement

      that prior to the disaster I was not aware of any Hillsborough plan or the role that the

      gymnasium was to play in it. I was not aware that the gym was the casualty clearing

      centre.

TONY EDW ARDS, AMBULANCEMAN - PART 2


Does the attached statement by Mr Edwards seem familiar to you?


2.       The Support Group have just sent it to me, Mr Edwards having noticed that I did not
mention it in my recent letter to him (also attached). The Group say they had meant to send
it to us in response to point 6 of your letter to them of 13 October (in your folder).


3.     I really do not remember whether I have seen this Edwards statement before or not.
Some parts seem familiar, others don’t. But I don’t think that it should alter what I said to
him in my letter. It’s still not clear to me why you should need to see him and it is still up to
him to make a case for doing that.


4.      If you agree, I will write to him confirming that we now have this statement by him
(or that we had it all along) and would like to know a bit more about what he wants to say to
you before deciding whether you will see him.

       1.    I ANTHONY JAMES EDWARDS will say:


       2     1 make this statement further to my statements o f 7* May 1989 and 25* October 1989

             appended hereto.



       3.    In my statement of 7* May 1989. at paragraph 7 ,1 describe how, when attempting to

             enter onto the pitch at Hillsborough I was prevented from doing so by a police officer.

             Both myself and the driver proceeded onto the pitch. We were obstructed from doing

             so by a line o f approximately ten policemen who had formed a cordon across the

             entrance to the pitch. One of those police officers left the cordon and approached the

             ambulance. He was not a senior officer he was a police constable. He stated ‘'You

             can’t go on there, they’re still fighting”. The time then was approximately 3.25-3.30

             pm.



       4.    My driver then shouted Alan Hopkins (the Assistant chief Ambulance Officer). I told

             him that the police officer had said that we could not go on the pitch. Alan Hopkins

             stated that he did not care who said we could not go on. He told us that he wanted us

             to go to the top of the field and not to stop for anybody until we saw Paul Eason. This

             surprised me because I thought Paul Eason was actually outside the ground.

             He then told us to put our two tone horns on. He actually reached across and put the

             horns on for us.

              I was later informed that Alan Hopkins had seen the chaos at the Leppings Lane end

              because he had been involved in getting the 10 year old victim into the first ambulance.

 Thank you for your letter o f 10 November. I apologise for the delay in replying to it.

 It might be helpful if I explain that the task which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has accepted
 from the Home Secretary is to establish whether there is any significant new evidence about
 the Hillsborough Stadium disaster which was not previously available to Lord Taylor s
 Inquiry, to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting or police disciplinary authorities. If there is
 significant evidence, he intends to see if it would have affected the outcome o f any o f the
 proceedings. He hopes to report his findings to the Home Secretary by the end o f the year.

 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has asked me to say that he is grateful to you for writing. He has
 noted the points you have made in your letter and will take them into consideration.      e
 also have the statements you made to the police on 7 May and 25 October 1989.

 You suggest a meeting with the Judge. Before deciding whether that would be useful, we
 would like to know more exactly what it is you would like to say to him that you have not
 said in your letter. Perhaps you could contact me to discuss this further.

  I look forward to hearing from you.

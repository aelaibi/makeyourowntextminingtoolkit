            I am a single man and                  I reside at the above address with my

            parents .         I         presently unemployed,

            I am a Liverpool              supporter and have been all my life.

            This year my friend                                      got me a ticket             from An fi el d for          the

            semi-cu p final at H i l l s b o r o u g h          between Li verpool              FC and N o t t i n g h a m

            Fore st FC.

            I paid him £ 6 . 0 0 for              the ticket w h i c h was         to stand        in the Lep pin gs

            Lane     end of the grcKind.              I have never         been to H i l l s b o r o u g h before.

            On Sa t u r d a y the        15th Af^il      1989     (150489)        at about        11.00am     (1100)     we

            left                        on route     to Sheffield.           We were travelling               in a private

                          but    I c a n ’t remember       the number

                 ~S£ha#t 1 e , I don't know the number and
                                -x                              \               :

         only teenagers.

         I think       someone        has been to see                     but       I d o n ’t know what       happened.

         On the way we did have                 several    stops once for        to be sick, and
                                                  ,          j>  otr Y&jT .

         this ^iujt^t^have been about                 12.30 pm (1230)           we were       stuck       in traffic    for

         about     1/2 an hour.

         Fr om   then on it was           busy all       the way      into Sheffield.

         1 remember        seeing       cans    in the    road on the way                 into Sh ef fi el d and

         coaches       being     pulled by police,           but     I didn't             really witness much

         drinking      of alcohol,         a pub we stopped off at was                        closed.        There were a

         few supporters              I saw singing and shouting                     but    I d o n ’t know    if they

         were    drunk     that was at about 2.15 pm                 <1415)         a mile        from the ground.

         We ev en tu al ly       parked    in S h ef fi eld at about 2 . 0 0 p m                  (1400)    we were about

         2 miles away from the gro und near to a bridge                                   on a bend.

         I did see some              policemen directing            traffic          near    to     where we parked      but

         they were        not telling you where             to park.

         I do    not    remember        receiving any        police di re ct io n walking                   towards    the

         gro und    in fact       I think       I only saw about 4 pol icemen on the wa y. The re

         was     no trouble either walking                down to the ground just                     the

         general       crowd going         to the match.

         W X a r r i v e d at the entrance             to the       ground altogether,               this was at about

a.o.a    Wh en we      reached the         entrance       there was av e r ^ S a r g e             crowd     just waiting

         to get     in,    no queue        just one'^ltw^ssit d i d n ’t seem too bad at first,                        and
k /w £   we wai te d for a bit            before       joining      the    crowd to get             in.

                    had to do our best          to protect                 I remember      seeing    two    police

                    making "things worse.           EventuDslly I helped a policeman hold the blue

                    gates    c 1osed* outsi d e , because there was           no room,        but the fans were

                    getting    upset,    I d o n ’t know why because          they had no where            to go.

                    E v e n t u a l l y we ended up near to the blue           concertina gates,           the    crush by

                    now was    very bad.

                    There was orny me,                               at this stage,           the others we had

                    lost as soon as we entered the                crush.

                    I do    remember seeing a couple of kids on the wall above                        the turnstiles

                    but    I don't know how they got up there or why.

                    I do not       remember    seeing any stewards          outside     the ground.

                    All    of a sudden I saw thavvthe             blue    concertina gate        leading     into the

                    in but there was          r*Q one   to hand them       in to.

                    There were a couple of\s^tewards ar o un d the gate area but they were                             not

                    taking    tickets    or giving      directions.         Fr o m there      to the tunnel and

                    through    it I did not see any other                policeman or stewards.

                             has been there before and he knew where                    to go,    but all        I saw was

                    the tunnel      and the pitch and        it seemed       like the only place to go.

                    about    trying    to find a space       to stand back up,           just    prior     to me

                    falling    down    I remember someone saying,               "Is there a barrier              in front

                    of y o u ” .    I thought about       this an d I decided to stay down on the floor

              and go under          the barrier,          when    I'd got under       I just grabbed at           peoples

              clothing,       jeans,       anythin g      to stand myself       back up.           I was very

              fri gh te ne d at this         time for my own life,             all    I was    breathing was hot

              air.

              Eventually       I stood up but             I was    facing    the wrong way          looking    up the

              terracing,       I just       could not turn around.

              In front       of me were about & or                10 people all       of whom were trapped

cat           on the barrier,          most      of these        people were    screaming          for help,    their

              bodies were          curved aro un d        the barrier and there was                no way they were

              going     to get off         it.     E ve nt ua ll y I got my arms           free,    and a few of us

              tried to       push the       people off the barrier,             one of these            people beimg

              crushed on the barrier                I would describe as about 23 years,                      stocky

              build,       wit h dark brown short            hair,       brown eyes,       wearing a T shirt.              He

              was clean shaven.                                    CllWT                           ■
              I remember       he started to go a funny                   colour,    and    I could tell       how

              f rig hte ned he was as he knew he w a s n ’t going                     to get off the barrier.

              S l o w l y his eyes bulged and his head just                    dropped,       I presumed he died.

              I just       stood there       then with my head             in the air       breathing      slowly,     I

              was n't      going    to shout,       I knew       it wo uld do no good,         there were

              thous and s shouting already.

              I remember       looking       round then and seeing a gate at the front                         of the
CA~i
              pitch     it was      locked and       closed,       and    patroling    it were a couple of

C T A T d _   police officers,             people were screaming at them to open                        it but they

 „—           ignored them.

              Mo me nt s    later    I turned ar o un d again as             I was still       facing       the wrong

'Pj££lM£)'££5jay this time           I saw the gate open and                people    climbing         o u t , I thought

              I ’m getting         out".     The    two    police officers were             now helping       people

              through,       I think they had             realised the       problem.        Slo wl y I was shu ffled

              towards       the gate.        I remember          the   policewo man trying          to pull    someone

              outfromunderpeople.

Even when        I got to the gate         I couldn't      get straight       out,    I had to wait

until     I was     taken forward a little more             by the    pressing       crowd.

Peo p l e were      crawling     over my head getting         out.     As    I was getting out

my right        knee    caught   the gats      post.

 When    I got out      properly    I just     fell    to my knees     by the goal       net,       where
*
I rested        feeling W r y     dizzy.

I remember        looking    back   into the      pens once where         I saw people        crushed

up the f e n c &xwi t            i r faces nearly being        pushed through          it,    I

couldn't        look a ^ a i n after    that    it was    too upsetting.

It wasn't        long   before a policeman         came up to me put his hand on my

shoulder and told me             I couldn't      stay where     I. was,     and that    I was going

to have to go out,           I swore at him and told him I wasn't                    going    back     in

the     pens,    I said,     "Arrest me because           I'm not going       back    in".        He just

w a l k e d away.

I just     sat    there a while        longer and ev en t u a l l y a St Johns Am bulance

man     came up to me and a s k e d me          if I wa n te d to go to hospital             or    if I

needed oxygen,           I said no go and help the other              people still       in the

pens.

I was very        confused,      shaking and      crying all     I thought      is that       I want ed

to get out so I wa lk e d over             to a corner gate       I went      through    it,       up the

ter racing and out the back              to the West Stand.           I w a n d e r e d about

outside and e v en tu al ly sat down near                to the turnstiles and gate

th ro ug h which        I entered the ground.            I sat there just holding my

he?

I then Ih&w bodies          injured l^nd dead being          bought    out of the tunnel

area by policlr.           There were a lot of bodies            lying outside         near to the

turnstiles.

I sat there for about 5 minutes                  then went    outside       the ground and sat

on a wall        with other Live rpool         fans.      I was wo r r i e d now because my

head had        cleared and      I was wo rr ie d about                           >    I thought
                                                                                                 PA GE       6

      they w o u l d n ’t stand a chance.               I was outside       the ground for about      half

      an hour       then I decide d to go back to the                car.      On the wa y back a man

      as k e d me    into his house,        let me use the          phone and gave me a cup of

      coffee.

      I got   back     to the    car and got        in as            had left     it open.     Then   I

      saw            md                walki ng    back   but they were not        injured as they

      were    in a corner       pen.

      About 5 O'clock        (1700)                and         came back to the       car,    uni njured

      as they were        passed over a fence             in the ground.

      I did not see any drinking               in the ground nor did I witness an ything

      that was a cr imi n a \ o f f ence .

CAT   My views are that          it wa's badly org an iz ed by the F.A.             and the    police at

      the

      outside       to stop the massi ve          surge    through    into the tunnel.

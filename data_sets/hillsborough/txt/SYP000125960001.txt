             SPOKE WITH A POLICEMAN BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CLIMB
             OVER THE FENCING. HE OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT IT WAS CROWD PROBLEMS. NO
             ONE REALISED THAT IT WAS MORE SERIOUS THAN THAT. MY CONCERN WAS
             THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY STEWARDS. CONTD ON PAGE 3

CONTD FROM PAGE 2.    I KNEW YOU COULD GO TO THE SIDES BUT THERE WERE NO
SIGNS TELLING YOU THIS OR STEWARDS. TO MOST PEOPLE THE TUNNEL WAS THE ONLY
PLACE TO GO.   I AM NOT BLAMING THE POLICE, THEY HAD A DIFFICULT JOB TO DO.

THERE WAS ALOT OF POOUSHING AND SWAYING.   I WENT TO THE LEFT     SIDE OF  THE
TUNNEL. ICOULDNT GO FORWARD ANY FURTHER.    WHEN THE PROBLEMS     STARTED  PEOPLE
WERE TRYING TO GET OVER THE FENCES, BUT BECAUSE OF THE CONGESTION THEY
COULDNT REACH UP TO TAKE HOLD OF THE FENCE. THE POLICE INITIALLY DID NOT
APPEAR TO BE AWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING   UNTIL THE SUPPORTERS TRIED TO PULL
THE FENCE DOWN. BOTH PENS EITHER SIDE OFUS WERE RELATIVELY EMPTY. HAD SOME
P^fcON OPENED THE GATES WHEN THESE PROBLEMS BEGAN PERHAPS THIS WOULD OF
PREVENTED THIS INCIDENT. I SAW N 0 MARSHALLS IN THE GROUND AT ALL. THE

             WERE VERY FEW POLICE OFFICERS AROUND, THERE WERE NO QUEUES AT ALL
             AND TH E NEARER YOU GOT TO THE TURNSTYLES THE MORE CRUSHED YOU
             BECAME. MY TICKET WAS CHECKED AND TORN IN HALF. I BOUGHT A
             PROGRAMME AND THEN WENT DOWN INTO THE TUNNEL AS THIS APPEARED THE
             ONLY PLACE TO GO THERE WERE NO SIGNS DIRECTING PEOPLE AND NO

THERE WERE NO STREWARDS ABOUT TO ASK AND VERY FEW POLICE. WHEN I GOT INTO THE
PEN IT WAS ALREADY REALLY FULL SO I MOVED DOWN TO THE FRONT AS I FELT
UNCOMFORTABLE AT THE BACK. WHEN THE PLAYERS CAME OUT IT WAS THAT FULL I COULD
NOT SEE A THING AND THEN THERE WAS A BIG SERGE TO THE FRONT. TWO
POLICEOFFICERS AND A STEWARD BY THE PITCH LOOKED INTO THE PEN AND WE SCREAMED
AT THEM FOR HELP AND TO OPEN THE GATE ONTO THE PITCH, BUT THEY DIDN,T SEEM
TO REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING. WHERE I WAS PEOPLE WERE GRADUALLY BEING
SQUEEZED TO DEATH AND THINK SOMEONE DIED BEING PRESSED AGAINST MY SHOULDER. I
WAS VERY LUCKY ALL I SUSTAINED WAS BRUISED RIBS. BY THIS TIME I COULD NNNOT
MOt t AT ALL AND PEOPLE WERE DESPERATELY TRYING TO CLIMB OUT AND BE LIFTED
0 U " B U T WHERE I WAS IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO CLIMB OUT AS THEY WERE SO
PENNED IN AGAINST EACH OTHER. EVENTUALLY IT SEEMED TO BE A GOOD 10 MINUTES
THE GATE IN THE FENCING LEADING ONTO THE PITCH WAS OPENED AND SOME PEOPLE LET
OUT. I THINK THE POLICE THEN CLOSED IT AGAIN IN AN EFFORT TO RELEASE THE
PRESSURE, HOWEVER I THINK THEY THEN REALISED HOW SERIOUS IT ALL WAS AND AGAIN
OPENED THE GATE TO LET MORE PEOPLE OUT AND THINK EVEN MORE PEOPLE WERE
KILLED TRYING TO GET OUT OF THE GATE. I WAS TRAPPED FOR ABOUT 20 TO 25
MINUTRES AND AT ONE STAGE I STOPPED BREATHING AND I AM NOT QUITE SURE WHAT
HAPPENED. SOMEBODY SEEMED TO DRAG ME FROM BEHIND AND PULLED UNDER A BARRIER.
IT IS ALL VERY VAGUE.

WE DID NOT GET INTO THE GROUND UNTIL ABOUT 2.40. WE ALL HAD TICKETS YET
NOBODY CHECKED TO SEE IF WE HAD THEM UNTIL WE WENT THROUGH THE UNMANNED
TURNSTILES . THE ONLY TIME WERE WERE ALL CHALLENGED WAS WHEN WE WENT UP THE
STAIRS BY THE TUNNEL TO SIT DOWN. WHILST WE WERE INSIDE THE GROUND I NOTICED
THE LACK OF POLICE SUPERVISION AND STEWARD SUPERVISION. AT ONE STAGE I
WITNESSED FANS CLIMBING OVER THE MAIN WALL TO GET INTO THE GROUND AND NOBODY
WAS STOPPING THEM.
WHILST UPSTAIRS I WITNESSED THE SURGE OF THE CROWD BUT DID NOT SEE WHAT THE
CAUSE OF IT WAS. I DID NOT SEE THE GATES BEING OPENED .

             ONE GET IN.IT WAS CROWDED AT THE TURNSTYLES BUT THERE WAS QUITE
             AN ORDERLY QUE AT THE TIME.THERE WAS ABOUT TWO POLICE OFFICERS ON
             EACH TURNSTYLE SEARCHING AS WE GOT THROUGH.

THERE WAS A HEAVY POLICE PRESENCE OF POLICE BEFORE WE GOT TO THE TURNSTYLES.
BUT THE POLICE DIDNOT SEEM TO BE DIRECTING ANY ONERR THE MOUNTED POLICE WERE
DOING THIS BUT THEY APPEARED TO BE PUSHING EVERYONE INTO THE SAME AREA.AS WE
PASSED THE TURNSTYLES WE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR PEN 5. WE WENT ROUND THE SIDE TO
GET TO IT . WE KNEW WHERE WE WERE GOING AS WE HAVE BEEN BEFORE. I WAS VERY
SURPRISED AS WE WALKED PAST THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNELL BECAUSE IN PREVBIOUS
YEARS I HAVE SEEN LOCKED WHEN THE AREA BEHIND THE GOAL BECAME FULL ALSO THERE
ARE USUALLY POLICE OFFICERS STANDING THERE RE DIRECTING FANS WHEN IT BECAME
FULL. ONCE WE GOT INTO OUR PEN IT BECAME OBVOIUS THAT THE AREA BEHIND THE
GOAL WAS VERY PACKED I HAVE SEEN IT THAT FULL ON PREVOIUS YEARS BUT I DIDDNT
E X O C T IT TO GET ANY FULLER . PEOPLE THEN BEGAN CLIMBING OUT OF THIS AREA
I N W OUR BEN I THEN REALISED THAT IT WAS DANGEROUSLY PACKED. AS THE PLAYERS
CAME OUT IT WAS OBVOIUS THAT PEOPLE AT THE FRONT OF THE PEN NEXT TO US WERE
BEING INJURED. THE PEOPLE AT THE BACK DID NOT APPEAR TO REALISE THE SEVERITY
OF THE CRUSH.JUST BEFORE THE MATCH WAS ABANDONED I THEN SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING
OVER THE CRASH BARRIERS ONTO THE PITCH. ONE LAD GOT OVER THE BARRIER AND WAS
ESCORTED AWAY BY THE POLICE AS THOUGH HE WAS BEING ARRESTED. THE POILICE
DIDNOT APPEAR TO REALISE WHY THE FANS WERE CLIMBING OVER. SOME OFFICERS CAME
TO HELP AND REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT MORE OFFICERS ARRIVED AND DID NOT
SEEM TO REALISE WHAT WAS GOING ON THE APPEARED TO BE A LACK OF COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN THE POLICE.THERE WAS BODIES ON THE PITCH IN FRONT OF US THAT THE
POLICE HAD BEEN TRYING TO REVIVE. I WAS NOT INJURED AT ALL.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH,
1.1                                                                              I

A LACK OF COMMUNICATION.

MY BROTHER WENT IN A SEPARATE PARTY IN A CAR.
***************
MY BROTHER DIED IN THE
***************
NORTHERN GENERAL HOSPITAL AT 4.00 THAT DAY, AFTER BEING CRUSHED ON THE
TERRACES DURING THE MATCH. MY BROTHER:
PAUL DAVID BRADY, 21 YRS,                               LIVERPOOL
HE TRAVELLED WITH:
1. I      '     I
2. |               I   ■
3.^JIOSEPH MCARTHY, WHO ALSO DIED. I DON'T KNOW THEIR ADDRESSES. I THINK
            HAS ALREADY SPOKEN TO YOU.
I WENT WITH 3 OTHER PEOPLE IN ONE CAR.
1.                                             LIVERPOOL
2.                 I DON'T KNOW HIS ADDRESS
3.                 I THINK IT IS, ONE OF THE OTHERS MAY KNOW HIS ADDRESS, HE
LIVES JUST OUTSIDE HALIFAX.

THREE OF US    WENT IN BY PUSHING THROUGH THE TURNSTILES, ALTHOUGH WE ALL GOT
SEPARATED.     THE FOURTH, 1      IIS QUITE A SMALL CHAP AND HE GOT MANHANDLED BY
A POLICEMAN    UNDER THE LOW BARRIER TO GET HIM OUT OF THE CRUSH, AND HE WENT
THROUGH THE    EXIT GATE THAT HAD BEEN OPENED, A CONCERTINA GATE, AND INTO THE
GROUND THAT    WAY. THIS WAS ABOUT 2.55, WHEN THE FOUR OF US GOT INTO THE
GROUND.

WE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE TOILET, THE ONE TO THE LEFT OF THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE.
WHEN WE CAME OUT WE WALKED THROUGH THE TUNNEL, AND IT WASN'T DIFFICULT TO
WALK THROUGH AT ALL* IT WAS A CONTROLLED WALK THROUGH TO THE STADIUM.

WHEN I GOT ONTO THE TERRACE THE GAME HAD ALREADY KICKED OFF. THERE WAS A
DIVIDING FENCE IN FRONT OF THE TUNNEL DIVIDING THE TERRACES, AND WE WENT TO
THE RIGHT, AND STOOD IN LINE WITH OR A BIT FURTHER OUT FROM THE RIGHT HAND
GOAL POST. WE WERE ABOUT 2/3 UP FROM THE FRONT.
IT WAS A REAL CRUSH ON THE TERRACE. AT THIS STAGE THERE WERE PEOPLE ON THE
PITCH, AND PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE TO GET ONTO THE PITCH, AND IT
SUDDENLY DAMNED ON ME THAT THERE WERE MORE PEOPLE ON THE TERRACE THAN THERE
SHOULD BE. I REMEMBER SOMEBODY FELL DOWN IN FRONT OF A BARRIER IN FRONT OF
US AND EVERYONE SHOUTED “GET HIM UP, GET HIM UP". A FEW OTHERS FELL TOO, BUT
WE GOT THEM ALL UP.

WE REALISED THAT SOMETHING WAS SERIOUSLY WRONG; SOMEBODY RAN ONTO THE PITCH,
A YOUNG LAD, TO THE GOALKEEPER TO TELL HIM WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THE GOALIE
TOLD HIM TO GET OFF THE PITCH. AFTER THE GAME GOT STOPPED, AND THE POLICE
GOT INVOLVED. THEY WERE ON TOP OF THE FENCING AT THE FRONT, ONE WAS TELLING
PEOPLE TO PUSH BACK, PUSH BACK, AND AT THIS STAGE I WAS OP AGAINST A BARRIER,
AND I COULDN'T PUSH BACKWARDS, IT WAS SOLID BEHIND US, AND I THINK PEOPLE
WERE LOATHE TO LEAVE THE STADIUM BY THE TUNNEL IN CASE THEY THEM MISSED THE
MATCH. PEOPLE WERE BEING PULLED UP FROM THE TERRACING INTO THE STAND.
THE POLICE BY THIS STAGE WERE COMING THROUGH THE TUNNEL, PUSHING THE ABLE
BODIED OUT OF THE WAY AND GETTING THE DISTRESSED ONES INTO THE FRESH AIR.
THEN I COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING CARRIED OFF THE TERRACE AND THROUGH THE TUNNEL,
AND SAW PEOPLE ASHEN WITH BLUE LIPS.
I CARRIED A LAD OUT, I THINK HE WAS OK, HIS COLOUR WAS BETTER THAN SOME OF
THE REST. I WENT BACK IN, AND REALISED THAT PEOPLE HAD DIED. I SAW A YOUNG
LAD, EARLY TEENS, PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO PASS HIM OVER THE FENCE AT THE FRONT,
IltfOOK THEM AGES TO GET HIM OVER, HE WAS LIKE A LIMP RAG DOLL.
WPI,EFT THE TERRACE, AND STOOD WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE GROUND, AND JUST
STOOD AROUND. BY NOW THERE WERE A LOT MORE POLICE IN THE GROUND, AND ONE, HE
HAD PIPS ON HIS SHOULDER, SAID "THEY FORCED THE GATES". I THINK I'VE SEEN
HIM SINCE ON THE TV NEWS.

PROACHING LEPPINGS LANE BUT NONE IN LEPPINGS LANE. AT THE TURNSTILES THERE
WERE TWO OFFICERS ON HORSEBACK AND ABOUT ONE AT EACH TURNSTILE. THE OFFICERS
ON HORSEBACK WERE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE ORGANISED BUT THERE WASNT ENOUGH OF
THEM. BECAUSE OF THE CROWD I WAS FORCED UP AGAINST THE LEFT HAND GATE. MORE
PEOPLE ARRIVED AND THE CRUSH WORSENED CONSIDERABLY A MAN ASKED ME TO HELP
PROTECT HIS SON FROM THE CROWD. IT WAS AS MUCH AS I COULD DO, I ASKIED A
FOOT PATROL OFFICER IF HE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT HE WAS HELPLESS HIMSELF. HE
TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE GOING TO OPEN THE GATES, A SHORT TIME LATER THE GATES
OPENED AND I PICKED UP THIS LAD AND RAN WE HAD NO CHOICE. ONCE INSIDE I GOT
OUT OF THE WAY OF THE RUSH AND MADE MY WAY TO THE NORTH STAND. AS I GOT
THERE THE CROWD IN THE END TERRACE WERE ALREADY SPILLING ONTO THE PITCH.

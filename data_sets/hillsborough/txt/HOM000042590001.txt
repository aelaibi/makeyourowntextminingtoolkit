HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

I have now shown Lord Justice Taylor your letter of 30 January.
Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to say that the comments in
paragraph 54 of his Final Report were based upon reports in a
number of newspapers, which indicated that convicted Swansea fans
had been warmly welcomed back on their return from Greece.
Reports quoted you as justifying this on the basis that the fans
had been unfairly treated by the Greek court, a point which Lord
Justice Taylor mentioned.

MICHAEL BROOMHEAD




    INSPECTOR




MAIN STREET POLICE STATION, ROTHERHAM




On Saturday 15 April                  1989       (150489),      I commenced duty at 8.30 am (0830)                      at

Main     Street       Police         Station,      Rotherham,        for   football        duties       in     connection

with     the    semi-final           at Hillsborough            Football     Ground.        I was        in charge      of

Serials        41   to    43    on Sub-Sector             16;   my   immediate       Supervising          Officer     was

Chief Inspector Purdy.

Basically those duties allocated to my serials involved Public Order patrols

both     before       and   after          the    match    in   Halifax      Road    from    the Wadsley           Bridge

Railway Station to the                     termination of the dual carriageway at the junction

of     Halifax      Road       and    Deerlands       Avenue.         Halifax       Road    and    the       surrounding

    streets    were      designated          as     the    arrival     and    parking       area        for    Liverpool

    supporters.        I know         this       area very well        having       spent   the        first    seven or

    eighty years of my 22 years service working in that area.

    I also worked the semi-final                    the year before last when Leeds United played

Coventry        City     and my        duties       then    were     almost      identical        to    those    on   this

    occasion.

    I live within one mile of that area and regularly use Halifax Road.                                            I am a

    football    supporter            and     attend       almost     all   the      Sheffield          Wednesday      home

    fixtures at Hillsborough.
I have worked at most of the semi-finals at Hillsborough over the years and

many    first     division matches              in ray early years of service.                        I was also on

duty for the World Cup matches held at Hillsborough in 1966.

In     addition,        I    have     regularly         performed         duties       as     a     Sergeant       at    the

Sheffield United             football        ground     at    Bramall         Lane and occasional               duties    at

the other three South Yorkshire Football League grounds.

I was on duty at the semi-final between Liverpool and Notts Forest in 1988,

when my duties concerned supervision of serials responsible for the Leppings

Lane turnstiles.

On    Saturday       15      April       1989   (150489),          I    set   off     from    Main       Street     Police

Station     for      Hillsborough            shortly     before          9*00    am    (0900)        in   a     Personnel

Carrier     with      Serial         Number     42     led    by       Police   Sergeant          2171    Keenan.         We

travelled via Halifax Road and I indicated to officers in the vehicle that

section which was              to be patrolled by Serial Number 42.                               We arrived at the

ground at 9-30 am (0930) for a 10.00 am (1000) briefing.                                          The briefing took

place at 10.00 am (1000) and after having a packed lunch, at 11.00 am (1100)

I walked from the ground to Halifax Road with Serials 41 to 43.

There    was    no    change        to     those duties        allocated in the operational briefing

notes.      About           11.20    am     (1120),     together         with    Police       Sergeant          Keenan,    I

approached        the       White    Horse      Public        House      in Halifax          Road    with     a   view     to

establishing whether or not                     the    licensee         intended opening.                As I did so a

male person who identified himself as the licensee came out of the premises.

He indicated that the premises would be open until 4.00 pm (1600)                                                 that day

but     would   close        at     that    time      until    all      football      supporters          had     left    the

area.

He     said that both sets                 of supporters were welcome and that supporters                                from

both teams were already                    in the premises.            He said that          arrangements had            been
                                                                                                                             rf\   2 /1 Z.
                                                          -   3    -




made to have doormen control those persons wishing to enter the premises and

he   did    not     anticipate        any      trouble.        I        visited          the    premises      with    Police

Sergeant        Keenan,       there     were      a    small           number       of     persons      inside       but    no

problems.          Police      Sergeant      Keenan      informed             Control          that premises         were    to

remain open until 4.00 pm (1600).

After patrolling Halifax Road to ensure all serials were in position, about

11.45      am   (1145),       I returned        to Halifax             Road    at    its       junction with Southey

Green      Road.         In Southey Green Road                at       this    location         and   across     from       the

White Horse Public House                is a      ’Thresher’ off-licence.                         I noticed      that       the

premises were full of Liverpool football supporters who were buying packs of

beer and lager.               I went into the premises and saw that there were only two

female      assistants         serving,     but       there    were         no problems.              I returned       about

midday and noticed that the number of persons entering the off-licence were

being controlled and limited to about six persons at any one time.                                               One shop

assistant         was    manning   and      locking      the       entrance         door whilst         the     other       was

serving customers.              A queue of about fifteen to twenty supporters was formed

up on the          pavement outside and whilst I had                           the premises under observation

the queue          remained fairly constant at                 that sort of number.                        (The premises

later closed about 2.00 pm apparently having sold out of packs of lager and

beer,      although       I   cannot    confirm        the     reason         for closing).              It    was    around

twelve midday when I also noticed that                                 the White Horse Public House                    doors

were closed due to the premises being full.

There      were    approximately         one    hundred        Liverpool            fans packed outside on the

terracing          and    beer garden     at    the     front          of      the premises.            They     were       all

drinking from cans and bottles                        apparently purchased from the Thresher Off-

Licence.          Around that time Police Constable Osborne mentioned to me that a

youth had gone       into a ladies hairdressers                         shop situated above the shopping

precinct    near     to     the    Thresher    Off-Licence                   and    had     to   be    ejected    after

requesting the staff to do his hair.                     He was under the influence of drink.

Large numbers of Liverpool supporters were arriving in private cars and vans

and parking on the estate roads off Halifax Road.                                    As the supporters walked

along Halifax Road I noticed that many of                                  them were       drinking from cans or

bottles.       Although       some    were    drinking                soft       drinks,    I    distinctly      recall

thinking    to    myself     that    I had never             in all          my    experience         of working    and

attending      football      matches,        seen    so          many       people     consuming        intoxicating

liquor in the street.

Sometime after 12.30 pm (1230) I heard a radio message to the effect that a

transit     van    had    driven     away     from       a       shop       after     the    occupants      had    been

shoplifting.        I then heard that the vehicle had been seen travelling along

Foxhill Road which forms a junction with Halifax Road at the Wadsley Bridge

Railway Station.

A   few minutes     later the transit van                    was       driven on to the car park of the

White    Horse     Public     House     followed             by        a    Police     transitvan        containing

Inspector Robinson and other officers.

The   occupants,     who were        Liverpool       supporters,                  were detained and placed            in

the   Police      transit    van.      I noticed             that          the    supporters’ van        contained     a

mattress in the rear which was surrounded by empty beer/lager cans.

A short     time later whilst I was speaking to Police Sergeant Keenan outside

the White Horse Public House, a group ofapproximately twenty youths,                                              led by

one youth      in particular,         started to             sing an obscene song.                     I went to the

leader     with    Police         Sergeant    Keenan             and        the    group     immediately         stopped

singing.       I warned      the youth about his                      future behaviour and there were no

further problems outside these premises,                              despite many of the youths present

being quite obviously affected by intoxicants.

About       1.30    pm     (1330),      I    saw Police        Sergeant         Dixon    who     was    in   charge   of

Serial Number 41 in Halifax Road at its junction with Kilner Way.

Police Sergeant Dixon                  told me       that his       serial were keeping a watching eye

over Liverpool             supporters who were buying large quantities of intoxicating

liquor      from     the    off-licence         department          of    the Gateway Supermarket.                These

premises subsequently sold out of packs and bottles of beer and lager.

About 2.30 pm (1430),                  I returned to Halifax Road near to its junction with

Southey Green Road where I saw Chief Inspector Purdy.                                     Liverpool supporters'

coaches were now parked in Halifax Road down as far as the Pelican crossing

just below this junction.                      The Fire Brigade were called to a coach at this

junction       which       was    leaking       diesel    fuel.           I recall       Chief     Inspector      Purdy

saying       his    radio        was    not    working         very      well    but     my    radio     was    working

efficiently,         although reception was                sometimes difficult due                     to traffic and

general      noise.         There       were    large     numbers         of Liverpool         supporters       walking

down     Halifax          Road    towards           Hillsborough,         many      of    them    were       under    the

influence          of drink although there was no                        trouble.        It was noticeable           that

all those heading towards Hillsborough appeared to be in no particular hurry

despite the ground being a ten mintues walk away.

I    also    saw     a    group    of       forty    to fifty       supporters         walking     in    the   opposite

direction          away    from    the      ground.      On     speaking to them one of their number

indicated          that    their coach          driver    had       allowed      them    to alight       near    to the

ground but had driven off taking the match tickets with him.                                            They were all

walking back to the coach to collect their tickets.

At    2.45     pm    (1445)       there       were    still     large       numbers      of    supporters       walking

towards       the ground.          Customers at the White Horse Public House were leaving




                                                                                                                                J
in small pockets and I noticed those Liverpool supporters who I had spoken

to earlier regarding             the    singing of an obscene             song making    their way down

Halifax Road.        They appeared to be well intoxicated but were not causing any

problems.

About that time I noticed a group of approximately forty to fifty Liverpool

supporters walking down the side of the                       parked coaches towards the ground.

They    appeared     to     be     well     intoxicated but           again   were   not   causing      any

problems.      I     recall       mentioning      the    group       to   Chief   Inspector    Purdy    and

wondered    where    they had been           drinking.         We    concluded    that   they must     have

been drinking at the Wadsley Bridge Working Mens Club which is situated in

Halifax Road near to its junction with Doe Royd Lane or perhaps one of the

public houses on the adjoining housing estates.

Throughout    the    day     leading up         to kick-off,         it was particularly noticeable

that    large numbers ofsupporters were drinking                      from cans or bottles and many

were    intoxicated.        In    fairness,      however, with        those exceptions mentioned, I

will say that the fans were well behaved although in many cases boisterous.

I was    surprised that those supporters heading for the ground after 2.30 pm

appeared to be in no particular hurry to get to the ground even up to 2.50

pm (1450).     Traffic in Halifax Road, whilst busy from around 11.30 am (1130)

onwards, was        never    allowed       to build      up    and    cause   serious    congestion     and

never    appeared     any    worse       than   that    on    a normal      Sheffield    Wednesday     home

fixture.

At   3.00 pm (1500)         I met Police Sergeant              Dixon and his serial number 41 in

Halifax Road with the intention of implementing Phase 2, which involved that

serial     joining    the        South    Yorkshire      Police       coach   outside    the   ground    in

Penistone Road North.                  The remaining     two     serials,     42 and 43, were     due    to

take    their meal           break at that time at Claywheels Lane Traffic                                           Department.

We    set     off       to   walk       to    the   ground         and       by   this        time       there     was    only    the

occasional football supporter heading for the ground.

Traffic was very light and of a local nature.                                           En-route to the ground I saw

a number of officers                    near    to the Gate Inn Public House                               in Penistone Road

North speaking to a group of about six men who were obviously intoxicated.

Those       supporters           made     their way       along          Leppings         Lane       watched       initially       by

officers in my company.                       We then continued along Penistone Road towards the

ground.

As     we    did       so,   I    heard      a radio message                 from a voice                I did not recognise

asking       for       the   gates        to be     opened.          Although            I was           unaware    of what was

happening,             the       caller      sounded     quite           panicky         and     I       remarked        to   Police

Sergeant Dixon to that effect.                           As we approached Gate                           'O' to the ground I

heard a radio message directing all officers at Claywheels Lane to attend at

the ground immediately.

At 3.15 pm (1515) we entered the ground and went immediately to the opening

between        the       North      Stand       and     the    Spion          Kop       where        I    saw    Superintendent

Greenwood.              I saw that there were a large number of people on the pitch at

the Leppings Lane end of the ground and I assumed that Liverpool supporters

had invaded the pitch.                        I had no idea              at that time          the         gamehad been under

way or the extent of the problem.

 I asked Superintendent Greenwood where                                  he wished        me to deploy my men                 and he

 indicated             the   playing          area      perimeter            track facing                   the Notts         Forest

 supporters on the Spion Kop.

 At    that time there was only a handful of Police Officers on the track and

 the        Notts       Forest      supporters          were        chanting            and     taunting           the    Liverpool

 supporters.

 Several       supporters            were      half-heartedly                attempting         to       climb     the    perimeter

 fence.            I    instructed           officers    to        spread         out    across          the    perimeter        track
1                                                         -   8   -




    facing the Spion Kop.

    Several Notts Forest supporters were screaming at me to clear the pitch and

    it    was    evident    that     they   too assumed        there    had   been a pitch       invasion   by

    Liverpool supporters.

    I had been in position for a few minutes when a youth ran across the pitch

    from the opposite end shouting abuse towards the Spion Kop.                               I deputed one

    officer to remove him but the youth ran off back towards the Leppings Lane

    stand       where   I   saw he    was   detained      by      other Police    Officers.       About   five

    minutes elapsed before I realised that the situation was more serious than I

    had first envisaged and I noticed that there were injured persons lying on

    the pitch at the Leppings Lane side of the ground.                           I attempted to calm the

    shouting       Notts    Forest      supporters   by       pointing    out   that   there were    injured

    people on the pitch and that it could not simply be cleared.

    The    taunts by the Notts Forest supporters continued,                       then suddenly a large

    number of Liverpool            supporters who were on the pitch,                   clearly   incensed by

    the    taunts, ran towards the Spion Kop in response.                        I feared a large clash

    when the Liverpool supporters reached the Spion Kop but officers in front of

    the Spion Kop successfully ushered the Liverpool supporters back across the

    pitch to the Leppings Lane side and a large cordon of Police officers formed

    across       the width of the pitch to prevent                    further problems of that nature.

    Whilst all this was taking place I did not hear any radio messages from the

    Police control,          although had any been made I doubt that I would have heard

    what was being said due to the level of noise from the crowd.                                 I did hear

    Kenny Dalglish make            an    announcement         over    the ground public     address system

    and whilst I could not make                out what he said his message seemed to have a

     calming effect on the Notts Forest supporters.
Liverpool      supporters             were   dismantling         the     advertising hoardings              to use       as

stretchers          and    it   was     then       that    the   seriousness           of   the     situation      became

known    to    the        Notts    Forest       supporters,         and       myself      for     that   matter,       when

several bodies were brought                     from the Leppings Lane stand direction towards

the Spion Kop.

At    4.25     pm     (1625)       an     announcement           was    made       that     the    match   was     to    be

abandoned.          In the absence of any other instructions I caused Serial number

41 to remain in position until the bulk of the Notts Forest supporters had

left the Spion Kop.                   Following that I anticipated that there would be Public

Order problems outside the ground so took the decision to revert to Phase 3

and   took     the        serial      from     the    ground      on    foot       along    Penistone      Road     North

towards Halifax Road.                   On     that journey although I was subject                         to numerous

comments       about       the Police          causing the deaths of supporters by opening the

gates, I saw no signs of trouble.

At 6.30 pm (1830) I went to Claywheels Lane with Serial 41 and subsequently

returned to Main Street Police Station by Police                                     coach,       going off duty at

7.30 pm (1930).

In respect of radio communications, although my radio was working throughout

the     day,    I     did       not     have    the       benefit       of    an    extension        speaker      and    in

situations          where         there      was     noise       from        traffic      or      supporters,      I    had

difficulty deciphering what was said.

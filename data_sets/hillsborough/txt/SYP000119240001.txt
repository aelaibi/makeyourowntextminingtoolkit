            Divisional           Headquarters.

            I came        on d u t y    at   9 am       on S a t u r d a y , 1 5 t h A p r i l          1989,      and    I went        to

            I there met           Inspector            Bennett who was               working          as    Logistics          Officer

            officers.            This     took       p l a ce    in the N o r t h S t a n d .              Following       this       Police

window       to     the      left       of    the       cabin     looked           out    onto       the       rear     of

turnstiles           1-9 a n d G a t e            A,     the w i n d o w           to     the    right          l o o k e d out onto

the    la d i e s    toilet            s i t u a t e d at      the     far       left     of the          stand.

Police       Sergeant             Booth       and       I made        preparations              to    receive           property

from    12 n o o n w h e n             the    turnstiles              opened.

Gate    A wa s       s hu t       at    t hi s    time and            once          the       turnstiles           were opened a

steady       stream          of    supporters             were        coming        through          to    the N o r t h S t a n d .

At    this    time        everything appeared                         to    be     following          a similar              pattern      to

the    previous           y e a r ’s s e m i - f i n a l , on w h i c h                 day    I had also              performed

property          recovery             duties       for     the L e p p i n g s          Lane    End       of     the Stadium.

Approximately                2.35       pm    Inspector          White           entered        the       portacabin            followed

by PC       Wright        of El         Sub Division.                  Insp.        White       was       helping        to     carry a

boy,    approximately                   13 y e a r s      old,        who    appeared           to    be       in a     collapsed

sta t e .     He wa s          clutching            a    'Ventolin'              inhaler,        used          by a s t h m a

sufferers           and      I noticed            his     breathing              was     very    laboured.               He     was

fully       conscious             though         weak     and     1 assisted              him    to       use     the    'ventolin*

spr a y .      I then          sat      w i t h him       u n t i 1 he       recovered.               The       boy w a s

accompanied             by a n o t h e r         b o y of      similar           ag e    and a man             of a b o u t     20-25

years.        Police           Sergeant           Booth and            I    began a           conversation with                  this

man.        Th e m a n       informed            us t ha t      there        wa s       a huge       crowd        of    people

outside       on L e p p i n g s            Lane.        Sergeant           Booth        l o o k e d at        his     watch and

commented           t ha t     it was         only 2 . 4 0        pm a n d         there       was    st ill         plenty      of   time

for    people        to      get       into      the     ground.            Th e    man       seemed       quite        s h a k e n and

said     "It * s m u r d e r           out    there       and     people are              being       crushed".               They     left

a short        time       later.

I looked          out     of      the       portacabin window,                     facing       onto       the       turnstiles.           I

saw m o r e       Police          Officers          were       going        into        the    back       of    the     turnstiles,

and    that       people          appeared          to    be    coming           through        the       turnstiles

extremely           slowly,            as    if t h e r e      wa s    a    problem           with    them        getting

through.          I went          outside         the     p o r t a c a b i n iand f a c e d          towards           the
                                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                                  R283

turnstiles.               I was       immediately              aware       of a g r e a t            deal     of    noise        coming

from     the    other          side       of the        turnstiles,

1 sa w a y o u n g         woman,          about        20 y e a r s ,     come       out       of    one     of    the

turnstiles,           she wa s            holding        her       hand    to    the       side       of     her    face       a n d was

quite     unsteady             on    her    feet.          I called         to       her    and       offered assistance.

She    s h o w e d me      a    l a rg e    graze        on her        left      c h e ek       which        was    bleeding

slightly.            She       said       she    ha d    been       forced       up a g a i n s t          the     side    of     the

turnstiles           by the          crush       of     people       on L e p p i n g s         Lane.         She    said        she was

really     frightened.                    She    began        to    cry.        A male          companion           then       came

behind     her       and       led    her       away     towards          the    N o r t h St a n d .

1 noticed more                 people       coming         through         the       turnstiles              in o b v i o u s     states

of    distress.

Sometime        while          this       was    happening           I became          aware          of     loud    banging          on

Gate     A , as      if    lar g e        numbers        of    people       we re h i t t i n g            it w i t h     t h ei r

hands     or    fis t s.            I could       hear        voices       shouting             "For       Christ       s a ke    open

the    gates"        "Let       us    in y o u        bastards."            The       gate       seemed          to m o v e      inwards

and    upwards        from          the    pressure           on    it a n d     1 was          sure       it w o u l d    c o l l a ps e .

I sa w    two      young        men,       in t h e i r       teens,       appear          on    to p      of the     wall       at     the

far    corner        of G a t e       A,        They     lowered          themselves             over        the    top and

jumped     down       to       the    s i de     where        I was.        There          were      2 or 3 s t e w a r d s

standing        at    the       Gate.           I then        sa w a      cordon       of P o l i c e         Officers           b e i ng

formed     at      the     rear       of    the       turnstiles,           behind Gate                 A.       They were

blocking        off       any       access       along        the    back       of    the       turnstiles.               As     they

were     positioning                themselves           I saw Gate             A open,          but       I could        not     see

who    opened        it.        Supporters              poured       through          in    large          n u m b e r s , I wa s

s h o c k e d at     how man y            people        were       trying       to    rush       in.

Everything           seemed          to    become        extremely          c o n f u s e d at          this       time.

Sergeant        Booth          j o i n e d me     outside           the    p o r t a c a b i n a n d we            went    to     the

gate     in the       fence          dissecting            the      North Stand             entrance             and West         Stand

enclosure.            Fans          came    to the         gate      requesting             entry          into     the W e s t
                                                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                                                            R2S5

Stand.         Conversely                f an s     were       approaching                   from       behind with             North Stand

tickets        wanting          access            through          the     gate          into          the N o r t h      Stand        entrance.

As    the    fans        were       entering            through Gate                 A       they       started          to    run a n d w e r e

pushing        each       other          in the         back.            About       this          time       I heard a             cheer     go

up f r o m     the       fans       already            in the        stands.                 It    really          s u r p r i s e d me      and    I

thought        the       teams       must         be    c o mi n g       out    onto          the       pitch,          and    that     there

were    sti l l      a    lot       of    people          trying          to    get          into       the    Football             Ground.

As    s o o n as     the       f an s     heard         the       cheer        they          started          to    run f a s t e r         and

push    each        other       more.

At    this     time       the       stewards            on     the       small       gate          where       1 wa s         standing

seemed       to     be    getting             very agitated                and       flustered.                    Sergeant          B o o t h wa s

vetting        tickets          for       them and             I wa s      helping                to    let    fans       through           the

gate     in b o t h       directions.                   I then           saw a man about                      35-40       years        on the

roof    of     the       programme             sellers            portacabin,                 which          was    about       10-15 yards

away    from        us,    on       the       other       side       of    the       fence.              He w a s        pulling        a youth

up beside           him.        The       young         m a n was         about          14 y e a r s         old.        1 r an       towards

them and          told     them          to    get      down.            I was       very w or r i e d              for       the    youths

s a f e t y as      there       is b a r b e d w i r e             along        the          t o p of        the    fence       and     I

thought        he m i g h t         fall       on      it.        T he    man    t o l d me             to    " Fu c k    off".         He    said

he w a s     going        to    jump          over      the       fence        and       I    c o u l d n ’t s t o p          him,      I told

him    not     to    be    so       stupid and               to    go     round          to       the    gate       where       I would           let

him    through           if his          ticket         was       for     the    West             Stand.           He    climbed        down

and    helped        the y oung               man      down.

As    I turned away                 from       the      fence        I became                aware       of a g r o u p of 3 — 4 fans

coming       towards           me    up       the      tunnel        at    the       edge          of    the W e s t          Stand.         They

were     carrying a young                      man with            t h e m wh o          appeared             to    be    in a       collapsed

sta t e .      I went          to a s s i s t          him.        Th e    f a ns        were          going       to    low e r     the     young

man    to    the     floor          at    the       side       wall       of    the          West       Stand       but       I s aw    it was

v e r y we t      along        the w a l l          and      that        liquid was                pouring          down       the wall

from     the      corrugated              panels          of      the     st an d .           I immediately                   noticed        there

this    wall.         1 requested                the y o u n g         men move           the       fan    to    the     fence,

which       they    did.         At     first         the m a n wa s           conscious             but     very       weak.          He

complained          of     pain       to his          che s t     and     stomach.              He     said      his     na m e was

                               and      that         he w o r k e d      at    the                                      Waterloo.

He    then    saids        “T h e r e      are       people       dead and            dying         out    there,        just         like

at H e y s e 1."         At    th i s      time       I thought           he wa s         hysterical,              but       he kept

repeating          this.         He     then         complained           of       feeling          sick     and      1 told          him       to

lie    down with           his    head          to    one       side.         I helped          hi m      into     the       recovery

position and             I noticed              his     head and          h a ir      were      steaming.             I suddenly

became       aware       that     his       breathing             was     very        shallow,            and    then        I c o u l d n ’t

hear     it at      all.         1 felt          for       a    pul se    w hich was            very       fluttery           and

er rat i c . I c l e a r e d          out       his m o u t h      and        then      turned         him onto          his       back

and    gave     him m o ut h          to m o u t h         resuscitation.                     While       I was       bending          over

                         I became           aware          of    someone           very       close       b e h i n d me.          I heard

a voice       says       "Fucking           slag,          it's    your        lots       fault."            I then          f e lt    a jolt

in the       base     of m y      spine          as     if      I had     been        kicked.             Two    or     three         of    the

men with                                    went        round      b e h i n d me         1 was        aware       of    them

standing        close         to me        as    if     protecting             me.        I heard          one     says       “D o n ’t

worry       girl,     he's       gone."                                            began       to    breathe          on his          own. I

returned       him       to    the      recovery               position.            When       I had       just       examined

                I asked Sergeant                      Booth       to     request          an ambulance,                 on    the

Police       radio.           I heard           him     calling          and       speech       coming          back     through            the

radio,       but    Sergeant            Booth         indicated           he       could       not     get a       reply.             He

said    that       he w o u l d       go    to       the       gymnasium           or P o l i c e      room a n d        request            one

from     there.

After       I had     resuscitated                                             I heard          sirens          coming        up

Leppings       Lane        and    then          they appeared                 to    stop.           I realised           they would

be a m b u l a n c e s .       1' l o o k e d        for Sgt.          Booth        but       I could        not      see     him.          1

felt    that       1 must        get                                   to L e p p i n g s       Lane       for     medical

as s is t a n c e ,

I asked          s o m e m e n wh o       were    standing          near                              if      they     c o ul d

assist       me     to    carry      him    to L e p p i n g s      Lane.        They    lifted          him     very

carefully.               I noticed         that    two     of    them      smelled       very       strongly           of

intoxicating              li q u o r .     One    of t h e s e      was    very    unsteady           on his         feet and

appeared          drunk.          I persuaded           him     to m o v e      away and       asked          someone          else

to a s s i s t     me.

                          was     carried        behind       the      stands     and    out     onto         the    road       on

Leppings          Lane     next      to    the    river.         I saw        there     were a        lot      of    pe o pl e

lying       or    sitting         in the      road.        Some        were     very    obviously             i nj u r e d .        Th e

bank.        I saw        there     were     other       people         lying     there.         At      this       time

                       condition          deteriorated           again and         he    lost       unconsciousness

His    breathing           stopped again and                  1 resuscitated             hi m a g a i n .           Whilst          1

was    doing       this      several        firemen        rushed         towards       the    injured           pe ople.

One    came       to                             and a dmi nistered              oxygen       f r o m a s m al l

cylinder          to     him.      This     revived                                     I stepped             back     to      help

turn    him       over     and     I stood        on s o m e o n e ’s j a c k e t       b e h i n d me.          I turned               to

apologise          and     I realised            the    pe r s o n ,    a young        man about           20-23       years            of

age was          dead.       I looked along              the     line      of    people       who     were       lying         on

the    road,       next      to    the     river       bank     and     I saw     that     t h e y all         appeared             to

be    dead.         1 counted 8            people       lying       in the       road.        I was        totally

shocked.            I then        heard     people       at     the     other     side     of m e        and     turned         to

see    some       Police        Officers         lowering        another         body    to    the       fl oo r .        The

deceased          had a denim             jacket       over     his     face.

A    line    of a m b u l a n c e s       drew    up    in the         road.      I tried        to      get

to    one    of    them      but     I could       not a t t r a c t       the a t t e n t i o n      of a n a m b u l a n c e

officer.           Just      then a        line    of P o l i c e       Officers        formed        in f r o n t        of    the

bodies,          between myself             and    the a m b u l a n c e s .       I began          to     get      worried

that    I    could        not     attract        anyone's        attention.             A Doctor           came      to

Officers            to       h e l p me     move                                   nearer        to      the a m b u l a n c e s

Inspector            Sykes          deputed           s o me     officers          to    carry                                 over     the

road.          They          placed       hi m w i t h a          lar g e     group        of    people          who    all    appeared

injured.             A       lot    of    them were              crying       and       moaning.            A nurse          came     to me

and    said         she       would       help                                    to a n a m b u l a n c e .           At    that     moment

I sa w    two        ambulance              officers             arrive       with a stretcher.                        They    lifted

                    onto        it a n d        1 returned             behind        the      stands        to    the P o r t a c a b i n

where      I again             met       up w i t h S e r g e a n t          1153 B o o t h .            I explained           to     him

what     ha d       taken          place.

There     were           a    l a rge     number           of    people       milling           about       the     a r e a at      this

time.          Some          were    being        very abusive                towards           us,      calling        us    "bastards",,

"fucking            murderers."

I informed Sergeant                         Booth          that    1 was          a member          of    both      the      Casualty

Bureau         and Hospital                 Liaison             team.        He    d i r e c t e d me       to    the       gymnasium.

As    I entered               the    gymnasium              I could          not     believe          the     situation.              There

seemed         to    be       bodies        all       over       the    f l oo r .       Some       of    them were           covered        in

white      cloths,              some      not.

I sa w     Inspector                Sewell        and       told       him where           I should           be.       He    said     that

Inspector            Bennett,             Police           Constable          Fletcher           and      other        officers        had

already         left          for    the        hospitals,             and    that       I was        needed        in the       gymnasium.

He    then      d i r e c t e d me          to P o l i c e        Sergeant           Fidler,          who     i n s t r u c t e d me    how

to    take      descriptions                    of e a c h       body    for       identification                 purposes.            At

this     time        Inspector              Charles             announced          that       one     Police        Officer         must     be

deputed         to       stay with              one    body.           The    d ec e a s e d were           laid       in    rows     a n d as

1 took         a description                    of e a c h       one    1 gave          the     body a number.

For    the      remainder                of m y       duty       1 performed             similar          tasks,        all    connected

with     the        identification                    of    the    deceased,             under        the     direction          of

Inspector            Charles.               I    worked with             Sergeant             Fidler,         Sergeant         Sewell,

             part    of the       gymnasium.             Bodies        were       then    taken        for    identification             by

             relatives         and    friends.

             Late    Saturday         night,,       early Sunday              morning,          16th A p r i l       1989,     bodies

             which were         still       unidentified              were     gradually          taken       to     the M e d i c o

             Legal       C e n t r e , Wate r y Street.

             1 remember         distinctly            t ha t    the    bodies        seemed       to a r r i v e      in the

             gymnasium         in t h r e e      distinct        groups.          There         were    those who          had    been

             brought       straight         to    the    gym from           the    pitch,        those       wh o    had   been    placed

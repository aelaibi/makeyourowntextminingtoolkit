H ILLSBOROUGH                                                                                                       ^ s r

The facts o f the Hillsborough disaster are very well known. In case, however, you would
wish to refresh your memory about the details, I attach at Annex 1 the background note
which was prepared for the Attorney General in 1990.                     As you will see, the Crown
Prosecution Service decided that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic
prospect o f conviction against any person on any charge.

                                                 f i t;, fc          H --1 V
Thereafter, the inquest was held on                      At the conclusion o f the inquest, the jury
returned a verdict o f accidental death. This verdict was challenged in the Divisional Court
in 1993. The court upheld the Coroner’s direction to the jury and said that there was no
good reason for ordering a new inquest. In addition there has been the Taylor Enquiry into
the disaster with its detailed findings, and as a result o f those findings, the police have paid
compensation.


Over the years, the Hillsborough Family Support Group (HFSG) have continued to press for
more and more inquiries into the causes o f the disaster. Their campaign was given a major
impetus when in December 1996, Granada TV screened a drama documentary programme
 Kppf                rFTv?a T-T'P’C p f c s thp,t t*p-q^3rr*^7 for     0 pron'r

brought to light fresh evidence and/or new witnesses which prove that evidence was
suppressed, and perjury was committed, and a conspiracy to pervert the course o f justice has
taken place.    The HFSG has been in correspondence with the CPS, the Law Officers’
Department and the Home Office. They seek to have a fresh investigation by the police
which they maintain would lead to criminal proceedings, a reopening o f the inquest, and a
public inquiry. For this reason, the CPS, LSLO and the Home Office have kept in close
contact because o f their varied responsibilities in connection with the requests from HFSG.
The CPS’s responsibility focuses on whether there is new material which, if properly
investigated, might lead to a realistic prospect o f conviction.


I summarise the "new evidence" and the CPS’s conclusion. The new evidence is suggested
to be:-


          i     a video tape o f footage from the score board camera, known as camera 5, of
                the Leppings Lane Terrace areas where the deaths occurred.


          ii    a statement and an affidavit from Mr Houldsworth, the engineer for the design
                and maintenance o f the club and police CCTV systems at Hillsborough and;


          iii   a statement from Doctor Walker who was involved in the attempted
                resuscitation o f some o f the injured people who had been taken to Northern
                General Hospital.


The Video Evidence and Mr Houldsworth’s Evidence


The HFSG believe that relevant videos were stolen, and that therefore the jury did not see
the relevant tapes. They also claim that the police were not telling the truth when they said
that the cameras were not working satisfactorily, and that they could see much more than
they claimed, and in consequence were negligent in taking no action about the desperate
situation on the Leppings Lane Terraces.


Two video tapes were stolen in mysterious circumstances, but these were the Club video
tapes and uoi the police video tapes.      The police video tapes have always been made
available to the Taylor Enquiry, the legal teams, and to the inquest. Although the two tapes
were not themselves shown to the jury, a compilation tape was shown. Viewing confirms
that the relevant material was shown on the compilation tape to the inquest jury.
Interestingly, it has now come to light that the Coroner him self had a video tape recording
made o f the entire main inquest proceedings. From this it can be seen which video tape was
actually shown to the jury.                                        cLi ^ ;   ^J
The allegation relating to the clarity o f the monitored pictures depends on clashes o f evidence
between the police and Mr Houldsworth. Mr Houldsworth’s evidence from 1989 is not so
precise as his evidence now given in an affidavit in 1996.        Mr Houldsworth himself, of
course, was not present to see the actual police monitor at the time.         In one important
respect, his evidence is undoubtedly wrong because he maintains that a time lapse mode on
a monitor will not contain a time and date imprint. It is clear from the recordings which
exist which were in time lapse mode that there is a date and time imprint on them.


Even if Mr Houldsworth’s evidence and comments are justifiable, his criticisms come
nowhere near the standard o f proof required for criminal liability.


Doctor’s Walker’s Statement


At the original inquest, the Coroner imposed a cut-off time for inquiring into the evidence
o f 3.15 pm.     The reason for this was that the evidence showed a pattern o f rapid
unconsciousness leading to death.      Since the crushing occurred at about 3.00 pm, the
Coroner selected a cut-off point approximately a quarter o f an hour later. The evidence of
Doctor Walker suggests that he treated a boy at hospital who was still alive after 3.15 pm.
The suggestion by HFSG is that this evidence was deliberately suppressed.            A detailed
analysis o f Doctor Walker’s evidence tends to suggest that if he is speaking about a young
man called Philip Hammond, he is completely at variance with every other medical person
who treated Philip Hammond, all o f whom concluded that he was dead on arrival at hospital.
If he is speaking about any other young man who was brought to hospital, there is no
evidence again that anyone with serious crush injuries could have survived. Irrecoverable
brain damage w ill ensue within four to six minutes o f the crushing.




Conclusions


The conclusions, with which I entirely agree, are that there is no new evidence as alleged
by the HFSG and their legal representatives, and therefore no grounds for reopening the
police investigation into the Hillsborough diaster.
Handling


It would seem to me that the first decision to be made is precisely the decision which I have
set out above. Assuming that there is no fresh evidence to justify a police inquiry, decisions
still have to be made as to whether there is sufficiency o f evidence to justify reopening o f
the inquest. This is, o f course, a matter for the Law Officers, but in view o f our analysis
o f the so called "new evidence", it may be that the Law Officers w ill conclude that there is
no justification for reopening the inquest. The third decision, as to whether they should be
a further public inquiry, is obviously a matter for the Home Office. In view o f the fact that
the three departments have kept closely in touch, it is important that this cooperation
continues, and that coordinated responses are given. There is no doubt that the HFSG feel
deeply that there should be some form o f further investigation.                                    If it is decided that no
department will be taking any further steps, in my opinion, a meeting should be held with
the HFSG to explain why it is that the departments are not reopening the issue. It may be
that a joint meeting between the three departments with the HFSG would be appropriate. I
doubt whether any such meeting would satisfy them entirely, but it would give an opportunity
to explain the reasons for the decision. It may well be that they w ill dispute these reasons,
as they have in the past disputed decisions which have been taken, but I favour a face to face
meeting with the group which represents people who have suffered such tragic loss and who
still grieve for their friends and relatives, particularly when they believe that they have not
been told the full truth.


In addition to the original briefing to the Attorney about the facts o f the Hillsborough
disaster, I am attaching the CPS Review o f the points recently made by HFSG at Annex 2
together with the relevant appendices. It is a lengthy document, which is why I have tried

forward.

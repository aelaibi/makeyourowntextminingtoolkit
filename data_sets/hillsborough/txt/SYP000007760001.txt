            I am a married man and I live at the above address together with my

                              At abo/ut 1wife
                                          pm on S a t u r d a y , 15th of April   1989 I ywas in the

           Pheasant        public House,     Oughterbridge L a n e , Sheffield,     together with a

            f riend                          We were standing together at thsr bar having a

            drink.     I would say that there were about fifty Liverpool                supporters

            in the bar and              land I were stood talking to two in particular.              1

           would describe these two as follows?



            1)     A white male, about 6ft tall, medium build with dark coloured

                   hair.          He also had a moustache.           I would estimate him to be

                   about 30 years of age.           He spoke with a Liverpool accent.           I

                   cannot    remember what he said his name was but he did say that he

                   was a                                     by   trade and he came from the
                                                                                                 PAGE            2
                                                                                                 S6S0

                  area of Liverpool.             The only detail    I remember of his clothing was

                  that he was wearing a red jumper.



          2)      A white male about 3 ’ 6 tall with blonde hair,                he had a slight

                  b u i 1d and he also had a m o u s t a c h e .    I would say that he was about

                  30 years old.         Again,     he spoke with a Liverpool a c c e n t , I c a n ’t

                  remember what his name was but remember                that he said he was a

                            iy t r a d e .   I cannot remember any details as to his clothing

                  other than he was wearing a ye 11ow jumper.



           They were pleasant           lads and they told us that they had got their

           tickets from the i r boss who had been invited to wat ch the game £*'om a

           box and had given them stand tickets,                 that he no longer needed

           Whilst we J^ere standing
                                list we
                                      talk
                                        weiing at the bar we were joi ned by Peter
              N / 1 3 1 0    I;
           liARJ ARAM and whilst we were all talking s o m e o n e , 1 c a n ’t remember who

           passed comment to the two lads at about/ 20 minutes to three                      p.m.

           as they left,        that they would be late for the match,              however they

           replied,       "It’s OK w e ’ll be able to walk           in the gate    cos we've got

           stand tickets".           I have no doubt that this was a totally innocent
                                                                                                         ' ' \
           comment and took it to mean that they would have no problem entering                                  |

 ^        the ground be cause they               both had stand tickets and therefore had thei r

COfy/^^£/^y seats already allocated                                to them.        ^ .„y.

     ^    Whilst they we re in the Pheasant              pub the two lads had about four            or

           five    pints and a m e a l .         As for the other Liverpool      supporters they

          were all drinking however there was no rowdiness and they were all

           well    behaved non of them appeared drunk.

           I would also add that             I   have no affiliation or particular          liking for

           any football       club and do not follow the sport.

Ch ief Constable,
C he s hi r e Con st abu lary ,
Polic e Head qu art ers,
Chester. CHI 2PP.

Dear Mr.       Graham,

H I L L S B O R O U G H I NQU ESTS      - MR. M E R V Y N JONES.

As y ou are of cour se aware, Mr. Jones w as c h a r g e d by his then Ch i ef Con s ta b le
Mr. G e o f f r e y D e a r w i t h the task of i nv e st i g a t i n g and o rg a ni s i n g the West
Mi dl an d s Police T e a m i n cludi ng as far as I am concerned, the cor on al aspects
relat ing to the de ath of the 95 peop le w h o u n f o r t u n a t e l y lost the ir lives.
The pre s e nt p o s i t i o n w i t h r egard to these Inque sts is that they all stand
adjourned, awa i t in g the D . P . P ’s d e ci s i o n on w h a t a c t io n he intends to take.

On Mr. De a r r e l i nq u is i ng his a pp o in t me n t in the We s t Midland s, Mr. Lesl ie
Sharp, the C h ie f C o n s t a bl e of C u m b r i a was a p p o i n t e d to take over the Inq uiry
as far as the D i r e c to r of Publ ic Pr o s ec u ti o ns and the Police C o mp la i n t s
A u t h o r i t y w e r e concerned, but it was e x p r e ss l y a g r ee d that M r . J o n e s w o u l d
retain and con t i nu e to act as C o r o n e r ’s Officer.               Since then, as you are of
course fully aware, M r . J on es has j o i n ed yo ur force as yo ur Deputy.



I u n d e r s t a n d that Mr. Jones is bo th w i l l i n g and able to con t i nu e to act as
C o r o n e r ’s Officer, and to h e a d up the a pp r op r ia t e pol i c e te am unt il m y w o rk
in rela ti on to these Inquests is concluded.                I also u n d e r s t a n d that his
c o n t i nu e d i n volve ment is a c ce pt a bl e to you.

Yo u w i l l I am sure be aware that there are m a n y reasons and adva nt a ge s in
M e r v y n re t ainin g his c o n n e c t i o n w i t h the Inquests and his i n volve ment as
C o r o n e r ’s Officer.   I w o u l d t he r ef ore like to take this o p p o r t u n i t y of
saying that I am v er y g ra tefu l to you for yo u r support and co-o perati on, not
only to M e r v y n but also to me in c on ne c t i o n w i t h these Inquests.

In ord er to avoid mi s un d er s ta n di ng ,                      I summarise b e l o w my u n d e r s t a n d i n g of the
position:-

     1.      Mr. M e r v y n Jones co n ti nue s to he ad up and to lead the We st
             M i d l a nd s Police Co ro nal In quiry Team.    It is at this point
             im pos sib le to put a time scale on this as the timing of the
             re su med Inquest and the extent and scope th ereof depends to
             a large exte nt upon the d e c i s io n of the D.P.P. w h i c h has
             not yet been made.          Si mi lar ly it is not pos si bl e at this stage
             to state the extent and n u m b e r of We st M i d l an ds Police
             of ficers and support staff w h o wi l l or may be involve d
             w i t h the Inquests, but I ant ic ip a te that there w i l l be some
                                          2



           f lu c t u a t i o n in n u m b er s to take ac cou nt of v a r y i n g
           factors a p p l i c a b l e from time to time.          I w o u l d a n ti c i p a t e
           and hope that the W e s t M i d l a nd s Poli ce T e a m w o u l d as
           far as possible, c o n si s t of o fficer s and support staff
           w h o alr e a dy hav e b e e n i nvolv ed in the Inquiry, m a n y of
           w h o m have m a de a v e ry su bs ta nt i al p r o f e s s i o n a l as w e l l as
           p e r so n al inve st me n t in thelnquiry.
    2.     I ha v e not b e e n in v o lv ed in the fi na nci al as pec ts of the
           Inquiry, but my u n d e r s t a n d i n g is that the cost has fall en
           to Sou th Y o r k s h i r e Police. I can see no re as on w h y the fi na ncia l
           asp ects sho uld be a f f e c t e d in any w a y m e r e l y be ca us e
           Mr. Jo nes has b e e n promoted.



    3.      Those aspe cts of the inquiry r e la tin g to the D i r e c t o r of Public
            P r o se c ut i on s and Pol ic e C om p la i nt s A u t h o r i t y are h e a d e d up
            by Mr.    Sharp.

    4.     F r o m the inception, the H i l l s b o r o u g h In q ui r y has b e e n a c o mp l ex
           matter, and has n e c e s s i t a t e d a m e as u re of c o - o p e r a t i o n in orde r
           to avo id for ex am pl e u n n e c e s s a r y d u p l i c a t i o n of statem ents and so
           on.     This degr ee of c o - o p e r a t i o n w i l l of c o ur se hav e to be
           m ai nt ained , and I trust that we w i l l all seek to m a k e w h a t is an
           an ard uous job m an ag eabl e.

I am c i r c u l a t i n g a copy of this letter as shown, in or der to ensu re that the
pa rties are fully aware of the ar ra ng e me n ts a p pl i ca b le to the Inquests.

In closing, I w o u l d like to say that I hope that I m a y ha ve the o p p o rt un i ty
at some point of m e e t i n g y ou and m a k i n g yo ur pe r so n al acqua intance .

Yours    sincerely,

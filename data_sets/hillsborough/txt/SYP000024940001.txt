              allo cation of s e a ts which might have been in a d e q u a te to c a t e r for its regular
              supporters, it was likely th a t persons would c o m e w ithout tic k e ts and add to th e
              pressures outside th e ground. Very g r e a t c a r e should have been tak en to p rev en t
              overcrow ding and to ensure an abundance of stew ard s to supervise th e t e r r l c e !

    6.        The f ir s t- a id equipm ent may have been inadeq u ate. In p a rtic u la r, th e r e was no
              oxygen available or eq u ip m en t to assist resuscitatio n . A rran gem en ts to access

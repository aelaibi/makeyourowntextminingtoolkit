        non    existent             this year,                   in f a ct       I only          saw about             2-3 mo unted            police

        and    the     s a me       number          of       foot        officers           in all.

        I would        also         add       t ha t        since        parking         the      car a n d         my arrival            in     the

        stadium        I did         not       see          anyone         consume          alcohol           or    behave        in a     drunken

        or    disorderly             fashion.                    1 took        up m y       position             in the      North        Stand

        which       wa s    seat      number                22    in g a n g w a y F of               the N o r t h        Stand and           settled

        down     in my        seat.            At       about          2.30      pm    I could           see       that     the     central        area

        of    the L e p p i n g s         Lane          terracing              had     become          extremely            o ver    crowded,

        This     area       I now         know          to       be     pens     3 & 4.           I couldn't               understand            why    the
                                                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                                                             SS47

            on es    at      either         side    of    these       two      pens       were     not      filling         up.     The       only

            people        going       into        the    side    o n es     were      those        that       were     climbing          over

            the     pen      f en c e s .

            It w a s      obvious           to me       that    there       w as     a serious           problem           in t h a t    stand

            and     it w a s      also       apparent          that    the      Police          d i d n ’t r e a l i s e     what       was

            going        on a n d w e r e         very    very    slow         to    react       and     to    help        people       to    get

            out     of    that      stand.          In f a c t    it w a s          not     until      the     fir e       brigade       arrived

            that     any       real      relief         was    given      to    those        people         in the         Leppings          Lane

            st and .         I felt         very    frustrated            with       th e    lack      of     action        by    the

            Police,,           I will        add    however       t hat        when       the    Police?       d id    grasp       the

            seriousness             of      the    situation          there         were    a    number        of     officers          20-30       in

            all     t ha t     I saw        desperately          trying         to    get       people        out     of    the    st an d.

            N. H-
    Thank you for your letter of 26 April enclosing
0_^ffive letters from eyewitnesses about the
    Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.
    I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
    Taylor who has noted it. It has now been
    passed to the Treasury Solicitor who is
    preparing the evidence for consideration by
    Counsel for presentation to the Inquiry. The
    Treasury Solicitor can therefore consider Mr
              offer to appear at the Inquiry.

Dear Mr. Whalley,

     I enclose herewith copies of five letters I have received
this week from Liverpool foofball supporterswho attended the
recent match at Hillsborough and witnessed the tragedy that took place.

     I have thanked them for their letters and told them I am passing
them on to you as evidence to be placed before the Inquiry.    You will
note that Mr.         of                           |Merseyside
says he is willing to appear at the Inquiry.

      I hope the enclosed letters are helpful.



                              Kind regards,
                                 Yours sincere!

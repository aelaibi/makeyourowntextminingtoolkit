                I live at the above address.          On Saturday     15th April   1989 I left my

                house address at about        1.30pm to walk to the Hillsborough football

                ground for the F .A . Cup Semi Final         between Liverpool and Nottingham

                Forest w h i 1st walking to the ground I did s^e fans purchasing                  cans

                of beer from the corner shop on the Midjrflewood Road number 4 8 5 .                 I

                also     saw numerous    supporters who were Obviously under the influence of

                a 1cohol.        There was the normal amount of police       in attendance.

                On arrival at the ground there was the normal amounts of Police

                Officer and mounted officers.          There were no queues at the turnstile

                and      I got got in as   I would normally do.

                1 then went to the W est Stand y4 rraces and through the tunnel and into

                pen number four arriving at /about 13.50 hrs on the same day.                     There
/£— V
                were     people already in thje pen when I arrived but it wasn't anywhere
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           S721

near full.      I stood at the back of the pen with my back against the
*
wall.     I was joined by four Liverpool     supporters and everything was

normal.

The    pen during the course of the afternoon and up until kick off the

pen filled up with fans and there was a- large amount         in the pan at

kick of f .    The match had only bee^pr going for about two mi nutes when

there was a large surge of fan^s entering        pen four from the tunnel.

The four Liver pool fans whom r was standing with,         I don't know their

names one of them said,        "Look at them drunken bastards they will      get

us kicked out of Europe bef o re we get back       in".   I can only des c r i be

it as one almighty mass of people        coming through that tunnel and its

hard to believe that they were getting through.           I am 6*0" and

eighteen stone and I cojrfsider myself as well       built and reasonably fit

man.     I was total 1y /ornpressed by people about me and could not move

at all.     This   las/#esd for ten minutes at the   least before the pressure

eased off.      At/this time    I was unaware that anybody had died.

Some fans were climbing out of the pen by climbing the perimeter             fence

and by climbing      into the stand behind us.     1 noticed to the left of me

a photographer who was taking        pictures of the scene and I saw three

Liverpool     supporters   commenced on attack on the photographer.        He was

rescued by two Police Officers        I remained in the pen until about 4.

15pm on the same day I saw the bodies of the         people who had died in

the front of the fence      I d i d n ’t see anyone who appeared dead in the

tunnel.       I left the ground of my own accord at 4.15pm and walk home.

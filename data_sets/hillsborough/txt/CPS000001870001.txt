Dear Sirs

Adlineton v Murray: Adlington v Duckenfield

Yesterday we received a letter by fax dated 16th September 1998, to which we sent you a
short reply (copy attached). This morning we have received by second class post another
letter on the same subject dated 14th September. You refer in the last paragraph o f that letter
to the possibility that w e might provide a set o f documents to W inckworth and Pemberton,
who you suggest you “are sure would want to make a similar request to ourselves” [sic].

In fact W inckworth and Pem berton made a similar request on 11th September. W e told them
that we would be prepared to supply copies o f these documents, provided that they met our
photocopying and incidental expenses, that they assured us that South Yorkshire Police
Authority was not funding M r Duckenfield’s defence, and that they undertook not to discuss
the contents o f the files with any serving or former South Yorkshire Police officers, or their
solicitors, until the outcom e o f the CPS review was known. W e requested this last
undertaking because we believed that the CPS are consulting with the South Yorkshire Police
about the matters w e have raised. W e have heard nothing from W inckworth and Pemberton
since.

The position o f Assistant Chief Constable Daines is that, following “guidance” from the
Director o f Public Prosecutions and advice from Hamm ond Suddards, he proposes to disclose
no documents at present, w hether to prosecution, defence, potential witnesses, or to the
Hillsborough Family Support G roup even where the disclosure o f the documents sought was
promised by the Home Secretary in February this year.



                                                -   1

It has been suggested to us that the South Yorkshire Police Authority is funding the defence
o f both M r Duckenfield and M r M urray pursuant to a request made by M r Richard Wells in
1997. If this is correct the expressions o f neutrality by M r Daines are, to say the least,
unconvincing.

You will know from our letter o f 24th August that we believe that the previous investigations
into the Hillsborough disaster have been seriously misled by the South Yorkshire Police, and
indeed the West Midlands Police. W e believe it is for this reason that M r Daines has adopted
his unhelpful stance. Neither you nor W inckworth and Pemberton, we note, have offered any
hint o f protest about South Yorkshire Police’s control o f the archive. Neither has a w ord o f
support been offered on behalf o f either defendant in support o f our request for access to
documents for the purposes o f (a) the prosecution and (b) our opposition to your request to
the Director o f Public Prosecutions to discontinue the case.

We believe that at present the tw o defendants and the South Yorkshire Police have identical
interests in refusing us access to papers that have been collected on behalf o f the following
four bodies:

        a)     Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry o f 1989

        b)     The D irector o f Public Prosecutions in 1989 and 1990

        c)      The C oroner’s Inquest between 17th April 1989 and the end o f April 1991

        d)      The Police Complaints Authority’s supervision o f investigations made by
                officers from a variety o f police forces into complaints made against a number
                o f South Yorkshire officers.

We regard it as legal nonsense to assert that the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire owns
all these papers and therefore has the right to seek to frustrate our constitutional right to
prosecute.

You will, I hope, understand why if the South Yorkshire Police Authority is indeed funding
your defence we are reluctant to supply you at this stage with copies o f the documents you
seek. The bereaved families have been deprived o f important information, statements and
documents for nine years because o f the fiction that in conducting all their enquiries for the
four different bodies above, the West Midlands Police have been in law the “agents” o f the
South Yorkshire Police, whilst at the same time the W est Midlands force has presented itself
 publicly as a wholly independent investigative body.

 At last, at the conclusion o f the “ Scrutiny” , the Home Secretary has insisted that a small
 proportion o f this archive should be made available to the HFSG. Seven months later, we find
 that M r Daines is refusing to disclose statements within the category o f material which the
 Home Secretary said should be disclosed. However, for the first time, the limited disclosures
 have enabled us to see something o f the whole picture o f these investigations, even if the
 structure is blurred by the continuing refusal to allow us to see more, a refusal which it
 appears to us that both defendants support.

                                                 -2-
In any event, if the South Yorkshire Police Authority is funding M r M urray’s defence, it seems
absurd that they should be asked to pay us for copies o f primary documents which are in Mr
Daines' possession. It must surely be in the interests o f the taxpayer that you request copies
o f these documents from Mr Daines yourself. You may tell him that we have no objection to
that course, and we have no objections to your providing him with a copy o f this letter.

For these reasons we will only supply you with copies o f these documents at this stage upon
the undertakings and assurances we have asked o f W inckworth and Pemberton. W e are
providing copies o f this letter in the circumstances to W inckworth and Pem berton and M r
Croston.



Yours sincerely

TECHNICAL W ORKING PARTY

N OTE OF A M EETING HELD IN R OOM 656 THE HOME OFFICE QUEEN ANNE'S
GATE ON TUESDAY 23 JANUARY AT 1.00pm


Present:     Professor L Maunder (Chairman)
             Mr N Bush
             Mr W Carter
             Mr M Dickson
             Dr C Nicholson
             Mr J Sweet (Secretary)


                                                                  Action

1.   Apologies for absence had been received from Mr
Stickley.


Hillsborough Inquiry - Final Report


2•   Professor Maunder confirmed that the Technical
Working Party Report had been accepted in full by Lord
Justice Taylor and would appear in his Final Report.
Although unable to give details of its contents,       he
could confirm in confidence,    that that Report had
itself been completed and presented to the Home
Secretary.     The Government's response was. awaited,      but
all indications were that publication would take place
in the near future.     It was agreed that the Secretary
would distribute copies of the Final Report, once
available,    to members.                                         Sweet




Supplementary Notes


3.   Imminent publication of the Final Report made
completion and submission of the Working Party's own
supplementary notes all the more urgent,      not least
because the Working Party would have no formal locus
once the Inquiry's task was complete.     Nor indeed would
the Inquiry secretariat be able to provide the
necessary support structure.     Given those and other
f   »




                                                                             Action


        constraints,   it was therefore essential to reach early
        agreement on the form,     if not the content,       of any
        notes.


        4.    Professor Maunder invited comment from members.
        At one extreme it would be possible merely to submit
        the various file papers accrued to date together with a
        covering index linking them to the respective Chapters
        of the Green Guide, whilst at the other extreme a
        comprehensive catalogue of the work undertaken,             the
        detailed deliberations of the Working Party members and
        the rationale of their recommendations could be linked
        with a paragraph by paragraph assessment of the Guide
        and proposals for change.       The latter approach might
        risk the charge that the Working Party was exceeding
        its remit by seeking, de facto,       to rewrite the Guide;
        the former might not ensure that the worthwhile core of
        expertise available in the file papers was drawn
        sufficiently to the attention of those who might in due
        course be tasked with any such redrafting.


        5.   The professional expertise embodied in the
        Technical Working Party had ensured in-depth critical
        examination of a wide range of issues.            Such
        concentration of expertise was unlikely to recur in the
        foreseeable future and members expressed some concern
        that detailed issues addressed by them would be
        overlooked by reliance solely on the Working Party
        Report.   In any event,    comprehensive redrafting of the
        Green Guide was likely to be a lengthy process,             and it
        was therefore important to present advice in a
        structured way to facilitate future reference to it.


        6.   After lengthy discussion,       it was agreed that
        Professor M a u n d e r /Mr Sweet would draft                        Maunder/
        supplementary notes on a chapter by chapter basis                    Sweet
        cross-referencing,    where appropriate,        with such
                                                                Action


documents as the Scicon Report,     and the Institution of
Structural Engineers 5th draft.      Reference could also
be made to the index already prepared and circulated.
Dr Nicholson/Mr Dickson's paper on crush-barrier
testing was also to be incorporated;      Mr Dickson
pressed additionally for the inclusion of an expanded
section on flows.     It was also agreed that Mr Dickson         Dickson
would supply information for the complete bibliography.


7.     A draft would be circulated as early as possible
for comment then submission.     Working Party members
recognised that they would no longer be able to
continue as a formal body once the Inquiry had
disbanded,    but nonetheless expressed the hope that
those who subsequently redrafted the Green Guide would
not feel inhibited about seeking advice from individual
members.


8.     More generally,   there was value in making
available supplementary notes to assist in the
improvement of grounds in advance of any revised Green
Guide.    It was entirely possible that a number,      if not
all,   of the Working Party's recommendations would be
accepted by the Government and acted upon immediately.
Remedial work at grounds did not have to await the
long-term reissue of the Guide.


9.     Dr Nicholson undertook to circulate a translation        Nicholson
of the QTIS    (Italian) document as soon as it became
available.


10.    The Chairman expressed his gratitude,   to the
members and Secretary for their dedicated,     professional
approach to the task entrusted to them.      The whole
experience had been a valuable and stimulating one.

CRUSH BftRRTERS AND HANnRATTfi




(1)   INSPECTION



1.0   An important part of the inspection is to determine the physical

      condition of all barriers.    Correct spacing, height and layout together

      with adequate structural condition are all essential if the barrier is to

      function so as to prevent injury.



2.0   In order that comparison can be made with previous annual inspections, a

      full record of the observations on each barrier should be logged by the

      inspecting engineer on a Standard Record Sheet (Ref 5 Ch 6.3) giving

      location and date of inspection together with all comments on condition.



3.0   Any visible defect (corrosion, cracks, holes, misalignment, signs of

      distortion, missing bolts) shall be noted and its potential reduction in

      strength assessed in order to determine whether the condition of the

      barrier is satisfactory.     All signs of potential weakness should be

      looked for, such as potential for instability.



4.0   Members and connections which the engineer considers may contain hidden

      defects (eg corrosion) will need to be investigated further, possibly

      losing nan-destructive examination or by dismantling.    In particular,

      inspection should be made of all areas where water traps or hidden detail

      where corrosion or damage could facilitate corrosion.
When the inspection establishes the presence of obvious and significantly

deteriorated material, eg holes or perforation caused by corrosion, the

barrier shall be deemed to be defective and should be replaced.    Should

the inspection reveal any component whose condition is deleterious giving

any doubt as to performance, then that barrier should be shewn to have

adequate strength by proof testing, or declared defective and replaced.




TESTING



(a)   Introduction



      The purpose of a site test is to assess the adequacy of the barrier

      for service, and to observe and record the behaviour and

      deflections of the barrier, handrails, posts and their foundations

      under test.



      It is important therefore to record both the results of the test

      and to look for any signs of weakness, particularly at the base of

      the barrier posts, or at structural joints, during the test.



      The test should be carried out by applying an evenly distributed

      force of 6kN/m to the barrier rail.    The total force applied will

      therefore vary from barrier to barrier.   A test shall consist of a

      bedding-in cycle and a proof cycle.



      The test schedule should reference the number of the barrier in

      accordance with the 'Barrier Location Plan'. From year to year,

      the barriers to be tested will vary.   The engineer should provide
to the testing authority a schedule of the 25% of all the barriers

to be tested in that year, together with any additional barriers

which the prior inspection has recorded may be of defective

condition.



Test Arrangement



The force shall be applied by jacking against the terrace behind

the barrier, ensuring the test equipment is horizontal as far as

possible generally as diagram.



The instrumentation shall be designed so as to be able to measure

up to approximately twice the design service load of the barrier

and to record accurately each individual force increment required

during the test.



Deflections in two directions at right angles shall be measured

immediately adjacent to the point of application of the force on

the handrails and at the tcp of all posts, losing a method of

measurement capable of an accuracy of ±0.5mm.   The deflection

measuring equipment shall be properly fixed to a rigid part of the

terrace.



The arrangement (), the force (kN) and the deflection (mm) shall be

recorded by the testing authority for each barrier location and

force increment so as to assess linearity of performance of the

barrier under load.   Each barrier to be tested shall be numbered

according to the barrier schedule and shewn diagraramatically on the
      Test Record, so as to indicate the length of the barrier and

      whether the barrier is single or multiple.



(c)   The Bedding-in Cycle



      As an initial cycle, and to allcw for bedding-in of the test

      equipment, the release of any frictional restraints, the barrier is

      to be loaded up to its design service load.   The bedding-in load

      shall be applied in at least three (or six) equal increments, with

      deformations being monitored at each increment of the load cycle.



      The barrier can be considered to have completed this part of the

      test satisfactorily if recovery to ±10% of its original position is

      achieved.   If the barrier fails to achieve this level of recovery,

      it shall be deemed defective unless a satisfactory explanation is

      obtained for these results.



(d)   The Proof cycle



      For barriers the proof cycle is to consist of the application of a

      force which is as nearly as practical equivalent on all components

      of the barriers to the evenly distributed force required to test

      that category of barrier (see Table ... Chapter ...).   As a general

      principle, the barriers shall be proof tested for up to a force of

      1.20 x the Required Design Service Force (Ref 2 Ch 3.8.3).



      The test force is to be applied on five (or ten) approximately

      equal increments, the increment being maintained for five minutes

      prior to measurement of the deflections.   A record should be kept
of all deflections at each increment of force.   The force should

then be released and the permanent deformation (ram) calculated

after release of all force.



Criteria for Compliance



Provided that the barrier has completed the bedding-in cycle

satisfactorily, it should shew no significant signs of permanent

deformation after the proof cycle.   This may be assumed to have

been demonstrated if the following conditions are met:



(i)    Bedding-in cycle - the recovery of the deflection is at least

       90% of the maximum deflection recorded under the full proof

       load.



(ii)   Proof cycle - the recovery of the deflection is at least 95%

       of the maximum deflection recorded under the full proof load.



Where possible, comparison should be made of the performance of

other similar barriers and with that under any previous similar

tests to establish that there is no significant reduction in

overall performance of that barrier with time.



In the event of the inspection revealing a structural condition

that is likely to prove unsatisfactory or the barrier failing to

comply with the conditions of the proof testing, it shall be deemed

defective and either replaced in total, or repaired so as to enable

compliance with further proof testing.

  The impact load with an energy of 0.5 kHta is regarded to be characteristic
  for a man falling against a railing.

  For the test a canvas bag, filled with sand, is used.             The shape and a cross
  section of the bag are indicated in the above sketch.

  The bag is filled with river sand, with a grain diameter of 0.5mm and a
  specific volume weight under dry conditions of 1.55 to 1.60. The sand will
  be dried as often as necessary to obtain consistent test conditions. The
  filled bag has a dead weight of 50 kg. A drop of 1m is required to generate
  an energy of 0.5 kNm.

  The test is performed, as a pendulum movement against the vertically
  positioned construction. The impact is applied to those parts of the
  construction, which are to be expected to have the least resistance and at a
  height above floor level not exceeding 0.70 m.

           TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES


Introduction

1 .   In the review of the technical aspects of safety, the
Technical Working Party considered the content and the
presentation of the Green Guide in detail.   The principal
conclusions of the review and the consequent recommendations are
contained in the Working Party Report to the Inquiry, but in view
of the amount of material gathered in the course of the work
detailed suggestions for the revision of the Green Guide are
assembled in this separate document as a contribution to any
revised edition.

2.   The Final Report may refer to the relationship between the
Green Guide and the Safety Certificate and to the view that the
local authority should follow the Green Guide criteria in
assessing the mandatory requirements for a particular ground.
Variation from the figures then included in the Safety
Certificate would only be permitted by formal revision.

3.   Paragraph 3 of the Report of the Technical Working Party
already records that:

     "3.  It considers that a revised issue of the Green Guide
     should form the basis on which a designated ground or stand
     is certified by the certifying authority, and recommends
     that any departures from the guidance or Technical
     provisions that may arise from local circumstances should be
     fully defined and should be subject to approval in writing
     by the certifying authority".

4.   The Technical Working Party believes that a revised edition
of the Green Guide should incorporate these recommendations
prominently in the introduction.  A high degree of definition in
the guidance offered will be required if ambiguity is to be
avoided.

                        Non-technical Aspects

                        5.   Non-technical aspects of the Green Guide lay outside the
                        Technical Working Party's terms of reference, but they interact
                        closely    with    the  physical   characteristics    of    grounds.
                        Responsibilities    for  the   improvement   of    structures    and
                        communications at grounds, and for the conduct of inspections and
                        tests, including those accepted from the Technical Working Party's
                        Report,  should be made clear in the Green Guide.         Particular
                        attention should be drawn to the management and training of those
                        carrying out the work, to the monitoring of procedures, and to the
                        recording of results.

                        6.   Reference to the required degree of competence of those
                        responsible for carrying out the technical work should be included
                        in the Creen Guide. An example from the Pressure Systems code of
                        Practice is

                              "3.1.      The 'competent person'    (whether a body or an
                               individual) should have such practical and        theoretical
                               knowledge and actual experience of the type of system which
                               is to be examined as will enable defects or weaknesses, which
                               it is the purpose of the examination to discover,      to be
                               detected and their importance in relation to the intergrity
                               and safety of the system to be assessed,"

                             A reference to "the recommending of corrective measures" might
                        be added to appropriate specifications,

                                             tests,
                              (iii)         make     separate chapter on temporary stands      or

                              (iv)          includea new chapter on provisions for       disabled
                                            spectators, and
                              (v)           provide   a bibliography (at least for use by Home
                                            Office).


                             The remaining sections should include the details that have
                        been agreed.    Their sequence could be based on either the Green
                        Guide (starting with Chapter 4 and omitting Chapters 14 and 15), or
                        on the Technical Working Party recommendations.

                Introduction

                1.    In the review of the technical aspects of safety,          the
                Technical Working Party considered the content and the presentation
                of the Green Guide in detail. The principal conclusions of the
                review and the consequent recommendations are contained in the
                Final Report of the Inquiry as Appendix 3, but in view of the
                amount of material gathered in the course of the work detailed
                suggestions for the revision of the Green Guide are assembled in
                this separate document as a contribution to the revised edition.


                Status of the Green Guide

                2.     The Final Report of the Inquiry recommends that

                      "25,      In assessing the mandatory requirements In        The
                       Certificate for a particular ground,     the local authority
                       should follow the Green Guide criteria- Once that is done,
                       the resultant figures and terms for that ground should be
                       specified in the Safety Certificate and no variation from them
                       should be permitted other than by formal revision.

                       26.       Where a local authority incorporates any provision of
                       the   Green Guide,    other than one within the scope        off
                       Recommendation 25 above, It should make clear whether the
                       provision    Is to be complied with absolutely        or   with
                       discretionary flexibility."

            3.   A related point Is made in paragraph 3 of the Report            of   the
            Technical Working Party:

                     "3.       It considers that a revised issue of the Green Guide
                      should form the basis on which a designated ground or stand is
                      certified by the certifying authority, and recommends that any
                      departures from the guidance or Technical provisions that may
                      arise from local circumstances should be fully defined and
                      should be subject to approval in writing by the certifying
                      authority",

            4,   The Technical Working Party believes that a revised edition of
            the   Green   Guide should    incorporate   these   recommendations
            prominently in the Introduction, A high degree o£ definition in
            the guidance offered will be required if ambiguity is to be
            avoided.

                    Non-technical Aspects

                    5.   Non-technical aspects of the Green Guide lay outside the
                    Technical Working Party's terms of reference, but they interact
                    closely    with    the  physical   characteristics    of    grounds.
                    Responsibilities    for  the   improvement   of    structures    and
                    communications at- grounds, and for the conduct of inspections and
                    tests, including those accepted from the Technical Working Party's
                    Report,  should be made clear in Che Green Guide.         Particular
                    attention should be drawn to the management and training of those
                    carrying out the work, to the monitoring of procedures, and to the
                    recording of results.

                    6.   Reference to the required degree of competence of those
                    responsible for carrying out the technical work should be included
                    in the Creen Guide. An example from the Pressure Systems code of
                    Fracticc is

                           "3.1.      The  'competent person'   (whether a body or an
                            individual) should have such practical and        theoretical
                            knowledge and actual experience of the type of system which

                            and safety of the system to be assessed."

                         A reference to "the recommending of corrective measures" might
                    be added to appropriate specifications,

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY - PART II
TECHNICAL W ORKING PARTY

Given other pressures, I am afraid that I have been unable to
produce a formal agenda for our meeting on Tuesday 23 January.
Nevertheless a major topic for debate will clearly be the form of
the Working Party's Supplementary Notes to the Inquiry, and in
aid of our discussions I have therefore produced the attached
index.  It aims to highlight relevant extracts from the minutes
and relevant other papers relating to each Chapter of the Green
Guide.  The reference WP89(M)1 indicates the minutes of the first
Working Party meeting, WP89(M)2 the minutes of the second
meeting, and so on.  Clearly the minutes will be the first source
of reference.  I hope this will be helpful.

                                        Yours sincerely




                                        JONATHAN SWEET

16.  It is a fundamental requirement of safety that structures at
grounds should provide spectators with safe accommodation and
safe means of ingress and egress.    They should also enable police
and stewards to exert proper control over crowd movements. If a
conflict should occur between these objectives, a substantial re­
arrangement may be required;    in no circumstances should safety
standards be compromised.   The Technical Working Party recommends
that references to sub-divisions in Chapter 14 of the Green Guide
be reviewed with these considerations in mind, and that the
Chapter   as  a  whole   should   reflect   these  principles  more
positively.

Separation of Viewing Areas and Pitch

17.  The Technical Working Party recognises the importance of
physical barriers as deterrents to pitch invasions.      It also
recognises that not all viewing areas present the same risk, and
recommends that consideration be given to differentiating those
areas requiring higher levels of security and other areas, such
as seated accommodation and members' enclosures, where     a lesser
degree of security might be acceptable.

18.  The  general   principle  of   separation  endorsed  by  the
Technical Working Party is that the means adopted should provide
sufficient security against pitch incursions to enable the police
to take timely and effective action should such incidents occur.
Clearly a balance has to be struck between crowd control and
safety.

19.  A configuration recommended for wider consideration consists
of a perimeter barrier on the pitch-side backed by a parallel and
continuous crush-barrier on the terrace-side, set back from the
perimeter barrier so as to provide a clear walk-way between the
two;   except in emergencies, spectators would not be allowed to
enter the w a l k - w a y . Such an arrangement would reduce the risks
associated with a common feature of British grounds, namely that
the front steps of terraces are substantially lower than the
level of the pitch:         immediate attention should be given to the
elimination of this hazard.

20.  The Technical Working Party recommends that the maximum
height of perimeter fences should be determined in relation to
the UEFA standard of 2.2m.     It also recommends the removal of
overhanging sections and spiked or barbed-wire attachments at the
tops of fences.

21 . A form of separation increasingly adopted in new stadia is
the dry moat.   To be effective, a dry moat must be sufficiently
wide and deep, and should be protected by fences on both sides to
ensure that spectators and players do not fall into it.     Where
enough space   is available,   a moat may offer an attractive
solution, but its application to older grounds is likely to be
restricted by limitations of space.
16.  It is a fundamental requirement of safety that structures at
grounds should provide spectators with safe accommodation and
safe means of ingress and egress.    They should also enable police
and stewards to exert proper control over crowd movements. If a
conflict should occur between these objectives, a substantial re­
arrangement may be required;    in no circumstances should safety
standards be compromised.   The Technical Working Party recommends
that references to sub-divisions in Chapter 14 of the Green Guide
be reviewed with these considerations in mind, and that the
Chapter   as  a  whole   should   reflect   these  principles  more
positively.

18.  T he  general  principle  of   separation  endorsed  by  the
Technical Working Party is that the means adopted should provide
sufficient security against pitch incursions to enable the police
to take timely and effective action should such incidents occur.
Clearly a balance has to be struck between crowd control and
safety.

19.  A configuration recommended for wider consideration consists
of a perimeter barrier on the pitch-side backed by a parallel and
continuous crush-barrier on the terrace-side, set back from the
perimeter barrier so as to provide a clear walk-way between the
two;   except in emergencies, spectators would not be allowed to
enter the w a l k - w a y . Such an arrangement would reduce the risks
associated with a common feature of British grounds, namely that
the front steps of terraces are substantially lower than the
level of the pitch:         immediate attention should be given to the
elimination of this hazard.

20.  The Technical Working Party recommends that the maximum
height of perimeter fences should be determined in relation to
the UEFA standard of 2.2m.     It also recommends the removal of
overhanging sections and spiked or barbed-wire attachments at the
tops of fences.

21 . A form of separation increasingly adopted in new stadia is
the dry moat.   To be effective, a dry moat must be sufficiently
wide and deep, and should be protected by fences on both sides to
ensure that spectators and players do not fall into it.     Where
enough space   is available,   a moat may offer an attractive
solution, but its application to older grounds is likely to be
restricted by limitations of space.

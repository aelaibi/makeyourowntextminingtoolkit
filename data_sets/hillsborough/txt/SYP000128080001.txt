                I am a cleaner ana I live at the above address with my husband.                       We

                have    lived here for 3 y r s .

                On Saturday 13th April              1989 <130489)       I had planned to go to a jumble

                sal a with my mother-in-law at our                local, cricket    club in Hatfield Hse

                Ln> Sheffield.               I left the house at about       1.40 pm (1340)   to walk to

                the jumble           sale,

                I was aware that on that day there was a semi-final                      football match

                being played at Hillsborough ground between Liverpool and Nottingham

                F o re s t „

                As we were queueing at the Cricket Club there were a number of

                Nottingham Forest             fans drive   past us in cars,        A few of them stopped

                to ask directions to the ground.                 The time was before 2 pm (1400)

                when we were stood outside.                All of the Forest       fans we saw were on
                                                                                      PAGE


         their way to the football        ground,

         When we came out of the jumble sale          it was about 2.30 pm*       <1430)

         We started to walk home across        the cricket field.      When we reached

         the Si cey Hotel   on Bicey Ave,      Outside     1 could see about 4 or 5

         youths who were drinking from pint glasses,             One of the youths was

         wearing a Liverpool    scarf and they all         had scouse accents.     I took it

         that they ware Liverpool        supporters   going to the game,

         As we approached them 1 heard one say they would give             it until 2.33

         pm (1435) and then make their way to the ground.             It must have been

         at least 2.35 pm (1433)        at that time..     I could see that the group all

         had a pint glass with at least a half pint still            to drink.    As we

         walked past them and along the        road I could see they were still

         sitting outside drinking and had not            left for the match,     I would say

         that   it would take about      15 minutes to get to the ground if you know

         exactly where you were going.

         All of the youths would have been in their mid to late 20s.




                                                                                     3 ihi'ihL1

            I am separated from my wife and have four children who normally stay

            w it h my wife.



            On Saturday 15th April          1989    (150489)     I went   to the football match

            which was held at the Hillsborough ground in Sheffield,



            I have supported Liverpool             since    I was six years old and I regularly

            go to the i r mat c h e s „



            I went to Hillsborough with my m a t e »

                       1‘iidnss,   he's not on the phone.



                     ot our tickets on the day of the match.                W e ’d tried to get
tickets     beforeh-2 'nd but we were           let down so we travelled down to the

n'ia t ch h o p i n a t h a t w e co u 1d 9 e ^ 0 ■1e ^ ® 3 r   0   t h e 9 r0 ^ 5*d ■
                                                                                     •



we managed to get two tickets from a group                          of lads who were sitting              on

some benches outside a pub,.                 I think the        pub was called the          '‘Brow*   but

I ’m not sure,        it was on a brow of a hill and although the pub was shut

there was an off sales              place open opposite.              The lads were singing and

looked as though they'd had a. few,                   in fact       a couple of police       officers

came over and asked them to quieten down.                           But they were        in a good

mood.     They,     were a bit rowdy but they weren't                    playing up.



We asked if they had any spare tickets and they said three tickets one

was a stand and two ground tickets                    so             bought     the two ground

tickets.       He paid       10 each for them,             I can't remember which ground

place they were for but              I think the face value of them was                    8 each,

ihe lad.s were Liverpool             supporters and had, Liverpool accents..



ne ana               >ertt down to the game           ir               transit van we didn't

really have any travel             delays on the way down,                 I remember that we

were delayed for a bit down a country lane,                         we were also delayed on a

motorway where there were               roadworks and again near an island just

coming     into Sheff 1 eI.d but we were directed, by a policeman towards ths

ground.       In all we were only delayed about                     10 minutes,,



I 've already mentioned about the group of lads drinking at the Brow,

I ’d say there were about 5-10,000 but walking down to the entrance                                   I

saw both Notts Forest and Liverpool                     fans drinking from cans,

'Supermarkets were open and I saw them coming in and out.                                There were

just    loads of fans drinking,              sitting on the walls..

I ’d say we arrived         in Sheffield at about     1 o ’clock,     half   past   1 at the

late s t <1300 h rs - 1330 h rs )



I d o n ’t know the name of the road^                [parked in but it was near the

pub,     we walked past the pub,      down the main road,      past some shops,           up a

side street and the entrance to the ground was on our                   left,   (Penistone

Rd ),



We d i d n ’t receive any directions where to park we just found our own

s pa c e ,



There were some          little shops by Leppings Ln and I saw a bobby walking

past,         I showed him my ticket and asked him where to go and he pointed

me in the direction of the turnstiles „              Other than that we w e r e n ’t

escorted or received any other directions.               There were      loads of police

about        but I w a s n ’t paying much attention to what they were doing.

On the way from where we parked the general atmosphere was that

everyone 'was enjoying themselves           I d i d n ’t see anyone    playing up.



I ’d say that we arrived at the entrance to the ground at about ten to

two     (1350 h r s )„



The turnstiles were         packed solid.     We managed to get about 3 or 4 foot

inside the crash gates,         one minute was all      right the next minute

everyone was pushing,. We d i d n ’t have a choice which way to go we had

to move with the crowd I got separatd from _______ I saw two police

horses       in the area between the iron gates and the turnstiles,                 one was

right up by the far right turnstile            (B   section RT turnstiles?          the

other one was a bit further over towards the right,.                  The one by the

turnstiles was shouting get back,           but people just     carried on,          I
                                                                                             HAGfc.          ‘



remember he had a moustache.                      There were    loads of people shout ing that

T,hey were getting squashed bu'C there was nothing he could do about                                  i'I

He was just smiling and telling                     people to get back.,      I was

concentrating of getting to a turnstile and keeping out of the way of

the horse.         Loads of people were saying that they were getting

squashed,.        I went through the middle turnstile                   near the   right but, just

before     I went through I helped a little half                      caste lad out.    He was

next to me and had asthma                   and he passed out,        I remember he had      a

little mate with him., but                  I don't   know what happened to him.



I lifted the lad up and passed him over to my right so he could get

out of the crowd.              I got the impression he was still alive but had

just fainted,,



1 ’d say he was about              12 x     14 years old.       He was about 4 *3, weighed

about 3      6   stone,     a thinnxsh lad,          he had    dark   curly hair that's      all     I

remember about him,.               I d i d n ’t see this      lad again.    I then went through

the turnstile.            My ticket was taken off me and I had the stub back.                            I

later threw the stub a w a y »                  Apart from the    policeman on horses,           l

didn't     see any bobbies            standing      in that area.,      I didn't   see any

s t ewa r d s a t t n e t u r n s t i 1 e s .



Once through the turnstiles                     I saw about    12 bobbies standing around,,

they weren't doing anything,                     they seemed to be watching the lads who

were    c ora i ng o ver t he wa 11 to my 1eft,.



I saw them climbing over and dropping down the other side.                             I saw two

jump down and show their tickets to police officers.                            One was a lady

police officer and the other a man.                      To be honest      I'd say they'd

climbed over the wall               to get, out of the         crush outside.

I didn't have any problems -finding my entry po i nt or once through the

turnstiles as I've said the only problem was outside,                                 my mind and body

knew what to expect and although it was uncomfortable                                 I d i d n ’t feel

any danger.



I went through the turnstiles                   and met up with                       We went to the

toilet and came out..             I d i d n ’t see any gates open..



We came out of the toilet and looked for somewhere to get                                  into the

ground we saw a tunnel and we went down there.                               We d i d n ’t know which

part of the ground it would lead us to it was just                               instinct     really,

I hadn't seen any s igns directing us where to go                              to.

I didn't      not ice a fence at the end of the ‘tunnel                        but    I knew that     i

There were no Police Officers or stewards at the                               beginning, end or

                    came out of the tunnel and went down towards                           the front        it

was full      in there but we still were able to make our way down to a

barrier,     I stood right up against                the barrier and                    ha d h is f o o t

on the barrier we were leaning                  back trying to stop              people pushing

down..    The time       would be about half past two                (1430           hrs), I didn't

remember seeing          anyone climbing out at, this time or being                       passed over

felt as if I ’d been punched                            in trie stomach,              the barrier was            right up

against my stomach,                       I felt       rough but              I knew what      to expect,         I ’ve had

it done to me a few times,                            if you stand behind a barrier you expect to

be crushed but this was unbearable ,                                     Experience told me to get under

the barrier and I went down I went, under the barrier but there was a

bloke standing directly                           in front of me               i. knew 1 had to get up and i.

asked him to move.                       He just said "Sorry mate",                         and d i d n ’t move,          I

could see that he had,                       room to move but just w o u l d n ’t so I punched the

back of his                 leg and he moved and said sorry.                            At this time           it was bad

but you could still move about,                                 it was just           like any normal game.

We were able to move about OK.

and           I was      shoutino for someone to help me.



I was taken forward about 4-5 people away from the fence,                                                      I could

my arms                I know that         I d i d n ’t step on me.



I was shouting                   "Please     please,           help me help me",               I saw 4 police

shouting for help.              They were just shouting for us to push back but we

had no where to push back to.                     We had so much weight               coming down on us

it was     iropos s i b i e .     1 saw ail       four of tnem talking              into their        radios

but I clon’t know what they were saying..                         it was jus I- mayhem,.            i saw

At about six minutes              past 3 or even 4 minutes                 past    (1306 or 1504

hrs! ,     I saw cameramen taking photographs of us.,                             They d i d n ’t help

the p o li ce ’s job they just made                 it more difficult             if anyone was

negligent       I would say it was the press.                     We were begging them to help

us but they just took photographs,                        A minute        in that crush was like an

hour.      1 remember that they were on the radio when the players were

kicking the ball about,                t h a t ’s when the mayhem started,.



It seemed to suddenly dawn on the police that we were                                  in trouble.,



I decided to aim for the fence on my right,                               I managed to get to the

fence and a bloke said that a kid had gone down behind me.,                                      I turned

and saw a kids head i could see feet on his body,                                  He was out,        1 d o n ’t

know if he was alive or dead.                     His   lips were moving slightly and his

face was white          I ’d say he was about             14 or     15.     I tried to grab his

shoulders and put my hands under them he seemed to weigh a ton.



People were standing on him and the                       impact of the squash made                 it

I was shouting for people to help me and saying there was a kid down,

I managed to pull him free and I lifted him over the side fence to the

    I tried to yet over as soon as               I put my hands on the fence                   people were

    shouting at me to go back for his mats.                         They were pushing me back

    down to get his mate.



    The    1st lad I pulled out was thin with a thin face.                            I'd say he was

    about 4" tall.        He had darkish hair               (mousey)       it was short and

    straight,        I didn't see h im a g a in ,



    I went    back     tor this other    lad he was about a good yard away from the

    side fence.          It seemed to take about half an hour to get to him,                                I

    had to kneel down in between the crowd I had my head between a chest

    and a back eventually I got to him I could see people were standing on

    him,     I was shouting to people that they were standing on him,                                     I got

    hold of his hand and pulled but he                     slipped out of my hand,               As I was

    down there with        h i m , I saw bodies one on top of the other,                      there       were

    heads,    arms     and feet everywhere.           One body on top of another but                      there

    were people standing on them,



    I asked a fella to help me and we managed to get hold of his arms

    again,     I d i d n 8t know that this was the lad I was after                        it was just

    pot luck I just grabbed anything                  1    could,



    I was    pulling him out       it seemed to            take forever,         all I wasinterested

    in was getting him and myself out.



    At that time I didn't know a barrier had broken,                             it was just      like

    looking through a tunnel            I was    in a time wharp all               I could see was

As     I lifted the kid up I could see people standing on his                         legs,     the

first, t,ime when I dropped hiiTi I stood up and asked this fella to help

me but he w o u l d n ’t he just said that he wanted to get out so I hit hint

and it seemed to bring him around and he helped me,.



The kid w a s n ’t moving at all and 1 think he was dead.



He was about         15 years old may be younger.              He had fair hair he had

black tracksuit          bottoms on,          I know his arms were       bare.,     He must have

weighed 5 or 6 stone maybe                 less.   He we Tit over the fence          I saw him go

over the fence and t h a t ’s when I passed out,

I wake up and         1 was on the football          pitch,     Ihere was       loads of fans

round me,         I came round and I was by the penalty area just outside the

box,    in front of the goal,



I went back towards the terraces to look for                                  Then I seen

people with the jumpers over their heads -- women children.



Then i. met                 he was on the pitch.          We hugged each other and

cried.       He was alright.             Then we started ripping the boards off the

sides     by the Stand,           on the right hand side.



We got a board and took                   it back to behind the goal.                    People around us

were doing the same thing                    picking the dead and                injured up onto the

boards.

to the far end by the forest                         sup*porters end.,         we went down a pathway

and saw an ambulance man with a radio.He was unconcious and                                           having

d i'ff i c u 11 y b r ea t h i n g .,   C.)t h © r fa n s h e 1 pe u m e a n d



We said to the ambulance fella on the                              radio,    where do you want him

mate,     he's     loosing his pulse.                  He just said put him down there.                     We

put him down with the other                         bodies.      We then ran back towards the

pitch to try to help someone else.



It happened so quickly I c a n ’t describe him ••••• he could have been my

own brother and I wouldn't                     have recognised him,



I saw a man lying on the floor with his trousers around his ankles and

his underpants down he was                     lying where we *d just dropped our other man

0 ff -



1 d i d n ’t know if he was dead or alive.                             There was no movement from

him,      1 cixdn’t want to a.ccept the fact                          he was dead ™ I d i d n ’t want            to

acespt the fact anyone was cleaci,



Everything was going around at about                             100 mph.



There was a Policeman standing by the bodies,                                 he w a s n ’t doing
                                                                                                P AGE


anything,           I said to him "Cover him up,           pull his    pants up",          He said,

" H s 's dead",        so I said to him "Show some f ’ing respect",                       1 went for

n iiti a n d m y rr;a t e       p u 11 e d m e a w a y .



We went      back on the pitch and me and                       ta r t e d   c ry i n q




We got back on the pitch fay the centre on the halfway line I saw a

Policewoman and Policeman carrying a young                     lad with a broken leg so

qavs    our board to someone else and we helped them to the side,.



Then I c ou l dn ’t do no more because              I c ou ldn ’t stand the pain from my

shoulder anymore,           then an old man from the FA came out onto the pitch

and I was talking to him - I think his name was



The fans were going mad at him just shouting for something to be done L



I was getting a bit upset myself                 by then so .1. decided, to go home,               this

would be when Kenny Dalglish               came onto the       pitch,.       I think the time

was about a quarter to five              (1645 h r s ) but     I*m not sure.



I went there to watch and have a good day out,                        1 c an ’t believe what

ha p pe n e d ,



Just    to clarify where        1 was as I stood on the terrace and looked

straight ahead the goal            post was either just slightly to my left or

just    in front of me,        the net to the left of that and then the other

q oa i. p o s t ,



Before      I passed out I remember seeing a woman Police officer                            leaning

over the fence and trying to pull me out,                    she w a s n ’t very big but,               she
I also saw other Police              officers helping fans out but,    I also saw some

Police just s t a n d i n g    around,



I don't know why,           whether    they d i d n ’t know what to do or were   in shock

or what,



I think that fans should have been directed away from the tunnel ■•••• the

Police     horses should have stood across and directed the fans around,



l saw people getting hurt on the spikes- on the fence's as they were

trying to get out - why have spikes on them,                I think this   contributed

to the irijuriss people             received,



i   was not aware that any loud speaker announcenient,s 'were m a d e ,



All   I was     concentrating on was getting out with my own skin.



Everyone      that gets out feels; a coward — feels guilty that you should

n a s<e d o n e n>o re »



One thing that upset me was the camera men ••■■■ why were they allowed to

take photographs           of the   injured -- the dead.    When they should have

been helping,          I actually saw the camera men standing         in front of the

Police taking photographs             of us ~ if they knew what was; going on,       it

must have been obvious to the Police,



They should have opened the gates               in the pens to let people through.
                                                                                                         H A Cat


I went to Anfield on the Monday or Tuesday after this tragedy had

happened..        I went to lay a wreath for those who had died.



As we were queuing up the camera men were                             photographing the people

coming to pay their              respects,          I got upset with them,.                  I dropped my

wreath off came out              1 was upset and angry about the camera men.                                  I sa

this man and I asked if he was a reporter,                                he said he was so I had a

bit of a go about what was going on,                            I asked him to print what                 I'd

said about        camera men taking photographs,.                         He wrote     it down and I gav

him my name and address.                   He was from the Sunday Times.,



He Dhoned me a few times                     on the Friday he phoned up and he asked me

                                                                 1.
                                                                  1s Hi
                                                                     4    ..?„<

going too far — t h e r e ’s no dignity in that.



All    I can say is that             it never should have happened.                       Ifeveryone          had

done their job properly it wouldn't have happened.



Instead of treating              people      like dogs and animals maybe we could                         be

treated like human beings,

but the same goes for some Liverpool                         fans,



I didn't go to the semi-final                     last year,          On this         day I was wearing             a

pair of Wrangler jeans,- a red sweatshirt with the                                    logo   '

    On the way to the ground the organisation was great                                     Police directing

    the   cars and everything but there was no organisation at the ground.



    Another thing          is that all the bodies were mixed up - true injured were

    lying with the dead,.               ihere was no one there to say injured to the

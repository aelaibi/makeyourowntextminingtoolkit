Dear Michael

HILLSBOROUGH

In the adjournment debate on 17 December last you said you would consider
representations about a reopening of the public enquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy.

In view of this I thought that you might find it useful to have the attached copies of
correspondence with the maker of the Granada television programme and with the Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire police.

You will see that this correspondence discloses a significant discrepancy about the alleged
missing tapes. Ian McBride claims that footage from “police surveillance cameras’’ had
disappeared. Mr Wells says that the only tapes to go missing were two in the possession of
Sheffield Wednesday FC. He implies that in any event the tapes would not have been of
any probative value because they were not trained on the terraces.

In any assessment you make following the representations you have received, I think it very
important that this discrepancy is either cleared up satisfactorily - or if not it must surely
become one of the factors tending to reopen the enquiry.

Best wishes.

Yours sincerely,

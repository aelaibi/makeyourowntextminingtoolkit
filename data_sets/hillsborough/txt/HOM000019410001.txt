HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


We spoke on the telephone the other day about Lord Justice
Taylor's plans to visit football grounds during Part II of his
Inquiry. I mentioned that Lord Justice Taylor would be in
Manchester on Friday 6 October and you kindly offered to show him
round Old Trafford and conclude his visit with a working lunch.

Lord Justice Taylor is grateful to you for these arrangements.
He would like to see the arrangements made for the control and
safety of the crowd, and would be glad of an opportunity to talk
to the club officials responsible. He would also find it helpful
to talk to the police, and I am in touch with Greater Manchester
Police about this.

I will accompany Lord Justice Taylor throughout.

After a working lunch, Lord Justice Taylor plans to make a
similar visit to Maine Road.

Perhaps you would like to suggest a suitable time for arrival and
let me have details about which entrance we should come to.
Please get in touch in the meantime if you need further
information.

We look forward to meeting you and your colleagues on 6 October.

at    this      stage     know what           the s i tu at io n was         in the West        S t a n d and        it

a p p e a r e d only to be a public                  order     situation.            A number        of fans         on tr

pitch,         Liverpool       fans,     were abusing my s e l f             and other         o f f icers      and       I

clearly         remember       that     many of them,              smelt     of beer and other al cholic:

drinks,         it was      only after a few minu t e s                 that     the s i t u a t i o n    became

clear.          An     inspector      i n s t r u c ^ d me     to as s i s t     in removijpy^Sodies and

the    injured from the               p i t c j r f and    I helped     to    carry             off      using

a d v e r ti s i ng    h o a r d i ng sy es    stretchers.           The     first    one     1 helped         to    carr;

off was a white male,                   probably           in this     thirties and a p p e a r e d            to    be

overweight.              I cannot       remember what              he was w e a r i n g     he was       c a r r i e d to

the    rear of the N o r t h Stand.                       He was    o b v i o u s l y dead.     At    the      rear       of

the N or t h S ta n d officers were taking                          the    hodies^yTffcT the gym so                    I

returned            to the p l a y i j ^ a r e a .     I     then a s s i s t e d    fans wit h another

hoardin g           taking Anot h e r       fan    into      the    rear    of the stand-.              I. cannot

describe          the      fan other       than he was a white youth,                     he a p p e a r e d     to have

a leg      injury.           1 left him at the area                    inbetween the N orth S t a n d and

the S pion Kop.                I then      returned to the              pitch near        to the West Stand.

I saw that there were                     a number      of    fans      laid on the grass who                  looked,

injured.              I went   to speak        to them but             g e n e r a l l y they were        distressed

by the sit u a t i o n and             they smelt          of a l c o h o l i c    drink.       There      were also «

number      of fans who were acting                     v i ol en tl y towards myself                 and other

officers            but they were          being      r e strained         by other       fans.        Under      the

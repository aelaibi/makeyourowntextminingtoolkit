    patrol.                 We      did      not       have    a     personal            radio.

    From          10.45am              (1045)          it w a s     quite         hectic        with a          l arge      number         of       coaches

    arriving                and        f an s     walking          to    the      ground        these          being       mainly         Liverpool

    fans.             These            supporters             were       nearly          all    carrying             cans     of L a g e r ,

    drinking                as      they went.                I did advise                the    supporters                t ha t    they       should

    not        be     drinking               and       that    they w ou l d             have    the       cans       taken away when                     they

    reached              the        ground,            but    they       ignored          the    advice and                carried         on

    drinking.                     Although             the    fans were               drinking        there          was    no      disorderly

    behaviour                    that       I s a w at        this       time.

    We      co n t i n u e d           to    patrol          this       area      unt i l      about       2.45pm          (1445) when

    C O IT lflld H U r l 11 I,                    told                            and myself             to     go    to    the      ground             and

    get       a dr i n k .              A s we         made    ou r w a y         to     the    ground          along       Halifax            Rd       the

    road was                lined w i t h              empty       b e er    cans        and    the      supporters              were      making

    remarks              and       comments             to    us.        The      supporters             I saw were              all      Liverpool

^supporters                       and       had     been      drinking            h e a v i l y , they were                ur i rjati j>$//'at the

^   from         th e      supporters.

    We      then went                  to    th e      ground where               we     got    a drink          near       to      the    G y m at

    and       myself              went       to     the      corner         of    the     ground North Stand                        and West             Stand

    to      see       what         the       crowd        looked         like.           We    were      not     on    the       Pitch         but       up    in

    th e      N or t h Stand.                     At    this       po int        we    saw a S t e w a r d           having         trouble             with    a

    Liverpool                    supporters             and went            to a s s i s t      him.          After        sorting         this          out

    we went              back          up    into       the North^iStand w h e r e                    we       had    s ome      abuse         from a

injured.              I tried         to    prevent           the     f a ns     from        going           along      the     gangway

but       they     i g n o r e d me        and       pushed      us      out     of     the way,              no m a t t e r      what       they

were        going      to     come      through.             Although            we     got        crushed against                    the    wal l

On     reaching          the      pitch       the      players           were      out       on the           pitch       but     I do       not

point        I assisted a               regular         Officer                  take        a male           prisoner          to     the

the       pitch       towards         the W E s t       Stand         at    thi s       stage           I w as      separated           f rom

On     reaching          the      perimeter            fence        at      the        rear        of        the    Leppings           L n E n d of

could        not      get    h im     o u t , I could            see       thi s       m a n w as        crushed          but     he w as

alive.

At     this      point       I was         stood       on the         pitch        in the           front        of P e n       four,        I

             trouble.              We    had      to     let     them      do w h a t    they wanted              to    do.         After       the

             fans      had        cleared         I went         back      to   the     North     S t a nd a n d        sat       with        other

             regular          and Special                Officers,          I think        it w a s        about       half       past        fo ur.

             We w e r e       de      briefed          by a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     and       stood       down.           I did        not     go

             into      th e       Gym and         had     no     dealings         with any        particular                body.

             In m y      opinion,             the      ground        is b a d l y     designed         the     is      no    proper           entrance

             for     the      emergency             services          to get        onto    the       pitch.           There        is    only        one

             small       at       the    side       of    t he      North Stand          and     this       was     inadequate.

             From      the L i v e r p o o l           supporters           I saw       they were           abusive          a ll    day       f or    no

             apparant             reason and             the m a j o r i t y      had    been     drinking             heavily           all    day.

             large       number          of    the       Liverpool          fans      I saw      on    the     pitch were                showing        me

             tickets          which         had     not     been      checked when             they        entered          the     ground and

             because          the       gates       at    th e      rear    had     been    opened          this       had    caused           the

             over c r o w d i n g .

             At    the       t i me     when                          and myself           were       at    the     junction             of    the

             N ort h Stand and West                       Stand       I saw       large     numbers          of L i v e r p o o l         f ans

             climbing             over      the     fence        which      separate        these          starters.         Officers           were

             trying          to s t o p       them       but     large      numbers        did    o^ t      over.

             I wish          to    state       that       when       I found        the J m s p e c t o r      at      P e n 3,      he w a s

             organising               the     removal          of    the    bodies       not     just       standing          there

                                                                                                                                                IGNED

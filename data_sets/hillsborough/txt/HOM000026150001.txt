                                                 F. MADDOX

Q.   Mr. Maddox, as- a police officer yourself and having
     been at the previous year's match, did you prior to
     3 o'clock that > day have any thoughts about the policing
     of the semi-final?      A. Yes.  Obviously I am aware of the
     way the^; Are policed to a degree.    There didn't seem to
     be the same amoufifc. of police visible.  Whether there was
     the same amount of police there as the previous year, I
     don't know.   I can recall last year going there and there
     were mounted police on the outside of the ground and there
     were quite orderly queues of people waiting to get into
     the ground, and in actual fact I think I was searched
     last year by police officers on my way to the actual gate.

Q.   Where had you been sitting or standing last year?
     A.  Last year I was in the West Stand in a seat above
     the g o a l .

Q.   From your position last year, were you able to see down
     on to the Stand and Terraces?    A. Yes;  not too much,
     but I could see the top of their heads.

Q.   Can   you now recall how full they appeared to be last year?
     A.    It did look full.  On semi-final day it is always full

Q.   But nothing that gave you cause for concern last year?
     A. No, certainly not;   nothing like the amount of people
     this time.

Q.   A short time after the time that we have been discussing,
     did you see the first signs of people climbing out on to
     the pitch side of the pens?   A.  Yes, I recall ---

Q.   Perhaps we do not need the details as such.  What I would
     like, Mr. Maddox, is what was your immediate reaction as
     a policeman as to what the situation was?   A. Behind the
     goals?

Q.   Yes. A. Actually, I thought they were fighting amongst
      themselves. That was my initial view.

Q.   Did you see any specific thing that led you to that view?
     A.  I saw one of the crowd party come out of the gate.
     I presume he came out of the gate;  whether he came out
     of the fence,; I don't know.  He looked quite dishevelled,
     his face looked swollen, and he looked like he had been
     in a fight, and that's when I first thought there was
     some trouble in there.

Q.   Can you recall the stage at which you realised it was not
     a public order situation? A.    The first time I realised
     it wasn't was, from my own point of view, when I put my
     head through the gate and saw the bodies on the terracing

Q.   I have jumped ahead.   Let's just take you through that.
     Obviously a stage was reached when you as a policeman
     decided that you woatdeigo down and assist if you could?
     A. Yes.   Another one of my friends had come out, and this
     was my first indication that my other four friends hkd
                                                F. MADDOX

swapped their tickets.   He roughly knew where we were,
or he knew where our seats were, and he came directly
in front of us round into that area and said that he
couldn't find my fourth colleague, and obviously there
was something wrong.   He said, "It's crazy down there".
I tried to go and find him.

To which gate did you go?     A. I went to No. 3.

You say, going back to a previous answer, it was only when
you got to that gate that you realised it was not a public
order situation?   A.  Yes.  I think bodies were out at
that time.  I don't know why they had been pulled out, but
once I had made my way round to the gate I saw that bodies
were heaped on top of each other and they were being pulled
out by police officers, and it was then I realised it was
a major disaster.

Can you help us as to the time When you reached gate 3,
were tfefe players still on the field or not? A. Yes.   I
don't think they were.    Obviously at that moment in time
the situation was that time stood still.    I tried to
indicate the times in my statement and I think probably
they may be out of order.    I sort of tried to think back
how they were.    I don't think the players were on the
pitch at that time, but I do think there were a lot of
people already pulled out before I put my head round the gate.

And I think you then gave assistance to those that you
could and you in fact had some involvement with Mr. Hicks's
daughters?   A.  Yes.

As you will appreciate, we have had many accounts of this
stage and I do not propose to ask you to go through all
that.    But that was your involvement up to that stage
with Mr. Hicks's daughters?   A. Yes.

     Mr.   GOLDSACK:   Thank you, Mr. Maddox.

              Cross-examined by Mr. GLASGOW:

Mr. Maddox, just one matter.  You arrived at about
half-past-one or shortly afterwards?   A. Quarter-to-two
I actually sat down.

I was wondering what time you had arrived in order to be
sitting down at quarter-to-t«ro?   A.   Oh, I think I left
the public house, which is in Hairanerton Road, at about
quarter-past-one.  It's a steady walk down through
Hillsborough, down to the ground.   I think I w a i M have
been going through the back of the South Stand at the same
time the Forest bus came, which would be 20-to-2.

Can you remember back to 1988 - was that the same sort
of time that you arrived?   A. No.  I think I arrived
later last time.  We stayed in the public house a bit
longer and I think I got to the ground about half-past-2.

Half-past-2 in 1988?    A. Yes.
                                             F. MADDOX

And in the 1988 game you were using the other entrance,
I think the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end? A. Yes.

Can I ask you about the 1988 situation at those turnstiles?
Wefce you comparing this year with last year when you talked
about the number of police?    A.  Yes.

In 1988, at the Leppings Lane turnstiles at about half-past
was there fairly orderly queueing that year?   A. Last year
yes.

And did you have the impression that the crowd that there
was was restricted at the perimeter gates last year, and
that the actual queueing at the turnstile was controlled?
A.  Yes.  Obviously it's a year ago now, but that's the
feeling I got.  As I say, I was searched on my way in and
there were mounted police at that end, and we were in a
long queue from the gates to the actual doors.

Once you got tp the perimeter gates - and you know the
ones that we are talking about, the curved ones at the
entrance - from that point, once you were through those
gates, were there straight queues all the way to the
turnstiles?   A.  Yes, there were.

On timing, Mr. Maddox, some time at about half-past-1 or
quarter-to-2 is a fairly typical time for crowds to start
arriving in bulk for a semi-final, is it?   A. Yes, I would
have thought so;  about an hour before the kick-off.

That is your experience at this ground or at grounds
generally?   A.   For semi-finals, this is the only place
I've been to a semi-final, this ground.   In most cases,
I think people go to a football match about half an hour
before it starts.

But at a semi-final you expect the bulk to be arriving
about an hour before, do you?   A. Yes.

On this occasion, by the time you got into the ground, the
centre two pens behind the goal were already fairly full?
A.  Yes, yes, they looked full at 2 o'clock.

Did that surprise you?   A.  No, not really.  At first I
thought the Liverpool supporters' end was the other end,
and that looked full, and then when they said "That's the
Forest end, this is Liverpool", it was quite amazing ---

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  It was quite amazing, did you
say?     A. Yes, that they got that end.

     Mr. GLASGOW:  The question of the allocation of the
end surprised you?   A. Yes.

And I am sure that as a police officer you would understand
that there may be policing reasons for th&t?   A. Oh, yes,
I appreciated their approach to the ground and the way that
they are confined and contained.
iw(Ef                            8
                                               F. MADDOX

        Q.   I will not press you on that, Mr. Maddox.  It was more
             the question of the concentration behind the goal.   It
             is not surprising, is it, that when the terraces are
             free with communication between them, that the fans like
             to pack behind the goal as far as they can? A. Yes, I am
             Lfture they do.




                                     /Q.   Even when the pens
                                 F. MABDOX


Even when the pens are from the outside full, it does not
surprise you that as we have seen on the video, people
will still climb into them in order to .... A. This season
I went to watch Liverpool and Wednesday and I went behind
the goal at the Liverpool end because everyone wants to
go behind the goal.  I don't know why, they just do.

And it is quite common to have fans climbing into that
area even at a late stage in the packing when the pens
are fairly full? - A. I have never seen it full.

You have never seen it before this year? - A. No, I have
never seen people climb fences to get in before.

But you are quite clear in your recollection that it was
climbing into those centre pens? - A. Yes, I am not sure
about the time.  I think it was half-past-2.  It was
between 2 and half-past that they were climbing in and I
did see them climbing out on to the top of the Stand.
They were being lifted out at one stage. Obviously that
would be after the inital push of people.

The last matter, Mr. Maddox.  I think you expressed the
view when you were at the ground on this day before the
tragedy occurred, that you regarded this as being a
first class stadium and ideal for the game? - A. Yes.   I
have some links with Hammerton Road Police Station and come
here when I can to watch games of football and I was telling
them about the ground and how it is one of the best in the
country and first class for this sort of venue.

From what you had seen and from what you had heard from
your Police experience and as a football supporter yourself,
would it be fair to describe that Sheffield Wednesday
ground is in your view a very well run ground with very
good facilities? - A. Yes, yes, it has first class facilities.
At the outset I thought it was public order and nothing
more.

      MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you, Mr. Maddox.   Thank you sir.


             Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Mr. Maddox, your comparison of the policing between 1988 and
1989 is of course comparing what you found at the Forest
end in 1989 with what you had seen at the Leppings Lane
end in 1988? - A. Sorry, yes I was in the Forest end in
1988, you are right.

You were at the Forest end in 1988 were you? - A. Sorry, no
you are right, the Liverpool end.  I was just trying to
think.  There was a colleague with us who was there last
year who was a Forest supporter and he stood i*p when they
scored the goal and everybody turned round and looked at
him, so I think it must have been the Liverpool end.
                                      F. MADDOX


Which end were you at   in 1989? -     A. I was   in the   West Stand.

And when   you had gone in you had gone in through the
Leppings Lane gates had you? - A. Yes.

Would you have a look where they would be so there Was no
doubt about it? - A. Yes.

The blue   gates there? - A. Yes.

And this  year you had gone in where? - A. That entrance    in
the corner.

You had come in from the Penistone Road end? - A. Yes,
there.

I beg your pardon, in 1988 you had come in from ....
A. Leppings Lane.

And in 1989 you had come in from? - A. The top corner.

The Penistone   Road end? - A. Yes.

So we are not comparing the policing of the same areas,
are we? - A. No.

Reference has been made to your experience as a Police
Officer and value in making assessments of crowds.  Is it
right, however, that on this occasion in 1989 you did not
appreciate that it was other than a disorder situation
until you put your head in through the gates? - A. Not
really, I saw people being pulled out but I did not know
whether they were victims of violence.

But it was not until you put your head through the gates
that it occurred to you that it was something else? - A.
Oh no, not at all.

You got into the ground and were in your seat at quarter-to
- A. That is correct.

And in the position that you took up you were able to look
down on to the terraces? - A. That is right.

You say that at about 2 o'clock the terraces were how full?
- A. They appeared full behind the goal.

Would you have a look please at photographs in the Police
Composite Bundle, Album 2. The first three photographs
in there are views of the terrace area. One can see in
Photograph 1 just the corner of the goal net.  Do you see?
- A. Yes.

Does that represent the situation as you saw or something
less than you saw at 2 o'clock? - A. It is difficult
because I would have a different angle view of this.
                                 F. MADDOX


For example if I may help you.   Looking at the first photo­
graph one can see almost in the centre foreground a gentleman
holding up a Scottish flag with room around him.   He is by
Gate No. 4. Then if one looks to the next photograph one
can see people to the left in the foreground just in front
of that balloon, or whatever it is, turning round talking
with a lot of room to ia©ve about.  Do you see? - A. Yes.

Does that represent the situation that you saw at 2;vo'clock
or something different? - A. The view I got it looks
different to that.

Does it surprise you that that is taken at about 2.46? — A.
No, not at all.  It is a different angle.

So is what you are saying this:  it may depend from which
particular part of the terrace one is looking at that the
impression of fullness is got? - A. Absolutely, yes.

But really one would have to take an overall view before
one went to make a comment as to whether or not it was full?
- A. Absolutely, yes.

You speak of having seen the terrace full, those pens full
at about 2 o'clock. Are you talking of looking at different
areas from those which we see in those first three photo­
graphs? - A. No, I am talking of looking at a different
angle to what these photographs were taken.  I am looking
from up and above and down.

Are you saying that from looking up and above you are going
to see more or less space? - A. I don't know.  I could only
see heads, I did not see space.

However at the time you spoke of seeing the pens full,
nevertheless there were determined individuals scaling
the fences to go into them to join them? - A. Yes.

The situation that you observed at about quarter-to-3 was
what, how was it at about quarter-to-3? Had there been
much change in what you had seen between 2 and quarter-to-3?
- A. More people had come in.  It was a good day.  Every­
thing was going fine as far as I knew.  I am not too sure
about the times, quarter-to-3.

A quarter-of-an-hour before the kick-off? - A. Yes, I know
when it is.  I am not sure looking back now on what had
actually happened.  I don't know whether it is quarter-to-3
or 10-to-3 before the players came out.

May we take it up to the time when the players came out.
Did you notice much change in the state of the crowd? - A.
Yes,nore people came in.

Anything to cause you any concern? - A. No.
                                     F. MADDOX


Q. And that is speaking as a Police Officer as well as a fan?
   - a . Well you say caused me concern.  I thought there was
   a lot of people in that end and I thought there was not
   a lot of Policemen on view and that was the only concern
   I had and we talked about it amongst ourselves.

Q. Did you see Policemen along the front at the perimeter
   gates? - A.Sorry?

Q. Did you see Policemen along the front at the perimeter
   gates? ' Did you see any Policemen? - A. I saw a few
   Policemen.  I cannot recall how many and I don't know, I
   saw a few Policemen.

Q. Are you able to say where they were? - A. I can't recall
   now.

Q. You have criticised them for their sparseness or fewness
   of numbers, but are you able to say where they were? -
   A. Put it this way:  I did not see lines of Policemen round
   the sides of the ground.

Q. There weren't lines of Policemen round the ground.    That
   is what you mean, is it? - A. Yes.

         MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you very much*

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you very much, Mr. Maddox.


                     WILLIAM PURCELL Called

                   Examined by MR. PHILLIPS:

Q. Are you   Dr. William Purcell? - A. I am.

Q. And you   are a doctor in Sheffield in general practice? —
   A. Yes.

Q. And you hold a part-time appointment as Sheffield Wednesday
   doctor.  Is that right? - A. Yes, I do.

Q. You have done this for several years.     Is that so? - A.
   Yes.

Q. I think   you regard yourself more as a team doctor, do you,
   than as   the Club doctor? - A. Yes, I do.

Q. Can you  say why that is? - A. My duties are mainly to deal
   with injured players rather than injured spectators.

Q. You attend, do you, on all occasions when the stadium is
   being used for football: matches? - A. Yes, I do.




                         /Q. Whether it is
                                           W. PURCELL


Whether it is being used by Sheffield Wednesday or some other
team? - A. I can't think of any occasion when it has been used
by another team.

Apart from Semi-Finals of the Cup, of course? - A. Oh, of
course, Semi-Finals, yes.

Do you know, Dr. Purcell, that the Football Association has as
one of its rules for Semi-Finals that there should be a
qualified medical practitioner in attending at least 30
minutes before kick-off? - A. Yes, I do.

Do you regard yourself as being there to comply with that
particular rule? - A. On this occasion, yes.

Had it not previously been the situation that that rule
applied to Semi-Finals, or at least the doctor should be there
during the match? - A. This was the first year I think it
applied.

The first year in which it was necessary for the doctor to be
there 30 minutes before kick-off? - A. Yes.

But previously it had been the rule, had it not, that the
doctor should be there during the match? - A. Yes.

Had you been there the previous year for that purpose? - A.
Yes.

Do you know also, Dr. Purcell, that it is a condition of the
ground's safety certificate   (sir, this is on page 1.11 of the
core bundle) Condition 8.2:

     "The holder shall ensure that during every specified
     activity" (which means effectively a football match) "a
     physician employed or retained by the holder is available
     to attend at the first-aid room if required, and that his
     whereabouts are known to those in the Police central
     control room at the stadium".

Did you know first of all of that condition? - A. No, I
did n 't .

Had anybody at the club ever drawn it to your attention? - A.
No.

Do you know of any other physician employed or retained by the
club  who might have fulfilled that condition? - A.   No.

You are the only one in effect? - A. I am the only one.

Had you in fact ever made it your business to let the Police
control room know where you were? - A. No.

From what you say presumably you saw no need to? - A. Yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Did you about that condition in

                                        14

                                                                W. PURCELL


               the safety certificate? - A. No, I did not.

          Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:     One of the purposes of the presence of
               this physician is to   attend at the first-aid room if required.
               Did you realise that   was one of the things you were there for?
               - A. No, I did not.    I had not read this condition at all.

          Q. And nobody in the club had told you that is what you were
             there for? - A. No.

          Q. Had you in fact attended        at the first-aid    room on any previous
             occasion? -A. I had been        to the first-aid    room on one
             occasion, but it was not        for casualties. It was really     just
             to look at the room, and        this was off my own bat.

          Q. How long ago was that? -A. Shortly after the first aid room
             was built and opened.  I am not quite sure how long ago, but
             a considerable time ago.

          Q. During the course of matches and so on if a person is found to
             be injured, a spectator, and is dealt with by St. John's
             Ambulance and taken to the first-aid room, from what you say
             you have nothing to do with it? - A. No.

          Q.   Do St. John's have adoctor of their own present at the match
               to your knowledge? - A. In the past there have been doctors
               occasionally present, but not as a common condition.

          Q. If you were asked would you go to the first aid room? - A.
             Certainly.

          Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When you say in the past there
               have been doctors there, you mean just by chance, or by
               arrangement with the St. John's Ambulance or what? - A. With
               St. John's Ambulance, St. John's Ambulance doctors.

          Q.   I am sorry, it is my ignorance probably.  I don't know what  a
               St. John's Ambulance doctor is? - A. An officer who is a
               doctor could be there.   An officer of St. John's who is also a
               doctor.

          0.        MR. PHILLIPS:    You mentioned, I think, one particular
               doctor in your statement? - A. Yes, Dr. Shortland and I
               believe also Dr. Burton are connected with St. John's
               Ambulance.

          Q.   Were they there on 15th April this year? - A. I do         not know.

          Q.   You had no liaison at all with St. John's? -A. No.

          Q. And you do not know, therefore, if          they were there the
               previous year either? - A. No.

          Q. Do you think it would be helpful, Dr. Purcell, if you were
               consulted or liaised with the St. John's Ambulance Brigade? -
               A. I have no particular skills in mass casualty.  I d o n ’t know
               that I could be helpful.  Perhaps I could give advice about
                            15

                                                     PURCELL


     how to get about the ground and the sort of problems of
     getting casualties to various par ts , but I have no skill in
     mass casualty.  I don't think my advice would be particularly
     useful to them.

Q. You have, of course, a medical room at the ground? -A. Yes.

Q.   Which is used by Mr. Smith,the physiotherapist? - A.      Yes.

Q.   And by yourself, I suppose,   if you need to? - A. Yes.

Q. That is in the players' part of the ground, iB not it, under
   the South Stand? - A. That is right.

Q. And so far as you are concerned is that really for the benefit
   of players? - A. Yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Just before we go on, you said you
     have no skill in mass casualties.  Is that a skill which is a
     speciality in medicine? -A. I would think there are certain
     doctors, say accident and emergency consultants, who might
     have this skill, or else doctors in the Army, for instance,
     would have this skill, or the Territorial Army.

Q.   When it says in the safety certificate that a physician
     employed by the club should be available to attend at the
     first-aid room, your view would be that he should be
     somebody who has knowledge of casualties of that kind over and
     above what a GP would generally have? -A. I would think his
     advice would certainly be useful. I think this would be
     important, especially for big matches.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   Of course, from time to time there are
     casualties amongst spectators without there being what you
     described as mass casualties? - A. Yes.

0. In that situation, individual casualties, you as a doctor
   would presumably be able to give help and advice? - A. Yes.
   You have to remember the geography of the ground.  To get from
   one part of the ground to another part of the ground can
   sometimes take me 20 minutes. So it was really in the past on
   rare occasions only for people who were close to me that I
   attended.

O. But if that problem was solved do you think it would be
   helpful if you participated in the first-aid exercise by
   attending at the first-aid room from time to time? - A. I
   don't think during the match it would be possible to do that
   because I have to sit and watch what was actually happened to
   the players. I have to watch and analyse how the player goes
   down injured, because that tells you what type of injury he
   has got. So your concentration is on the actual playing.

Q. Is that, in fact, Dr. Purcell, the instruction that you have
   from the club, that you should look after the players? - A.
   This is basically the instruction I have, yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       You are saying really that insofar
     as the safety certificate includes a requirement of a
     physician available to attend the first-aid room, that should
     be somebody else, because you are full-time required by the
     club to be on call in case one of their players needs
     attention? - A . Y e s . You c a n ’t leave the match because you
     would miss the play and miss the actual injury.        This is
     the problem.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:    Can you help us about the provision of
     equipment.   Would you be able to say, for example, if I
     showed you a list of the equipment that was intended to be
     kept in the first-aid room whether you thought that was
     sufficient? - A. I d o n ’t think I could. I have never been
     involved in the actual equipping of the first-aid room.

Q. No.    I understand you don't have a key to the room? - A. No.

Q. And you have never been asked what should be in there? - A.
   No.

0. We have had a list provided, or the club had a list provided,
   by Dr. Bailey, who is a specialist in community medicine.
   Among the various things such as stretchers and blankets and
   so on he suggested there should be a Minuteman resuscitator? -
   A . Yes.

Q. Are you familiar with that? - A. Yes, I am.

Q. Do you think that is a useful thing to have in the first-aid
   room? -A. Yes, I would think it would be, but it needs someone
   who knows how to use it.

Q. It is something that requires some training, does it? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Do you think one would be sufficient, or should be sufficient?
   - A. I would think in a normal match one would be ample.  You
   could not cater for a mass casualty situation.  You could not
   hold enough available.

Q. Did you yourself have any equipment that you kept with you? -
   A. Yes, I did.  I carried on my person two airways which were
   basically Brooks airways. I also had in my medical room an
   Ambu-bag.

Q. Can I ask you first about the Brooks airways, please.   What
   are they? - A. Brooks airways are basically a tube with a
   curved tube at the end of it.  The curved tube is placed over
   the person's tongue, and you breathe through ,the other end of
   the tube.  The purpose of it is if the person does vomit it
   keeps you away from the vomit, and also it keeps the tongue
   forward.

Q. Obviously very useful in the situation that arose on 15th
   April? - A. Y e s .

        Q.   You had, I think, two of those on you? -A. Yes, I did.

        Q.   They seemed to be fairly simple devices.   Is that so? - A.
             Y e s , they a r e .

        Q. Do you think the first-aid people should have these? - A. Yes,
           I believe they do have them, actually.

        Q.   You would not see     any difficulty in the first-aid    people usi
             that particular device? - A. No, it is a very simple device.

        Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    In fact when you used the Brooks
             airways they did get full of vomit, did not they? - A. Yes,
             this is the trouble, they did block up.   It was very difficult
             to dislodge the vomit from them.   We tried blowing them, but
             you were losing time.    In the end I threw them away and just
             kept going with mouth to mouth straight on the person's skin,
             but the Brooks airways did block up.

        Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   How long after you started using it did
             it block up? Was it any use to you at a l l , in other words? -
             A. It was useful for a very short time and then it blocked up.

        Q. This other thing you mentioned, an Ambu-bag? - A. Yes.

        Q. Can you tell us what that is? - A. An Ambu-bag is basically a
           bladder which is connected by a tube to a nose and mouthpiece
           like an inhalation device from an anaesthetic room, and you
           squeeze the bladder and it pumps air into the person's mouth
           and nose area.  That is possibly a more useful piece of
           equipment because you it w o n ’t block up with vomit, but it is
           more expensive.

        Q. Again, is that something that could be used by first-aiders
           such as St. John's? - A. Yes, it could be.

        Q. Without particularly special training? - A. No, they would
           need some training.

        Q. And those are readily available, are they, as items of medical
           equipment? - A. Yes, they are.

        Q. They, of course, help to resuscitate people as a substitute I
           suppose for mouth to mouth resuscitation? - A. Yes.

        Q. Can you get a better flow of fair with one of those things
           than you can with the mouth to mouth? - A. I think first of
           all you can control it if you are skilled in it.  I keeps you
           away from the person's vomit, because when a person vomits and
           you get vomit in your mouth it makes you boke, it makes you
           vomit yourself, which interrupts the mouth to mouth breathing.
           So really a device like that that keeps you away from the
           vomit means that the resuscitation is going to be more
           continuous.

        Q. How many of those do you think it would be useful for the club
           to have, knowing the club as you do? - A. I would think most
                             18

                                                 W. PURCELL


     of the first-aiders should have them, the St. John's first-
     aiders .

Q.   Most of the first-aiders should have one each? - A. Yes.

Q.   Now, I think you are against the idea of having
     defibrillators? - A. Yes, I am.  In the Hillsborough Disaster
     it would have been impossible to use a defibrillator safely.
     That is the basic problem.  I am not against defibrillators in
     general, but in a disaster situation with crowds of people
     pressing on you there was no way you could have used it.   You
     would have electrocuted someone.

Q.   Did you in fact use your Ambu-bag on the day in     question? -A.
     No, I did not.  I left it in the medical room.  The situation
     I envisaged was possibly running on to the pitch, quickly
     getting the footballer off the pitch, and using the airway if
     necessary, and then using the Ambu-bag for continued
     artificial respiration in the actual medical room.   I kept it
     in my bag in the medical room.  When the disaster occurred the
     thing that was always in the back of my mind, you had four
     minutes in which to act.  You had four minutes before the
     person would be brain dead, and if I had run back for that bag
     I would have lost those four minutes.




                              /Q. So when it occurred.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Before you ask questions, Mr.
     Glasgow, I would just like your; hfelp on this, Dr. Purcell:
     You were on the pitch, of course, doing what you could,
     as you have said, giving people a certain amount of time
     and then moving on, time being of the essence?     A. Yes.

Q    Four minutes, you say, brain damage if        he has not recovered?
      A.  Yes.

Q.   And some of the people that you and Mr. Evans were dealing
     with, you managed to rescue them, did you?   A. Most of
     them did not recover at all.

Q.   But some?     A. One at the   beginning.

Q.   Can you help about this?    If there had been an announcement
      asking for any doctors in the crowd to come immediately on
      to the pitch, bearing in mind that time was of the essence
      anfl    Gould only deal with one person at a time, do you
      think that would have been helpful?   A. I would have
      thought the more help we had for those mass casualties,
      the better.

Q.   But there was no announcement?       A. No.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Thank you.

                 Cross-examined by Mr. GLASGOW:

Q.   Dr. Purcell, I am sure everybody is very grateful for the
     effort that you did make and I do not want, of all people
     here, to sound in any way critical of you.     But may I just
     ask you, if in fact you had been sitting in the gymnasium
     or in the first-aid room when you were first told by the
     Police or by anybody else that this situation had developed,
     do you believe there   is anything more that you could have
     done than you did do   to save lives?   A. No.

Q.   Would it have made any difference - let me put an extreme
     example to you, again without any personal criticism -
     if you had been sitting in the Police control box with a
     panoramic view of the ground and you had seen the situation
     develop in front of you, is there anything more, on that
     tragic day, that you could have done that would have saved
     more lives than you did?   A.  No, I don't think so.

Q.   And in the events which in fact occurred, when you got
     on to that situation   on the ground, I think it is right
     to say that only one   of the victims who you came across
     was capable of being revived?   A. Yes.

Q.   I think that you accept, Dr. Purcell, that if anybody had
     at any time asked for the Club doctor, they would, have
     been referred to you?   A. Yes.

Q.   And very fairly in your own statement, you describe on
     page 2, having set out the functions performed, you say
     "The duties I describe above are those which have been
     carried out by the Club doctor for very many y^ars and the
     way I dealt wit h the matter is in no way different from
     my p redec e s s o r s ' ■ ? A. Yes.

                                                  D. W. PURCELL

Q.   Did you know that Dr. Bailey, who is the specialist in
     community medicine, had been asked to advise the working
     party as to the medical requirements at the ground?  A. No,
     I did not.

Q.   You did not?   A.   No.

Q.   Did you know that Dr. Bailey had told the working party
     that the pressures on his time were such that he did not
     wish to become involved in discussions with Club personnel?
     A. No, I didn't.

Q.   If Dr. Bailey had not taken that attitude and had been
     prepared to discuss the matter with Club personnel as to
     the requirements,  would he have been directed to you?
     A. I don't know.    I don't know that I can answer that
     question.

Q.   I appreciate it is difficult.   Let me put it in a more
     direct way.  If Dr. Bailey, when advisig the working party,
     had said "I want to speak to the Club doctor;  who is he?",
     he would have been referred to you?    A. Yes.

Q.   And you would have been able to explain to Dr. Bailey what
     you saw your duties as being?  A. Certainly.

Q.   What facilities you knew there were at the ground?   A. Yes.

Q.   And, from a general practitioner's point of view, you would
     have been able to tell him what equipment you personally
     thought might help?    A. Yes.

Q.   And what would be unnecessary or,   in your view, pointless?
     A.   Yes.

Q.   Could we assume that if you had been asked for your own
     input at this stage by Dr. Bailey, you would have said
     that, for example, a defibrillator was not a good idea,
     but airways and ambu-bags were?    A. Yes, I would have
     said that airways and ambu-bag* were essential, but a
     defibrillator I thought was necessary as well, but not
     for the situation that occurred at Hillsborough.  I was
     envisaging a situation where somebody would  drop down,
     an individual, with a coronary, near to where I was.   Now,
     that was the situation that I envisaged for defibrillator,
     but I did recommend a defibrillator.

Q.   Could we look at that ---

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry, you did, did you
     say?   A.  I recommended to the Club that they got a
     defibrillator.

Q.   But that would be largely to deal with one of their players,
     would it?   A. Or else somebody close by me, possibly     a
     director, who had dropped down with a cardiac arrest, near
     me.

                                                      D. W. PURCELL

Q.          Mr. GLASGOW: And the circumstances in which you would
      envisage that being used, Dr. Purcell, are to take the
      patient somewhere where they are secure and where you can
      work?    A. Yes.

Q.    And to try and revive heart activity after a cardiac
      incident of some kind?   A. Exactly.

Q.    You would not have attempted to use one in the circumstances
      that arose on this occasion?   A. No, it was far too
      dangerous.

Q.    You have over the years I think dealt with a number of
      incidents which have happened on the pitch?   A. Yes.

Q.   And it was your experience and expectation that if there
     were going to be injuries, as distinct from collapses,
     they were likely to happen on the pitch?   A. Yes.

Q.    The sort of incidents which you had envisaged and I think
      discussed with people as being likely to happen in the
      Stands were heart attacks or collapses of one kind or
      another, but not a likelihood of physical injury?  A. Yes.

Q.   And in the past, when people have collapsed on the ^Stands
     either through fainting, or I think on one occasion a heart
     attack, you have been the man who has dealt with it?
     A.  Because they were close to me, close to where I was
     sitting at that time.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: What is your range from where you
     sit?   A. Mostly in the South Stand itself.  I would be
     mostly in the South Stand.  If it was in the West Stand
     or North or down at the Kop end, it would be too far away.

Q.         Mr. GLASGOW:    Too far away for what purpose - for you
     to be sent?    A.    For me to get to them in time to do any
     good.

Q.   Let us look at the two examples.  If somebody had a hfeart
      attack in the West Stand, who would be sent for to try to
      deal with it?   A.   The St. John's Ambulance.

Q.   Because the length of time that it would take you to get
      there would probably be longer than the St. John's
      Ambulance who are distributed around the ground?   A. Yes.

Q.   But if, for whatever reason, the Police had     decided that
      they wanted a doctor at the first-aid room,    are you the
      person who would have responded to that?      A.   It has never
      happened in the past but I presume I would    be.

Q.   I think you always    sit in the same seat?    A. Yes.

Q.   And the position in which you sit is known, of course,     to
      the Club officials?  A. Yes.
                                28


                                                    D. W. PURCELL

Q.   Particularly to the m an in radio contact with the Police
     Room, ex-Superintendent Lock?    A.  Yes.

Q.   And to the police officers who stand in front of you on
      the perimeter, many of whom I think know you personally?
      A.  Yes, they do.

Q.   They would know you by name and they would know who you
      are?  A.  Yes.

Q.   And if any experienced police officer at that ground wanted
      to know who the Club doctor was or where he would be
      sitting, you would expect them to know that without
      needing to be told, would you?   A.  Yes.

Q.   Can I ask you again about equipment, Dr. Purcell?  If you
     went to the St. John's Ambulance Brigade for advice about
     equipping a first-aid room, I think you would probably be
     referred, would you not, to their manual in which they
     have printed information?   A. Yes, I believe so.

Q.   Have you seen that yourself?       A. No, I haven't          actually
     seen that m a n u a l .

Q.    But   you know   of its existence?    A. I've heard of it, yes.

Q.   You would not, as I think you told Lord Justice Taylor,
     expect the St. John's Ambulance man on the ground simply
     to give you a list;   you would expect him to refer to the
     guidance in the manual?   A.   Yes.

Q.   The last matter, I think, Dr. Purcell, relates to the
     question of the ambu-bags and the a i r w a y s . I think there
     was a particular incident which had occurred that caused
     you to raise that matter with the Club Chairman on one
     occasion?   A. Yes, I did.

Q.   Did you recommend the purchase of that?           A. Yes,       I did.

Q.   How many were in fact bought?          A.   Just one.

Q.   One ambu-bag?     A. For my own personal use.

Q.   For your own personal use?        A.    Yes.

Q.   And that is, would it be right to say, the easiest form
     of resuscitator for anybody to use?    It is a r e s u s c i t a t o r ,
     is it not?   A.  Yes.  It's not the easiest.   The actual
     Brooks airway is the easiest, but it's the most effective,
     I would think.

Q.   The Brooks airway is simply an access-way,          is it not?
     A.  That's right, just a tube.

Q.   And nobody could call that a resuscitator?              A.   No.

Q.   But the ambu-bag is a mechanical means of placing              air into
      the lungs?   A.  Yes.
                                                    D. W. PURCELL

Which is, if you are talking about resus c i t a t o r s , the easiest
one to use?    A.  Yes.

It requires some training in the way in which you hold the
mask around the face?   A.  Yes, and the pressure on the
bag.

Apart from that, the use of the bag would be no more
complicated to teach than mouth-tOemouth resuscitation -
perhaps even easier?   A.  Yes.

And you described the Brooks airway and the ambu-bag as
being useful equipment, but isit right  that on this
occasion when you attempted to use      both the airways that
you did have, both of them became useless ---    A. They
blocked up with vomit.

    within a matter of seconds?         A. Yes, very quickly.

And tragically, given the type of injuries which we had
in this case of loss of consciousness induced by crushing,
the problem with vomit is one that is almost inevitable?
A.  Yes, I would think so.

     Mr. GLASGOW:     Thank you very much, Dr. Purcell.

     Mr. KALLIPETIS:   Sir, there is one matter to complete
your note on paramedical training that I would like to put
to Dr. Purcell, if I may.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Yes.

        Further cross-examined by Mr. K A L L I P E T I S :

Dr. Purcell, in addition to the other skills that I asked
you about, there is one that I omitted, and that is
intravenous infusion?   A.  Yes.

Would a general practitioner be able to do that or would
he require extra training?   A. I would think a young
general practitioner could probably do this if he is
straight out of hospital.  I think someone who has been
out of hospital for a long time would need the extra
training.

So just to summarise, it is intubation,         i.v. infusion
and defibrillation?   A.  Yes.

Are you aware of any requirement in other sports at all,
Dr. Purcell, for the training of a doctor who is in
attendance?   A.  No.

     Mr. KALLIPETIS:      Thank you.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Thank you very much, doctor, and
thank you for all you did.

     Mr. GOLDSACK:     Mr. Higgins please.
                                                  P. HIGGINS

     Mr. WOODWARD:  Sir, before this witness is called,
it is perhaps important that you should be aware that
before we went away for the weekend we were provided with
a comprehensive and somewhat extensive folder of SYMAS
statements.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes.

      Mr. WOODWARD:  Sir, the purpose of the exercise over
the weekend was to be best informed and best prepared for
most expeditious pursuit of this week's activities.   Sir,
 when we arrived this morning .we were greeted with a
series of other documents, many of them from some of these
witnesses who are to be called representing the Ambulance
Service.   Sir, we have been assured that those documents
do not contain anything fresh or in addition to that
which is in the statements;   that I understand from the
Ambulance Service themselves.    Sir, if that is the case,
one m ay wonder why we have been troubled with these papers
at all.   Sir, may we proceed upon the basis that they are
to be ignored and we can proceed upon the statements which
have already been served, because we have not had the
opportunity to cross-reference, to correlate or even
simply to read those statements which we have been given
this morning.   It frustrates the endeavour, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I have not seen them, Mr.
Woodward, but if they add nothing, then perhaps we can
dispense with them.  If they do and you are embarrassed,
no doubt you will tell me.

     Mr. WOODWARD:  Sir, we have been told that they add
nothing.  May we proceed on that basis?

     Mr. KALLIPETIS:  Sir, I rise in defence.  I thought
I had explained to Mr. Woodward before we started that
what these extra statements amount to are timed events,
times taken from videos which we have seen and from the
various radio messages that have been transmitted to
SYMAS Headquarters, and they really give a chronological
sequence to the events in the sta&iujnv

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I thought we had a fair
amount of chronology in these rather voluminous statements,
Mr. Kallipetis, quite frankly.  I am anxious that we
should not get this aspect out of proportion.

        Mr. KALLIPETIS:    I understand,   sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    So no doubt you will use your
discretion as we go along, bearing in mind that if you
can omit something, it m ay obviate the need for Mr. Woodward
to rise.

        Mr. KALLIPETIS:     An invitation I can hardly refuse,
sir 1

        Mr. GOLDSACK:     Mr. Higgins, please.

                PATRICK HIGGINS, Called
                Examined by Mr. G O L D S A C K :

Are you   Patrick Higgins?      A. Yes, sir.

A long time member of the South Yorkshire Metropolitan
Ambulance Service, and since 1983 a Station Officer?
A.  That's right, sir.

Since the Bradford fire in particular, have you had
particular involvement with Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club?   A. I have, sir.

I think following the fire at Bradford, it was decided
within your service that there should be a disaster plan
covering each of the main football stadiums in South
Yorkshire?   A. That's correct.

And you attended a meeting in July 1986 involving police
officers* fire officers and yourself?   A. That's right.

And as a result of that meeting and other major consideration,
your major accident plan for Sheffield Wednesday was drawn
up?   A. That's correct, sir.

And we find that at page 322 in the core bundle.  Prior to
1986, had there been any ambulance service presence at
Sheffield Wednesday football matches?   A. Not at Sheffield
Wednesday football matches, sir;  only at semi-finals.

At semi-finals?    A. Not actually in the ground at semi­
finals, but it was provided as cover.

So if we can just briefly go back to 1981, say, what was
the position then so far as your Service attending the
semi-final was concerned?   A.  We provided ambulances
that stood by close to the ground.

But outside rather than inside?        A. That's right, sir.

I think in 1986 you decided that it would be useful if
there was an Ambulance Service presence within the ground
at all matches?  A. That's right, sir We were concerned
after the Bradford fire.

And that is obviously a matter that you would have
broached with the Club?   A. I believe the Chief Officer
approached the Club, sir.

The identify of that person, the Chief Officer?         A. Mr.
Page.

Mr. Page did that.  Was the effect of that approach that
two tickets were made available?   A. That's right, sir.

For yourself and Mr. Eason, in fact?  A. Initially it was
for myself and Mr. Keyworth. Mr. Eason came on later.
                                          P. HIGGINS

So from what datie did you attend matches regularly?
A.  From the start of the 1986/87 football season.

And was that part of your official duties or something
that you did in your own time?   A. It was something
that we covered in our own time.

What about the provision of ambulances within the ground?
A. We only provided ambulances within the ground at
semi-finals.

What, in general terms, ha^evyou found the Club's attitude
tot be to your presence at normal League matches?  A. At
normal League matches, I think they have been glad that
we have been there, especially Mr. Smith, the physiotherapist

Since the time that you have been issued with season tickets,
have they always been for the same seats?  A. They have,
sir, yes.

And is that in the South Stand?     A. In the South Stand.

And whereabouts?   Can you just indicate to us on the plan?
A.  It's directly behind the players' tunnel.   It's row T,
seats 152 and 153.




                                  /Q. When you were discussing.
                                 P. HIGGINS


Now when you were discussing with the other interested
parties in 1986 how you would cope with a m«ajor incident
at Hillsborough, was the question of access for your
vehicles discussed? - A. We knew the ground pretty well,
the Police, the Fire and ourselves and it was obvious
from the onset of the meeting that the oiily access to
the ground was via the gymnasium entrance.

Now there are in fact two entrances from the road at
that end of the ground? - A. That is right, they are very
close together, sir, so they both serve the same entrance
at the gymnasium.

In the event of a major incident did you envisage using
just one of those entrances or both? - A. I think initially
we envisaged using both the entrances as a turn in for one
and exit through the other.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   An in and out? - A. That is
right, my Lord.

      MR. GOLDSACK:  With whom was that discussed? - A.
Well it was a general discussion   as we went round the
ground with the Police and Fire Brigade.  I don't think
there was anything formal.

Do you recall whether a Club representative was present at
that discussion? - A. There was only the Club Groundsman
sir.

Was there general agreement amongst that group that the
idea of a one gate in and one gate out was a good idea? -
A. I think that was the idea that came from everyone at
that time, yes sir.

Well now that plan having been drawn up, do you know to
whom it was circulated? - A. I don't sir.  I got a copy
from Mr. Wilkinson who was the ADO at Headquarters at the
time.  I understood that they had been circulated to all
the other parties but I couldn't ....

You weren't personally involved in that? - A. No.

But thereafter you attended at many matches? - A. That is
correct sir.

Did you in the course of routine checks during those matches
ever check to see whether both the exits and entrances
were kept clear? - A. On semi-final days we used to check
the immediate area round the gymnasium but I don't think
I ever checked the actual drive-in between.

Well now can I come to the arrangements for the semi­
finals.  The 1986/87 season you had had a season ticket?
- A. That is correct.
                                        P.   HIGGINS



Q. What happened when the semi-final came round? - A. I
   approached the Club and asked if there were any tickets
   available for our seats and I was told by the Club that
   the ticket allocation for semi-finals is organised by
   the F.A. and they had no control and therefore the tickets
   would not be available sir.

Q. Did you in fact attend the 1987 semi-final? — A. No sir.

Q. I didn't phrase my question very clearly.  By "you" I
   meant SYMAS? - A. We attended outside the ground, not
   inside the ground sir.

Q. Again was that you yourself on a voluntary basis? - A. I
   was on a voluntary basis, but there were two crews supplied
   at the cost of SYMAS.

Q. Had it been explained to the Club when these discussions
   had taken place that if they wished to have an ambulance
   presence at the ground they would have to pay for it? -
   A. That was made plain to the Club if they had a specific
   ambulance attend home matches sir.

Q.What did   the attitude appear to be to that? - A. The
person that was involved at that time was M r . Smith and he
   indicated that the Club at that time were happy with the
   St. John's.   He did not think the Club would pay for an
   ambulance presence.

Q. Were you happy with the situation at the 1987 semi-final
   when you weren't present inside the ground? — A. Not really
   sir, we were concerned.  We had attended but it limits
   what we could have done in a situation such as developed
   in 1989.

Q. So when you heard that the 1988 semi-final was also to be
   at Hillsborough, was a formal approach made to the Club
   fortickets?   - A. I telephoned the Club again sir and got
   the samereply as I had had before that it was the F.A.'s
   job to distribute tickets and not the Club's on semi-final
   day.
Q. When you made these 'phone calls did you want to speak to
   anyone in particular at the Club? - A. The first semi-final,
   the first year I tried to get hold of Mr. Mackrell but I
   could not get past his Secretary sir.

Q. Did you have any more success in 1988? - A. No.

q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Do you mean you could not get
        his Secretary?   She would not let you speak to him or what?
        - A. Well the answer I got, my Lord, was that Mr. Mackrell
        was not available;

q.            mr. GOLDSACK: How many times were you told that?
        - A. The first year I was told that four times sir.
                               35

                                          P. HIGGINS


Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That is   1987? - A. That is
        right, my Lord.

Q.           MR. GOLDSACKs   Had you simply told his Secretary
        that you were Station Officer Higgins or had you let her
        know that you were ringing up with a specific request
        concerning the semi-finals? - A. The first year I actually
        mentioned that we were there on a normal match-to-match
        basis;after the Popplewell Report that we should be in
        attendance at such occasions and I did tell her that for
        the semi-final of 1987 but it did not make any difference,
        we were just told that the tickets were not available.

Q. Were you able to glean on your third or fourth telephone
   calls whether she appeared to have spoken to the Secretary
   in between? - A. Well the reply I got on either the third
   or the fourth was that she had spoken to Mr. Mackrell and
   the tickets were not available for SYMAS.

Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  How many times did you ring
        in 1988? - A. Just the once, my Lord.   I did attend at
        the ticket office and I got the same reply that year sir.

Q. Is there any suggestion that the P.A. might be asked about
   this? - A. There was not, my Lord.

q   .         MR. GOLDSACK:  Well now you did in fact attend the
        1988 semi-final I think? - A. I did sir, yes.

Q. How did you arrange that? - A. Mr. Jones who had taken over
   in Chief of Operations for SYMAS approached the South
   Yorkshire Police and the Police allowed us to go in to
   their area near the gymnasium where we parked our vehicle.

Q. For the purposes of identification, was that contact through
   Mr. Sewell? - A. That was through Mr. Sewell by then, yes.

Q. And he arranged, did he, for yourself and Mr. Eason? - A.
   I went along with another Officer, Mr. Bentley on that
   first occasion plus an Ambulance Crew.

Q. So that altogether there were four SYMAS officials in the
   ground? - A. That is right, plus there was an ambulance
   outside the ground.

Q. Just again identify for us, if you will, where the ambulance
   was positioned? - A. It is an area between the Spion Kop
   and the North Stand, close to the gymnasium.

Q. Is the stick in the right place? - A. Yes, just there.

Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  And who was paying for that
        attendance? - A. That was paid for by SYMAS, my Lord.

Q.            MR. GOLDSACK:   Did the two officers with the ambulance
                                      P. HIGGINS


     remain in it throughout the match? - A. On which occasion
     sir?

Q. 1988 semi-final? - A. The ambulance was parked at the top
   of the ground and all four ambulance personnel were at
   the bottom of th|ramp with a view to the pitch.

Q. And when you say "bottom of the ramp" is that simply standing
   there so that you are able to see the pitch itself? - A.
   That is right.

Q. At the 1988 semi-final were your services in fact called
   upon? - A. Not actually inside the ground we did not respond
   to anything in the ground.  We were used afterwards outside,
   there was trouble after the match.

Q. You say at that semi-final in addition to the ambulance
   inside, you had a second one on standby nearby? - A. That
   is right sir.

Q.   Again your own initiative? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   Did that arrangement also occur this year? - A. That is
     right.  Mr. Jones approached Mr. Sewell again and we had
     the same arrangements with the South Yorkshire Police.

Q. Do you know whether the Club were told that you were there?
   - A. The Club were told. My colleague Mr. Eason contacted
   the Club.

Q.   Is that before the 15th of April? - A. Yes sir.I believe
     Mr. Eason contacted the Club after he had spoken to
     Inspector Sewell.

Q. To let the Club know that you had made arrangements to be
   present? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you know yourself to whom within the Police Mr. Sewell
   passed the information on? — A. I don't sir, no.

Q. Did you personally speak to anyone more senior to Mr. Sewell?
   - A. I didn't sir.

Q. Were you parked in the same position this year? - A. We
   were sir, yes.

Q. And again did you have another ambulance on standby near
   to the ground? - A. We did.

Q. On the day itself did you position yourself between the
   Kop and the North Stand? - A, We did.

Q. Were there any calls on your services before 3 o'clock? -
   A. None at all sir.

When you attend matches what means of communication do
you have with you? - A. We have the standard radio on
the vehicle plus we carry a hand set.

Do you as a matter of course carry out a test with your
Control before matches start? - A. We check, we do a test
call on arrival at the ground.

Did you do that on the day of this semi-final? - A. Yes
sir.

Is that both on your personal radios and on the vehicle
radio? - A. Yes sir.

And were they all apparently working properly? - A. Yes sir.

Is that both on your personal radios and on the vehicle
radio? - A. Yes sir.

Were they all apparently working properly? - A. Yes sir.

What was the first you were aware of any trouble at this
year's semi-final? - A. About 3-minutes-past-3 we noticed
a disturbance at the Leppings Lane end just behind the
goal.
At first did it appear to you to be the sort of situation
where you would be required? - A. It did not sir, no,
it just looked like a crowd problem behind the goal.

At what stage did you decide to do anything further about
it? - A. Well at that stage I asked Mr. Eason to go down
and have a look to see if we were required.

For how long was Mr. Eason away? - A. Approximately two
minutes.  He just went down to assess and then came back
to me.

And what was the information he gave you on his return?
- A. He said when he came back that they had been attacked
himself and Mr. Chippendale and that they had got a
casualty there with a query fractured limb in the goalmouth
area.

What instructions did you then give? - A. We collected
equipment and went back down.  I had already notified
our Control that there was a possible incident but it
did not seem serious at that time, then the four of us
went back down with the equipment to reassess the situation
down there.

From the seats that you occupy at league matches, do you
have a better view than you had standing between the
Kop and the North Stand? - A. A better view of Leppings
Lane?
                                 P. HIGGINS


Of the Leppings Lane area where we know the trouble
occurred? - A. I would say we would have rather than the
ground position we held on that day sir, yes.

I appreciate this is with the benefit of hindsight, but
knowing as you how know what was happening, do you think
you would have appreciated earlier the need for your Service
to be involved if you had been in your usual seats? - A. I
think that is almost impossible to say.

Did you locate the casualty when you returned to the
Leppings Lane end of the ground? - A. Yes sir.

And did you make the necessary arrangements for him to be
dealt with? - A. That was left with Mr. Eason and Ambulanceman
Chippendale and Worrell.

Whilst you physically were at that end of the ground did you
appreciate the scale of this disaster? - A. Not at all sir.
I was still convinced it was just a minor crowd problem.

How close to the perimeter fence did you get? - A. I was on
the edge of the grass surface just before the cinder track
sir.

To try and put matters in context, were the players still
on the field at this stage? - A. They were initially as
we were going down but a Police Inspector stopped them
before we actually got down to the casualty.

Did you return to the area near to the ambulance? - A. I
did sir.  I called Control again.

What was your purpose in radioing Control at that stage?
- A. By the time I was getting back towards the ambulance
vehicle there were more people coming over the top and
it was starting to look as though we could possibly have
some more minor injuries as I thought at that time.

So what was it that you wanted from Control? - A. I asked
them to send me the standby vehicle down close to the
ground itself.

Did you at about the same time also get a message from
Control? - A. I got one shortly after that sir at about
8-minutes-past.

Was what that for? - A. They told me they had reports
from the Police about an incident at Leppings Lane and
could I check it out.

What did you do upon receiving that message? - A. I told
the Control Officer that there was an incident developing
at the Leppings Lane end but the plans we had for this
ground made the only access for vehicles at the gymnasium
and I asked for the vehicles to come to the gymnasium area.




                                                            .m'f   it:'.
                                    P. HIGGINS



A. At that stage did you consider there was any need for more
   than the two ambulances which were readily available?
   - A.Not at that stage sir, no.

Q. Having made that contact with Control what was your next
   movement? - A. I met Mr. Eason on the pitch again and by
   this time there were quite a number of people coming over
   the fence. We jointly decided that it was developing into
   a serious incident and I went back to the vehicle yet again
   and passed the message to our Control that it was developing
   and that we would need far more ambulances.  I think I asked
   for ten sir.

Q. After that did you remain with the ambulance? - A. No sir,
   I went back down on the pitch again trying to assess the
  numbers we were getting over.

Q. Did you at some stage try to use your own radio hand-set?
   - A. I was trying several times both on the pitch and in
   the ambulance area.

Q. Was it functioning properly at that stage? - A. It was at
   times but at other times it was difficult getting through
   to the Control Unit.

Q. By the "Control Unit" you.. A. I could not get through to
   Rotherham Control.

Q. Do you know what the problem was? - A. I don't.  There was
   quite a lot of people around at that time, it was difficult
   to hear anywhere in the ground.

Q. Have you been involved in other major incidents where there
   is a very noisy crowd around? - A.No sir.

Q. Have you come across situations before where your radio
   has not worked properly at critical moments? - A. No sir.

Q. For how long did it appear that your radio was not operating
   properly? - A. Well it was difficult to say.  Some messages
   were obviously getting through because we were getting
   messages back from Control but it is difficult to assess
   what was getting through and what I was missing with the
   crowd noise.

Q. Did you at some stage decide that this was what you would
   call a "major incident"? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Can you help us as to the stage at which you made that
   decision? - A. I had been told by a Policeman that there
   were bodies down at the other end and we had actually
   by 13 or 14 minutes past it was apparent that there were
   bodies there and that is when I went back to get that
   information to the Control Room.

Q. You have just mentioned you got back information about
                                  P. HIGGINS


there being bodies from a Policeman.  Do you know which
Policeman? - A. I don't know the Policeman sir, no, he
was a Sergeant.

Do you know whether that was because he had been sent to
find you or just as it were casual conversation? - A. He
came to the ambulance and yelled something to that effect
at me.

Your normal contact With the Police is Mr. Sewell? - A.
That is correct.

Did you know where to find Mr. Sewell within the ground?
- A. I did not sir. We had an arranged point for the
ambulance as the gymnasium and I expected that to be the
point of any contact.

And if Police Control which of course is completely the
opposite side of the ground from where you were, if they
wished to contact you how would you expect them to do that?
- A. They would have to go through our Control or send
someone round.

Either a runner or via Control? - A. Yes sir.

What was the practical effect so far as you were concerned
on the ground of declaring this a major incident? - A.
It made our Control aware of the resources we would need
and they started to put that into operation.

Did you from that point onwards until a more senior Officer
arrived remain with your ambulance? - A. Yes sir.

You being the Control Officer at that stage? - A. That is
correct, sir.

And Mr. Eason being the Incident Officer? - A. That is
correct.




               /Q. Forhhow long
                            41


                                                    P. HIGGINS


Q. For how long were you based at the ambulance before a senior
   officer relieved you there? - A. Mr. Hopkins arrived at 23-
   minutes-past. I briefed him and he took over the role of the
   Control Officer.

Q. In those few minutes between your taking over as Control
   Officer and being relieved by Mr. Hopkins, presumably your
   other officers were involved in helping with the general
   casualties and fatalities? - A. That iscorrect, sir.

Q.   Did you see the first ambulance arrive?   - A. I did, sir.

Q.   Do you know what time that was? - A. I think    it was in the
     region of 17-minutes-past.

Q. Was that the one which had been on standby near the ground? -
   A. Two arrived virtually together.  There was a Parkway
   vehicle and one specifically stood by for the incident.

Q. Can I move to a different aspect.  You told us that the plan
   had been that ambulances would use two entrances, one in and
   one out? - A . That is correct.

Q. On the day is that how it worked out? - A. It did towards the
   end of the incident, but not initially, sir.

Q. Why was that? - A. There were some vehicles parked in the
     gymnasium entrance in the early stages.

Q. Do you know to whom they belonged? - A. I could not really
   say.  I believe there were some Police vehicles and some hire
   vans.  I don't recall how many of each there were.

Q. At what stage did you become aware that that entrance was
   blocked? - A. I became aware when I went to check the
   gymnasium to see if it was clear to be used for a
   casualty collecting point.

Q. At what stage was that? - A. That was I think approximately 13
   or 14 minutes past.

Q. About the time you were declaring a major incident? - A. Yes.

Q. Because you of course know that the gymnasium would be used as
   per the plan for casualties or fatalities? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Having realised that the gates were blocked did you personally
   give any instructions to anyone to clear them? - A. By that
   time it was chaos in that particular area, and it was
   difficult to get hold of anyone.  We still had access
   for three to four vehicles in the first entrance
   which was adequate at that time.

Q. Just dealing with the ambulances, I think within a fairly
   short period there were a number of ambulances as it were
   stacked up on Penistone Road moving in as quickly as they
   could to take casualties to the various hospitals? - A. That
                             42


                                                  P. HIGGINS


     is correct, sir.   We tried to maintain 10 outside the ground.

Q. In practice they reversed in, collected their patients and
   then came out forwards? - A. That is correct.

Q. Did that in practice cause any appreciable delay? - A. I don't
   think so.  It went rather smoothly once the operation got
   underway.

Q. I think the arrangement as per the plan was that initial
   casualties would be taken to the Northern General? - A. That
   is correct.

Q. With the Hallamshire as the reserve? - A. Yes.

Q. Again, on the day did that part of the plan appear to work
   smoothly? - A. As far as I could see it did, yes, sir.

Q. And also the plan to use the Herries Road bus station as the
   holding point for ambulances, again many were there within a
   short period? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. In fact, possibly surplus to requirements? - A. We had too
   many in the later stages, yes, sir.

Q. Once Mr. Hopkins had taken over from you at the ambulance did
   you divert your attention to the gymnasium? - A. It was
   between the gymnasium area and the ambulance loading area.  I
   was trying to assess patients, priority to move them, sir.

Q. Is it right again at the time you declared at major incident
   you had visited the gymnasium at that stage? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   It was then being used as a dining room, but you made the
     request that that be cleared away, and that was done
     immediately? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q.   Mr. Higgins, you then spent the rest of the day taking a
     leading role in ensuring that the casualties and fatalities
     were then attended to and moved from where they were to where
     they had to be taken? - A. Yes, sir.

                 Cross-Examined bv MR. GIBSON-WATT:

Q. Mr. Higgins, when you were asking to be able to attend the
   Semi-Finals you told us that the reason or excuse given to you
   was that the ticket allocation was a matter for the Football
   Association and not the club? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. You have confirmed, I think, you did not suggest to the club
   that they should take up the problem with the Football
   Association? - A. I didn't press it, sir.

Q. You did not press it, and so far as you are aware no-one in
   SYMAS took up the problem direct with the Football
   Association? - A. Not that I am aware, sir.

                                                            P. HIGGINS


    Q. Can I put it this way.  Did you have some doubt at the time as
       to the adequacy of the excuse? - A. I can only take people's
       word as it is given, sir.

    Q. Were you aware at the time Sheffield Wednesday had its own
       allocation of tickets for the Semi-Final? - A. I was not, sir.

    Q.   Are you aware now? - A. I am not, sir, no.

                MR. GIBSON-WATT:        Sir, page 139 of the Sheffield
         Wednesday bundle.

                        Cross-Examined by MR. G L A S G O W :

    Q.   Mr. Higgins, I think most of what I have got to ask I can ask
         Mr. Hopkins, but bear with me if I ask some matters of you,
         will you? We think that Mr. Hopkins' understanding of the
         arrangements that SYMAS had with the club were that there were
         two tickets to be made available for all home matches firstly?
         - A. That is correct.

    Q. But that no tickets were to be made available for Semi-Final
       matches, and that that as he understood it was the arrangement
       which had been made? - A. That is correct, sir.

    Q . You agree with that? - A . Y e s , s i r .

    Q. When I say "you agree with that", you agree that that is what
       was agreed, not that it was necessarily ideal? - A. No, far
       from it.

    Q. To distinguish the two situations, at a League match you and
       another officer would attend in your own time? - A. That is
       correct.

    Q. And that was a result of the arrangement which you had
       personally made, I think, with the physiotherapist, Mr. Smith?
       - A. That is correct, sir.

    Q. Again, I am only concerned, Mr. Higgins, with the facts that
       were agreed.  I will take up with others the question of
       whether they were a good idea or not, and I am certainly
       not criticising you for them.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can I just follow what this means.
         You and one other attending in your own time meant you were
         not paid to do it? Is that it? - A. That is right, my Lord.

    Q. But if the ambulance was actually required, had been required
       and had been used, presumably that would have involved some
       expenditure, would it? - A. That is another crew.  The crew
       would be paid.  The officers were there on a voluntary basis.

    Q. The crew that was standing off then was paid? - A. Yes.

    Q. By SYMAS? - A. That is right, my Lord.

                                                  P. HIGGINS


Q.        MR. GLASGOW:     I think that the arrangement grew up in
     this way, and if    I can put it to you shortly, Mr. Higgins,you
     can then tell me if I have got it wrong, otherwise I won't
     need to ask you questions.    When you made your visit to the
     ground you walked round first with the groundsman, Mr. Ward,
     to talk about the layout of the ground? - A. That is correct.

Q. Is that auch correct? — A. Yes, sir.

Q.   After that there was a meeting just with you and your
     colleague, and the physiotherapist, Mr. Saith? - A. That is
     correct.

Q.   Mr. Smith raised a     particular question with you,again i        thin
     about team players getting hurt? - A. yes, sir.

Q.   And what he asked, and I think it was by way of a favour
     personally of you as football enthusiasts.    Is that the way it
     was raised? - A.   I think they were concerned about the
     transport of the injured players in a quicker fashion.

Q. Yes.  Again, we are not dealing with whether this was right or
   wrong or sensible or not.  I promise I will take that up with
   others. What he said was he wanted if possible to arrange a
   quicker method of getting an injured player for whom he was
   responsible to hospital? - A. yes, sir.

Q. And this was something quite separate from the formal part of
   the day which had been preparatory work for drawing up the
   incident plant? - A. Mr. Smith did touch on the other points
   of the Popplewell Report and the safety angle of the ground,
   but his major concern was for the players, that is true, sir.

Q. His personal concern was the job he did in the club which was
   looking after the players? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Again, no criticism, it happened that you and I think Mr.
   Eason later were quite keen football enthusiasts? - A. We did
   visit Hillsborough prior to that, yes, sir.

Q.   And taking it very       shortly, he said he would be  in a
     position to organise for you to have tickets yourself,
     complementary tickets, in your own time, and that the quid
     pro q u o , if I may put it like that, what you could do for
     him was that you would then be able to arrange more quickly
     than a 999 transport of an injured player to hospital? - A.
     That would result, sir, but our prior function was after
     the Popplewell Inquiry to be in the ground from the safety
     point, the people in the ground.

Q.   Can we move to the     second phase, the Semi-Final games,because
     it was clear and I think made formally clear by Mr. Hopkins to
     the Police that the arrangements at Semi-Finals was not for
     these off-duty officers to attend in the ground, but no
     tickets available, an ambulance manned at or just outside the
     ground? That was the difference? - A. That is correct, sir.
                          45

                                               P. HIGGINS


Q. So far as whether that was a good idea or not, the question of
   the formal arrangements with the club at the official level
   you understood were to be taken up by Mr. Page? - A. Mr.
   Wilkinson acted on behalf of Mr. Page initially, yes, sir.

Q. You told us that Mr. Page approached the club.  Your
   understanding was that he would deal either directly or
   through Mr. Wilkinson with the club as to the formal
   arrangements post-Popplewell and for security of the ground as
   a whole? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did anybody ever say anything to you after that meeting with
   the physiotherapist I think in 1986 - is that right, 1986? -
   A. That is right, sir.

Q. In the following three years did anybody ever say anything to
   indicate that that arrangement had been changed? - A. No, sir.

Q . And for the next three yea r s , whether good or b a d , the
    arrangement remained, tickets for League matches when
    Sheffield Wednesday were playing, no tickets but formal on
    duty attendance of ambulance crews at Semi-Finals? - A. That
    is correct, sir.

You were in charge, until Mr. Hopkins arrived, of the
gymnasium area, dealing with casualties.  May I put to
you some criticisms that have been made by doctors and
the press and ask you to comment on them please? A. Yes,
sir.

The first one is that people were being puts into ambulances
in any order.   What do you say to that? A. Iro, that's
not correct, sir.   I was assessing patients as they came
through.  It was rather difficult, as they were coming
rather quickly.

The second suggestion is that it required a doctor who was
a spectator in the crowd to assume control and make* sure
that those still alive and most seriously injured got off
to hospital first.  What do you say about that?    A. Well,
we had transported a number of casualties before that
doctor arrived on the scene, sir* aind many more after.

There is also an allegation that at least 30 people would
still be alive if there had been a rapid response with
basic medical facilities.  What do you say about that?
A.  It's difficult to say.  In my experience within the
Ambulance Service, I don't think we could have saved many
lives down there, sir.

Why is that, Mr. Higgins?   A. The people that were
coming out of the ground, when the bodies started to
come out ---

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You mean out from the pens?
A.  Out from the pens, yes, sir.   They had been there
for a longer period than you would normally expect to be
able to successfully resuscitate anyone.   By the colour
of them, they were so cyanosed, they were the worst cases
I've ever seen in my service, sir.

     Mr. KALLIPETIS:   Lastly, Mr. Higgins, can you help
us with some of the equipment that has been variously
described here, and I think inaccurately described in
terms of its function?    Could you just look at and show
his Lordship what a Brooks airway looks like, please?
You cannot tell us what a Brooks airway looks like,
because we have not got one!   But we have got some mouth­
pieces here, I think.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Perhaps in the course of the
day we might see one.

       Mr. KALLIPETIS:   We can arrange for one to be brought,
sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  And perhaps also it would be
helpful to me, Mr. Kallipetis, if on one sheet of paper
you could put the hierarchy of your officers.

       Mr. KALLIPETIS:   Certainly we will do that, sir.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.

     Mr. KALLIPETIS:  Just look at these items, Mr. Higgins?
(Handed to the witness).  Do you have there a bag and mask?
A.  Yes, sir.

Can you just produce it?   A. That is it.  You fit that
over the mouth, press the bag and it inflates the lungs.
(Demonstrating).

     Mr. KALLIPETIS:  Do you want to see it, sir, and then
it can be handed round.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you very much.

     Mr. KALLIPETIS:  Can you be getting some airways out,
Mr. Higgins?   Do you have some airways there? A. Yes,
sir.

Just pass those to his Lordship, will you, and tell us
briefly what they do.  (Witness demonstrating to Lord
Justice Taylor).   Forgive my ignorance, Mr. Higgins, but
how do they compare with the Brooks airway?   A. Basically
you achieve the same objective.  You are keeping the tongue
down and maintaining a clear airway, sir.

And do you have a minuteman there as well?        A. We have
got a new pack, sir, which is similar.

Let us have a look at that, please.  A.  That is just a
mechanical resuscitator which inflates the lungs and
empties them.  (Demonstrating).

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   And that fits inside them?
(Indicating).    A.  Yes, that is the mechanical part,
arid this piece is in the yellow box.  (Indicating).

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I see.   Very well, thank you.

        Mr. KALLIPETIS:  Is that portable, Mr. Higgins, in
fact?      A. It is carried on all the emergency ambulances.

So you could take that on to the pitch,       for example, on
this occasion, and use it?   A.  Yes.

        Mr. KALLIPETIS:   Thank you.

               Re-examined by Mr. GOLDSACK:

Mr. Higgins, just two very brief matters, please.   I should
have dealt with one of them earlier.  On the day, I think
you took the view that it was impractical to take the
ambulances on to the pitch?   A. It was impractical, yes.
Because of the crowd and the melee that was going on, it
would have been impossible to take people round there,
and it formed a bottleneck anyhow with there being just
the one access point.

With a better access point, would you have considered
taking the ambulances on to the pitch?   A. If there had
been a dual access point, it would have been practical,
                            56
                                                       P. HIGGINS

     but with just one access point it became impossible.

Q.   Do you think it would be advisable if you were able to get
     ambulances on to the pitch? A. In some instances, yes,
     possibly, but in an incident similar to the one that
     happened this year, I don't think it would be practical.
     It would still have sufficed to use the gymnasium and the
     methods that we used this time, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: The only thing is that all
     these people carrying the injured quite a distance on
     improvised bits of boarding added greatly to the amount
     of physical effort, I suppose, and also the time taken.
     Do you think it would create more confusion if you had an
     ambulance on the pitch?   A. Well, the way it worked, my
     Lord, the patients got to the one focal point very quickly
     because of the involvement of the police and the fans
     and it helped the operation of dealing with the patients
     to run more smoothly than it would if we had had isolated
     incidents out on the pitch.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes, I see.   Thank you.

Q.        Mr. GOLDSACK:  The other very brief point is this:
     You heard Dr. Purcell's evidence this morning?   A. Yes.

Q.   The ambu-bag that he was describing, is that similar to
     one of the items that you have just shown us?   A. That
     is the one, sir.

Q.   That is the same?    A. Yes.

          Mr. GOLDSACK:   Thank you very much, Mr. Higgins.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.  I gather that you
     have problems of your own, Mr. Higgins.  Thank you very
     much for coming.

          Mr. PHILLIPS:   Mr. Eason please.

          Mr. KALLIPETIS:  Sir, if it assists, I can comply with
     your request.  (Document handed to Lord Justice Taylor).

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you very much.   It might
     be helpful for everybody to    have copies; I do not know.
     We can get it copied, if you like. Thank you.

                PAUL ANTHONY JAMES EASON, Called
                   Examined by Mr. PHILLIPS:

Q.   Paul Anthony James Eason, is that right?       A. Yes.

Q.   You are a Station Officer at Longley Ambulance Station
     in Sheffield? A. Yes, sir.

Q.   And you have been a liaison   officer with Sheffield Wednesday
     along with Mr. Higgins, have you?   A. That's correct.
                                          P. A. J. EASON

For how long have you been doing that?     A. Since May, 1987.

Your station is very close to the ground, is it not, two
miles away?   A. Yes, sir.

And do you regularly go to the matches with Mr. Higgins?
A.  Yes.

You have heard his evidence about the arrangements for you
to sit in the South Stand on normal League matches? A. Yes,
sir.

Do you agree with that?     A. That's correct, sir.

You, of course, when you go to the fdotball matches, are
going when you are off duty?   A.  Yes, sir.

Again, so far as the big matches are concerned, the semi­
finals, you accept what Mr. Higgins says about the
arrangements; there?   A. Yes, I do.

On this occasion, in relation to the 15th April 1989, I
~ think it was you who spoke to Mr. Sewell, was it not,
before the match?    A. That's right, earlier in the week
and on the day of the match.

I think it was a Tuesday.  You rang him up and told him
that you were going to attend with Mr. Higgins? A. Yes,
sir.

And he was happy with this arrangement, was he?       A. Yes,
sir*' „

Is this what you expected to take place?       A. In Mr.
Sewell's case, yes.

You had not been present the year before, had you? A.        Sorry

You had not been present in 1988, had you?      A. No,sir, I
had been on leave.

Again did you speak to the Secretary of the Club, Sharon?
A.  I spoke to Sharon, atod confirmed that the Ambulance
Service would be attending, yes.

And she   agreed to that too?   A. Yes.

Then, with Mr. Higgins, you made your arrangements for the
attendance of ambulances, one at the ground and one at
Middlewood?   A. Yes, sir.

And did you go to the ground and meet Inspector Sewell
when you were there?   A. Yes.

This was, I think, about ten-past-2, was it?      A. About
ten-past or quarter-past-2, sir.

No problems at that time?   A. No, sir.
                                           P. A. J. EASON

At about quarter-to-3, were things still all right, as
far as you were aware?    A. I wouldu have said there
was a very festive atmosphere.

There was a festive atmosphere? A. Yes, I think people
were looking forward to the game.

Did you stand with Mr. Higgins before the match started?
A. Yes, sir.

You noticed, I think, just after 3 o'clock something
happening at the Leppings Lane terraces?   A. Yes, sir.

And Mr. Higgins sent you and I think Ambulanceman
Chippendale, is that right, down to the Leppings Lane
Terrace?   A. Yes, sir.

Just after 3 o'clock - I think you say three-minutes-
past-3 in your statement - you went off with Mr.
Chippendale to the far end?   A. Yes.

How far did you get?   A. We went right down to the right
hand of the perimeter track around the pitch, at the
side of the fence by, I think, pen 6.

You went as far as pen 6?       A. Down into that corner.

And what did you see?   A. We looked across from there,
across the pen, and I saw football spectators watching
the game.

Spectators watching the game.     In which pen was that?
 A. That was in pen 6.

In pen 6?   A. Yes.  Beyond that, behind the goal, there
seemed to be some disturbance going on.  People were
starting to go out on to the perimeter track behind the
goal.

Did any of the people who you saw at that time appear to
be in any difficulties? A. As I walked down behind the
goal, there were people who were winded, and later, of
course, there was the gentleman with the injured leg.

We will come to him in the proper place.  How far did you
actually get to him?   Did you get right behind the goal?
A. Yes, right behind the goal, and I was making my way
towards pen 3.

Why were you going towards pen 3?   A. Because there was
obviously some congregation of people around there. You
couldn't see what was going on beyond the fence but there
were a lot of policemen around that area, I would say
straight along the pens 3 and 4 fencing area.

What were these policemen doing?   A. To me, sir, it looked
like they were telling people to get back.
                            59

                                                P. A. J. EASON

Q.   Were they standing on the    wall?   A. Yes,sir.

Q.   Leaning over the fence? A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   Did you see any of the gates open?    A.  I believe that
     a gate in pen 3 at that time may have been opened and
     people were trickling out.

Q.   Trickling out?   A. Yes.

Q.   Were they coming out under their own steam or were they
     being assisted out?    A. It looked to me like the police
     officers were assisting them out.   My presumption was that
      they wanted to put them in the pens which, of course, had
     got more space.

Q.   Where were these people going to?    Ai> Some of them were
     coming out and sitting on the pitch;    some of them were
     winded;  other seemed to wander about behind the goal.

Q.   Did you see them going particularly towards pen 1?      A. There
     were some fans that went to that area.

Q.   These people that you say were winded, did they appear to
     you to require any attention from you or your colleagues?
     A. No.   What was happening was that the people who were
     winded sat down.  Some of them actually lay down. After
     a short space of time, they sat back up and they appeared
     to be quite all right.




                                              /Q.   Did you see

                                      P.A.J. EASON


Q. Did you see at the time you were there St. John's Ambulance
   people in action? - A. There was St. John's Ambulance
   personnel around the area but not specifically in action,
   no.

Q. Not tending to people you mean? - A. Not specifically,
   no,  I can't recall that sir, no.

Q.   Can you give us any idea what time it would be when you
     reached the back of the goal? - A. Approximately 5-past-3
     sir.

Q. Had the game stopped by then? - A. No, the game was still
   in progress.

Q. What happened when you got to the back of the pitch.  You
   mentioned two things earlier on, didn't you.  One was being
   assaulted and two was finding somebody with a broken limb?
   - A. He had an injured leg sir.

Q. Which happened first? - A.   The assault.

Q. You were with Mr. Chippendale were you? - A. Yes, and there
   was a St. John's person there as well.

Q. Were you all assaulted? - A. That is right sir, yes.

Q. What were you wearing? - A. I was wearing Ambulance uniform.
   I had a blue 'V' neck Ambulance issue jumper on and a H.V.
   jacket over the top of that.

Q. That is a high visibility jacket, is it? - A. That is right
   sir.

Q. What colour is that, yellow basically? -A. I would say
   satin yellow sir.

Q. What does it say on it, anything? - A. It says "Ambulance"
   on the front over the dress pocket and on the rear it
   says "Ambulance Officer".

Q. How many people assaulted you and your colleagues? - A. At
   that time there was just the one gentleman sir.

Q. That was kind of you to call him a gentleman.  What did
   he do? - A. He approached us, shook us, punched us, swore
   at us individually.  Mr. Chippendale managed to cast him
   off a little while and a Police Officer took charge of
   him.

Q. Now you went along did you then? - A. I took Mr. Chippendale
   and we drew on to the pitch after that sir.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Apart from the swearing what
     did he seem to be saying? - A. Apart from the swearing
     he did not seem to be saying anything, my Lord.  I understand,
                                 P.A.J. EASON


I think, what was going through this man's mind.  Having
been in the situation he had possibly been in it is
understandable for me personally in the Ambulance Service
that that chap was under a lot of stress. I did not attach
any importance to him.  I don't believe he was being
aggressive with us.

      MR. PHILLIPS:  You went you say from where on to
the track, from the perimeter track? - A. It would be just
to the left-hand side of the gate in Pen 3 as you look at
it, on to the pitch area.

And what did you find there? - A. There two football
supporters asked us to have a look at their colleague.
They took us to a gentleman who was initially stood up
at the side of the left-hand goalpost as you looked towards
the Leppings Lane end.

What was wrong with him? - A. He had a leg injury which    I
considered may have been fractured.

What did you decide to do about this person? - A. What we
decided to do was because of the situation around us and
there was aggression around us, I wanted the chap's
colleagues to stay with him while I took myself and
Chippendale back to our vehicle to get equipment to
treat him.

You could not just take him off as he was then? - A. No
sir, he had got a leg injury and I wanted him to stay
where he was with his friends until we could get some
treatment to him.

What was happening round about when you saw this young
man. Were there other people who appeared to be injured
or not? - A. He was the priority in my eyes at that time
sir.

Could you see what was happening behind you in the
terraces? - A. No sir.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Was it really that you did
not have occasion to look or what? - A. You could not
actually see into the pens sir because of the Police
Officers and the fans between my line of sight and the
actual pens.

      MR. PHILLIPS:  Did you try to speak to your
colleague Mr. Higgins by means of your radio? - A. Yes,
I did sir.

What happened there? - A. I could not get through to him
on the radio.

Was Mr. Higgins still within the playing area of the ground?
- A. I could see Mr. Higgins and Ambulanceman Worrell
                                 P.A.J. EASON


diagonally across the pitch area.  I think Mr. Higgins
had moved down slightly from where we had been originally.
I could not get through to him on the radio so I tried
to signal him visibly and whereas I could see Mr. Higgins
and he was easily identifiable, in looking our way there
was so many people around he could not obviously see
me.

You are radioing from one to the other.  Is that right?
You are going directly to Mr. Higgins on your radio? -
A. No sir.

What are you doing then when you tried   to speak to him on
the radio? - A. To contact Mr. Higgins   by radio I would
have to use my handset to get in touch   with South Yorkshire
Ambulance Control who would then relay   the message back
to Mr. Higgins on his handset.

I see, so you can't speak just directly across the field
to him? - A. No sir.

Do you think you got as far asControl? -  A. I don't believe
so.  The only thing I know about that is I was using the
handset and not getting any reply.  There was a hurly-burly
going on around me, a lot of noise.  It could be that I
did not hear them or it could be the set did not work.

Did you have earpieces with your sets? - A. No sir.

Do you think it would have helped if you had? - A. I doubt
that sir.  Past experience at a pop concert in Sheffield
Police Officers had earpieces and with the high volume
of noise at that I think they were quite ineffective.

So what did you decide to do when you found you could not
speak to Mr. Higgins via Rotherham? - A. I had to set up
a runner.  I was not prepared to leave Chippendale on
his own down there.  I was not going to send Chippendale
back and leave myself down there, so I decided that we
would both return.

Was the game still going on then? - A. I can't recall.
I think it may have stopped then.

So there you are, you have got this injured person and
you know of no other casualty? - A. None at that time
that would seriously warrant our involvement.

You go off with Mr. Chippendale back towards where you
had come from and what did you do then, you spoke to
Mr. Higgins did you? - A. Spoke to Mr. Higgins.
Chippendale and Worrell collected some equipment and
we all set off back down towards that area of the ground.

So all four of you went with a fracture pack and a
stretcher? - A. That is right sir.
                                 P.A.J. EASON


And with some various other things? - A. Yes sir.

You took one of those Ambu-bags with you, did you? - A.
That is right sir.

Why did you do that? - A. The Ambu-bag was taken down there,
Ambulanceman Worrell placed that on the stretcher out of
instinct, as he says now.

Could you at the time think there was a need for an Ambu-bag?
- A. Was there a need?

Yes? - A. There was a need for the portable oxygen which
we took with us for the winded people.  I think it would
follow quite naturally if the Ambulanceman put the portable
oxygen on the stretcher then he would put the Ambu-bag on
as well.

Did you in fact take oxygen as well then as the Ambu-bag?
- A. There was a small supply of oxygen for the Ambu-bag,
yes.

When you got back to the corner to where your ambulance
had been, did you then again try to get in touch with
Control or did you leave that to Mr. Higgins? - A. I tried
on m y set and it did not work. I then tried it on
Mr. Higgins' set and that did not work either.  By that
time it was apparent that things were developing at that
end of the ground.

Isn't there a set on the ambulance itself? - A. There is
sir, yes.

You had to go there to get this equipment, didn't you?
- A. Yes.

Did you try the ambulance set? - A. When we went down to
get the equipment the incident we were treating was a
leg injury, we were not aware of the gravity of the
situation at that time.

I appreciate that, but you had got an ambulance there;
you may well have had to take that person away out of the
ground; you had another ambulance at Middlewood.   You
would want that, wouldn't you, to come and replace you?
- A. That vehicle would come down and standby while the
initial ambulance was away, yes.

Did you take steps to get that done? - A. I believe
Mr. Higgins had made a request for that vehicle'.

But you didn't? - A. No.

You went back all four of you to this casualty? - A. Yes.
                                 P.A.J. EASON


Were you able to do anything about him? — A. When we got
back to him Ambulanceman Worrell and Chippendale dealt
with his leg injury.  They splintered his leg and myself
and Station Officer Higgins tried to assess the situation.

What view did you come to then when you went back the
second time? - A. Well things as I say sir had started to
develop. There were far more people spilling on to the
pitch; there was a lot more noise and people who were
injured were starting to come on to the pitch.

So I think it was Mr. Worrell and Mr. Chippendale who
started attending to them as quickly as they could? - A.
What happened sir was Station Officer Higgins and myself
discussed the matter and it was decided he would return
to the ambulance and then start preparing the gymnasium
area while I stayed up the field in an assessment
situation.  That then released Worrell and Chippendale
to deal with casualties as they found them.

You were putting into effect the plan you already had to
use the gymnasium as a clearing station, a casualty
station? - A. Yes.

And to leave it to Mr. Higgins to deal with Control? -
A. That is right sir.

Were you able to report back to Mr. Higgins what you saw
or indeed to Control? - A. No, the only method of communi­
cation after that that I had with Mr. Higgins was by
running myself.  I left Worrell and Chippendale working
with patients and I was doing assessment and running with
the information.

Do you think you would have been assisted by having a
direct link with each other in the ground? - A. It is
possible but it is difficult to say.  You asked earlier
about earpieces.  It is quite possible that may have
been of assistance but I have experience in the past
where it has not been because of thenoise around.

Now I think you left Mr. Higgins to deal with the situation.
Did you come to the view, that this was a major incident
at some stage? - A. At that time I considered we were
developing a serious incident, not a major incident.

 What did you propose to do about that?- A. In what way
 sir?

 What steps did you propose to take when you came to that
 conclusion? - A. What, that we had a serious incident?

 Yes? - A. We had already decided that we were building
 up to a serious incident.  The idea would be that Higgins
                          65

                                    P.A.J. EASON


  would go back to the vehicle; would radio for assistance
  which I believe he did; would then prepare the gymnasium
  area and all the casualties and injured and people
  helping casualties and injured would be funnelled towards
  the gymnasium area, which is what happened.

Q. Did you at any stage think to yourself:   "Now*this is a
   major incident.   I have got to do something about that"?
   - a . I only considered the incident in terms of a major
   incident as the bodies started coming on to the pitch
   and I saw multiple resuscitations taking place.

Q. What sort of time would that be. Can you help us? - A. I
   believe it would be something round about quarter-past,
   16-minutes-past-3.

Q. That would be about the time when the St. John's Ambulance
   first went on to the pitch? - A. I think the St. John's
   Ambulance was on the pitch a little earlier than that sir.

Q. You I think went to deal with a small boy? - A. My attention
   was drawn to the fact that there was a small boy laid on
   the pitch sir, yes.

Q. This was I think over by the player's tunnel, wasn't it?
   - A. If you look at the player's tunnel, come inside into
   the field, round about there, it would be round about
   that area.

Q. I think there was a doctor working with that boy? - A. A
   gentleman who claimed to be a doctor was resuscitating him,
   yes.

Q. You went to get help did you? - A. I went to see what was
   going on. Again I have been dragged by a fan and informed
   about this child and he said "There is a doctor with him".
   I went to speak to the doctor.  The doctor told me in his
   opinion there was a chance for the child and could I get
   an ambulance to him straight away.

Q. We know that Ambulanceman Flack arrived on the pitch at
   about this time? - A. Yes.

Q. Was that in response to a request from your or just a
   coincidence? - A. As I got back to the area of the ramp
   I was aware of coming into contact with Flack.  I would
   say that was a coincidence sir.

Q. And you sent him to fetch this little boy, did you? - A.
   No.  I pointed out where the child was roughly situated
   but again at ground level you could not see anything,
   so we took the cot out of the vehicle we had originally
   used as a control vehicle and I ran with Flack to where
   the child was.
                                 P.A.J. EASON


And someone else took Mr. Flack's ambulance on to the pitch.
Is that right?- A. Mr. Flack's driver had driven his
vehicle on to the pitch after us.

This boy was put on the stretcher was he and put on to
Mr. Fi^sfe's ambulance and taken away? - A. That is right
sir.
Was anybody else taken away in that first ambulance? -
A. I don't believe so sir, no.

Did you know of other people at that time who required to
be taken away? - A. People were being resuscitated on the
pitch.  The doctor had told us that there was a distinct
chance that the boy .... The boy was the priority.




                        /Q. I think you
                            67

                                                     P.A.J. EASON


Q. Now, I think you did manage to get in contact with control
   shortly after this? - A. That was on board Flack’s ambulance.

Q.   You went with him to hospital? - A. I went across the     pitch in
     the attendant's seat of the ambulance while I radioed     control
     and declared a major incident.

Q. We know you then switched to channel 1? - A. That is correct,
   sir.

Q.   Can you help us about this.  Is this the same channel 1 as the
     Fire Brigade uses or a different channel altogether? - A. I
     believe it is SYMAS's own frequency which works in conjunction
     nationally with the Ambulance Service.

Q. You call it channel 1 for your purposes? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you instructions for ambulances to come to the Penistone
   Road end? - A. Yes, in line with that plan.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can I ask you.  When you switched
     to channel 1 did you thereafter have success with the radio? -
     A. No, sir, it seemed to come and go.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   Where were you when you were asking for
     the major incident to be declared and the switch over to
     channel 1? - A. I was in the front of Flack’s ambulance.

Q. How far did you go in that ambulance with him? - A. It must
   have been three-quarters of the way across the pitch, sir.

Q. You got out of the ambulance then at the Penistone Road end? -
   A. Yes, that is right, sir.

Q. Did you stay while he went off to hospital? - A. As I got off
   the vehicle the vehicle proceeded straight out and away to
   the Northern General.

Q. How did it get out of the ground? The way        it was intended to
   so far as you were aware? - A. I would not       be able to say,
   sir.  I d i d n ’t actually see it leaving the   ground.  I believe
   it would have gone up the ramp, turn right       and gone straight
   out through gate O.

Q. Did you go to the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes.

Q. You did not stay about in the area of the gymnasium at all? -
   A. I never went into the gymnasium.

Q. Did you go on to the pitch side of the Leppings Lane end? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Did you go further out towards the turnstiles? - A. No, sir.

Q. Did you know what was going on, that ambulances were arriving
   at the Leppings Lane end? - A. No, I did not.

           Q. Would you have expected to have been told that? - A. Yes, I
              wo u l d .

           Q. At this stage when you went back there who was In charge from
              the ambulance point of view? - A. I was still In charge at
              that point In time.  I went down to the Leppings Lane end,
              tried to make another quick assessment.   By that time
              things were beginning to clear.   It was obvious there were
              people out on the pitch and being moved by hoardings down
              towards the gymnasium, so I went straight back down to the
              Penistone Road end and met Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer
              Hopkins.

           Q. So he would have arrived about that time? - A. About 23-
              minutes-past-3, sir.

           Q. And taken over from you? - A. That is right, sir.

           Q. And I think you carried out his instructions in effect from
              that point onwards? - A. I went with Mr. Hopkins down towards
              the Leppings Lane end of the ground, briefed him as best I
              could, and took whatever instructions Mr. Hopkins ;gave me.

           Q. I think you also in the course of the time after he arrived
              witnesses the congestion of vehicles around the area where the
              ambulances were intended to load? - A. Yes, sir.

           Q. And assisted in getting ambulances to reverse out and that
              kind of thing? - A. Yes.  Because of the situation with the
              hire vans, etc., it was possible to back ambulances two
              abreast into the area for loading.  I was assisted in
              Penistone Road by a road traffic Policeman.  I d o n ’t know who
              it was, who at a certain point after that told me that the
              access further up Penistone Road was available for putting
              ambulances through, so we were shuffling ambulances at two
              loading points.

           Q. I think subsequently a minibus ambulance arrived? - A. That is
              correct.

           Q. These are for the walking wounded, I think you called them? -
              A. Well, probably the wrong phrase, sir.  Probably minor
              injured.

           Q.   Yes, those who can at least walk about? - A. Yes, sir.

           Q.   Then at the request of your Mr. Jones you went across to the
                Herries Road bus depot?   (Paragraph 28, sir). - A. Yes, sir.

           Q. This was according to your own plans the place where
              ambulances would be stacked up as it were until required at
              the ground? - A. Yes, that is the designated ambulance parking
              point.

           Q.   When you got there were there ambulances there already? - A. I
                went with a convoy of ambulances.  I think there were possibly
                six or seven ambulances I took with me to establish that area.

Q.   And was the area free for your use? - A.   Yes.

Q.   Was it about 200 yards away from the point where you wanted
     the ambulances to be at the ground? - A.  That is right, sir.

Q.   When you got there did you try to get in    contact with your
     control? - A. I did, sir, yes.

Q.   How did you try to do that? - A. With a further hand set. The
     problem in fact this was reversed.   I could hear control. I
     d o n ’t think they could hear me. I could certainly hear them
     calling me, but I could not make myself heard to them.

Q.   So you found yourself - were you able to keep any contact
     going with the Sheffield Wednesday ground and the people
     there? - A. No, sir. The only contact I would have with the
     ground would be by runner.

Q.   Is that in fact what   you did? - A. That is right, sir.

Q.   And I think you then had quite a large number of South
     Yorkshire Ambulances along with assisting vehicles from West
     Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire? - A. 24 in all,
     sir.

Q. Did they all stay or get stacked at the Herries Road depot? -
   A. That is right, sir.

Q. And I think you eventually came to use the telephone that was
   already installed at the bus depot because of the difficulties
   you had with radio contact? - A. Yes.

Q. And with the use of a telephone and a runner you were able to
   keep in touch with Mr. Hopkins? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. And get his proper instructions? - A. That is correct.

Q. This is obviously a very unsatisfactory matter from your point
   of view? - A. In point of fact it was the best arrangement I
   could come to in that particular location

Q.   And then Ithink you spent a lot of time dealing with the
     various tasks that had to be done by your service? - A. That
     is right, sir.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. KALLIPETIS:

Q. One matter, if it is important.  You have seen yourself on the
   video, I think, when you were first assaulted, Mr. Eason.  The
   time is given as 15.05 and 50 seconds? - A. Yes.

Q. That would be the time when you were just approaching the area
   behind the goalmouth? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q.   The second matter, what is the difference between aserious
     and a major incident? - A. A serious incident is one that will

                                                 P.A.J. EASON


     allow our service to keep the incident contained.  A major
     incident is an incident is an incident whereby the normal day
     today running of the service could be affected, and we enlist
     the help of outside services.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  When you say outside services, you
     mean other ambulances? Not the Police? - A. Yes.

Q. Other ambulances.    Thank you very much.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We will break now.   2 o ’clock.

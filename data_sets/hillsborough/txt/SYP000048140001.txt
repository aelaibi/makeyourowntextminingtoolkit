                                                          10 September 1990




Dear Doctor Popper

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

I am now in a position to respond to your letter of 31 August 1990 and to
confirm the telephone conversation I had with your secretary earlier today.

The requests made in your letter have been given very careful consideration
by myself and by the appropriate members of the Police Complaints Authority
and it has been decided that the reports, supporting papers and documents
should now be passed to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.    I
am sorry that I was unable to accede to your request to delay such a move
but the Chief Constable is aware of your interest in the matter.

Yours sincerely




Chief Constable
Investigating Officer

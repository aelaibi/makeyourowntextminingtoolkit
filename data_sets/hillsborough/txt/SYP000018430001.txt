               A POISONOUS smokescreen is being put up
               around the Hillsborough disaster.
                 The smokescreen Is a vile attempt to divert attention from the

                 Not even the Sun, whose front page coverage today is a disgrace
               to journalism, has managed to dredge those up.
                  If so many fans were seen by
               police picking the pockets of the                                                                        Sun • It would not know

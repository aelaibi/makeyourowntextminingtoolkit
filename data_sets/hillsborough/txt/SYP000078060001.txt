             At 8.15 am (0815 hrs) on Saturday 15 April                1989 (150489),        I paraded

             for duty at Stainforth Police Station.                 I was then conveyed along with

             other Officers to ’A ’ Divisional H.G, at Doncaster.                     There I met with
                                                                              N   n   10 3

             From Doncaster we were conveyedl/by van to Hillsborough for a briefing.

             After the briefing       in the gr^fidstand we were supplied with a packed

             lunch which was eaten in tfafe grandstand.

             After the briefing and m a & l , th© Serial            left the Ground and took up

             position at the roundabout on Leppings Ln.                 The Officers         in this

             Serial    paired off and/with PC1900 KENT I took up position                     near the

O ct        roundabout.      At thi</ time the only Officer           in that Serial          with a

^/VT"       personal    radio was/the supervising Officer, PS PEARSON.

Q'eoorsip    There was a steacLy flow of fans from the direction of Halifax Rd
                                                                              PAGE        2
                                                                              SH23H

through the morning.         I was not aware at what time the turnstiles were

o pened,

A large number of fans arriving at Leppings Ln were carrying cans and

large plastic bottles of beer/lager.               These supporters were informed

that they would not be allowed into the Ground with alcohol or if they

were in fact drunk.        However,    most elected to sit on the garage

forecourt    close to the roundabout and drink their beer.

The crowds were in good humour and although noisy and boisterous,                  I

saw no fighting or similar problems.               There were however,   quite a

number of people wandering back and forth along Leppings Ln asking for

spare tickets.       These were both in groups and men acting on their own.

At approximately 2.30 pm (1430 hrs)            there was a large increase in

numbers approaching the G r o u n d ; ^€hi s eased off again as ’kic k- of f ’
                                   ,/
approached.  However, just b^/ore 3 pm (1500 hrs) there was a rush of

supporters from the Hal if           R d ; some were running and were spurred on

by cheers from the Grouira,

Shortly after 2 pm (1^00 hrs) a large number of supporters were

escorted from the lokal         station (Wadsley Bridge)      to Leppings Ln.      They

were escorted by Mounted Officers who left this crowd              at the   end of

Leppings Ln.      this group had been by far the rowdiest          of all

supporters arriving at that area.             On entering Leppings Ln this group

spread out across the road, although traffic was still travelling

along Leppings Ln.        I was asked by quite a number of supporters for

directions to local       public houses.       Some just asked where the nearest

pubs were,    others asked for various pubs by name,           these included      ’The

B e e h i v e ’ and 'The Horse and Jo c k e y ’.

Shortly after 3 pm (1500 hrs) my Serial was directed to move along

Leppings Ln?     I do not know if this direction was passed to PS PEARSON

over the personal       radio or that we were simply moving to our pre­

arranged standby point.          However,    we walked the full   length of
                                                                    PAGE        3
                                                                    S2232

Leppings Ln to the entrance to the Ground.

On arrival at the entrance to the Ground I saw a number of Liverpool

supporters in the road outside the Ground;    there was quite a number of

people but I cannot say how many as they were well spread out.        A

number of Police Officers were being organised into a cordon across

the entrance to the Ground outside the main gate.      As I joined this

cordon I was directed by a Senior Officer    (I do not know his name or

rank)    to go on the alley between the River Don and the rear of the W

Stand.     It was obvious that something was happening or had in fact

happened inside the Ground.     As I entered this alley I saw people

entering the alley from behind the turnstiles.     Some of these people

were obviously injured;    one middle-aged man was laid in the alley and

was being attended to by Police Officers.     The m a n ’s face was blue and

I got the impression that he was already dead.     With other Officers      I

gave what assistance I could to these people.     These people were

talking about a pitch invasion and a barrier collapsing,      but I was

still unaware as to what had actually taken place.      People fetched out

into this alley were holding their chests and ribs,      some had leg and

ankle injuries.

I was then directed to make my way along the full      length of the alley

to ensure it was kept clear for emergency vehicles.       I found that the

alley went from the Leppings Ln entrance along the full      length of the

S Stand.     In parts it widened out to form a small   car park at the rear

of the S Stand.    Here I found several Special Constables and asked

them to ensure that the alley was kept clear.     I then made my way back

towards the Leppings Ln entrance.

As I reached the point where I first saw injured persons      I saw that

numbers here had swollen dramatically; there were in fact now 10 or 12

corpses laid alongside the chain link fence bordering the River Don.
c        _______________________— — —   ------------------------- — --- -
The bodies had been covered over with Police anoraks and tunics.      By
this time several     ambulances had arrived and a     man dressed in denim

was going amongst     the injured.   The   man worked tirelessly,    sorting out

people who required immediate attention or moving to hospital.            I was

later told he was a doctor.       I also saw a man in his twenties who was

dressed in *T* shirt and jeans?      he was obviously drunk.     This man was

stood by the corpses and was shouting to nearby Police Officers,             "Why

d o n ’t you do something for them?11   He grabbed at two Officers who were

helping a man with a leg injury.        I approached this man and he then

moved off towards     the S Stand.

I was told to form a cordon with Officers         in front of the bodies.      We

were stood in this position for some time;        several Officers   in this

cordon were in possession of keys for Police vans and offered to make

them available for use as impromptu ambulances.          They were told to

stay put but it was quite obvious that the sheer volume of injured

persons   in that alley was too much for the ambulances at the scene.

Eventually several Officers were told to fetch vans.

When the more seriously injured had been removed by ambulance and the

alley was being cleared of the lesser injured,         several barriers were

placed in front of the bodies and canvas sheeting draped over the

barriers.     We were then released to stand outside the g a t e s .   By this

time supporters were     leaving the Ground via the Leppings Ln end in

large numbers,    although they were being asked to stay where they were

over the P.A, system.      I was still unaware of the cause of what was by

this time a major    incident.

The numbers    leaving the Ground were making      it difficult for emergency

services to gain access to the alley.

A small number of the supporters      leaving the Ground seemed deeply

hostile to Police Officers,      some shouting,   "You murdering bastards".

I got the impression that any small        incident   could turn the crowd

against the Police.      A large crowd had gathered on Leppings Ln on the
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S2232

      other side of the River Don;        they were shouting abuse at Officers

      stood near the gates.

      When Leppings Ln had cleared,        I tried to find the rest of my Serial.

      I had had only fleeting         contact with them since arriving at the

      Ground.    I eventually met with PS PEARSON and together with several

      Officers from ’A' Division who became separated from their own

      Serials,   we made our way to Claywheels Ln.        Whilst walking along

      Leppings Ln I was struck by the large quantity of,jdiscarded beer tins

      in the road and g u tt e rs .

      In recent years    I have worked at          Ground on a number of occasions

      both inside and outside the jSround.        I have worked at three F .A . Cup
c #
      semi-finals   including t^He 1988 L iverpool and Notts. Forest match.          I

      am quite fami liar w f t h   the layout of the Ground and sur rounding a r e a s .

      From the time I/arrived at the Ground after the kick-off until            I later

      left the Ground,    I only saw one person who I took to be a

      steward.    I had no idea of what had happened inside the Ground until             I

      spoke with persons leaving the Ground,         both Police Officers and

      supporters.     I do not think that had I been in possession of a

      personal   radio I would have been able to make use of it effectively,

      other than to have an understanding of what was happening,           which I

      feel would have helped me in my job.

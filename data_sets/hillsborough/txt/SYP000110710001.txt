My day began in Headquarters at 0800 hours.    From there we

transported some radio equipment to Hillsborough, this being

spare equipment to be left in the Police Control Room.     On

completion of taking this equipment into the Control Room, I

attended the briefing.   On completion of the briefing I remained

in the area of the gymnasium, where the issue of the radios was

being conducted.   My responsibility on the day was to make

myself available in case of communication problems.     I was in

possession of a radio with an ear receiver for the whole

duration of the day.

At around 1400 hours I began to hear the radio breaking up.        At

first I assumed it to be interference but when it continued

intermittently I made my way over to the Control Room

accompanied by Chief Inspector Beal.   This being around 1420

hours to 1430 hours.

On arrival at the Police Control Room I first changed the

'tulip' microphone for a 'hand phone/first m i c ' taken from the

spare W15U 'Base Station.'   The fault continued, so during a

'stop' in communications I plugged in the spare W15U 'Base

Station' to the mains supply and changed over the aerial

connection.

The fitted 'Base Station' had been working on 'talk through.'

This is a ground to ground radio facility, so one radio can

communicate to another radio.   Therefore I switched the spare

 'Base Station' to      'talk through', giving exactly the same

communication as the fitted 'Base Station.'

The spare       'Base Station' was situate on the floor underneath the

bench.        The box containing the spare 'Base Station' has a

physical size of 27" x 11" x 11" high by 11" deep, the mains

lead and aerial lead are only of sufficient length to connect to

the spare       'Base Station' in situ and therefore I was unable to

place it on top of the Control Room bench.       This in turn meant

that the first mic/hand phone, which is connected by a curly

lead, only just came about the level of the bench and the

operator was obliged to bend down to use it.       The loud speaker

to the spare 'Base Station' is incorporated into the set and

therefore reception was at floor level.       A hand held Motorola

personal radio was therefore used by the operator.        This enabled

him to stand upright to transmit, the reception was via the loud

speaker in the hand held radio itself and it gave the Control

Room equal opportunity for transmission.

The time was now about 1448 hours       *(Can he confirm this in

anyw a y? )

After checking the system was working correctly I left the

Control Room but remained at the bottom of the steps by the

gate, where I stayed for the rest of the afternoon.       Many

messages were coming over the radio, I remember the request to

open the Leppings Lane gate, that being around 1450 hours.         I

also remember a request to delay the game, as there was still a

large crowd outside (Leppings Lane end).   Time unknown.

        so,     On arrival         back    I noticed a drain on the                    station f o r ecourt               had a

        large wet are a a r o u n d          it.     1 was       told this was where alcohol                       had been

        poured down the            d rain after        having       been      removed from some              of the

        Liverpool       fans wh i l s t      we had been awa y from the area.

        In company w ith PW G i b l i n             I con t i n u e d my task at the                railway        station

        until    approximately-S.55pm                 (1455)       at that       time we were             i n structed to

        take    our meal w h i c h we           did at West Bar Po l i c e Station.                        All    the

        On arrival        numerous         other    dog     handlers         were     present and after a short

        w h i 1 e I s aw o f f i c e r s t a k i n g t he i r d o g s i nt a t h e g r o u nd a t            the

        P e n i s t o n e Roa d   end*     I took my dog           into the ground at               this     s^age

        assuming       it w a s • a public         order        incident.        i was       only    in the       ground «.s

        few minu t e s       when a long        with all         the    other    dog handlers we were                     lo id

        to    leave    the    ground and standby at                    our   vehicles        by a S o u t h Yor k s h i r e

        Dog Sergeant.

        Having      returned        to    our   vehicles         we had by this            time     become       aware      o-i-

        the    nature     of the         incident     but not          the mag n i t u d e    of    it.     It became

        increasingly frustrating                   having        to s t a n d b y on the        road outside when

        we wan t e d to go          into    the    ground and help..

        E v e n t u a l l y we were all         i nstructed to enter                the ground with              our dogs?

        this    task was an e x t r e m e l y         precarious             one due    to the       large       number       o ‘f

        ground?       my dog was          in an e x c i t e d state due           to the       noise and          general

        movernent,         1 e v e n t u a 11 y m a n a g e d    to make rny way with other                   dog

        handlers       onto       the    perimeter      track across            the    opposite        end of the

        ground      to L e p p i n g s    Lane.      This       end of the ground was                o c c u p i e d by
                                                                                                                         P AGE   3

            Forest     fans and we were             inst r u c t e d     to face     them with our            dogs.

            Whilst     I respect         the    d e c i s i o n to have      us facing       the For e s t      fans      it

            seemed     to me at       the time       to be unnecessary,                man y fans       be h i n d the

            large     fence were         in tears and none               looked as though           they were         likely

            to try and          c limit over     onto   the     pitch,

            I    remained       in that    position        until       just after        it was a n n o u n c e d on the

            public address           sy s t e m that    the     game was        being abandoned.               On the

            announcement          being made        that    the     game was        to be a b a n d o n e d an appeal

            was made      to the      crowd to stay            calm a n d      remain where         they were         rather

            than      leave the gr o u n d so that            the      roads a r o u n d    the gr o u n d    could be

            kept      clear for use        by the e m e r g e n c y      vehicles?         a small      but   significant

            number     of fans       immediately         left the         ground.

            On    leaving       the g r o u n d I went     in company w ith PW G i b l i n               in   our     vehicle

            back      towards      the    city centre where             we had been detailed a                static

            point     to moni t o r      fans    returning        from the        ground.         The   vast m a j o r i t y

            of these      fans were        very quiet and subdued.                     They were        both F orest and

            Liverpool       fans.        After    all    the    fans      had d i s p e r s e d   I returned        to

            N i a g a r a and    subsequently         returned to my own Force,,

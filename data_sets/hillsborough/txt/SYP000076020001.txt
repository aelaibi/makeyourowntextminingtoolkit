              Before       the       start     of    the      match       I had        been       talking              to    this    man.           I woul

              describe          h i m as     being        about        the    s a me    ag e      as m y s e l f            in his       early

              twenties,          about       5'10        tall     of m e d i u m       build,          short           dark       brown     haj/r,         he

              sh-irt w i t h         short     sleeves,           he wa s       also      wearing             a    pair       of    b 1 u.Js d e n i m




              After       being       relieved           from     the     pressure           of     the       barrier             when    someone

      tcT     squeezed          between        myself         and      the    barrier,            everything                 that    was       going           on

              became       quite        hazy,       until         I realised           I was        standing                against       the        wail       at

              the    b a ck     with     the      sitting         supporters            above          me.        Some       of    the    sitting

              supporters             a s k e d me    if      I wanted         an    hand       to      get        up    there,        but      1 said           1

              was    alright.

              I don't          recollect          what       t i me    this     was,      but       I suddenly                noticed my               friend

                                               standing           in the        crowd        h a lf      way       down       the

              terraces          directly          in f r o n t        of me.                      was     able          quite       easily           to m a k e

              his    way       towards       me.     I could           see at       this       time       between             supporters

              standing          near     the      back       towards         the    front         of     the       terrace          which           s t il l

              seemed       packed        tightly.

              Whilst       standing          at     this      point       I could         not       see       why       the       pressure           was

              still       on    the     fr o nt ,    because           I could         not     see       going          forward          from        the

through           people       quite     easily,           on    reaching            the     t un n e l         1 s aw    two P o l i c e

Officers           standing        th e r e ,      wh o    directed          us      down       the        tunnel,        at    this    time

there        was    hardly       nobody          in the         tunnel,         I just          noticed a              couple     of

spectators           standing           against           the wall,          I d i d n ’t see               anybody        at all

lying        on    the    floor.        I then made              my way         to     point          2    I have        indicated        on

the     gra p h .

On     reaching          this    p o i nt     I noticed about                   20     people/lying                on     the    fl o or ,

a ll    of    them       being     administered                 first       aid      by s ^ p o r t e r s .            I saw about              10

Police        Officers          stand       the r e ,      watching          the       fi/rst a i d             being     carried       out,

then     other       Police        Officers           appearing             from       out      of        the    tunnel        carrying

spectators,              and    placing          them      on the       floor          near       to       the    other        injured

people.

Whilst        I wa s      standing          at     tj/is    position            before          leaving           the     ground,       I

noticed           that    some     of    thesre       people          lying       on      the     ground          had     died,     for

Returning           to    the     incident          that        happened          in the          ground,           just       before       I

but     was       closed       again     and       I never           noticed         it    being           re-opened again.

I only        hope       nothing        like       this     happens          again,          whether             I am     involved          or

not     I think          that    some       system         ought       to    be a r r a n g e d            that     better

ground        officials          etc.,        to    cope        with    such a disaster.

I would           also    like     to    suggest           that       these       bodies          also          been     trained       more

to     cope       with    first     aid       administration.

took    up m y         position               there      at    about          2.25       pm    (1425).             My      colleagues                for
                                                                                           THfriW
the    day were             already            there,         they          being Frank             G Q D L E Y ani

I stayed          there         for       a    couple         of m i n u t e s ,         then_I        walked           o ver       to     speak          to
                                                                        4

some    colleagues               from W oodseats                     Divisio-n w h o            were        posted          to S S t a n d at

K o p End.            I had a quick                   chat w i t h           them,       then       returned            to m y        position.

From    then w h i c h was                    about       2.35       pm      (1435)       until        kick-off             everything

seemed       to       be    normal,            nothing         untoward             happened and                 it     just        seemed           like

last    year's             semi-final.

The    match          kicked         off       on     time      so     I was        watching           it;       after          a    couple          of

minutes          I was       aware            t hat                                had    gone       off a l o n g          the       track

towards          Lepping         Ln       t e r r a c e s , after             a    couple       of m i n u t e s           he       came      running

back    to       us   and       said          something           to        the    effect       t hat       " You       better           get     up
                      I
the r e ,    you       may      be    needed",              so me,           Frank       a nd a       co u p l e      of    others            started

to    make       our w a y       towards              the     terraces.              I must          state         at      this       p o int        that

I am    having             difficulty               in    remembering               the       events        of     t hat        day,       although

things       do       keep      coming          back        to me           from    time       to    time.            I cannot             remember

whether          the m a t c h        had       been        s t o p p e d w h e n we w e r e             walking            along          the

track       or    not a n d          my       first       recollection               of a n y t h i n g          is w h e n we             reached

the    corner          f la g    at       N S t a n d at W S t a n d                end.        I saw L i v e r p o o l               fans

climbing          o ver      the      fence           onto     the          track    as       well     as    others             who      had

already          made       it o n t o         the       track       and      pitch.           I saw Police                 Officers

pulling          at    the      fence          to     rip     it d o w n a n d           others        were        treating              people

the    injured.              I would            guess         t hat         the    time       was    now a b o u t          3.10         pm    (1510)

    but    I *in not       sure.

    I was     now a w a r e        t ha t     there       were      many        people          injured and my                 only

    c o n c e r n at     t his     time was          to    help       the       injured;             it was       no w      the    worst

    incident        I h ave        had      to    deal     with       in m y         five       years        on the B r i g a d e            and       I

    was    not    yet      aware        of a n y     deaths.             I made          my way        o n to     the       pitch       to

    treat    a    lad w h o        was      in his        late      teens           to    early       twenties           w h o was

    sitting       down      complaining              of    his      knees ;          I felt          his     legs      to    check       for

    breaks       w h i c h was         negative;          he     said      he       could       feel       his    legs       so    I got          him

    to m o v e    them about,               then     a Policeman                h e l p e d me        get     him      to    his    feet.              I

    walked       with       him        for a f e w y a r d s ,           t h e n he      seemed        to       be a l r i g h t     so we

    told    him     to      go    to m i d d l e      of       pitch and keep                  out    of     the way.

    I then moved             on    to     treat      another          lad a b o u t            the    s ame      age     who      was

    sitting       on     the      pitch,         winded and           crying.              He    t o l d me       that       there       was

    someone       dead       back        there      and    pointed             to    the       terraces;          this       was    the

    first     t ime        I became         aware        t hat    there         could          possibly          be    fatality          in the

    crowd     and      I    f elt       shocked.           I couldn't believe                        what     this       lad was

    telling       me,       it was          now     that       it hit         me e x a c t l y       what      was     h a p p e n i n g in

    the    terraces         and        I became          more     shocked.                The    next        thing       I recall            is

    seeing       a Policewoman                giving       mouth         to m o u t h          to a m a n w i t h           ginger       hair

    w h i lst a P o l i c e m a n         was     giving         heart        massage,            this       I t h i n k wa s

    somewhere          in the          penalty       a r ea.        I went           over       to    the P o l i c e w o m a n         and

m   asked     her      if she w a n t e d me              to     t ake     over,          so    I started             giving       this       man

    mouth     to m o u t h .           I f elt      for a        pulse        but        felt    nothing,             his    eyes       were

    open and        his      f ac e      practically             bl a c k .         I realised             he was        dead and

    looking       back      on     it     probably         had      been        for       some       t ime    but y o u        never         give

    up    trying.          The     Policeman             then      put a        coat       over       his     h e a d a nd        I moved

    on.     I remember             seeing         somebody          giving           heart       compressions                to a m a n           by

    the    other       side       of    the      goalposts          towards              S Stand       side       of     pitch      but

    n o b o d y was      doing         mouth      to m o u t h ,      so      I got        down and           started          doing         mouth

    to m o u t h a n d       feeling          for    a    pulse.           Again          there       was     nothing,            this       man

was    dead.           By    now      I was        becoming         quite          affected          by w h a t          was     happening

here    and       couldn't            accept        it,     the     f act         that     people         had       come        to    see       a

match and were                dying          in f r o n t     of me.              I s t il l     can n o t         remember           the

sequence          of    events          and     how      they     happened,              I can       remember              helping          a

girl    w i t h a f r a c t u r e d arm who was                       being          attended            to    by a P o l i c e

Officer,          I also          helped a teenager                   dressed            in    pale       b l ue      who       was    being

attended          to    by a P o l i c e m a n ,          to w a lk.              He a s k e d      if    people           were       dead;

the P o l i c e        Officer          said       there were            a    lot       dead and          the       b o y ’s legs           j ust

g a v e w a y.         We    coaxed          him    to    keep walking                  and    took       him       to     the       halfway

line.        I do       recal l         helping          a young         girl        who      was    having           difficulty

breathing          and was            being        attended         to       by    her     boyfriend;               her     tongue          was

out    so    I turned             her     over      onto      the     recovery             position with                   her       head

back    and       she       began       to    breathe         a bit          better.           I told          her       boyfriend              to

keep    her       head       b ac k     and     her      airway       open,          then      I moved             off     to    someone

else.

The    next       thing        I recall            is w a l k i n g      past        the      terraces             along        the    track,

the terraces                b e h i n d the        goal     still        seemed          full       at    t his       time,          then       I

sau                                H ie      of m y      colleagues,               and     I spoke            to    her     but

nothing       seemed           real       anymore.            I remember                sitting          on a wall              on the

S S tan d and           crying,           and      someone        asking           me    if    I was          alright           and    someone

else    saying,             "You      did     the     b est     you      can".           I was       crying           because

of w h a t    I had w i t n e s s e d              and    because            I j ust       c o u l d n ’t a c c e p t           that

something          like       t his       could       happen        here.            What      happened after                    t hat      I do

not    remember,             it    is a       blank       except         that        I have         seen myself                 on    the

t el ev is io n and            I am walking               on the         pitch asking                people           if    they are

alright       and       tapping           them      on the        back,           but    I honestly                d o n ’t r e m e m b e r

appear       to    be       dead,       but     I do      not     remember              doing       this.           There        is a       lot

about       that       afternoon             that     I cannot           remember.               The      last        recollection                   I

             have     is a f t e r          I have        been       cry i n g    on    the w a ll.          I was     on the        pitch

             crying         when       a    lad    came        up to me,          put     his     arm    r o u n d me;      he    t o l d me    he

             was    a First            Aider       and     t ha t     he    had    c ome     f r o m K o p End,        he     said      "Come       on,

             l e t ’s go         for       a drink",           so we w a l k e d        bac k     to N S t a n d w h e r e        I saw a       lad

             banging         his       head against              a w all         over    and      over    again.         We      stopped       him

             and asked            him       to    c ome    for       a drink       with      us    but    I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r      whether

             he    did      or    not.           I remember           then walking              b ack    out   onto      the      pitch       but    by

             now     everything              had    finished            more      or    less.        I went      b ack      to    the

             ambulance            room;          there     were       Police,          a m b u l an c em en and      civilians           there

             all     shocked.               I thought           at    the     time      that      it was       a bad     dream.          This       is

             the w o r s t        experience              of    my    life.

             The     ginger        haired          lad     I would          describe         as    about       18/23 years           old,      with

             his     hair        brushed          back,        thin     face      with     stubble        on his       face.         I c ann o t

             remember            anything          else        about       him.

             I h av e       brought          in the        News       of    the W o r l d       w i t h my     photograph          on    in    case

 EX INSPECTOR H. WHITE



 As you are probably aware, the Coroner would like to have called Mr WHITE as
 witness to the Hillsborough Inquests.

 However, as a result of correspondence received from Mr WHITE          \
              as a result of very helpful enquiries by your Sergeant John MORGAN,
 the Coroner has decided not to call him.

 Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

                  SUBJECT:     HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST - RETIRED POLICE INSPECTOR HARRY WHITE



                  Prior to the Christmas adjournment of the Hillsborough Inquest on 19
                  December 1990 , representations were made by the Hillsborough Support
                  Oroup, consisting of the bereaved families to H.M. Coroner, Mr Popper.

                  The role of former Police Inspector Harry White during the disaster had
                  come under scrutiny during the Inquest and he had been mentioned by a
                  number of witnesses.

                  Mr King, Barrister for the bereaved, had accordingly requested ' the
                  a endance of Mr White for him to give evidence at the proceedings. I was

                  Apparently, H.M. Coroner decided that Mr White would be called to the
                   nquest as a witness unless he could produce documentary proof of his ill


                  I contacted him by telephone and informed him of this decision. During
                  the Christmas holiday I received the attached correspondence from Mr
                  wnite, which I now produce for your perusal.

                  Midlands Police Liaison Team, in order that H.M. Coroner may be fully

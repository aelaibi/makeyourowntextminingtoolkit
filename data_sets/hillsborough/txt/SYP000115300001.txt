             I am a Constable          in the S                                     currently stationed

             at                   Raad, Pol i^e Station,                rielji.

             At   10.00am (1000)        on Saturday,   15 April,             1989 (150489)    I reported for

             duty in.the North stand at the Sheffield Wednesday Football                           ground

             for a briefing          in relation to the FA Cup Semi-Final^ match between

             Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

             When the briefing was           concluded I went \& < {e ther with Serial S to j:thft

             £J.puth st a n d »     After   checking the seating area I then went to the

             turnstile area situated within the South stand near to the Leppings

             Lane area of the ground.             At this time           I was with approximately four

             other       constables on my s e r i a l > together with Police Sergeant

             Hemmi ng wa y.                                ■

              I   remained near to the turnstiles which were # n                      to Nottingham

             Forest fans until approximately 2.3ppm                      <        whf*^ I had, cause to

              enter the uncovered seating area of the stand.                        From my position I

              could see the entire ground and I immediately noticed that whilst the

             Spion Kop and South stand were almost                     full of Nottingharri^'ff’rest fans

my' colleagues.

I remained at the turnstiles and a short time later Sgt. Hemmi ngway

approached me'and informed me that the kick-off could possibly be

delayed# as there was a large amount of fans Still trying to get into

the groutid.   :                        ,



                    TTie radio was fitted/with an ear piece so I could not*

hear any transmissions,    but at & pp ybximately 2.40pm     (1440) S g t .

Hemmingway stated that there appeared to me a problem and that

someone was passing messages over the radio       in a hy s t ej^irtfa 1 state.

At 3.OSprr^ </15Q5) Superintendent Murray came to^>Ke turnstile area, he

was running and asked me and ;my co 1J e ^ g u s s ,to follow him if we were

free to do so.     I followed Mr. Murray through the uncovered seating

area of the South staind and over a small wall onto the perimeter

track of the pitch.     Together with other   colleagues',    I followed him

to the Leppings Lane terrace area.       It was not until     I came within

feet of the rnetal fencing of the standing area that I realised there

was a problem in the centre section of the terraces.           I saw

immediately that    people at the'front of the terraces were        crushed

against the metal mesh fencing and were unable to move.            At this time

most of the fans although obviously distressed appeared in order,                 but

I was aware that a teenaged female who was pressed tightly against

the fencing    looked very pale and appeared to be unable to breathe.

She was holding the fence with her hand but she h^d been pushed so

far forward that her face was pressing through the gaps in the fence.

Together with Inspector Darling who had also joined us I stood on a

concrete ledge on which the fencing     is mounted.     In this position we

were both facing the fans    in the terraces and we were       indicating to

them to move back as far as they could.       We were doing this by using

our hands and also by shouting to them.       The' fans were shouting back
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           R457

to us that they were unable to go back.

At this time there was only small         number of police officers at the

fe n c e .

I got down frpm the       ledge and walked along the length of the centre

section of the terraces.          I could see that by now a larger number of

fans appeared to be distressed and in p^ih.            The girl   I had seep a

short time earlier appeared to have lost consciousness.              I again

stood on the ledge and looked into the centre section.             There was no

sign of the crush easing.          All the fans    in this section were   packed

tightly together.

A number of fans       in the section to the      left of the centre section

were becoming very angry and abusive to us by this time.             There was

no problem in this section.

A short time       later there appeared to be a larger police presence         in

that area and more police officers stood on the concrete ledge.  As
         •                           I
fans started reaching out for assistance police officers were able to

reach over        the fence,   take hold of them and drag them up and over the

fence.       At   this time I assisted a number     of fans to get safely over

the top of        the fencing and down onto the perimeter track.     The fans I

assisted were able to walk         away from the    area by themselves,   although

they were obviously very frightened and shaken none appeared badly

injured.

A short time        later there were so many police officers near to the

fencing that        I was unable to get back onto the ledge,      so I went onto

the pitch near to the goal area.         It was at this time      that I noticed

the football        game had stopped as there were a large number of fans

and police officers on the pitch.

As I looked back toward the terraces         I saw that the blue gate which

had previously beep closed was now open and police officers were

ca rr yin g'people from inside onto the pitch.
                                                                            ■' PAGE

I saw that two officers w£re -having difficulty in carrying a youth so

I took hold of his leg and assisted in carrying him onto the pitch.

The youth was very pale and appeared unconscious.               We laid him on his

feack.     The policemen then left to return ttithe terraces.           A ,

policewoman who I do not know then approached me and together,we

attempted to revive the youth - I             gave mouth to mouth resuscitation

whilstthe         other policewoman gave heart masage.        We worked on the

youth for several minutes until a member of the St, Johns Ambulance

approached us.         He also tried to resuscitate the youth but after a

couple of minutes told us there was no use              continuing as he was, dead.

I do not know the        identity of the youth but would describe him as

follows- male,        white,    slim build,    late teens/early twenties,   pale

complexion,        short ginger/brown hair wearing^ light coloured shirt

(possibly checked).

After     placing an anorak or similar over the youths face we left him

on the football        pitch.     I then returned to the Leppings Lane terrace

area and gave what assistance              I could to fans who were still   in the

v i c ini t y .

During this time        I was unaware that there were a number of bodies

laid on the pitch,        however,    when I later    returned to the football

pitch the youth I had assisted had been removed.               After the dead and

injured had been attended to I then together with other members of my

serial asked fans who were on the pitch to gather together               in one

area off the grass and generally gave advice and assistance to people

who were unable to find their friends and relatives.

At approximately 5.00pm           (1700)   I then attended in the North stand

with a large number of other police officers to await a de-briefing,

however,      before this.; began I left the ground and went to Ecclesfield

Training Centre,        Green Lane, Sheffield where a Casualty Bureau had

been organised.

              POLICE CONSTABLE 3235, HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION,SHEFFIELD.



I am a Constable in the South Yorkshire Police,currently stationed at Hammerton

Road Police Station,Sheffield.

At 10.00 am on Saturday,15th April,1989,I reported for duty in the North Stand at

the Sheffield Wednesday Football ground for a briefing in relation to the F.A. Cup

semi - final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest.

When the briefing was concluded I went together with Serial 2 to the South Stand.

After checking the seating area I then went to the turnsti le area situated within

the South Stand near to the Leppings Lane area of the ground. At this time I was

with approximately four other Constables on my serial together with Police Sergeant

Hemmingway.

 I remained near to the turnstiles which were open to Nottingham Forrest Fans until

approximately 2.30pm when I had cause to enter the uncovered seating area of the

Stand. From my position I could see the entire ground and I immediately noticed that

whilst the Spion Kop and South Stand were almost full of Nottingham Forrest Fans, the

North Stand and West Stand appeared only half full of Liverpool supporters. When I

returned to the turnst'l les I commented on this to my colleagues.

I remained at the turnstiles and a short time later Sgt.Heminingway approached me and

informed me that the kick-off could possibly be delayed as there was a large amount

of fains still trying to get into the ground.

Sgt Hemmingway was the only officer in that area who had a radio in his possession.

The radio was fitted with an ear piece so I could not hear any transmissions,but at

approximately 2. ifQpm Sgt Heminingway stated that there appeared to me a problem and

that someone was passing messages over the radio in a hysterical state.

At 3 .05pm Superintendent Murray came to the turnstile area,he was running and asked

me and my colleagues to follow him if we were frkee to do so. I followed Mr. Murray

through the uncovered seating area of the South Stand and over a small wall onto

the perimeter track of the pitch. Together with other colleagues I foliwed him to the

Leppings Lane Terrace area. It was not until I came within feet of the metal fencing

of the>standing area that I realised there was a problem in the centre section of the

terraces. I saw immediately that people at the front, of the terraces were crushed against

the ffiekal mesh fencing and were unable to move.At this time most of the fans although

obviously distressed appeared in order,but I was aware that a teenaged female who was

pressed tightly against the fencing looked very pale and appeared to be unable to breath.

She was holding the fence with her hand but she had been pushed so far forward that her

face was pressing through the gaps in the fence*

Together with Inspector Darling who had also joined us I stood on a concrete ledge

on which the fencing is mouted.In this position we were both facing the fans in the

terraces and we were indicating to them to move back as far as they could.We were doing

this by using our hands and also by shouting to them. The fans were shouting back to us

that they were unable to go back.

At this time there was only small number of police officers at the fence.

I got down from the ledge and walked along the length of the centre section of the

terraces. I could see that by now a larger number of fans appeared to be distressed and

in pain* The girl I had seen a short time earlier appeared to have lost consciousness.

I again; stood on the ledge and looked into the centre section.There was no sign of the

crush easing. All the fans in this section were packed tightly together.

A number of fans in the section to the left of the centre section were becoming very

angry and abusive to us by this time. There was no problem in this section.

A short time later there appeared to be a larger police presence in that area and more

police officers stood on the concrete ledge. As fans started reaching out for assistance

police officers were able to reach over the fence,take hold of them and drag them up and

and Police Officers on the pitch.

beenclosed, was now open and police officers were carrying people from inside onto the

pitch.
I saw that two officers were having difficulty in carrying a youth so I took hold of his

leg «Tid assisted in carrying him onto the pitch.The youth was very pale and appeared un -

conscious. We laid him    on his back. The policemen then left to return to the terraces.

A policewoman who I do not know then approached me and together we attempted to revive

the youth - I gave mouth to mouth resusitation whilst the other police woman gave heart

massage. We worked   on the youth for several minutes until a member of the St. Johns

Ambulance approached us. He also tried to resusitate the youth but after a couple of

minutes told us there was no use continuing as he was dead.

I do not know the identity of the youth but would describe him as follows:-

Male,white,slim build, late teens/early twenties,pale complexion,short ginger/brown hair

wearing light coloured shirt (possibly checked).

After placing an anorak or similar over the youths face we left him on the football pitch.

I then returned to the Leppings Lane terrace area and gave what assistance I could to fans

who were still in the vicinity.

During this time I was aware that there were a number of bodies laid on the pitch, however

when I later returned to the football pitch the youth I had assisted had been removed.

After the dead and injured had been attended to I then together with other members of

my serial asked fans who were on the pitch to gather together in one area off the grass

and generally gave advice and assistance to people who were unable to find their friends

and relatives.
                 5 OOpm
At approximately^ then attended in the North Stand with a large number ofotherpolice

officers to await a de-briefing,however before this began     I left the groundandwent   to

Ecclesfield Training Centre,Green Lane,Sheffield, where a Casualty Bureau had been organised

My tour of duty finished at 85m that date.

At no time during the incident did I communicate with any     of the players.

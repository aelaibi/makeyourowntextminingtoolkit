At     1 3 4 0 hours,        I to o k        up m y      viewing           position          by the        wall     in the        frq:n'

of     the S o u t h       Stand     in      line wi'th the                penalty area              of    the W e st       St a n d .

Up     u ntil       about    1440       ho u rs ,     I spent            my     time    talking           to    oth e r    p ress      ...

photographers.                I then           left      my        position and walked                    to the m o u t h        of

the     players'           tunnel       intending              to    take       a picture          of B r i a n C LO U G H .

Whilst         at    the m o u t h      of     the    tunnel             I became       engaged           in c o n v e r s a t i o n

with Glenn               KIRTON,     I think          he       is the A s s i s t a n t           Secretary         of     the F.A.

I would         consider          Mr K I R T O N as            a    f r i e n d / c o 11e a g u e .       A f t e r a few

minutes         of       conversation            w i t h Mr         KIRTON,         a ground          official          carrying         a

walkie         talkie       came     up      to us.            I do       not    know       this m a n ' s        name     but    he

was     smartly           dressed       in d ar k         coloured            b l azer,      c o ll a r    an d    tie.

This      ground          official        in m y      presence             and      hearing        said        to Mr K I R T O N ,

"I     think        we    still    have        between             fifteen       and    twenty         thousand           pe op l e

outside         the       ground",        at     which         point       Mr K I R T O N      replied,           "Well      do y o u

want      to    delay       the    kick        off."

T he    Official           said,     "I      don't        think          it w il l     be    necessary."

We     all     then went          our     separate             ways.          I tried        to    find B ria n C L O U G H            bu

never        saw     him    once.

At     1501     h r s , I walked             back     to       behind         the    goal      West       Stand      end     near      to

emergency            gate    number          three        to       set    up a      remote        controlled            c am era.

I heard         screaming          from        behind          me     on the        terraces.             I turned         r o u n d an

sa w    people           crushed     up a g a i n s t          the       perimeter          fence      of P e n      three.           I s

that      one_girl's           f a ce     had     gone         blue,       obviously           the     pressure           on t h e s e

people         at    this    stage        wa s    massive.                I realised           something           awful        was

happening,               people    were        starting             to    climb      over      the     fence.           I finished

the     film        I had    in m y       cameras.                 There      was    nothing          I could        do    to h e l p

these        people        being     crushed.                      absolutely          knew       by no w       it was

             The Po li ce            did    not       seem      to    appreciate                 what     was    happening.             I t h in k

             they     initially             they       thought         it was              a    pitch     invasion         or     trouble

             starting.                                                      --                                                                       Y

             I then        retrieved             my    remote         cofit-rol led               camera      from      behind      the      goal-

             I wa s     standing            in the        goal        six y a r d              box w h e n a P o l i c e        Officer       wearinc

             a flat        cap       came    o nt o     the      pitch.               I grabbed           hold     of     h i m a nd    pushed       hin

             across        the       penalty area               towards           the          referee who         wa s    standing          in the

             corner        of    the       penalty        area        towards              the N o r t h S ta n d ,        saying       to    him,

             " F u c k i n â€™ stop          the    game-"

             I must        have       screamed          these         words           at       h i m at    least     three        times-       The

             Police        Officer          then went            up    to    the           referee        who    I think          was   in a n y

             event      about         to    stop       the      game-

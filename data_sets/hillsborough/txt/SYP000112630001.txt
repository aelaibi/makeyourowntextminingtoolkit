           Superintendent                     D u c k e n f i e l d we then       left for          the football            ground.          On

           then took         the         o f f icers rnentiond above                      to the Leppings               Lane

t errace       ticket       hold e r s      should go.        At    this       stage      I noti c e d that there

were     turnstiles already                  open and that    s u pporters had s t a r t e d to enter
                                                                         o ■      .                               .   .   .

the    ground.            I also    told* the        officers that there w o u l d be a build up

of s u p p o r t e r s w i t h o u t     tickets,       hanging a r o u n d           on the’,p a v ements and

near     to the       p e r imeter       gates      in hope       that    they w ould get             tickets.
                                                                                                     i'

Also     to expect          ticket       touts w hich w ould             obv i o u s l y a t t r a c t    Supporters,

thus     blocking          entry to the ground.

Once     briefed,          I took all         the    o f f icers    up to C a t chbar Lane,                Midlewood

points and           their     points        for Phase      III.         On    return to Lepping-s,Lane, I

i nstructed          that P C ’s 1696 S t a n b r i d g e          and     1300' G r u n h i 11 should work

t o g ether        in a    pair,    that      I should work wit h PS                   1952 S m i t h and PC

Wilson       by herself,,           I also       suggested         that       because      there was         very

3.i 111 e a 1 1 f i v e h o rses            could, do at t h i s t im e , t h a t a f f icers                too k t,he

leg stre t c h and also                to    have a n o t h e r    look       round the area.

At    1 2 . 3 0 pm that      day,      in company with PS S m i t h we went                      on a general

patrol.            We went    up to Mi ddl ewo.od R o a d and                  turned      right      up Wads I ey

Lane,       pass The Park           public       house.       I returned a steady st r e a m of

Li v e r p o o l    supporters         walk i n g    up W a d s l e y Lane away            from the        ground.

Most     stated that          they were          looking      for    somewhere            to get      s o mething         to

eat.        When     passing       the      shops    in W a d s l e y Lane,           I noti c e d    that

Liverpool' .supporters where                     leaving      off-licence              premises wit h           packs of

beer and what a p p e a r e d               to be the     two      litre       plastic      bottles        of    beer.

Some     suppo r t e r s     were      sitting       on g a r d e n wa 1 1s^dr i nk i.^.g the             beer,

should       go to the        g r o u n d early and that             if they a r r i v e d at             the   ground

drunk     they w o u l d         not     get    in.     We    c o n t i n u e d to walk           up .Wadsley Lane

until             reached The H o r s e a n d J o c k e y              p u b H C^j^otts e .. - There            I saw

approximately. 100 Liv e r p o o l                    supporters         d r ink i

P^^.Some                were     sitting; on the n e a r b y             grass       verge.         He    continued to

walk    round' the          estate        passing       other       of f - l i c e n c e    shops,       where       again

Li verp ool        s up p o r t e r s    were     buying      cans     of beer.

Approx.       1.00pm we           returned to the              gr o u n d    to join officers               mentioned

above.       At    this     time        I a s k e d the M o u n t e d       officers         to keep the area                   in

front     of the          p e rimeter       gates      clear.       As k i n g   them without             tickets          to

leave     the area.              I was also a sk e d           by a foot           Inspector         to try to keep

the f o o t p a t h       over    the      bridge      clear,       because        s u pporters          were

congregating,              blocking         the    pavement         causing        other      pedest r i a n s        to step

out    into the           road.         This was       passed       on to the other M o u n t e d

officers.            At    this      time      I noti c e d    that all          the       t u rnstiles     were       open

and that          supporters            were    going       thro u g h without any                problems.

For    the    next        hour    up to a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 , 0 0 p m all            my    contingent were

em p loyed as           d e s c r i b e d above.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 0 0 p m       I heard over           the    radio         that    the    special          train

'vad arri v e d at W a d s l e y Bridge.                     I looked at           the t u r n s t i l e s and

noti c e d that           small      queues       had formed          leading        to nearly all              the

turnstiles and              the      foot      officers were           searching all               the    s upporters

going     into      the     ground.            Mounted       o f f icers were still                asking       people          not

to block          the     e n t rance     to the       ground,       a ga i n getting             people without

tickets awa y             from the         ground.          I was a s k e d by an            Inspector          to    clear

the    footpath           in front        of the       shop and terrace                house,       so that          the

suppo r t e r s     a rr i v i n g      from the       special        train      could be d i r e c t e d towards

their     r e spective           turnstiles.            Queues were a l r e a d y             being       formed by

foot    officers at              the     turn s t i l e s    arid at     this      stage      there; was         no

problems.            I was       then     joined       by Insp.        Hand-Davies            and    eight       other

Mounted       officers.              I noti c e d that         as     people a r r i v e d they            seemed
                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                   R 192

confused,         because        for      the next       10— 15 m i n u t e s       I was    c o n t i n u a l l y being

a s k e d where     certain          e n trances were.

Approximately 2.15pm                   I looked at          the L e p p i n g s Lane         terr.ace

turns t i l e s    <8)    a n d n o t i c e d that        there was a build up of                    people.             No

queues at, turnst i l e s .               At this      stage all            the    perimeter       gates were            open

and s u p p o r t e r s were         c o n t i n u a l l y a rr i v i n g    at the ground.              1 noticed

that PC       1 300.and        1696 had a c t u a l l y         gone        into the       pen area and started

to    relieve      pressure          and     re-establish           queues,           I went      in to    help

because       I noti c e d      that       some    supporters          were        trying    to    crawl    .under the

barrier and         push their way to the                     front.             It seemed' a t; t              t a ge

that    the     supp.orlers arriv i n g at                the     ground          just    did not want       to wait
                                                                                                                   *£■'
their    turn      but,      just      push their way to the                      front.     The m o o d    of the

crowd g r a d u a l l y      changed from being                 happy to a g g r e s s i v e        because myself

and the       other      two M e r s e y s i d e     o f f icers     were         trying    to get       them    into

queues     thus     preve n t i n g a crush.                I noti c e d          that    people wit h      small

children were            hold i n g       them above        their      shoulders.            People       were

totally d i s r e g a r d i n g what was               being      said       to them.        I noticed          beer

cans    being      th r o w n at       one    of the M e r s e y s i d e          officers.         A rnan with his

young    son was         s h o u t i n g at me to do som e t h i n g                because       he was    getting

crushed.          Because       as     1 have      said above,              the    people a rr i v i n g    just .

wanted     to     push    their way to the                front.            I then       left the    pen area

because       I wa s n ' t     being       effective.           I. t ried three            times    to    get my

horse    into      the    pen a r e a        just where         the blue           barrier     finished,         but

could not         because       the       supporters were            so densely            packed.

The    s u pporters       actually           pushed me        out.          My    intention was          to try and

join up w ith the              two     other M e r s e y s i d e     officers            so that    we    could     put a

cordon of horse              ac r o s s    thus    s t o pping     some          of the    pressure       on the

turns t i l e s    and also          to try and          regulate           the    flow of supporters.

P eople at        this    stage were           c omplaining          of      being       trod on by the horse.

I moved out         of    that area and o r g an i s e d a cordon of horses                               across         the

blue    perimeter        fence.         I noticed    that PC Grunhill                   and S t a n b r i d g a    had

also    left the        pert a r e a because       they were          not' being         effective.             After

o r ga hi sing    this     c a r do n

t u r n s t iles were     being     crushed.        I also         noti c e d an Inspector                standing

on the    blue     barrier       iiear to the       turnstiles          pulling and             lifting         people

out.     Whilst     I was       in the     cordon of horse             on the       perimeter          gates       I

was asking        supporters        not    to    push?    but yet again they just                      ignored

what was       being     said.      I saw youths          climbing          the    perimeter         fence        just

to get    into     the    pen area.         At about         this     time myself            and    the    horse

were    pushed     t h r o u g h the     gates.    ,The      s upporters          pushing       past..      1 saw

several    people        fall    to the     floor and myself and PC 2 3 1 6 S cott m a n a g e d

to    push back     the     crowd,       blocking     the gap,         a l l owing       the    people who had

fallen    to get        back    onto     their    feet,      o t h erwise     I believe            that    they

w o u l d have    been t r a m p l e d on.        It was at         this     stage       that      I tried to

gejl thro u g h on the          radio,     saying     " Emergency"           but    I couldn't            get

It was about this time w h e n I saw s u p p o r t e r s that was                              in the      pen

being    ushered        round    towards        Gate C.       I w o u l d say that a p p r o x i m a t e l y

100 went       towar ds Gate C .           This    st i 11    lef t, appr ox imate 1y 200,                 st i 11

trying    to push their way thro u g h towards                        the    turnstiles.             About

'2.50pm I then saw Gate B open w hi c h a l l o w e d the                          remaining         supporters

the    pen to enter        the    ground on mass.               I saw Gate B close an d we                        then

allowed supporters              to filter        through      towards        the turnstiles.

It was at this           point    that     I went    to the         turnstiles and              put my horse

right    up to the wall.                I saw two youths            approach       the turnstile,                 one

had a ticket        in his       hand,     the    other      had a ten        pound note.              It was at

this    time     that    I heard a mess a g e        over       the    radio asking             for all
                                                                                                   ,■            PAGE

turns t i l e s      to be     closed.           I immediately            stopped     further       entry       into

the    ground by putting                 the horse          in front       of the turnt.i l e s .

I w o u l d say        r e garding       radio     communications             that   because        of    the

position          1 was     in the       noise     of the       crowd and a c t u a l l y trying            to

organise M o u n t e d         deployment,           I found        it very d i fficult            to hear

a n yt h i n g    clearly.       Whet h e r      it was      because       of the noise         round me at            the

time     or because           of traffic          on the      radio       1 cannot     say.

I have       eight years M o u n t e d experience-,                      having w o r k e d at all         the

grounds          in S ou t h Y o r k s h i r e    plus      others at Derby,           C h e s t e r f i e l d and

Le e d s Utd.        and    I would       like to. say that               I have     never    experienced

crowd behaviour               like    that.        It seemed that             people    did not and would

not     listen to advice.                 They seemed to tota l l y d i s r e g a r d what                  was      said

to them.            T o t a l l y d i s r e g a r d i n g .the safety of          people at        the    front      of

the     turnstiles.

POLICE DEPLOYMENT

It se e m e d       in my     opinion       that     up to the           special     train arriving,             there

was    sufficient           o f f icers     both on foot and m o u n t e d to                cope,       because at

that     stage       there .was       13 M o u n t e d officers.              But once       the    crush started

on the       turnstiles,           the    number       of    officers       on foot      seemed to         reduce

d r a m a t i c a l l y up to a point where                  I only saw          perhaps     1 Inspector,

1 S e r g e a n t and 2 PCs           (This       is o b v i o u s l y    on the     turnstiles).

As     stated above           I have      eight years           Mounted       e x perience work i n g

football          duties.        I have,         within      that    period,       three years           as a

sergeant.             I have w o r k e d      two other S e m i - F i n a l s at H i l l s b o r o u g h         plus

numerous First D i v i s i o n matches.                       I am usua l l y e m p l o y e d on various

duties a r o u n d         the g r o u n d but m o r e        often t h a n      not at      the L e p pings Lane

turnstiles.

I feel       that      if the      suppo r t e r s     had shown a little              c o n s i d e r a t i o n and

had     listened to what              was     being      said    to them and not             s t a r t e d the    push

an d    crush before           kick      off,     then      I think       this   tragedy w o u l d not have

              happened.            Perhaps     the s u p p o r t e r s were   e x c i t e d about   the match,    but   I

              believe a high              p r o p o r t i o n ha-d been drinking,       plus also a     large    number

              without        tick e t s    just   trying their       luck at      the    turnstiles,     thus

              causing        the    s u p p o r t e r s w ith tickets   to build up outside            the* turnstij.es.

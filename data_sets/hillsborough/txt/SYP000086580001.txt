                 have     worked as a tur n s t i l e            operator at S h e f f i e l d W ed ne sd ay s Football

                C lu b s Hi 1.1 >»borough ground since                 1971.         I have worked at all              the

                 turnstiles           in the g r o u n d and so I know the                  layout    very well.

                On S a t u r d a y        13th April    1989      (150489),      1 a r r i v e d at    the ground at about

                 11.30 ani I showed my                identity arid went             straight     to the meeti ng            room

                 under     the S o u t h Stand.             I received my        canvas        bag for the      tickets           the

                 keys     for       the    tu r n & t il e and the document           w yth the      turnstile     number and

                 t he n went         straight       to the turnstile                 4>n the   Pen ! s t on e Roa d end of

                 the     ground.           I w ou l d say that       1 was   /a pe rat i ng     my turnstile around, a

                 quarter        to twelve.          E v e n up to kiyk         off    time,    3 oclock      it was      very

                 quiet.         There was a lad facing me                  in t u rnstile             jnfortunately           I

                dont*      know his          name    but we even had time              to   chat and swop        papers.            It
                                                                                                                                                        PAGE              £
                                                                                                                                                        S3084

was    a     steady             flow          of    'spectators               nothing          to     energetic.                       I think          it

was    about              1510       a    Policeman             came          to     my      turnstile              he       told       us    to     close

the    turnstiles                    because             something                was     happening                in       the    ground          I *01       sure

he    was        an       officer             and       1 think          he       had     pips      on     his          shoulders,                 I just

thought              it    could          be       any    number             of    things        like          a    late          kick       off.          I love

football              so    I. t h o u g h t            great       I can          get       in a n d      watch             the       game    I quickly

packed           my       things          together             walked             around       the        inside             perimeter             to      the

stewards              roam       by       the       players             entrance.              This        is       where          we    always            hand

the    ticket              and       1 did          the    same          procedure             on     this          day.           I was       first            in

the    room           but       as       other          turnstile             operators             arrived                 they       mentioned               fans

climbing              on    the          barriers          but          1 d i d n ’t t h i n k            anything                was    really            wrong.

    1 then           went       up       to    the       refreshment                 stand       on       the       South          Stand       at       the         top

of    the        stairs,             1    bought          some          food       I then        went          up       to       the    seating            area

on    the        southAtand                    and       stood          in a       gangway          with           two       stewards          and         two

Police           officers.                    I d o n ’t       know          exactly          which        gangway                I don* t         recall

any    of        the       stewards                names       but        1 would            know     them          by       face.           1 could            see

that        no       players             were       on    the       pitch.              As    1 looked              towards             the    West            Stand

1    could           see    that          there          were       a    lot       of     people          on       the       pitch       Police

fay t h e        goal       area          but       people          were          even       shilling          around             the    half       way

line.            1    could          see       a    man    giving             ano^me r man                mouth             to    mouth

in w h a t           I believe                was       appreciation.                     1 saw       a    young             football          fan         I

               to    the    Lep pirigs        Lane        era.           I heard         ripples             of    clapping           from       the

              Nottingham           Forest          fans        it    was     more        in a p p r e c i a t i o n         of       what     the      Police

               had      done.           1 saw Dalglish                       and       Clough              come    onto     thep itch         and      one    thin

               that      stood          in m y m i n d         was           a     photographer                   holding        his       hand       with    the

               camera       high       in    the    air        trying         to       get    a       photograph           of    Kenny        Dalglish         or

               C l o u g h i e , this        was    on        the    centre            line       of       the    pitch     while          all    the       other

               events       were       going       on     I    remember            thinking                what    a Moron.            Then       by

               comparison          I saw       a P o i i cernan             carrying              a    hoarding          stretcher?              his    hat

               came      off    but     he    d i d n ’t go          back        to     pick          it    up,    he    just        carried          on.

               By    this      time     it    was       about        a    quarter            to       four,       I went        to    the     toilet,

               there       were    a    few    in       the        toilets         even       then          1 d i d n vt    know       exactly          how

               many      were     dead.        As       I was        leaving            the       ground          I noticed           that       ail    the

               major       gates       were        open        and           fans       were           flocking          out.I s a w        ambulances

               coming       and         going without                any     difficulty.                     As    I was driving              away      from

               the      station        I saw       Police           officers            on    the          major    junctions              directing

               traffic.           The       traffic        was       flowing           well           and    I. c o u 1 d s e e       ambulances             and

               doctors         getting        through              without         a    problem.                 J then     cut       through          the

               outskirts          of    Sheffield              and       home.

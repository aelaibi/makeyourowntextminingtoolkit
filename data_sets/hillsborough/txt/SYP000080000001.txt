           turnstiles.

           We all        began making          our way w ith d i ff i c u l t y         across the      pen to the

           difficulty.            Geoff      had a g a i n      become s e p a r a te d from Ian        and myself      but

                we were at this             l oc at io n at a p p r o x i m a t e l y H~3 minutes        (into the match)

                passed 3pm          1500 that         I can recall         seeing a young       lad carried out           of

                pen three          by two me n and        laid on the         grass    next to the        corner       flag.

                We were       stood behind gate              1 onto the       pitch an d this       lad was      lying     in

                front      of us.

                As     far as      I was    con ce rn ed the y o u th was         b re athing and alive          a lt ho ug h

                he was      receiving          a t t e n t i o n from various     people.       He was     placed       into

                the     r ec overy      p os ition on his          side after     one man had given him a short

                spell      of mouth to m o ut h          resuscitation.           About    a minute after          this a

                ma n who      I cannot         describe      turned the y ou th a g ai n onto his             back,

                com me nc ed mouth to m o u th            r es us c it a ti o n then    listened for the           lads

                breathing.             Then he s t ar te d external           heart mass ag e     on the      lad and      it

                became      obvious        to me that        the    lad had s t op pe d    breathing.

                The     same man a l t e r n a t i v e l y    tried heart m a ss ag e and mouth to mouth

                r e s us c it a ti o n on this y o ut h for between 2-5 minutes,                        then he stopped

                an d    pulled the youths              t-shirt      over    his head,     indicating       to me that          the

                y ou th had died.

                I can describe             this y o u t h as a w hite male,            10-13 years, about 5*2,

                male a p p a r e n t l y with the y outh began shaking                    the lad v i o lently as          if

'         V     in disbelief            that    the   boy was dead.           My a t t e nt i o n was    distr a c t e d from

                this     group and         I am unable        to say what        h a p p e n e d to the youth

                B e t w e e n 3.10pm       1510 and 3. 15prn 1515 I m a n a g e d to get onto the                      pitch.

                This was        because        I had seen G e o f f r e y M O O D Y    lying,   apparently         injured,

                on the      pitch,       the m a t c h having        been s topped by this time and                I

                o b v io u s l y was     concerned       for his welfare.

                I m a n a g e d to locate Geoff              on the    pitch and then went              in search of

process and          passed a number                  of Pol ic e O ff ic e rs who         patently

o b v i o u s l y did not         know what was             happening       at    the far end of the            pitch.

On    returning       to the         pitch       I found Geoff          had been s t re tc he re d off and

a ft e r   being     c on fr on te d wit h the              large    number       of dead and         injured on

the    pitch,      I deci de d to help                 carry some       of them to medical                assistance.

I helped        carry on m ak e sh i ft               stre tc he rs about         three rnen who were

obviously        dead.       They were all                 roughly     betw ee n 5*1 0 and 6 ' 0 of stocky

builds       (13-14 stone)             and a p p e a r e d to have          beer    be 1 l y s .     I cannot

describe        them further.

I also       helped a further                  two    injured      people       by a ssisting        to stretcher

them to the t em p or a ry mortuary.                         The    first was white             female,      16-18

years,      5 ’5 - 5*6,           m e di u m    build,      w ith dark      brown straight shoulder

length hair and wear in g a red Liv er po ol                             ’C ro wn Paint'           football    shirt.

I cannot        remember what             she had on below the shirt                      but      I do   remember

that       she had no shoes              on.         She was    conscious         for a short         time    but

b ecame      u n c o ns ci ou s    just        before we ente re d the             t emporary m o r t u a ry        or

gymnasi u m .

The    second of the two was a white male,                              2 0 - 2 5 years,        5*7 - 5*8 of

medium       build,     wit h a dark m ou s ta c he and wear in g a t-shirt and trousers

w h i c h were     undone.           He was          conscious       but was     not making m uc h            sense. I

can    recall      him saying            that        his   chest was hurting            but     I could not         see

a n y visible        injury,         as was          the   case w ith the girl.

I do not know what                 became        of these       people after            they were     put    into the

t e m p o r a r y mortuary.            I had become            s ep a ra t ed    from    Ian after Geoff            had

been s t r e t ch e re d off the                pitch and did not see them a gain until m uch

later.

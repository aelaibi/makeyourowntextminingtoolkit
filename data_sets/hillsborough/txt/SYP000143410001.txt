                                             - ST J O H N S



The     match         s t a r t e d at       1500       hours.            At     about          1505    ho u r s ,    I wa s       standing

on     t he     corner          against          the    Kop when           I noticed              fans       from Liverpool               end

trying          to    climb over             the       perimeter           f en c e .           I told       some     of     the    members,

who     was      in m y         sq u ad ,    that       we    had        better        make       our       way    down      to    the    other

end     as      the       other       squads       of    our        force        may       need       our    help with

forthcoming                injuries.




As     we     arrived           at    the    other       end,        a    policeman              grabbed          hold     of me a n d

p u l l e d me        towards          the       fence,       saying,            "It l o o k e d as           if t h e r e    is a

fatality             down       here.”           When    I looked,               the p o l i c e w e r e f o r c i b l y          trying

to     remove         the w i r e          and    I could          see     some        of       the    f a ns     trapped against

th e    fence         wire,          not    being able              to mov e ,         and       their       faces       turning         blue.

When        they      got       the    first       man       out,        I asked           a    policewoman who               was    just

stood         still        to    h e l p me w i t h          the     fan.         She          seemed       to s h a k e     herself          back

to     reality            so    I asked          her    to    do     the       heart           compressions           while        I did          the

resuscitation.                       Time    seemed          to    stand         still.           As    we w e r e       working         on

this        young         fellow,          a survivor             t o l d me      that          they    ha d      been     standing           on

him     for      about          ten minutes,             so       the     pol icewoman and myself                          went     to

another          fan       they were             just    bringing              out.            Although         I knew       that    the

first         v i t al     three       minutes          had       p a s s ed ,    we got          to w o r k         on the       fan,

opened         his        airway and             got    the       first        full b r e a t h into               him.       Before          I

could         give        him    the       second       full       breath,            he       emptied       his     stomach        contents

all     over         my    face       and    head,       it w a s        as      if    someone          had       turned      a hosepipe

                                                                                                                       D652

on    full     fo r c e .     I spat        it    out a n d     carried        on w i t h   the     j o b we      had    to

do.      The     p o l i c e w o m a n was       absolutely        fantastic,           although      she      ha d     turned

a    very    funny      c o lour.       She       just     tried a smile           and      carried     on     doing

heart       compressions.              I cannot           say   how     long we      carried        on for        but

somebody         came       along    stating         he w a s     a doctor        and    pronounced          him       dead,

so w e      moved along           to a n o t h e r    fan a nd        the   same     incident        happened           twice

more     where      I opened         th e    airway and           got   stomach         contents      over        face       and

head.        I can      remember        having        a    look    around       in b e t w e e n    breaths        and

keep     seeing        bodies       being        l a i d all    over     the    pitch.        Also     I would          like

to    praise      all       the   volunteer          first      aiders      who     came a n d      tapped        me    on

the    shoulder         stating        that       they were        first       aiders       and asked        if    they

could       help and         I thank        them and        directed        them     to w h e r e    they were

needed.

The    frustrating            thing     about        it all       was    seeing      the     fans    needing

help and         not    being       able     to     get    to   them     in time.

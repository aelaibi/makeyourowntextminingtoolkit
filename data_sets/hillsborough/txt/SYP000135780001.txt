          We have, of course, already made available a copy of Mr. Phillips'
/,. /yv       report.to ,.the.;.Coroner: 's-VOffleer.

     •As can be seen from the report, Mr. Phillips has himself analysed

/'   -..evidence,; relating'to'    .the- effects'of^alcohol;consumption on the

     ; .We..do-, not' think .that' it will, -be- particularly..-helpful'"for: us ..to--':;v';-
       identify individual witnesses,•more particularly, as the main data
       base of statements is held on the HOLMES computer system, by the West
       Midlands Police.. ' We would, however, ask that where there-are
       independent witnesses, particularly.local residents, neutral
       supporters or Liverpool Police Officers, such as the.mounted
       Officers on duty at Leppings Lane,:, all.- of'whom give evidence in
<■    relation to the effects of, drunkenness, -then these witnesses ought


        So far as the presence of .non-ticket holders outside the ground is
     ..concerned, we would again ask that witnesses be called, from, amongst
        the many supporters who gave evidence of people.asking for;"spares"
        as they walked down Leppings Lane.                              •-.-•■‘V'-:

       In relation to the possibility that there was some organised attempt
       to breach the turnstiles, we would ask that those witnesses be
       called who are referred to in. paragraph 204 of the Interim Report of
       Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.

          We would also ask that witnesses be called from, amongst: supporters,
          who found themselves confused by the signs and ticket colours and
>■ ..... also from, amongst: the turnstile operators.as ..regards.supporters;,,

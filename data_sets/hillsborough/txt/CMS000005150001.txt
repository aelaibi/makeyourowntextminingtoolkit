1.   As requested in your minute of 11 April I attach an amended
draft which takes account of the meeting held between the League,
FA and the Home Secretary since Mr Ellingford's submission of 23
March.

2.   The Letter of 1 March from Arthur Sandford, Chief Executive
of the Football League, asks the Secretary of State for a meeting
to discuss finance for the Taylor recommendations on football
ground safety and planning issues regarding new and existing
stadia.

3.   Finance, has of course been overtaken by the Chancellor's
concession on Pool Betting Duty.  The Minister will have seen the
Times report of 22 March (attached at Flag A) which reports Mr
Sandford's welcome for the concession.   Mr Sandford is reported
as saying that the League will respond by 'drawing up a total
strategy to meet the requirements of the Taylor report'.

4.   At the meeting with the Lord Ferrers on 4 April, the issue
of planning permission for new and redeveloped football grounds
was raised (paragraph 11 of minutes at Flag B).    It was left that
it would be a matter for the football authorities to pursue
separately with the Minister.       They will undoubtedly want to
discuss this issue before the Secretary of State sees Mr Sandford
in J u l y . , A draft Planning Policy Guidance Note on Sport and
Recreation will, I understand, be with the Minister soon and it
will contain advice which SARD has contributed to on this matter.
A meeting with the football authorities in early May might
therefore be timely.

Thank you for your letter of 1 March to the Secretary of State
about the financing of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations on
football ground safety and the planning issues surrounding the
development of new and existing grounds.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer's announcement in his Budget
Statement about the reduction of Pool Betting Duty reflects the
Government's concern to ensure that vital        improvements   to
football grounds     are made for the safety and comfort of
spectators.    I have noted the remarks attributed to you in the
Times article of 22 March.   It is most encouraging that you have
responded so positively and constructively to the Chancellor's
proposal,   and that both yourselves and the FA showed such
willingness at the recent meeting with the Lord Ferrers to work
with    Government     to  implement   Lord    Justice   Taylor's
recommendations as quickly as possible.      Not least of these
improvements is of course the introduction of all-seater stadia.

I regret that I was unable to attend the meeting on 4 April.   I
know  that   the  issue  of  planning  permission  for  new  and
redeveloped grounds was raised.    My office will be getting in
touch with yours and with Graham Kelly's to arrange a meeting in
order to explore this issue further.

I am copying this letter to Graham.

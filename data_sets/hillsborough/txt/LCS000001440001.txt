THE HILLSBOROUGH PROJECT: A PRELIMINARY PLAN



Summary

The     proposed         research             project       w ill    assess     the    services       provided

by     the      M erseyside            consortium            of      social     services     departm ents,

other        social    services          departm ents               and    voluntary     and        com m unity

organisations            in     response          to    the         H illsborough       disaster.       It    w ill

aim     to     identify         the    p ractice        elem ents           required    at   a ll    levels     in

order        to r e s p o n d    effectiv ely          to    such         disasters    and   consider         how

this    inform s        w ork         w ith    peo p le       confronted         with    less       public     but

equally acute crises.

Stage One


Analysis of the Helpline database


The     current       assum ption          is      that       this          com puterised                 record        system

contains       info rm atio n          that      will        be     of       use        to     the        p roject.             The

their problems were perceived and what the service response was.



A num ber         of problem s             in     relation             to    the        database               have    becom e

accessed       and      it    is    w orthw hile      to       do      so,      the   follo w in g        general

plan is proposed:-



a      as p r e l i m i n a r y b a c k g r o u n d w o r k it w i l l b e n e c e s s a r y to b u i l d

       up a picture o f the establishment o f the Helpline, to look at the roles of the

        various agencies and individuals involved, and to co nsid er the differing

        e x p e rie n c e s o f the a g e n c ie s and in d iv id u a ls in v o lv e d in H e lp lin e

        organisation and work.



b      from      this        base     consideration            w ill      be    given       to    the    general

        procedure            by     w hich     the    database            was     constructed.                 W hat

        procedure            was      used    for    recording            in form ation?               W hen    was

        inform ation re c o rd e d ?            W hat in fo rm atio n was collected?                           How

        was standardisation achieved? How was the information used?



c      finally,       the         creatio n     of    a       viable           database          for    research

        purposes.             T his    m ay    involve         inter a li a :         the    re-ordering          or

        regrouping o f the data; the coding or recoding o f the data; analysis either

        by hand or using SPSSX.


Although a relatively large n u m b e r o f calls have b een m ade to the H i l ls b o r o u g h

Helpline - 1,533 in the six months 1.10.89 to 31.3.90 - less than 15% o f these



w e r e for help. T h e v a st m a j o r i t y o f calls w e r e for i n f o r m a t i o n o r w e r e o f an

administrative nature and my current understanding is that they consequently did

not result in any information being entered on the database. As a result the data

held may not allow for or necessitate particularly sophisticated statistical analysis.



As    m ight     be     expected         the    calls         to    the      H elpline      have        not    been

research           w ill       be      to        consider           the       p rofile      of     calls     over          tim e:

when        w ere          calls       for       help        made?             W ere       they      concentrated              at

particular             periods?                  (eg     in        the       im m ediate          afterm ath         of      the

Finally,           and         in      addition              to     looking          at      the        n atu re     of       the

discussions as well.



                                                                        4
The Survey
T h e survey would consist in the main o f pre-cod ed questions , t h o u g h the nature

o f the experiences being disc usse d will necessitate the inclusion o f a n u m b e r o f

open-ended questions as well. In addition to the questio nnaire, res p o n d e n t s will

also be given the opportunity to respond in writing to a n u m b e r o f open-ended

questions which will b e printed as a separate questionnaire. T h e reasons for this

a re t w o-fo ld . Firstly, it is a m e a n s o f c o ll e c t i n g m o r e d a ta a n d , in p a r t i c u l a r ,

getting at some o f the interesting and important detail that could not be picked up

by the questionna ire.           Secondly, as the subject is one in w h i c h the respo n dents

will have a major emotional in vestm ent and one w h e r e a n s w e r in g questions in

response to a formal questionnaire is a potentially alienating experience, the offer

o f an alternative and additional m eans o f conveying p e rs o n a l i n f o r m a tio n may

make the resp o nd en ts feel that they have a grea ter de g re e o f o w n e r s h i p o f the

project. It will be crucially im p orta n t all through the study to e n s u r e that those

who have suffered as a result o f H i lls b oro ug h are not further tro u ble d -by their

involvement in the research.



T h e extra questionnaire can either be sent to the respondent pr ior to the survey so

that they can b e g i n th in k in g a b o u t the issu e s that a r e likely to b e r a i s e d in the

i n t e r v i e w or, a lte rn a tiv e ly , it c a n be left w i t h the r e s p o n d e n t at the en d o f the

i n t e r v i e w and r e t u r n e d to N I S W w h e n c o m p l e te .    T h e r e a r e a d v a n t a g e s and

disadvantages in both approaches and careful thought will need to be given to this

question before a decision is made.




T u r n in g to the m ain que stio nnaire, the following is a (by no m ea n s exhaustive)

 list o f topics that would need to be covered:


          what their relationship to the disaster is?



                                                           5
        wh e re user heard of service(s)?

        when service(s) were used (how contact was made)?

        why service(s) w e r e used (how often service(s) were used)?

        what was expected from services?

        what was received from services (how helpful?)

         what        other         form s        of      p ractical/em o tio n al                help        did       they

         receive?
         did      they       have         any      negative           experiences               as     a     result        of

         contact with services?



It   w ill      also      be      im portant,            if    possible,           to    include           w ithin        the

    b e n e ce ssa r y to e x a m i n e the ex perien c es o f a sample o f 'v ic t i m s ' who h av e not

    been in contact with the formal agencies. A revised questionnaire will have to be

    used with this sub-sample as many as the questions asked about services will not

    b e r e l e v a n t . A total o f 20 -3 0 r e s p o n d e n t s ( p e r h a p s s lig h tly m ore) f r o m this
    category should be sufficient.

    preliminary analysis o f the Helpline database. It is likely that the samples will be

    d r a w n fro m social services records. Altho u gh it was originally anticipated that

    the Helpline database would be used for this purpose it is probably inappropriate

for two reason s.              Firstly, the sa m ple will need to include resp on d ents who have

not had contact with the Helpline and, secondly, using the na m e s and address es

w o uld p rob ab ly c on tr av en e the D ate P ro tection Act. D r a w i n g the sa m ple f ro m

social services records will also help the researcher to stratify the sample in such

involved in the North-West. The sample will be drawn simply by setting quotas -

Non-service users may be slightly more problematic to contact. However, there

do appear to be a nu m ber of promising avenues to explore,

If f in a n c ia l r e s o u r c e s w ere to allow, or if the p r o j e c t r e s e a r c h e r had tim e , it

might also be useful to have a small number of group discussions in which those

affected by the disaster could share experiences. This might also enable slightly

resources to cover the extra work.

Once       again,        this       h alf of        the   research     is   d ivided        into     two     m ain

parts;         a n :" ; ;h i s t o r i c a l   or   organisational          study       and      secondly,          a

series of semi-structured individual and group interviews.


Phase One: The Organisational Study


An Organisational Study was included in the original research proposal and then

r e m o v e d after discussions with, as it then was, JR M T.                      I p r o p o se , that a small

scale Organisation Study be included within the formal structure of the project as

it is a p ie c e that is f u n d a m e n t a l to the su c ce ss o f the w h o l e e n t e r p r i s e . It is a

d iscrete piece o f w o r k that needs to be incorporated into the timetable. In o r d e r

to b e a b le to d e s i g n r e s e a r c h t o o ls w i t h w h i c h to c o n d u c t i n t e r v i e w s w i t h

community groups and individuals came together to respond in the way they did.

W it h o u t this contextual in fo rm a tio n there is no solid p latfo rm on which to b a s e

the other, more concrete parts o f the study.

W h a t I p ro p o se to do is, by using the records o f the Inter-Agency F o r u m (which

I a l r e a d y p o s s e s s ) , the r e c o r d s o f any o th e r b o d ie s w h i c h a r e a v ailab le, and




                                                            11
through interviews w ith key personnel, to build up a p i c t u r e o f the p ro ce ss by

w h ic h the 'I n te r - A g e n c y F o r u m ' and the V o lu n ta r y S e c to r C o - o r d i n a t i n g

C om m ittee cam e into being and to consider the issues and p r o b l e m s confronting

the g r o u p s w o r k i n g in this way. In clu d ed in this p a r t o f the p r o j e c t will b e a

limited number o f interviews with those involved in Sheffield and Nottingham as

well.    Although included under the general b a n n e r o f the S ta ff C a r e Study, the

historical or organ isational Study o f the se rvice r e s p o n s e will inform both o f the

major parts of the project. As such it will be necessary for the bulk of this w o r k

to be unde rtaken in the first 3 months o f the research (see timetable).




Phase Two: The Interview Study

W h a t I a n tic ip a te in this part o f the study is a se r i e s o f g r o u p 'e x c h a n g e s ' o r i, ;

research proposal ^ a r c h 1990) is the inclusion, again by wa y o f comparison, of

some work with the police.

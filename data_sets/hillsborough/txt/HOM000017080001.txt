                I apologise for writing to you at a time when I know
         you must be under immense pressure, but I would like to raise
         one rather important matter which is, I believe, relevant to
         the Hillsborough inquiry.

                During the committee stage of the Football Spectators
         Bill in the House of Lords, we discussed the situation that
         could arise if the national membership computer system broke
         down, or another emergency situation arose, at a time when tens
         of thousands of people were attempting to gain admittance to a
         football ground (House of Lords Hansard, March 14, columns 193-
         201).    I proposed that in the case of such an emergency the
         senior officer of police should have the power to direct that
         the scheme should be temporarily suspended;   the Minister did
         not want the police to be given that power, but agreed to meet
         me and representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers.
         This meeting eventually took place at the Home Office,    Mr James
         Anderton, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, and one of his
         Assistant Chief Constables representing ACPO.    The Home Office
         and the Department of the Environment undertook to re-consider
         the issue and others which we put to the Minister, but, before
         we heard the result of their reflections, the tragedy of Hillsborough
         intervened.

                I appreciate, of course, that you may consider that many
         of the issues involved in the argument about the Football Spectators
         Bill are outside the terms of reference.   Nevertheless, I trust
         you will agree that this particular issue is highly relevant to
         your inquiry.   I very much hope that you will agree to consider
         commenting on this matter in your report.

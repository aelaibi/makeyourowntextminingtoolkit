                                HILLSBOBOOGH AMD THE AMBULABCE SERVICE


The        Hillsborough         Disaster         in     terms       of     Ambulance      Service          provision       and

response was a successful exercise.                             That success was only possible because

as     a     Service      we    review,          at    least       once    a    year,     our    approach          to    Major

Incidents         and always without                  fail, consider the lessons                 learned from other

Services         who may        have       had   to    respond       to    a    large   scale     or major         incident

within their areas of responsibility, within that period.




We were very effective on the 15th April 1989, because we had in attendance

at     the       time,     ambulance          personnel        and        officers      within       the    grounds        and

outside          the     stadium.           That      procedure          had    been    one     of   our     operational

policies         since     the Bradford            Stadium Fire some years earlier.                          It is worth

noting        that       when     I        approached        the        five    Football        Clubs      within        South

Yorkshire          offering       to        provide      professional            Ambulance        Service      provision

within       their       stadiums,         shortly after           the    tragic       fire at Bradford,            none of

them saw the need and none of them would consider paying for such services.

That       did    not     deter       me    because      I    felt       that    should    a     tragedy      of    similar

magnitude happen anywhere within my County and we could not adequately deal

with       it,    two     accusations            could       legitimately         be    made     against      the        South

Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and myself.




Firstly,         we     were    negligent          because         we    had    not     taken    account       of       recent

events and perhaps we were negative by thinking these things                                               always happen

to others.




And secondly, we lacked professional foresight which disregarded the safety

of the general public within our areas of responsibility.




                                                                                                              /continued

Both     of    these    points,        I    now   know    following     my    attendance      before    Lord

Justice       Taylor,    would     have      been   the    minimum     accusations     made    within       the

public enquiry.




As a result of my visit to the West Yorkshire Ambulance Service to consider

their        response and handling of the Bradford Fire,                     I decided   that ambulance

cover        would be provided free of                 charge to the football clubs.




My     visit     to     Bradford       identified         the   following        important     issues       for

Ambulance Services to consider




       (1)     Because     of    the       crowds   leaving     the    Ground,     ambulances       found    it

               difficult to approach the necessary areas.




       (2)     It happened on a Saturday when most Officers                        are not     on duty and

               Control had no means of calling them in,                       if they were not on           the

               telephone at home.             They had no paging system.




       (3)     Officers who were contacted and asked to respond did                             so in their

               private     cars    with      no blue      lights,      horns,    marking or    radios       and

               where therefore rendered useless by                    the traffic and crowds.




       (4)      Officers    had     no      means    of     clear     identification,        they   were     in

                civilian dress.




       (5)      There was no Ambulance Service Plan of Action                        for the evacuation

                or rescue of people from football stadiums.



                                                                                                /continued

       (6)        Little contact with the Police.




    That     is   not    to     say    the    Ambulance   Service   did   not   cope   well    with     the

    incident, because they did given the situation.




    Some of these issues were not a matter of concern in SYMAS as we had Senior

    Officers      on    call    at    all    times with marked cars,      radios,   horns     etc,    but   I

    didn't think we had enough and so:




           (1)    All Station and Senior Officers were provided with radios.




           (2)    All Station and Senior Officers were provided with pagers.




           (3)    All Football Grounds had Ambulance Evacuation Plans drawn up.




           (4)    Positive,      on-going,       liaison and communication with the Police was

                  set up just to cover these types of events.




           (5)    Control had individual written plans of action.




           (6)    Large        attendance      games   received   additional    Ambulance and        Officer

                   cover.




    These measures helped with our success.




     But what did we learn from the Hillsborough Disaster ??



                                                                                               /continued

We learned




   (1)   You have to plan for any incident to happen to y o u .




   (2)   You do not rely on communications or information being adequate or

         even available,        from others.




   (3)   You have      to realise      that plans      have    to be regularly           READ by       all

         concerned.




   (4)   You    have   to   have   sufficient        resources    ON   DUTY       to    cater    for    at

         least an initial response.




   (5)   You    need   to   have   tight      control    and    command      of    your    aspect       of

         provision.




   (6)   Liaison initially is poor with all concerned, take positive action

         to secure effective liaison.




   (7)   The Ambulance Service informs the Hospitals of the                            'INCIDENT' via

         switchboard, not the Police




   (8)   An    Ambulance     Officer    is    required    within       the    Hospital          Incident

         Room.




   (9)   Do    not   use    jargon.      Do    not    expect     others      to   understand        your

         terminology.



                                                                                           /continued

  (10)         Prepare for the Press.




      (11)     Prepare for "Stress".




      (12)     Understand the needs of your                  staff.




      (13)     Don't be afraid to show your                  emotions when it        is safe to do so.




Other    issues were          identified,     such as        the use     of voluntary organisations.

The    need     to    have     an   agreed     span     of     control     of   these       people,       we   had

incidents       where    volunteers          ignored     the     directions         of    Senior        Ambulance

Officers      and went       into areas      after being advised not to.                    This       should not

happen       again because the         long standing unwritten               rules       that    the    Statutory

Ambulance       Service       takes    charge     of    these     volunteers          has       now    been    very

formally written.




I must mention the Press - some of these people on the incident site acted

in an appalling manner.                They paid sums of money to residents whose homes

backed onto          the Temporary Mortuary Area               in order      to obtain photographs               of

the ambulance personnel               removing    the        bodies   to        the         Medico Legal               Centre in

Sheffield.           Others    incited    people       to complain about             rescue      and statutory

services.        Many    paid       little    notice     to    formal      statements       of     information.

You should note that any statement made by an individual after an incident

can   be     investigated       and   called     to    explanation         before     the    Public      E n q uiry.

Several people found this out to their dissatisfaction.



                                                                                                       /continued

A very important point to remember is one raisad during the investigation.




     "You have the responsibility for the provision of all aspects of

         your Service,   that final accountability cannot be delegated to

         others even if by custom and practice it has never been provided."

                  I am a single man and I live at the above address wj^tTh my parents.

                  For the past five years                   I have seriously s uppp luffed Liverpool football

                  piub,     I try and watch all of their home games and manage to make                                                 it

                  to about 50% of their away matches.                               I am not as season ticket h ol de r.

                 A friend of mine, Gordon Horn/fegl^fne a ticket for the semi final match

                  between Liver pool and No11 i ngrtam Foest,                               He went to Anf i e 1d and bought

                  the ticket from there.                   He was able to get the ticket because I'd got

                  vouchers from other games that I had attended and this enabled me to

                  get a ticket.

                  The ticket was for thxe Lepp^fngs Lane end of the ground at Hillsborough

                  football ground.              I            Go rdon £6.00 for the ticket,                          it was for the

                  ter ra ce s.        I have still got the ticket stub the serial number being

                    We all met up at               the B e a c o n s f i e l d Pub      (PH) w hich          is our         regular.        We

                    m e t / u p at about       10 am.            Most    of us had a pint of                 lager         or beer     I had a

                    pi/nt of       lager     but    I c o u l d n ’t tell you           if G or d o n had a drink                  or not.

                     e left Liverpool               at a ro u n d       10.15 am Puggie              ( H a r d a k e r )drove      the mini

                    bus.        I think we went- along                  the m o t o r w a y and then across                  the P e n n i n e s ,

                     I took a couple               of    cans of        lager with me          in the mini              bus.       Most    of

                    the     others      took a few cans w ith them but                       I c o u l d n ’t tell you who                 took

                    what.

                    We d i d n ’t stop a ny where                on route apart           from at a pub about                     six miles

                    out of Sheffield.                   The    pub was        called the^ Silver Fox but                     I c o u l d n ’t

               I P ? tell      you exactly where               it is.         I know                     is owned by

                                                          We a r r i v ed at the          puro at a p p r o x i m a t e l y        1.30 pm,

                    a nd    I had two        pints       of llwfeTr.I           had a l r e a d y drank           the      cans    that    I ’d

                    t ak en with me          in the mini             bus.     Most     of the others with me also                         had

                    two     pints      but   I c o u l d n ’t tell you what e x a ct ly what                       they were

                    drinking.           I d o n ’t think G or d o n had much t/r drink                        if a ny thing at all.

                    We     l_eft the Silver Fox at about                       1.50 pm/and drove              off towards

                    Sheffield.           We had only t ravelled two                          three miles whe n the mini                         bus

W he n we got out of the mini ^bus there was a massive                                       crowd waiting          to

get     t hrough the turnsfrj^es^                 There was            no orderly queue             I d p n 't

remember        seeing any       police         officers.

We    started to make          our wa y forward and the further you got the more

unbea ra bl e      it became.         At one       point,            I was    that    tightly       paqked       in that

I was     lifted off my feet.                   I remember seeing a^po 1 i cgtfiar|j|on a horse

and as he moved            the horse we all              seemed to get split u p .                     I got      pushed

up against a wall,             squashed.           I must            be honest       I was    quite     f r i g h t en de d

and     I was    having     d if fi c u l t y    breathing,

I d o n ’t know what         time     it was       but    it felt as though                  I had been          in the

queue     for about            teen mi nutes when                    I saw a large gate on my right

hand                        I c o u l d n ’t see who           had opened            it.     E ve ry on e   started

to iTi#ve towards          the gate a nd thi ngs                eased a l o t .        I was able           to breath

and     I w ould     like to say that             I 'm,glad that              the gate was          opened j a g ^ y s e

I dread to think what might                      have happened               if the gate h a d n ’t

been opened.

I made my way towards               the gate and wa lk ed t h r o u g h .y'^Vt^this stage                           i

of him more or lefs              straight away.

          and    I got through the gate together.                              No one took my ticket                or

his ticket was            for.     Due     to the fact that                I ’d been to the ground                    last

year     I was aware        that     the terrace was              divided           into    pens.

Once     I got     into the pen          (3)    I could see           it was! pack'ed.              The    crowd were

swaying        quite badly and there was                  no way          I wa nt ed to move forward,

the game had a l re ad y started.                   More       people seemed to               come    in

from behind and                      and    1 were       pushed towards               the middle          but we were

that     the    people     in front        of us were          being       crushed.

The    game was stopped and                I saw people on the                 pitch.         After about             ten

 n-adverserial way, would be warmly welcomed by them.  The proceedings of which Mr
 alf speaks, don’t directly involve the bereaved because they are, correct me if I ’m
 g, it’s the contribution proceedings between the various defendants, the insurers of
 olice have agreed that subject to proof, they will deal with all the civil claims and
 e are issues arising from that. Certainly in terms of the bereaved, those
 eedings are not a factor and I am sure they would all welcome as much information as
 ossible to get.

letcalf - I think there’s a further point which again I d o n ’t suppose affects us
•ctly, which I perhaps ought to make on that, nobody is being kept waiting for
sensations INAUDIBLE so that’s not a live issue, the question of the amount of
lensation is in issue and one of the particular aspects is something known as pre
.h terror/pre impact terror which we used to describe as pain and suffering before
.h. If it be the case that there is evidence of people having survived for a long
; or recovered consciousness sufficiently to recognise what state they were in or
fered pain, then the bereaved relatives are likely to be entitled to higher
lensation on those grounds. That may be a factor which is preventing cases being
tied at the moment.

•'raser - Certainly that’s a major factor but I don’t think that’s adverserial in the
•e   ; between ourselves, that’s really a matter for finding out information, that’s
 vou’ve beer bombarded with all these letters from people.

 - Looking from the bereaved point of view, my feeling is that they would welcome a
Lted Inquest, provided that the limits are explained to them an that they understand
 reason for it.

Fraser -There will be one or two people who you will be faced with if you do proceed
 find those restrictions difficult to accept and you will have to be as firm as I have
 doubt you can be with them, even though they have it explained in advance, it’s an
remely emotional situation particularly for those who were there with people who died,
 perhaps so much for people who are at arms length.  It may be seen as an opportunity
 those who vere there, to get it off their chest and that could be a problem I think.

 - We have thought about this, it is difficult and I also recognise that it is
ossible for me to satisfy 95 families.  I have thought about how we should present the
dence and I feel we should not ask any SY Police Officers to give oral evidence at
s hearing.

Me   alfe - I can’t think that any of them could give any information about this, they
} J give general information about body positions and so on.

 - There are a lot who participated in the rescue and resuscitation and by not calling
m, i t ’s only fair to say that we are harming those that did well and tried very hard.
 we decided it was impractical to select.    It becomes very much harder to control all
 questioning and for that matter the answers.    The principal way we want to present
 evidence is that there will be be team of Officers from W Midlands, they will prepare
ummary of the evidence and will present that summary of how the deceased arrived at
 ground and the events which took place at Hillsborough, basically statements. As
n as the summaries are available, they will be circulated to the solicitors of the
ering Committee.    If you felt that that was acceptable as it stands, then I would

Mr Fraser - There will be some families who want their, someone said, their 15 minutes of
fame.  I suppose to some extent they are going to have to be given that opportunity
aren’t they.  I think the vast majority will go through very smoothly but I think that
there are going to be one or two    whoare going problems.

HMC -     We recognise that, but we want   the Inquests to be meaningful.

Mr Fraser - Yes, it’s serving the two points particularly, getting information and also
dealing with our problems on the civil front.

 Mr Jones - The summary is not only one of my Police Officers’s summary but      that is
 reviewed by me and my people, it’s actually going to go to Dr Popper so he      gets actually
 the full file with all the statements and including matters which could be      considered
prejudicial.   He can actually read those matters which relate to the death      and look at
 that in terms of how it compares with the summary.  The summaries come out      from the
 Coroner as opposed to come out from me.

 M Fraser - No disrespect to W Midlands’ Officers, I think that if that point is made,
 a..u clearly made, I think some of the "oh i t ’s another policeman and another policeman’s
( .atement" sort of comment, then if a statement comes from your office, it’s going to be
 .iluch easier to swallow.

    HMC - Would you want to see the suunmarie s^Mr Kennedy? Vl would prefer not to send the
    summaries to dozens of parties.                        J

    Mr Fraser - One of the points at issue is tftat^at!" the moment a broad swipe has been taken
    at this pre-death payment and suffering, those summaries are almost bound to contain
    information which will benefit us and I certainly would have no objection to the oterh
    side seeing them, I don’t know whether they would want to.

    Mr Metcalf - I think the distinction that can be drawn between us and the other
    defendents is that we are doing the paying out, so we have a legitimate interest.
3                                                    u                               .
    HMC - I ’m quite happy is you say it would be helpful to see them before we begin.

    Mr Jones - There’s no problem.   The first thing was to clear with Mr Fraser in terms of
      it side of things.

,o *r Fraser - We have to work together, if the document became available and the plaintiff
  relied upon it, I would have to disclose it any way, so you might as well see it at the
  beginning rather than. It will be a matter of public record after the hearing because ti
  will be part of the deposition.

    Mr Metcalf - Returning to the beginning of this, there is I think a line to be drawn in
    making clear what these preliminary hearings are intended to deal with between saying,
    well look w e ’re doing this to prevent any possible risk of prosecution, but not actually
    giving the idea that a prosecution is certainly going to follow.

    Mr Fraser - That has occurred to me and will occur to others.

    HMC - We thought about doing this a while ago but I turned it down because I thought that




             INIAAF
     if I held a limited Inquest as this stage, everybody would assume that I knew what the
     MP    w a s going to do.  ?he reason why I feel we can do it now is because of Miss Steel s
     letter       She requested the information, what we are doing is trying to comply with her
     w ish      It would be made clear, if necessary 9 5 times, that under no circumstances can it
     be construed as a preliminary.      Do we say that because somebody won’t believe it, we
    „ don't do anything at all7
/

     Mr Fraser - that’s right, there will be one or two hotheads who will look for the
     ulterior motive behind this. The vast majority will accept it in the spirit which it
     done.      The press will do the same.

      HMC - I am quite satisfied in my own mind that we are not doing it for that reason.
      There are three scenarios which are worth mentioning.         One, that the DPP decies to
    p r o s e c u t e somebody or several people for manslaughter.   If that were to happen, then
       Section 16 of the Coroner’s        Act would apply and I would adjourn the Inquests on
       provisions of that Section.         Whether I resume or not, I will decide at the end of the
       nrosecutioh, but it is my normal practice not to resume when prosecutions for murder,
       manslaughter or ......... take place. Secondly, that he decides not to prosecute for
          ^slaughter or a charge that falls within that Section.        In that case, I will have to
    r ecide on a resumption then I will make up my mind how much further evidence I will need
     *|\:o call. Thirdly, he decides not to prosecute but that somebody brings a private
       prosecution.       Again, I ’m not saying it will happen but it is a possibility, Mr Hytner I
      think hinted at that     possibility.

      Mr Metcalf - I would take his remarks very carefully, he at no stage gave the idea that
      he or his colleague, King, thought that there was anything in which they were putting
      forward. What they were saying was, "some of my clients believe". He was very careful
      in his wording.

      HMC - I w a s n ’t suggesting that he thought that one should be brought, I was just saying
      that he recognised that there were some people who might wish to do so. Assuming that
      someone brought a private prosection, then you’re back in the Section 16 situation.
     ir%
      Those are the three scenarios.     If the DPP were to prosecute, then if I hadn’t     done the
      resumptions at this stage,     I would have had to resume on a limited basis to at    leasttake
      the medical evidence.    Bearing mind even if the DPP does prosecute, he may not actually
       — osecute 95, he may select.    It might be that it would be unfair not to at least take
       _.ie sort of evidence we have been talking about for the other x number who aren’t
       mentioned on the charge sheet, but it would be covered under Section 16. So I might be
     .'faced with having to do all this anyway after the DPP has decided. Assuming that we do
       it nov. that work will have been done if the DPP decides to prosecute, I will resume the
      Inquests for the purposes of adjourning under Section 16 and then I will make up my mind
       when it is over.

       Mr Fraser - I t ’s going to take a lot of    heat out of the situation.  There is a need to
       know, 1 think so far as it’s possible to     give that information, I think it’s an excellent
       idea .

       Mr Jones - Humanely, if you look at it in terms of not doing anything at this stage, it
       could be quite a while, and the psychologists tell us that the grieving process needs
       this in order to work through.  The vast majority of families want to settle down and

 start rebuilding their lives but they can’t do it.

 HMC - I d o n ’t know what the DPP is going to do any more than you do.          When I mention it,
 that s got to be put as part of the scenario.

 Mr Jones - To help you on that, if this goes ahead at the time we are talking about, the
       submission to the DPP wo n ’t have been made whilst this is going on.

 Mr Fraser - What sort of dates are we talking about7

 HMC - What we want to do as soon as you are happy, we want to have the pre-inquests with
 you next week because we want to give everybody a chance to hear and know what’s going
 on and resume the Inquests on the 18th April, and start actually taking evidence on

Mr Fraser - Would you attach to the summary the PM report or would you include it in it?




           IN1AAF
          HMC - The PM report would be separate.    1 might call the Pathologist to every Inquest and
          I d value your comments.

         Mr Jones - I t ’s a question what the family want to some extent.    I know there are one or
         two PM reports which talk of fractures and what the family want to know is whether that
         fracture caused any distress.     In the majority of cases, they are very sympathetic
         reports.  I c a n ’t see very many families wanting to put questions to the Pathologist
         One or two certainly.                                                       6

         HMC - There are one or two where there were queries.        1 want the families to be able to
         hear what was what, it’s better if it’s dealt with in Court. What 1 had in mind, and I
           " “ S      sP°k®n to Pr° f usher, is on the opening day, to take evidence from Dr Forrest

          .ny alcohol at all, another large batch only had relatively low levels, there may be a
         few where th                                        thought thaty„, could ^
         some othet suitable Pathologist, so that he could give us a general dissertation on
         traumatic asphyxia death.  The families wouldn’t have heard it but the solicitors would
      tne^PMc   i f.;   We d° thu V T COUld then take as documentary at least a proportion of
     ^tne PMs.  But if you say this family w o n ’t be happy unless they hear from the
       atnologist, then 1 will consider that.

         The Jury, initially 1 was going to do without but 1 have changed my mind.  There will be
         a Jury even at this preliminary stage, though the Jury will have nothing to do because
         there will be no verdict as such at this stage.  Bearing in mind that one of the
                   18 ^ a^ * Prosecution may take place and that 1 may adjourn under Section 16,
         and at the end of the day, may not resume, if we do this without a Jury then none of its
         with a ^ r y      3    7     1 think technically   L t ' s better if the Inquests were heard

         Mr Metcalf - I can’t    fault your logic but it would be nice for them if there was    a wav
         round it but I can’t    think of any.                                                      7

         to start with a new one, and do the whole job again.       I felt it would be unwise to
         proceed without them from a legal point of view.


                      Ttl S f3Se where.you would automatically have had a Jury had their been no
         possible element of prosecution.

     HMC - That’s the problem. .The Act says that if, a Coroner shall proceed                      I

     really worried about selecting.

    for exclusions on the Jury. We don’t want to pick and choose but we don’t want to have
    people who by definition are involved in some way. 1 have to think about this.

    We are inclined to hold it here and I will show you around the building later.     As we are
    going to be dealing with 95 Inquests and provided we can get the summonsing right, we
    shouldn’t have too manypeople in the building at any one time.      Except on Day One when
    the press will be here,    then 1 think they will go away.) We want to try and arrange for
    ccTffee and the l^RVS, and^e'want- to inform the'Hillsborough Support Group.   I don ’t want
    to get involved in the running of that side because it’s more for Mr Fraser. What lhave
    in mind, is when we warn the family of attendance, we would at the same time warn the
    Support Group. We will     then expect you to co-ordinate them, the Social Services etc.

    ^lr Metcalf - Are they all     represented, all 957

    Mr Fraser - There’s about two or three that aren’t, this      is something that your Officers
    and I can check.  Representation has changed.

        "MC - Can you let me have you updated list7

<' Mr Fraser - Yes, 1 can let you have that by the end of the week.         Our difficulty is one
        that I have no wish to embarrass my friend about, but we as a Steering Committee, may not
        be here because we have a problem with the Insurers about being here.     Our original, if
        I ’m treading on difficult territory, please say so. Ouroriginal approach     to your
        Inquest was this; we have already sent out a questionnaire to all solicitors who
        represent the bereaved and with very few exceptions, they have all returned them saying
        they want block representation.   This means you would have one individual or a team of
        two or three working on a rota basis appearing before you.    It had originally been our
        intention to match representation with our protagonists, but in view of what you have       \
        said today, my view, subject to the view of my Committee, would be, that it would be at \
        solicitor level only and probably me because I have 22 personal bereaved families and as
        I lead the team for the    Inquests, I would probably be before you. That was on the basis
        that the Insurers would    fund that en bloc.  They have declined our invitation to pay for
        vepresentation for the bereaved at the Inquests at all. Not either en bloc or as           ./
        solicitors or for each individual family. So the present position is that we either have
        to persuade them to see    the error of their     ways and there is a meeting on Wednesday of
        this week at which an attempt will be made, or, we have to tell the families they cannot
          ° represented unless they pay for individual solicitors themselves and the prospect
        therefore is that you have a different solicitor for each bereaved, or in some cases, no
        solicitor at all.   The third possibility is that there is funding available from another
        source.   I can tell you that as I speak there is no other source available.     It has been
        suggested that we approach the Legal Aid Board, it is not possible.     It’s been suggested
        that we approach the Disaster Fund, and they have declined, so there are only two
        possibilities, either we can persuade the Insurers.    In fairness to the Insurers, their
         stance was taken before this information came available to us, but either we can persuade
         them to change their minds and agree to fund block representation or fund individual
         solicitors representing their clients and those solicitors instructing us as agents.     Or,
         secondly, you have a team of different solicitors, you have a different solicitor for
        each bereaved in front of you with my exception.    Some have blocks of three, four and
        five solicitors, but there are quite a lot with one.    The present situation is that you
        could end up with up to 40 solicitors in front of you and that is a problem for which I
        TAPE ENDS

 Mr Jones - Can I just add that there will be transcripts as well.

 HMC - we are wired for sound and we usually transcribe from tapes, but at the moment that
         we have it here, I will get preferably the same firm that did the Inquiry to do
  horthand transcripts and we will probably record as well    We will lpt anvr.no k

  Inquests done separately so that we w o n ’t get a whole d a y ’s proceedings.   You can ask for
  individual copies rather than all those for that day.

  Mr Metcalf - It will reduce the need to go through the evidence at the end.  I c a n ’t
  think at the moment of circumstances where we would have questions to ask, if we don’t
  the likelihood is that we would want a low level representation and a transcript.

  Mr Fraser - I think from a political point of view,     the Ch Constable might want somebodv
  in.

  Mr Metcalf - Yes and no.    If it isn’t necessary, but I would have thought, I ’ll have to*
  think about it.

 4^)MC - I want to call the cases in Pathologist order because if I do need to call a
  ^Pathologist, I want to call him for half a dozen.   But of course where there are two
   people in. the same family have been killed, then that’s an over-riding consideration.
   Those Inquests should be done on the same day. There are other factors which come into
    t as well.   They will appear random.  The disadvantage is that they w o n ’t be in
f solicitor order. If the Committee doesn’t represent, i t ’s not a problem.

  Hr Fraser - How much notice would you give the families or would you tell the
  solicitors?

   HMC - What I have in mind, is that we would notify the solicitors of the time and also
   the family directly. An Officer would tell them, and of course any witnesses we may want
   to call, the Officers would notify.  And of course the Hillsborough Support Group so it
   may veil be that in certain circumstances, w e ’d turn up at the door as well.W e ’d have
   to say that the Inquest is going to be held on x day but be prepared for change.       Mr
   Fraser, you could explain those aspects.

  Mr Fraser - It would help me if you could alsotell me with my Committee hat             on,   the
  -oroposed dates as well.

   HMC - Yes.  If I know that the Committee will be representing en bloc, I wouldn’t notify
   the individual solicitors, I would just notify you of the dates.

    r Fraser - I think it would be better if you told the solicitors as well.    To a large
   extent, we are anonymous in the sense that we have deliberately not identified ourselvRfl
   as individuals and if I have the information, then by the time I get to his solicitor ainl
   he &ets it out, or he gets the information get back to me, I think if i t ’s possible, ti? li­
   the family, tell the solititor and also tell me.

   Mr Metcalf - It only matters in terms of preparation,     reading up etc.

   HMC - That   is all I really need to say today.

   Mr .... - This question, your objectives as it were, in asense         you are united in terim'
   of finding out the information in order to settle on

   Mr Metcalf   - We each have the idea that this thing is bettersettled       quicker.




           INIAAF
( Mr ..... - In particular, the pain and suffering levels, immediately before and after
  death, there may well also be needs amongst the families to actually question, which they
  would normally do in an Inquest, question the people who were actually there, to say what        u
  did you do to help my client,/- One thing that you will h a v e ' t o l e sure of is that this
  ’device’ will actually bring out that to your satisfaction, A lot of it will centre of
  what the summaries say, but the ability to cross examine will not be there at that point,
  either for you or for the families.   If we called the police after we had just completed!
  and in many instances they would be in a position to give that evidence under cross
  examination, there could also be considerable problems there where it could become
  adverserial in terms of complaints against police.

  Mr Fraser - The majority of the families wo n ’t be looking for that problem, there will be
  ®°me,  I think the advance publicity can make it as clear as possible,    on bothsides of
%^/he Pennines, that this is an exercise to give information and not one to

  HMC - This is the draft letter.

,,-i-ir Fraser - Would it be your intention to talk to the press before next week’s meeting?

  HMC - I ’m inclined to say I should tell the press about the meeting and I have drafted
  another press.

  Mr Fraser - Somebody must copy it to the press agency.

  Mr Metcalf - The only thing I would mention from your point of view is that some people
  might phone that number on the second page and be surprised when someone says "W Midlands
  Police".

  HMC - It is going to solicitors apart from those few who are not represented,      I am going
  to do a covering letter to those.

     Fraser - So this is to all those solicitors who have notified you they      represent the
  Jeceased to all organisations who were represented

  Mr Metcalf - Otherbodies who were given representation at the Inquiry.

,r HMC - Do you think you could send me the addresses?

  Mr Fraser - When would you   expect to release this7

  HMC - Tonight if we finish early, we need the addresses        so tomorrow. Idon’t intendto
  send one to each deceased, just one to each firm.     I do intend at some point to have a
  meeting with the press and re-explain a) what we are doing, b) try and pointout that I
  d o n ’t want any more bad press in my Court. I also want to talk with the Social Services.

  Mr Metcalf - I suspect you will get quite a big turn out next week from people, I don’t
  know if there’s scope for extra benches.

  HMC - We w o n ’t have all the families, it will all be solicitors.   I don’t thinkw e ’ll
  have enough     space  next week but I agree with you, I suspect there willbe quite a few
  representatives.

 Mr ..... Can I just confidentially brief you both in terms of the progress of the
 investigation.  That is continuing, 1 saw Mr Metcalf’s eyes raise when I said the final
 submission to the DPP w o n ’t have gone by the time this starts on the 18th.    It w o n ’t be
 long after, I intend to finish it in the Spring and await the DPP’s response. But in
 fairness, it will not be completed, every t crossed and every i dotted until the end of
 this particular process.     Not that this process is anything to do with it, i t ’s just
 simply that other things are going on and that includes interviews which I will be
 talking to you about.   I have had your letter, we d i d n ’t deliberately respond other than
                                                                                             t
 to acknowledge because we wanted to talk about this, bearing in mind your letter came
 about the same time as Miss Steel’s asking very similar questions.

 HMC - Are you content that we should proceed in the way that I have outlined?

     Metcalf - I see no reason why not.

 Mr Fraser - I agree entirely.     There will be one or two problems with this but on balance
    think it’s an excellent idea, primarily from the point of view of the relatives to get
 the information that they have wanted for nearly a year, and also from the lawyers point
 ° £, y ? V' ^here is an added bonus that information will come out, and those few problems
 will be the price we will have to pay for a much larger benefit.

 Mr . P.P P --Without naming any individuals, do you think there would be scope andwould
    be appropriate to take those cases which perhaps could cause greater difficulty
 towards the middle or towards the end, rather than on the first day when all the press
 will be queued up7                                                               v

 Mr Fraser - It depends on the nature of the problem really.

Mr Metcalf - I think it would be usual in most Courts to take shorter cases before longer
ones and if the anticipation is that in some cases there will be a lot of questions the
usual thing would be to list them at the end.

'-lr P . p . - f What you might get is   a lot of the   other families hyped up.

Mr Jones - I think it should be started as a    low key thing and hopefullyit will run that
 /ay  Whereas if you have the world’s press here on the first few days, the disadvantage
It   f «        g6t u    ° f the timetable, 1 think they'll do that anyway. But I agree
the stuff which can be got out of the way without any difficulty should be, so as not to
upset them as individuals.

Mr D . f . f . ' Minimise the trauma really.


?! ” etCa“ "Again, if any cases which are going to cause any particular problems are
last on the list on any given day, then no other family is going to be kept waiting.

HMC - Structure them within the days as well.

Mr Fraser - I would say that there is one particular case I can think of that should be
heard in the morning.

HMC - If you have any views Mr Fraser you must tell me.

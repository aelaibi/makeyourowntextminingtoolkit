                 At      1125 am that date      I commenced moun te d duties                    on Police Horse

                                                                                                 EM 227

included      contingents        from M er se ys id e and N o t ti n gh a m Mounted

Departments.

At   1135/am at the           rear of the S outh S tand            1 was    paired w it h PCV

HINEyjg of N ot ti n gh a m moun te d and        commenced         crowd    control    duties    in the

are a   of the ground.           With PC H INES     I made a tour            of the ground

pointing      out to him        relevant areas      including         entranees and       routes of

approach      by     opposing    fans.

At   1230    pm we        received   instructions    from    Insp H AN D- D AV I S to work         in

the Herries Rd,            Herries Rd South area to encourage N ot ti n gh a m Forest

fans    towards       the ground.        Wit h PC H INES    I carried out these            duties

dealing       w i t h some mi no r i nc: i dents    of f i ghVi ng in Herries Rd but              no

serious       incidents        occurred.     At about   jA - 3 0    pm that   date     a large number

of N o t t ingham Forest         fans a lot of them the worse                 for drink a rr iv ed        in

                    together,    these    fans we re very noisy and boisterous and PC

H IN ES and myself          escor te d them along Herries             Rd South to P e ni st on e Rd

where we ushered them towards                  the turnstiles.             We then    remained    in the

area of the junction wit h Herries Rd S o ut h and P enistone Rd

e nc o ur ag i ng    fans towards      the turnstiles.

So metime after           142# I began hearing       radio messages            to the effect       thai

there were          problems    in the area of L ep pings Ln turnstiles and                     I heard

requests      that additional         manpower     including m ou nt ed officers            be sent

to that area.

I know that PS399 S G R S BY who was              on duty    in P en istone Rd          inst ructed

serveral      moun te d officers         from Pen is to ne Rd to attend              in Leppings Ln

to assist.

I can remember            hearing    radio messajf^y' to the effect             that    people were

being    injured at Leppings             Ln turnstiles      and      I believed       I heard a

request       that a gate        be opened to r e li e v e     the     pressure. I believe        I

heard a       negative       reply.      That, is the gate was not to be               opened.     Some

time after          the    initial   request    for the gate to be opened               I heard the

At about        1445 I received                instructions           from Sgt SORSBY to at te nd
                                               ^ 0-515
Leppings        Ln with P C2472 W H E A T C R Q F T .                I made my way to the Leppings Ln

fans    were     very noisy and seemed to be all                             pushing    towards       the

t urnstiles          there      seemed to be no signs                     of any orderly queuing,                I saw
                                                   y

that a large           concertina gate                 (Cy   i   n a wall      leading     towards      the      south

S tand was       open f ij^ly and              large    numbers           of fans were     streaming

unchecked        through the gate.                 This      gate gives access             to the area at             the

rear    of the West Stand,                     At this time the area was                  packed with

people and           I could see         large     numbers           of    people   entering a tunnel               which

leads under the West S tand to terracing at theyrront                                       of the West Stand.

A   large      number      of fans were           climbing           onto Walls and gates aro un d                  the

turnstiles           and dropping          into the ground,

I went to a point                inside        the outer         ring of gates where            I a t t e m p t e d to

slow down the advance                  of fans towards the turnstiles.                         At this          point

it seemed that             the     pressure       of fans had eased so                 I pulled^y           horse     out

and s t o,<dd near a wire              fence across              from gate C.          Gate ^ / w a s   then

dossed and a number                 of fans were             left standing          outside     it.     It was

clskar they were               not going        to gain entry through that gate so                          I a sked

them to        rejoin the          queues at the t urnstiles w hi ch they did.                              I
                                                                 /
returned to a position                   near     to the/wire              fence and    1 then     received

i nstructions          from      Insp H A ND - D A V ^ S to control             entry of fans t h ro ug h a

go with him to the Pen i st on e Rd area w hich                               I did.      We entered the

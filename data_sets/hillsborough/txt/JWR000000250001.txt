  Miss
  Medical Records Manager,
  NORTHERN GENERAL HOSPITAL NHS TRUST

  Dear

  Re:      consent of Medical Records - Victims of Hillsborough
           Disaster

  I have found a number of requests coming through for release of
  these records.

  I am appalled that despite, my letter, requests have been sent
  to other Consultants in the department for release of such notes.
  I am also concerned that the Admissions Office may have
  transferred the requests from an "Access under Medical Records
  form" onto a form normally used for requests from Solicitors.

  This form states "no legal action intended against the Northern
  General Hospital Trust".   Having read the application from the
  person, I can find that no such assurances have been given.
  While I have no problem with the release of these records given
  proper assurances, I think that the proper procedures should be
  followed.

  This is a time when there is a great                      deal   of   interest   being
  raised in the Hillsborough affair.

  Yours sincerely,



  MR. JIM W A R D R O P E ------------

         I think this document would be more properly handled through the
         normal requests for information for medico-legal purposes rather
         than through Access to Health Records Acts.

            Medical and Nursing Debriefing relating to the Hillsborough Disaster

                                  of 15th April 1989

                   Date of Debriefing   - Wednesday 19th April 1989

                   Chairman             : A C Crosby
                                        : Mrs



Procedure

A medical debriefing was carried out at the Wednesday lunchtime meeting. A
subsequent meeting with senior nurses in the Department was carried ait in Mrs
       s office at 1400.

Major Problems Identified

1. There was little or no ccmmunication frcm the Police or Ambulance Service.
2. The area for intermediate injuries became overcrowded and manoeuvring of
trollies was difficult.
3. When the patients arrived, they arrived all in what seemed to be a single
wave. This appears to result frcm the decision of the Ambulance men at the
ground to take the first wave of patients to a near by hospital and then
transferred the next wave to us.

Minor Problems

1. The large number of volunteer staff.
2. Attempts by the Police and Clerking staff to do full documentation on a
patient who had just arrived instead of giving him a number. This had the effect
of slowing up the reception of patients at the triage point.
3. Insufficient Doctors at the triage point.
4. Failure of medical students to attach themselves to a named Doctor, rather
than attempting to act as Doctors themselves.
5. Overflow B.I.Ds being brough to the A&E Department for certification because
Watery Street was full.
6. The normal hand over procedures for patients being referred to a specialist
team do not seem to work.
7. There appeared to be no co-ordination of relative helpers, although this did
not directly concern the A&E Department at the time of reception of patients.


Reccmnendatian

1. There should be an Ambulance liason officer at the control point in the A&E
Department and he should be in close contact with his colleague frcm the Police.
2. The current minors area of the A&E Department should be redeveloped, removing
the existing cubicles and opening out the available space.
3. There should be additional oxygen and suction points put into the area that
will becane "intermediate injuries" during a major incident.
4. A further five trollies should be purchased and placed on minors in lieu of
the existing examination couches which are not mobile and which were dispensed
with on the day of the disaster.
5. Consideration should be given for the development of a public address system
within the Department. The Consultant in Charge would have overall control of
this system. An alternative means of carmunicating with the Sub-Directors of the
various regions would be by named runner.
6. Large st-ick-on labels bearing the title Doctor, Nurse and Clerical Staff
should be available at the control point and should be handed to those staff who
attached to the Department and to those useful volunteers who present themselves
to the Consultant and Nurse in Charge. Unless a person has such a designated
4
                                  -2-


label he or she could be asked to leave the Department.

7.   The following equipment needs to be purchased
     Twelve portable sphygmernananeters
     Six drip stands
     Twenty arm boards
     Supply of pens for writing and marking on patients skin.

     These would be stored in the Major Accident Cupboard.

8. The spare furniture currently blocking the Transit area should be removed
imnediately. The additional resources that this area represented could not be
easily mobilized on the day of the disaster.



The overall impression was that the Major Accident Plan had worked very well and
comparatively view fine tuning exercises were required. It was felt that one A&E
Department alone in this City could not have dealt with the Hillsborough
Disaster.

     Dear Colleague

     Hillsborough Football Ground Disaster

     Here are some notes I made of the discussion we had on 12 May.   Perhaps you
     could confirm that they are a correct record of the issues and the action we
     need to take.   If there are any aspects that concern you, please give me a
     ring.

      It would seem, now that the collection of evidence has been completed by
      Lord Justice Taylor, that it would be appropriate to have a meeting with the
      police representatives on issues such as communications.

      In the meantime, no doubt the issues that were raised as individual matters
      are being or have been considered as part of the individual unit’s debriefing
      arrangements.

      Yours sincerely

                     HIT.I.SBOROUGH FOOTRAI.T. GROUND DISASTER


         Note of issues discussed at debriefing meeting held at the
  Northern General Hospital on Friday. 12 Mav 1989 with representatives of
       District, the Roval Hallamshire and Northern General Hospitals
                 and the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service


Issue 1       Initiation of Procedure

              It was noted that forewarning could be received from a variety of

              sources, although the police was the most likely.        It was also

              recognized that initiation could be undertaken by any of the

              emergency services but it was considered to be preferable that the

              ambulance service undertook that responsibility.        The question of

              confirmation by the hospital to ensure that the reported incident

              was not a malicious false alarm, was recognised.        However, it was

              also generally agreed that it was better to initiate the

              procedure and then stand down rather than have delay and

              vacillation in the early minutes of notification of an incident.



Issue     2   Communication

              Consideration was given to the question of communications between

              the hospitals, police and ambulance authorities, and the use of

              ‘red’ ex—directory lines between SYMAS and the Accident and

              Emergency Departments.    Having discussed various possibilities,

              the preferred solution, on balance, was the use of the ‘red’ ex­

              directory lines between SYMAS and A and E.         Links with the police

              would continue to be established in accordance with current

              practice.



issue 3 who decides within the hospital that the maior disaster procedure
           is to be put in hand

              It was noted that the Royal Hallamshire Hospital had an internal

              procedure with a medical check, whereas the Northern General


                                         1
            Hospital did not, before activating the procedure through the

            telephonist.    After discussion, it was agreed that the Accident

            and Emergency Department was the central pivot, and switchboard

            operator should set the call out procedure in motion after a check

            by a senior member of the Accident and Emergency Department on

            duty.   It was noted that if the police initiated the procedure,

            including using such terms as ‘standby’, an immediate check would

            be made with the Ambulance Service.



            It was also agreed that if casualties started arriving without

            prior notification, the senior professional member of staff in the

            A and E Department would put the disaster procedure in motion

            immediately.



Issue   4 Distribution   Procedures   for   Iniured   Patients

            4.1 the first receiving hospital would be selected by the

                Ambulance Service and would be dependent on both which

                department was open and ease of access, bearing in mind the

                location of the disaster.



            4.2 The method of diversion of casualties from the first receiving

                hospital was discussed.      It was agreed that the senior doctor

                in the Accident and Emergency Department at the first

                receiving hospital would notify SYMAS when he/she decided that

                further casualties needed to be diverted to another hospital.

                If possible, the second receiving hospital would be notified

                by the first receiving hospital in advance.      Any diversions

                beyond the immediate city hospitals would again be initiated

                through the Ambulance Service.

    Issue 5   Children’s Casualties

              After consideration, it was decided it would not be appropriate to

              change the existing procedures, and children’s casualties,

              eminating from a major disaster, would be taken to the district

              general hospitals.      At the same time, assistance would be sought

              from the Children’s Hospital for any specialist medical and

              nursing help and, at an appropriate time, casualties would be

              transferred to the Children’s Hospital following initial care in

              the district general hospitals.



    Issue 6 Public Radio Messages

              It was agreed that a check needed to be made of the pre-recorded

              messages to be broadcast by local radio in the event of a major

              disaster, informing staff of action which they should take if off

              duty.



    Issue 7 Site Medical Officer and Site Medical Teams

              Consideration was given to the possibility of changing the

               existing procedure.     It was agreed that the existing procedure

               should stand whereby the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service site

              officer would call both for a site medical officer and/or site

              medical teams as he felt necessary.      In the event of such call,

               it was agreed that a senior anaesthetist and senior surgeon

               (consultant or senior registrar) would need to be despatched to

               the scene.   It was noted that the Ambulance Service would

               continue to send a vehicle to transport the site medical officer

               and/or site medical teams to the scene of the incident.




               It was noted that the inquiry being undertaken by Lord Justice


                                          3
           Taylor might well advise on attendance at major sporting events of

           professional emergency teams rather than relying, as at present,

           on sporting organizers making their own arrangements with the Red

           Cars, St John’s Ambulance Service, etc.



Issue 8 What is to be carried bv Site Medical Teams bv wav of Equipment.

           Drugs. Etc?

           Consideration was given to the different arrangements in the

           Northern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals.    The Northern

           General Hospital had assumed that it could well be the second

           receiving hospital and would, therefore, be the most likely

           hospital to be asked to send an emergency team.     Accordingly, it

           planned to carry equipment, drugs, etc, on the ba:sis of treating

           20 casualties, whereas the Royal Hallamshire Hospital worked on

           the basis of sending a mobile team to a single incident as opposed

           to a major disaster.   Mr Hopkins referred to the major disaster

           vehicle standing by at SYMAS which carried substantial equipment

           and supplies which would provide a back-up to any mobile team

           despatched by the hospitals.



           After some discussion, it was agreed that the Accident and

           Emergency consultants would have further discussions between

           themselves and SYMAS as to what equipment would be carried by whom

           to the scene of any major incident.



issue 9 Action bv District and Unit Controls.-

           Consideration was given to the various arrangements which had been

           made at the time of the Hillsborough disaster relating to the




                                    4
function of the Bed Bureau, clearance of beds within hospitals and

links with the press.



The role of the Bed Bureau, in diverting other emergency workloads

away from the hospitals receiving the casualties from a major

disaster, was confirmed.



With regard to clearance of beds, and particularly transfers to

other hospitals to create space in the main receiving hospitals,

the procedure had worked well and any minor re-arrangements would

be considered between the units concerned.



With regard to the press, the importance of gathering information

in one central control, which, it was understood, was the Police

Authority’s responsibility to establish, would be further

considered with the Police, and the possibility of gathering the

information on a computer base at the individual hospitals capable

of transferring information between the hospitals and the Police

Authority, would be considered as a means of expediting a

comprehensive casualty list and condition state for all

appropriate spokesmen to draw upon.



It was decided that, for clarification of the various local

controls in the hospitals and also the Police, Ambulance and Fire

Authorities, the District control role should be reviewed and put

in writing.




                           5
Issue   10   Who   does   what

              Arising from the discussion on the District control role, further

              consideration was given to the role of the police concerning

              enquiries on casualties and the method of providing information to

              the Police.        Secondly, hospital condition checks;   this again

              raised the question of hospital information to be linked and

              transmission of information to relatives’ holding areas.        The

              ease of supply of hospital information, establishing comprehensive

              alphabetical index at individual hospitals and between hospitals,

              was given a further airing.



              It was agreed that clarification would be required on these issues

              and a scheme prepared.



Issue 11 Radio availability and use for Communications

              There was a general feeling that radio communications were not the

              most appropriate or efficient way of proceeding and, whilst

              recognizing that facilities were available at the Royal

              Hallamshire and Northern General Hospitals, it was agreed that

              this matter be given further consideration as part of general

              communications between the hospitals, the Health Authority central

              control, the Ambulance and Police Authorities.



              It was noted that, for certain communication functions within the

              hospitals, runners were more effective than telephone

              communications.




                                            6
Issue   12   Relatives

             Discussion took place on the arrangements which had been made for

             both accommodating and informing relatives, and of the

             arrangements for support staff for counselling, arranging

             accommodation and transport, supplying information, etc.    It was

             agreed that had the incident not occurred on a Saturday, then some

             of the arrangements would not have worked as well in terms of

             accommodation being readily available and, in any case, it was

             noted that more private offices and separate interview rooms were

             needed.



Issue 13 Standard Format of Frontispiece of Maior Disaster Plans

             It was agreed that the two hospitals frontispiece should be a

             common format with common information which would also be

             available to the Ambulance, Police and Fire Authorities, and

             arrangements would be made for such standard format to be

             prepared.



Issue 14 Reception and Control of Volunteers. including Non-Base Hospital
           Staff, (ie staff arriving at a hospital which was not their usual
           place of work)

             It was agreed that whilst volunteers and non ‘base’ hospital staff

             fulfilled a valuable role, a procedure was required to enable the

             most effective use to be made of such persons, including reception

             and direction to appropriate areas of work through the central

             hospital controls.



issue   15   What   i1?

             It was recognized that the experience learned from the

             Hillsborough disaster might be considered atypical in view of the



                                      7
               similarity of the casualties and the non-surgical nature of the

               incident, and it was agreed that consideration should be given

               within the hospitals and on a District-wide basis, on the issues

               which would arise from various other scenarios, eg large numbers

               of surgical casualties, incident happening during the working

               week, etc.



Issue     16   Other

               Various general issues were raised at this time, including the

               need for scanning facilities at the Northern General Hospital, the

               roles of other hospitals in their supporting functions, the number

               of official visitors and timing, and the diverse nature of press

               enquiries, including foreign press.

    requesting that they be put through to Casualty-  The operator receiving the
    call was concerned that the call originated from Hillsborough and not from one
    of the police stations and listened into it, fearing that some problem had
    arisen at the football match.  From the content of the conversation between the
    Police and Casualty, it was clear that the Royal Hallamshire Hospital was on
    standby to receive patients from Hillsborough following a possible Major Accident.
    The Switchboard were not aware of the identity of the Police Officer initiating
    the call which was received at 1 5 . 2 0 h r s .

    The Switchboard were not informed officially of the standby for Majax by either
    the Police or the Accident and Emergency Department.

    At 15-33 hrs Miss       ontacted the bleep board to ask if the Switchboard were
    aware that the hospital was on a Majax.


    Notification of Staff

    Although the Switchboard had not officially be informed of the Majax, again at
    1 5 - 2 0 hrs they received a call from one of the operator's husbands, telling
    them to put the television on immediately as "something bad has happened at
    Hillsborough". Upon seeing the scenes at Hillsborough, and also following the
    call from South Yorkshire Police, the Senior Telephonist used his own initiative
    to telephone three members of the Switchboard staff at home, who live close to
    the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and requested that they report for duty
    immediately.

    The rest of the Switchboard staff, during the next half hour either reported for
    duty without being called, or telephoned first to see if they were needed.

    Because of the immediate media coverage of the disaster, there was insufficient
    time to implement the cascade call out for the Switchboard staff, as the
    majority had either seen or heard of the disaster via the news media, and had
    reported for duty of their own accord.

    Following the notification to the first three telephonists, the Senior
    Telephonist again used his own initiative by notifying key members of the
    hospital staff, that the R.H.H. was on standby for a Majax.

    By this time, Accident and Emergency had requested that all of their Doctors be
    contacted via their long range pagers, and staff from various departments had
    started to telephone the hospital to see if they should report for duty or not.
    The Switchboard had also received several enquries from the press for
    information regarding the "catastrophe at Hillsborough".

    At this time the Switchboard had not been informed officially about the Majax,
    but following the call from Miss       the operators immediately followed their
    instructions for Majax (enclosed).

    It was apparent very quickly that it might not be possible to use the cascade
    system for calling staff, as so many had already either contacted the hospital,
    or started making their own way in, without waiting to be informed.


                                                                                  contd.
-   2   -




All staff were contacted in the order given on the instructions, although, when
bleping staff, the operators could not wait for one person to answer before
bleeping the next.


Enquiries

Before the Majax had been officially declared, the Switchboard started to
receive many calls in connection with the disaster. These calls can be
separated into four categories:

        Relatives and Friends - enquiring about patients. To start with we had no
        information regarding admissions from Hillsborough, so we advised the
        callers to contact the emergency number - Sheffield 570800.

        Press enquiries - these calls were put through to Administration.

        Staff - enquiring whether they could be of help, and whether they should
        report to the hospital or not. - We could only put these calls through to
        their respective departments.

        Public - Offers of help for accommodation for relatives/friends, blood donors,
        voluntary work councilling bereaved relatives, clerical work, switchboard
        work, General Practitioners and other Consultants offering medical help,
        nurses, and many retired N.H.S. workers offering their help.


Recommendations for Switchboard procedure

    1. It is imperative that the Switchboard receives instructions that the Majax
       plan is in operation. Perhaps it could be written into the A & E Majax
       cards that as soon as they receive information concerning a Majax they
       should inform Switchboard immediately utilising one of the emergency
       numbers e.g.     or

    2. A check list should be kept by the operators of all personnel they have
        informed regarding the Majax. This should stop the possibility of anyone
       being overlooked, as many have happened in this instance, due to bleeps not
       being answered for whatever reasons.

    3. It should be stressed that staff should not contact the Switchboard except
        in cases of extreme urgency. All lines into the hospital were engaged
        very quickly, mainly due to R.H.H. staff asking whether they were required
        or not. This not only created extra work, but also contributed to the
        outgoing lines being blocked.

    4. There were insufficient lines to get press    enquiries through to
        Administration, and whilst the calls that   were put through were answered
        immediately, it would have helped to ease   the congestion on the Switchboard
       were more lines to have been utilised for    this purpose.

    5. There were no instructions given to the Switchboard about what should be
        done with offers of help from the public. All that we could do was to
        take names and telephone numbers, together with details of the service
        being offered, and take these notes round to the Social Workers. The
        only exception to this was in the case of people offering to donate blood.
        These callers were given the telephone number of the Blood Transfusion Service,


                                                                                    contd.

    6.        It would have been beneficial had each department informed the Switchboard
              when they had sufficient staff in their respective departments, so that
              any callers could be advised accordingly. This would have helped to keep
              many calls to a minimum duration, again helping to ease the congestion on
              the board.

    7.        There were insufficient lines through to both the Police Incident room and
              also the Social Work Department. In one case the Police Incident phone
              was engaged for ? hour on the same call. It is understood that the Police
              were talking to a police station for the duration of the call and perhaps
              may have been able to use their two-way radios instead of the telephone.
              For the first few hours we had only one extension to put relatives’ calls
              through to the Social Workers. These callers were extremely distressed,
              and due to the lack of any information on admissions at Switchboard for
              several hours, the callers had to wait for the one extension.

    8.        We are not aware of how many lines actually went to the emergency number
              Sheffield 570800, but it is apparent that there were insufficient to deal
              with the amount of callers trying unsuccessfully to get through.

    9.        Several S.T.D. telephones should be made available for relatives trying to
              call home. Again at times the Switchboard was blocked with level 'O' calls
              from people trying to call Liverpool. Unfortunately, most of our outgoing
              lines were blocked, and so we were unable to deal with these calls
              efficiently. Also whilst dealing with these calls the operators were
              unable to deal with incoming calls which again would have helped to
              alleviate the congestion.

    10.       It would have been preferable to have had several more telephone operators
              in the department in order to relieve the tension and stress suffered by
              the operators on duty that day. No-one should work for more than one
              hour under these conditions without having at least some time away from
              the board. It must be noted that whilst ten telephonists reported for
              duty, the rest of the staff had either called in offering their services,
              or remained at home waiting to be contacted. The ones who had called in
              were told not to report as the board was fully manned. No contact was
              made to the others.

           Dear Dr

           May I thank you for your help in the Accident & Emergency Department on the
           afternoon of Saturday 15th April 1989. Though the circumstances of the
           Hillsborough Disaster were a great tragedy, your efforts did much to assist
           the efficient management of the casualties arriving at The Royal Hallamshire
           Hospital. We could hardly have done that without your expertise and swift
           response.

           Yours sincerely

           I am very grateful to you for arranging for me to visit
    the injured in the Northern General and Royal Hallamshire
    hospitals today and for coming personally to accompany me.           I
    know how very busy all the staff in both hospitals have been.
    They have worked with great dedication and professionalism,
    both in the way they have dealt medically with the
    consequences of yesterday's terrible tragedy and also in the
    care and concern which they have so obviously shown to the
    relatives of those who were seriously injured.     You can
    justly be very proud of them.


            I should be grateful if you would pass on my warm thanks
    to those who were involved with the arrangements for my
    visit.

      Dear Mr Crcsby


      Thank you so much for showing me around your Department on Sunday
      the 16th April.                             ^                     •

      I must say that I found you much more likeable than that Scottish
      fellow at the other hospital, Mr Wardrobe or whatever his name was.
      Don't worry, if it canes to an O.B.E., I'll see you right.

  t o provide Dr Ashton with the information t h a t he i s seeking; namely on t h e outcome
  and w e lf a r e of the s p e c t a t o r s t h a t he was inv ol ved with p e r s o n a l l y in the area

  I am anxious t o be as h el p f u l as I can but I do not wish t o impose any unreasonable
  burden on y o u r s e l v e s or your c o l l e a g u e s in S h e f f i e l d . Will you f e e l able t o simply

   Dear Richard

   Dr John Ashton ; Hillsborough

   John Todd has passed me your letter of 22 May 1989. Whilst I should obviously
   want to help with anything you think we should do, I am a little puzzled about
   what is required and, perhaps, what it is needed for. On the face of it, I
   doubt the feasibility of the request.         ^

    Is Dr Ashton interested in those spectators he was involved with? If so, I
    think it would be impossible to identify them. Surely he must appreciate we
    could only trace those he, or others, assisted if he could identify them for


   Clinicians have been studying the progress of the casualties which reached our
   hospitals, of course, and I believe that the incident has thrown up some
   interesting research issues in a clinical context, but I cannot see any
   bearing this would have on any interest Dr Ashton might be expressing given
   the terms of your leter. If I have misinterpreted this I should, of course,
   wish to consult those clinicians who have been concerned at the Northern
   General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals.

   I would be happy to have a word with you
   would help

   Yours sincerely

       IN CONFIDENCE

       To:     Mr J A Wardrope, Consultant in Accident & Emergency, NGH
               Nr A C Crosby, Consultant in Accident & Emergency, RHH

       Dear Mr Crosby

       Hillsborough Tragedy

       I attach, in confidence, copies of an exchange of correspondence I have had
       with Dr Alderslade, the Regional Medical Officer, arising from an approach he
       received some time ago from Dr John Ashton, who is, I understand, an academic
       community physician from Liverpool University who was a spectator at
       Hillsborough.

       You will see that he made an approach regarding the outcome and welfare of the
       spectators he was involved with in the area behind the Leppings Lane terrace.
       I sought some clarification of what he required from Dr Alderslade because, as
       far as I could see, there would be little information which we could usefully
       provide without finding the identity of the individuals concerned and he
       clearly could not identify this for us.

       The more particular point is also made as to whether attempts at the ground to
       prioritise despatch of patients were effective. Apart from the fact that,
       presumably, many casualties were brought away by the Ambulance Service without
       passing through any medically directed sorting area, my impression from our
       de-briefing discussions with you is that we would not be able to trace whether
       particular casualties had acutally been handled by Dr Ashton, or indeed any
       other doctor at the site.

       However, Dr Ashton’s further letter of the 10 July presses me to ask the
       questions of clinical colleagues. I wondered whether you are able to advise me
       accordingly. I shall be away in the next fortnight (as indeed is Dr Todd) but
       would be happy to discuss this with you on my return if you prefer. If the
       matter is as straight forward as it seems to me I think Dr Ashton’s latest
       letter invites us to say so.

       Yours sincerely


       General Manager                       ■

      Dear Mr. Crosbie,

      Re: Hillsborough Disaster Enquiry

      Please find enclosed draft statement in duplicate and I shall be grateful if you
      would carefully read through, and amend and return one copy to me, retaining the
      other copy for your own use. I apologise for the delay in preparing the
      statement but it was considered necessary to draft the statements from all the
      staff and then to compare them for any major discrepancies. There are just one
      or two discepancies and these have been taken up with the individuals concerned.

      I should be grateful if you would confirm your time of arrival at the hospital
      was in fact 3.30, as in speaking to other members of staff it appears you may
      have arrived at the hospital just before that time, at say 3.25. Do you think
      that is possible ? Also, I gather from Kir Baldwin that we now know a mobile team
      was requested by SYMAS and that possibly a, staff nurse took the telephone call.
      This does not appear to have been acted upon but I wonder if you would look very
      carefully at what is drafted in the statement about the mobile team and alter it
      as you consider appropriate.

      Would you kindly note the West Midlands Police, who are investigating the
      disaster, for Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry, have requested copies of the
      statement. Further it appears the statements of any witnesses called to give
      evidence will be copied to the Press. This is quite unusual and it does mean you
      must be sure you are entirely happy with the content and format of the statement.
      Please feel free to alter the statement or add to it if you have remembered any
      more details. I should be grateful if you would then return the statement with
      any amendments as soon as possible, so that I can have it retyped and returned to
      you.

      If you have any queries at all please do not hesitate to telephone or write.

      Yours sincerely

                             STATEM ENT




Alan Courtney Crosby will say as follows



I am a Consultant in Accident & Emergency at the         Royal

Hallamshire Hospital,   Sheffield.      I qualified at

in 1974 and m y qualifications are MB, CHB, FRCS,        Ed.     Iwas

appointed to this post on 6 March 1989, prior to         which I   was

a Senior Registrar at the hospital for five years.



There are two Consultants in the A & E Department, myself and

Mr D G Ferguson who was on sick leave on 15 April.         We work

one week on call,   one w eek off.     I would not normally have

been on call on 15 April, but I was covering for

Mr Ferguson's sick leave.    There is a Senior Registrar in the

Department, Mr M S Hockey,   FRCS,     and he is the first on call.

On Saturday,   15 April there were three Senior House Officers

on duty.    I believe it was a reasonably quiet day with seven

people in the Department.



I was walking in Ecclesall Woods on Saturday afternoon,

15 April.   I had been wal ki ng from about 2.45 pm and was

w alking towards Hunters Bar when m y bleep went off at about

3.12 pm.    I had m y seven year old son with me and we ran to a

telephone box at Hunters Bar.        This took no more than five

minutes.    I telephoned the hospital using the direct Ambulance

emergency line, which was answered by Charge Nurse

      in the A & E Department.        The Charge Nurse told me the

police had telephoned and asked the hospital to be on stand
 by to receive injured people as a stand had collapsed at the

 football ground.     I remember wondering wha t   "stand by" meant;

 if a stand had collapsed then it was likely to be a major

 disaster.    I asked the Charge Nurse for further clarification

but he said he did not have any mor e details.        He confirmed

 again the hospital was on stand by.       I to l d him I would come

to the hospital as soon as I could and in the meantime he

 should also find Mr Hockey,     Senior Registrar.



 I had seen an ambulance and a fire engine going into town.



 I immediately ran with m y seven year old son to _______________

______   Nether Edge, where I knew m y wife was visiting and

would have her car.      This is about half a mile from Hunters

Bar.     When we arrived we all got into the car and m y wife

drove me as quickly as possible to the junction of

Clarkehouse Road and Glossop Road where I left the car and

ran to the A & E Department.       I did not notice any ambulances

as I ran into the Department.       I arrived a little after

3.30 pm.     Nurses wer e clearing trolleys and the part of the

Department which receives minor casualties had been cleared

of patients.     I noticed two policemen in the photocopying

room,    setting up a telephone point as if responding to a

major disaster.     I found Charge Nurse           and asked whether

he had received further confirmation and he indicated he had

not.     I told him we m a y as well wo r k on the assumption that

this was a major disaster and I asked one of the clerical

staff to tell switchboard that I was d eclaring a Major

Disaster.
I made some enquiries of the police, but they were not sure

of the position.    In the p re se nc e of the police officers I

telephoned Jim Wardrope,    Consultant in charge of A & E at the

Northern General.     I tel ep ho n ed his home and was told by his

wife he had already left for the Northern General.          This was

at about 3.40 pm.     By this time the first patient had arrived

at the resuscitation end of the A & E Department.          Mr Hockey

arrived at this stage.     The Major Disaster Plan provides for

the A & E Senior Registrar,    together with the Orthopaedic

Senior Registrar, Orthopaedic Senior House Officer,         and Sister

or Staff Nurse, to assemble at the Orthopaedic Clinic

entrance to triage casualties as they arrive.          The Accident &

Emergency entrance should be closed and all casualties should

pass through the triage point.      M y function in a Major

Disaster is to set up a Control Centre in the A & E

Department to co-ordinate the reception,         assessment and

treatment of casualties and liaise with the medical staff

entering the Department.     I d i d this,    establishing the

Control Centre in the secretarial office.          I recall having to

unlock various doors,    for example to the secretary's office

and the back door of the Department.          I handed out the Major

Disaster notices which are pr ep a r e d ready in Mr Ferguson's

secretary's office.     The next thing I remember was meeting

Mr Daly, Consultant Phsyician,     as he was about to leave the

hospital,   unaware of the situation.        This was about 3.50 pm.

I told him a Major Disaster had been called and he indicated

he would immediately return to the medical wards to clear

beds.   By this stage the De pa rtment had received two

patients.
Some moments later Professor A G Johnson, Professor of

Surgery, and Dr D L Edbrooke,            Consultant Anaesthetist,   arrived

in the Department and I directed them to intermediate and

resuscitation areas respectively.



A large number of medical staff of intermediate grades began

to arrive over the next twenty to thirty minutes and I

distributed them around the Department in accordance with

their experience.



At about this time Mr Hockey began to receive m ore injured at

the triage point.          This was about 4.20 pm.      Ambulances were

bringing casualties to the usual A & E entrance rather than

the Orthopaedic Department entrance and I therefore

despatched an SHO to direct the ambulances.



There was a rush of casualties arriving at the Department

between 4.20 and 5.00 pm.             These were dealt with and

discharged or admitted as required.              I recall the first or

second patient to arrive in the Department had d i e d and his

b ody was placed in the temporary mortuary (the Orthopaedic

Seminar Room) and the door locked.



Mr Hockey continued to triage patients and I did not become

involved with this.          However,    I was aware of the nature of

the injuries and the one fatality.             I could not tie together

Charge Nurse               s account that a stand had collapsed at

the football ground with the small number of potential

orthopaedic c a s u a l t i e s .   Most of the casualties a p peared to
have been crushed and i thought perhaps there had been a

stampede.   I did not examine or speak to any patients in

depth.



There were more than enough medical and nursing staff to

handle the influx of casualties.



After about 5.00 pm the flow of patients dried up and there

then came a rumour that we were expected to take the transfer

of up to forty dead bodies from the football ground,    for

storage in our temporary mortuary.    Sister            who was

situated at the triage point had been given to understand

this was to happen and she had pa ssed the message on to me.

In fact the bodies never arrived and there was no

communication from SYMAS.   Eventually I telephoned the Medico

Legal Centre and a woman on duty there tol d me the Centre had

sufficient capacity to make the transfer to the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital unnecessary.



By the late afternoon,   I had spoken with medical witnesses

who had come up to the hospital from the football ground and

I learnt from them that about seventy five people had died.



At about 6.30 pm I informed Ambulance Control in Rotherham

that we were in a position to take routine emergency 999

calls.   I made it known in the Department at about 6.50 pm

that I was declaring the Major Disaster over and I despatched

nursing and medical staff around the Department to thank

volunteers for their efforts and to let the m know they could
return home.    Until then people had been lingering in the

Department.    At about 7.00 pm, by prior arrangement,      I met

with Mr D Baldwin, Unit General Manager,     and Dr D R Perks,

Chairman of the Medical Staff Committee,     and together we

toured the hospital wards to take stock of the number of

admissions and their disposition within the hospital.        G2 is

the w a r d designated to receive patients from a M aj or

Disaster.     It is normally an ENT ward.   It appeared that

wards K2 and LI had also taken patients.      I understood there

were also some transfers to the Intensive Care Unit.        The

majority of patients were not seriously injured and most had

been admitted for observation only.     I understood at that

stage that eighty patients had pa ssed through the Department

that afternoon,   of which twent y five had been admitted and

only one had needed intensive care.     This information was

available to me at about 8.00 pm.     Throughout the afternoon I

had no communication with SYMAS,    until an Ambulance Liaison

Officer appeared after 5.00 pm.     It would have been useful to

have had forewarning of the nature of the injuries to be

expected, an accurate assessment of the nature of the

incident, an estimated time of arrival of the next batch of

seriously injured patients,    an estimate of the number of

patients,   and it would also have been helpful to let SYMAS

know of the hospital's disposition.     I believe the Ambulance

Liaison Officer was assis ti ng in the transfer of patients out

of the hospital from the Medical School entrance.       I did not

see a Senior Ambulance Officer.     The police liaison were

visible but I did not have muc h contact with them.
The most useful information I received d u r in g the afternoon

was from Jim Wardrope at the Northern General Hospital.       I

think I made direct contact wit h him on the Department's tie

line at about 4.30 p m when the Department was very busy

receiving patients.     He confirmed to me he did not want any

assistance but asked if I could contact the Neurosurgical

Registrar and request he attend the Northern General

Hospital.   Mr Wardrope confirmed a number of people were

being ventilated and that there ma y be some head injuries.       I

despatched a Senior House Officer to find the Neurosurgical

Registrar and I understand he went to the Northern General.

I believe there were some transfers later in the afternoon

from the Northern General.     Mr Wardrope also confirmed he had

requested SYMAS to divert cases to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.



I met with the press in the Boardroom for a press conference

where I gave purely factual information.



During the afternoon there had been no request to me for a

mobile team to attend the ground.     Normally Ambulance Control

would request a mo bile team directly to the Department, via

the emergency telephone.     I had ensured that appropriate

equipment had been assembled by the resuscitation end door

and I believe there would have been more than enough staff

to send two teams,    each comprising a Surgeon, Anaesthetist

and a trained nurse.



I spent most of the afternoon b etween the Orthopaedic
entrance and the major casualty part of the Department.       From

there I had a good vie w of what was happening within the

Department and was therefore able to co-ordinate the

Department's response to the disaster.



M y day ended at about 10.00 p m w he n the Department was closed

(it normally closes at 9.00 p m on Saturdays).     By that time

everything was very quiet.     I do not recall there b ei ng any

relatives as they were gathered in a separate part of the

hospital.

Slides                        Comment


Hillsborough 2.59            Disasters ccme in two groups. There are those in which it
                             is obvious frcm the outset there has been a disaster as in
                    k        tin.) iii I nf 11m Tfagjfnrt-h Air Prnnh But there are others in
                             which the beginning of disaster is hard to define at the
                             time. A wisp of smoke, the faint rumble of ice along the
                             side of a ship, the s«rge of a crowd known for its
                             boisterous nature. In retrospect, we see that it was here
                             at the beginning that communications had their first impact
                             on events. The faulty alarm, the radio messages that never
                             reached the bridge, the inability to control a crowd all
                             result in delay in transfer of information which first
                             precipitates then compounds a tragedy.

                              This slide shows

                              1.   Crowded conditions (count heads).
                              2.   Gravitation of Police Officers towards the scene.
                              3.   The time.
                                   Gate C was opened 7 minutes ago.
                                   The Police have changed radio channels once after a 2
                                   minute canmunication break between control and the
                                   ground.
                                   Seme 2,000 fans have walked into the ground heading
                                   straight for the already congested stands.

                              In the deafening noise of chanting and shouting many Police
                              Officers do not immediately react to the cries for help, but
                              at Gate 3 which opens onto the pitch a Policeman is now
                              alive to the crisis. He radios to the control rocm for
                              permission to open the gate.
                              He does not receive a reply.
                              No one in control has noticed over crowding. He opens the
                              gate anyway. Already it is too late for seme.


Barrier in Pen 3              At 3.04 pm a barrier fails in the crowd. Across the field
                              the game continues to joyous shouting. Across the front of
                              two terrace pens, 95 people are dying.

                              The Ground Superintendent tries to radio for the match to be
                              stopped. His message is not received so he stops the game
                              himself at 3.05f pm in the afternoon. Rescue work begins
                              with bodies piled on the ground and outside the access
                              tunnel.
                               THE HTTJfiBOROOGH DIASTER

The Medical Reponse

Mr Chairman, ladies and gentleman. Thank you for the opportunity to take part in
this symposium.


Slide 1 - THE SHKFFIKU) HUiLSBOROOGH DISASTER - the medical response.

        The Hillsborough Tragedy affected the whole of the Sheffield cannunity.
We just happen to be the spokesman today for the whole staff of the Northern
General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals, and deserve no special credit.


S lide 2 - The Gate
        Saturday the 15th of April was a fine sunny day perfect for taking the
kids to the park, mewing the lawn or going to a football match.

        I          have never been to a live football match and the lack of a television is
a great handicap to armchair sportswatching. So while I was mowing the lawn I was
unaware that 45 thousand people were assembling at Hillsborough football ground to
witness the F.A. Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

         The kick off was at 15.00 hours.

        Six minutes later the match was stopped because of crowd trouble and a
possible pitch invasion. Few people realised that they were witnessing Britains
worst sporting disaster.


S lide 3 - Leppings lan e T erraces
        The disturbance occurredliehind the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the
ground which had been allocated to Liverpool fans.

        It took sane time for even people at the ground to realise that anything
serious was happening. For example, sane time after the match was stopped a
doctor in the main stand took his family hane to avoid involving them in a riot,
not realising that his skills may be required.


S lide 4 - Gates

        It is cannon knowledge that the incident at the ground involved the
opening of these gates allowing a surge through a tunnel vtfiich sloped down onto
the terraces.


S lid e 5 - 9 5 Dead
         95 people eventually died


S lid e 6 - Fencing
        Just over half were thought to have died behind this fence on the
terraces.
                                 -2-


S lide 7 - Tunnel
          And just under half were thought to have been trampled to death in this
tunnel.


S lid e 8 - Broken B arrier
          Only one barrier actually gave way under the pressure.   The rest held.


S lide 9 - Bent B arrier
        But sane bent as shewn in this slide.    Sane injuries were related to the
barriers.

        People were trapped behind the fences as seen in the widely published
press photographs. There were gruesane descriptions of people being pushed
through the fence like a chip cutter. No injuries of this type were seen in the
hospitals. And although the post-roortem findings have not yet been made public I
believe no injuries of this severity were found on the bodies.


S lide 10 - Fence
          Sane people escaped over the fence.


S lide 11 - Door 3
          Sane got out through this door when it was eventually unlocked.


S lide 12 - Cut Fence
        Others escaped when the fire service cut the fencing to release both
living and dead.


S lide 13 - Ju d icial Enquiry
        We need to remind you that the Hillsborough Tragedy is still the subject
of a judicial enquiry.

        We therefore feel constrained, on the advice of the hospitals legal
advisors, not to discuss publically certain aspects of the Emergency services
response. No doubt we will all hear the results of Lord Justice Taylors
investigations in due course.

S lid e 14 - Blank
          The first evacuees were taken to the Northern General Hospital.

        Mr Jim Wardrppe who is the A&E Consultant there will now give an account
of their response.
S lid e 1 - Royal H allam shire H ospital Accident & Emergency
            15.37 C onsultant arriv ed
            15.40 2 p a tie n ts
           Dead       Dncchscious
           15.42 S.R. arriv ed

        At 15.37, thirty minutes after the onset of the incident the A&E
Consultant on call arrived in the department where preparation for a major
incident was underway. (NB. DGF in bed)

         Seven patients in the waiting area were discharged.

         The normal A&E staff for a Saturday afternoon were present.

        At 15.40, 2 patients arrived. One was dead on arrival. The second was
unconscious, unresponsive but cardiovascularly stable and hyperventilating. He
was externally normal. After a chest x-ray which looked normal he was intubated
and sent to the I.T.U. He proved to be the most severely brain damaged of the
survivors and is still unconscious.

        At 15.42 I arrived fresh fran mewing the grass. Having established that
the major incident was fully operational. I proceeded to the triage point. I knew
this was my job but was not sure how to do it and had never been trained.
Fortunately there was a prolonged hiatus - I re-read the manual.


S lid e 2 - Prolonged H iatus
        During this time large numbers of hospital staff of all types descended orf
the department, plus G.Ps who had previously worked there. The A&E nurses were
called out using a supply of 10 p pieces and the public phones in the department.
An attempt to do this with A&E staff resulted in none being contactable but all
except one appeared in the department before the majority of patients arrived.

        The media coverage resulted in the hospital switch board being jammed.
This is not unusual - but this time it was by our own medical and nursing staff
phoning in to see if they were needed. This made the paging system difficult but
in the everitunnecessary.

        One particular problem affected me. I was due to be triaging along with
the on-call SR in Orthopaedics who appeared just as the last patient was seen.

        The system allowed for the Orthopaedic SHO to be bleeped early and for him
or her to call all the other team. The SHO was on leave and cover by the
Registrar. This was forgotten at the time and the failure of the SHO to reply was
not noted - so none of the on-call orthopaedic team were informed.


S lid e 3 - Ward P reparation
        The designated receiving ward was the ENT ward.      This was cleared by
transfer and discharge.

        The Professor of Surgery and a Consultant Physician happened to be in the
hospital anyway - not an event Ladbrookes would have given short odds on I They
cleared 45 beds between them very quickly.
s i iA» 4 -    16.00 - Fully     prepared - m ultiple s ta f f in p o sitio n
               16.05 - 17.05     - 66 p a tie n ts
                       17.45     - 3 more
               18.15             - A&E cleared

          Therefore when the next batch of patients arrived the A&E was fully
staffed and the wards were prepared.

          So at 16.05, one hour after the onset of the incident. The
department was suddenly deluged with patients. 66 arrived in the next hour,
then the flood stopped and 3 more tricked in by 17.45.

              The department was cleared and ready to function normally by 18.15,
just over       three hours frcm the onset of the disaster.

          None of the patients received after 16.05 required resuscitation.
All were fully conscious and frightened. Many complained of abdaninal pain
and difficulty breathing. The majority were walking wounded.

              TOTAL           70
          We do not know how many were triaged to each of the 3 areas. One
was dead on arrival and went to the temporary mortuary in the department.
None after the first unconscious patient went to resuscitation.

          Approximately 40 were walking wounded and 30 were designated
moderately injured. This corresponds to 24 admitted and 45 discharged.

          Of those admitted 8 were suspected intra abdominal injuries, one ofwhich
had a respiratory arrest with spontaneous recovery. None requiredsurgery and all t-
fully recovered.

              8 complained of a crushed chest. One had been revived by CPR at the scene.
Except the unconscious patient already described no others proved: to have serious
injuries.

              2 were inebriated,
              1 policeman had his head jumped on
              2 had broken arms - one went to theatre the next day.
          3 had neuropraxias - 2 Brachial plexus traction injuries trying to hold
onto barriers. 1 was a lateral cutaneous name of the thigh frcm barrier pressure.
          None were underdiagnosed.
          But patients went to several wards - hand over did not take place as
orthopaedic patients.

          No lacerations seen

          45 were discharged
          32 had minor bruising and grazes requiring no treatment.
          3 had minor head injuries
          1 had a fractured ankle which was potted.
          2 had neurcpraxias a* second L.C.N. and a posterior interosseous nerve.
          7 had no detectable injury.
          Many appeared emotionally shocked by the experience and this element has
yet to be assessed.


Slide 8 - Ncn-Disaster Patient

          During this one patient arrived with a potentially serious injury unrelated
to Hillsborough, he did not cane through the triage point but was correctly treated
initially. Without definitive medical advice he appeared to have been discharged.
He returned the following day with marked and potentially serious progression of his
symptoms.


Slide 9 - Social Workers Adninistrators

          The A&E work was all over in 3 hours. The theatre and orthopaedic and
surgical staff had little further to do. The Anaesthetic staff worked hard in the
I.T.U. for several days.

          However the hospital administrators, social workers and outpatient nursing
staff worked hardest of all for 48 to 72 hours taking phone calls from potentially
bereaved relatives and counselling the bereaved. All of vAiich was emotionally
exhausting. They deserve a great deal of credit.


Slide 10 - Lessens learned

          Mr Wardrcpe will now discuss the lessons learned.

Mr

SHEFFIEID



Dear

Thank you for your letter of the 22nd February which Administration have
passed on to roe. For the purposes of informing the Police Insurance, I can
confirm that you attended the A&E Department of the Royal Hallamshire
Hospital at 1735 on the 16th April 1989.

The doctor who saw you has recorded that you had pain in the right side of
your chest as a result of being crushed against turnstiles at Hillsborough.
On examination there was tenderness in the middle 4th rib area. An x-ray
did not show any rib fracture and you were discharged fran the Department.
I hope this will be of sane help.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough Disaster

Number:

As a result of the difficulties at Hillsborough, I was treated in your
Hospital.    I was diagnosed as having broken ribs after being X-Rayed.    I
am now asked to forward a Report to the Police Insurers of the treatment I
received at the Hospital.       Perhaps you could let me have a note the
treatment given to me and the diagnosis.    If there is a fee to be paid for
this do let me know and I will pay it.

Yours faithfully.

                                    15 APRIL 1989

                                       IN T E R IM R E PO R T OF INQUIRY


                                                 IN T RO D U C TIO N

  1  On 15 April 1989 a football match to decide a semi-final round of the FA Cup competition was to be
 la^ed between the Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Clubs. The neutral venue chosen was Hillsborough
Football Stadium. Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. Only six minutes into the game, play was stopped when it
was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. In the result.
95 died a n d over 400 received hospital treatment.
   1   On 17 April 1989 I was appointed by you to carry out an Inquiry with the following terms o f reference:

       To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football ground on 15 Aprii 1989 and to make
       recom m endations about the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports events.

  3     Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: Mr Brian Johnson QPM. Chief Constable o f Lancashire,
and Professor Leonard M aunder OBE. BSc. PhD. ScD. FEng. FI Mech E. Professor o f -Mechanical
Engineering at the University o f Newcastle upon Tyne. Their help has been invaluable and I am very grateful
for their ex pen advice and wise counsels. While the sole responsibility for this report is mine. I am comforted
in the knowledge that both .Assessors agree with it.

   4. M r Robert Whalley was appointed Secretary to the Inquiry. He and his assistants have worked
 prodigiously and skilfully to give me all the advice and support I could have wished. I also wish to acknowledge
 the help I have received, as always, from my clerk. Mr Ernest Pott.

    5. T he policing arrangements for 15 April were in the hands of the South Yorkshire Constabulary. The
 efficacy o f those arrangem ents and their im plem entation was from an early stage called into question. It was
 therefore decided that the investigation o f the disaster and the gathering o f evidence for this Inquiry should be
 conducted by an independent police force. M r Geoffrey Dear QPM. Chief Constable of West Midlands
 Constabulary, undertook this task. He was m ade responsible directly to me: he appointed Assistant Chief
 Constable Mervyn Jones to take full-time charge o f the investigation. I am deeply indebted to both o f them.

   6 . O n 18 April I visited Hillsborough Stadium . I inspected the scene of the disaster on the terraces and all
 relevant parts o f the stadium and its approaches. My Assessors and I have made further visits during the
 Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool on 21 and 29 April.

    7. T he Lord M ayor and the Sheffield City Council kindly offered to make the accommodation and facilities
 of Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing o f oral evidence. This offer was gratefully accepted and I would
 like to record my thanks for those facilities and for the co-operation afforded to the Inquiry by the authorities
 in Sheffield.
     8 . On 28 April 1989,1 held a preliminary hearing to announce the date when the oral evidence would begm.
 •to give some directions as to the procedure I intended to follow and to hear applications from those wishing to
  be represented at the hearing. I accorded representation to the following:
         (i)  Those bereaved or injured as a result of the disaster.
        (ii) The Football Supporters’ Association.
        (iii) The Football Association.
        (iv)  Sheffield City Council.
        (v)   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club together with the Football League, the C u b ’s casual staff and
              their insurers, the Sun Alliance.
        (vi) South Yorkshire Constabulary.
        (vii) South Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority.
I
    Subsequently, during the hearing. I further accorded representation to:
         (via) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service
               (SYMAS).
    and (ix) D r W Eastwood, consultant engince rto Sheffield Wednesday Football Q ab.

      9. Since the circumstances o f the disaster raised urgent questions of safety, especially at football grounds,
    you indicated at the outset that you would welcome any recommendations, even of an interim nature, which I
    might be able to give in advance o f the new football season due to commence in mid-August 1989.1 therefore
    announced at the preliminary hearing on 23 April that I would conduct an oral hearing with all possible
    expedition as the first phase o f the Inquiry to discover the facis and causes o f the disaster and ena'oie r.e to
    make any im m ediate interim recom m endations necessary in the short term.

       10. The West M idlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A ■‘Freephone" number was advertised to
    enable members o f the public, especially those who had attended the match, to offer their evidence :o the
    Inquiry. Initially this num ber was available for three days on 28 different lines. Tne response from the public
    was such that the lines were continued for a further three days by the end of which 2 . 6 6 6 calls had been
    received There were also many written offers o f help. Some 440 West Midlands officers were deploved cn the
    Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in Birmingham. Liverpool and
    Sheffield and com puter technology was used to the full. In all some 3776 statements were taken. Tnere were
    also some 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry and to me personally all of which I read. Tne poiice,
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the BBC had video cameras fuming at the ground on 15 April. In
    aggregate, they recorded some 71 hours o f film covering the period before, during and after the disaster. Tnus
    the material gathered and potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enormous. From this
    mass it was essential to select only sufficient good and reliable evidence necessary to establish the facs and
    causes o f the disaster.

       11. Where it seemed likely that any allegation or criticism might be made o f the conduct o f any person or
    party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned
    setting out the likely grounds for complaint. This followed the practice established by the Royal Commission
    on Tribunals of Inquiry (the Salmon Commission).

      12. T he hearing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding on 29 June. In
    that period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel’s submissions were delivered in w ritin g on 7 Juiy and
    on 14 July I heard their brief oral submissions supplementing the written argument.

      13. Witnesses were not sworn. Since this is a depanm ental inquiry, there was no power to administer the
    oath but there was no instance o f any witness giving evidence which 1 considered might have been different
    had he or she been sworn.

       14. T he witnesses called were only a small fraction of those from whom statements were or could have been
    taken. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that they were sufficient in number and reliability to enable me to reach the
    necessary conclusions. To have called more would have prevented me from presenting an interim report in the
    required time and would not have added significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been aole to
    take into account m any written statem ents in addition to oral testimony..

       15. A p a n from the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry which was drawn from statements taken by
    the West M idlands Police and others volunteered by individuals, each of the represented parties was given full
    opportunity to put forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final submission was made by
    Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police that since the investigation by West Midlands Police is still continuing,
    all the evidence has not been assembled and it would be unsafe for me-to make findings of fact. I should
    therefore make clear that the investigation continues principally to furnish as much detail as possible to HM
    Coroner for the City of Sheffield as to the cause o f death, the precise position at death and the care and
    movement of each o f the 95 victims individually. I am assured by Chief Constable Dear and Assistant Chief
    Constable Mervyn Jones that it is most unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter or add to
    the history o f events which emerged at the hearing.

      16. I should like to thank all those who m ade it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
    event and for evidence to be efficiently presented and tested so as to give a full and fair account of what
    happened in all its aspects without irrelevancy or duplication. I pay tribute particularly to the West Midlands
    Police for their speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to ail those responsible for processing it.
T he m ost eloquent tribute to the fairness and thoroughness of the police investigation came from the Secretary
o f the Football Supporters’ Association. He said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to whether that
investigation would be fair and objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness statements
th e m se lv e s. Having heard the opening statem ent by Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered
bv the police, he found that it accorded entirely with his Association’s evidence and the initial anxiety was
wholly dispelled.

   17. Before and during the Inquiry I derived great assistance on a wide range of technical issues from the
Health and Safety Executive who providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research and Laboratory
Services Division) where tests were conducted and reports prepared swiftly and efficiently. This was done
in close consultation with Professor Maunder. I am most grateful to the Director. Dr A Jones, and to the
Deputy Director. D r C E Nicholson, for th eir invaluable help.

  18. I wish to com m end Counsel to the inquiry, M r Andrew Collins QC. Mr .Man Goldsack and Mr
Bernard Phillips for their industry, care and fairness in selecting and presenting the necessary evidence: also.
Counsel for all those represented who tested that evidence fully but expeditiously. This Interim Report could
not possibly have been prepared in so shore a time had I not had the whole-hearted co-operation o f all those
m entioned and many others.

     19. T he second phase of the Inquiry will be directed to making final aria long term recommendations about
  crowd control and safety at sports grounds. I need to consider in depth information, opinions and arguments
  from a wide range o f sources and contributors both here and abroad. It was clear from the outset that this
  second phase could not be carried to completion before the next football season. However, at an eariv stage of
  the oral hearing I invited evidence from all who wished to contribute to it and specifically from many sporting,
' local authority, emergency service and police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked that submissions
  should be in writing and should be m ade promptly so that the second phase o f the Inquiry could
  follow im mediately after the first. I shall now proceed to consider the large body of written evidence which has
  b een subm itted. I shall want in some instances to have further oral evidence or discission in conjunction with
  my Assessors. We will also need to make a num ber o f visits and inspections.

   20. I now present my Interim Report and Recommendations. I shall prepare my Final Report and
 Recom m endations as soon as reasonably possible.

                                                  CHAPTER 1

                         T H E G R O U N D AND PRE-M ATCH ARRANGEMENTS

Fixing The Venue
  21. On 20 March 1989. the Football .Association (the FA) requested that their Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and N ottingham Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium. The corresponding
semi-final between the same two teams had been held there in April 1988. The arrangements had been
successful in the view both of the police and of the host club. Sheffield Wednesday (the Club) were therefore
willing to accom m odate the 1989 match. South Yorkshire Constabulary were prepared to police it but oniy if
the ticketing arrangements were the same as those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
Those arrangements did not please Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989. They thought the ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirement was
accepted and the m atch was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

The Ground.
  22. The Hillsborough Stadium is some 2:^ miles to the north-west of central Sheffield in the district of
Owlerton. The ground was opened in 1399 on what was then a greenfield site by the river Don. The pitch iiss
roughly east to west. A plan of the ground and its immediate environs is at Appendix 1.

  23. The west end. with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. Tr.e
east end abuts on Penistone Road, the A 6 1. To the south is the river Don and to the north a residential street.
Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North.

   24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving acccss to the south stand, to the Directors' and players’
entrances, and to the adm inistrative block under the stand. Tne roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
access between Penistone Road and Lsppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut it otTat each end. There
is some car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players and employees o f the Club. Tne south
stand dates from 1914 and is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with'places for S.300. 5.500 o f those are
roofed over and 3.300 are uncovered.

  25. The north stand is also all seating and accommodates about 9.700. Behind it is a gymnasium or sports
hall. There are also a first aid room and police room close by.

  26. The east end is all terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged and roofed over in 1986 and
now accommodates som e 21.000 standing spectators. Tnere are crush barriers in the Kop running parallel :o
the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free movement from side to side.

   27. At the west or Leppings Lane end o f the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
stand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 for World Cup matches, some of which were held
at Hillsborough in 1966. The covered stand accommodates 4.456 seated spectators. The terracing in front of it
extends higher in the com ers between the stands and its total capacity was stated to be 10.100. At both the Kop
end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by perimeter fencing. The fencing is about eight feet high
m ounted upon the low wall at the Foot o f the terracing. At the top of the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
angle for some 15 inches to make it difficult for anyone to climb over towards the pitch. Tnere are gates at
intervals along the perim eter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. These gates are less than a
metre wide and were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
They are marked and num bered on the plan Appendix 1.

  28. Unlike the Kop end. the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radial
fences at right angles to iu dividing the area into pens. This division w-as begun after an FA Cup semi-final in
1981 when crushing occurred due to overcrowding and gates had to be opened. It proceeded in stages, the final
arrangement being shown on the plan Appendix 1. The first section of the west terracing moving south to north
contains gates 1 and 2 and is known as pens 1 and 2 although in fact constituting only one pen. Next is pen 3
with one gate: next pen 4 with one gate: pen 5. which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
divide pen 4 from pen 6 . This was to isolate home and away fans on occasions when both might be
accommodaied on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west comer. Pens 5. 6
and 7 each have a perim eter gate. At the back of the pens, under the front of the west stand, there is a gate in-
each radial fence. W hen those gates are open, the back row-of the terracing is intended to permit access from
pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial numbers are present- those gateways are not
readilv visible or accessible. The present layout o f the pens, fences, crush barriers and gates has resulted from a
s e r i e s o f piecemeal changes. The nature and effect o f those changes must be considered later.


T h e Turnstiles
   29. Because of the housing fn Vere Road there is no access from the north side o f the ground. Alcng
Penistone Road N o rth there are some 46 turnstiles which usually gjve access both to the Kop and to the east
end of the north stand. They are marked 43 to 8 8 inclusive on the plan. Tne 12 numbered 77 to 38 are designed
to feed the north stand but were not used for that purpose on 15 April in order to segregate supporters of :he
two te a m s as appears later. Two o f them. 77 and 73. were however used for access to the Kop.

  30. At the south side of the ground there were 2-1 turnstiles (numbered 19 to 42 on ;he plan). Those
num bered 37 to 42 led to the Kop and the rest to the south stand.

  31. In summary, the south and east sides o f the ground accommodated some 29.300 whose access on the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. The other rwo sides of the ground, north and west, with a capacity o f 24.256 were fed solely from :he
Leppings Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the Ground
  33. M ost supporters were expected to come by road although rail transport was available. Nottingham
su p p o rten trav ellin g by train would arrive at the m ain line Sheffield Midland Station whence they wouic be
directed an d escorted northwards by the police. They would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
N ottingham supporters travelling by coach, mini-bus or car would approach Sheffield from the south mainly
on the M I . Again their arrival at the ground would predominantly be via Penistone Road or Herries R oad

   34. Liverpool supporters travelling by normal rail service would arrive at Sheffield Midland Staiion just
like their N ottingham counterparts. The police aim ed to segregate the rival fans and put them into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail sta’.ion
catering solely for football supporters and situated to the north o f the ground. A police escort was available to
conduct them on foot to the-Leppings Lane entrance. Those coming from Liverpool by road would approach
Sheffield either via the M62 and down the M 1 from the north or across the Pennines from the north west. All
such routes would bring them to the ground via one or other limb o f Leppings Lane as shown on Appendix 1.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west: arrivals from Nottingham
would be from the south and east.

 Allocation of Places and Tickets
    35. Experience in recent years has produced a policy o f segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
 o f rival teams. T he need for this policy to be m aintained was endorsed and emphasised by the Popplewell
 Report following the Bradford City disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 semi-final the police decided
 that sections o f the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation of
 Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans. The section to be granted to each was determined by the direction
 whence each predominantly approached. Thus. Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides of the ground
 for which access was from Leppings Lane. Nottingham Forest were allotted the south and east sides with access
 from Penistone Road.

     36. T h e effect o f the decision was that for this all-ticket Cup Tie. Liverpool were allotted only 24.25 6 places
  as against 29.800 for Nottingham Forest. This, although average attendance of supporters at home matches
 was substantially higher at Liverpool than at Nottingham. Moreover, with standing tickets at £ 6 and seats at
  £12. N ottingham Forest had 21.000 standing places compared with Liverpool's 10.100. So. Liverpool’s
  allocation was more expensive as well as smaller. Understandably, Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
  o f places and tickets. They sought with some support from the host club and the FA to have it changed in
  1988. but the police were adam ant. To switch ends would, in their opinion, have involved rival supporters
  crossing each other's paths when approaching the ground thereby frustrating attempts at segregation and
  creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989. when the same plan was proposed. Liverpool again challenged it. The
  police, however, m aintained their view, adding that those who had attended in 1988 would be familiar with the
- arrangem ents and that any change would lead to contusion.
I
    Access from Leppings Lane
       37. As the plan Appendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck or forecourt at
    a bend in Leppings Lane where, coming from the north, it turns to the south-west and crosses a bridge over the
    river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north and west o f the ground. They
    were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs of Leppings Lane and would converge on the
    forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line o f railings with six sets o f double gates. Inside
    those perim eter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles. ,As shown in the photographs Appendix 2. the
    latter are in two sections divided by a fence. The northern section consists o f turnstiles 1 to 16. Numbers 1 to
     10 gave access to the north stand. Thus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9.700 with north stand seats. Their
    tickets were marked “ Entrance A" and were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
    letter A above them and brown boards on the wall.

       38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in the west stand. Thus 4.456 were served by six turnstiles.
    They were the next block to the right o f those marked A. However, instead o f these turnstiles and the west stand
    tickets being marked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were marked C. Their colour-code on
    tickets and boards was red.

       39. On the other side of the dividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
    10.100 with tickets for the west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. This was because there
    had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential numbering continued from 19 upwards
    on the south side o f the ground. When the number at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the present
    arrangements o f 1 to 1-6. A to G ’and then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-numbering all round the ground.
    However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. “Entrance B” also appeared on tickets for the west
    terrace. Thus, the three blocks o f turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane end read from
    left to right A. C. B. The colour-code for west terrace tickets and the boards beside turnstiles A to G was mauve.
    To the right of turnstile G is a tubular steel barrier to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadway to the
    south stand.

    Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
      40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. There is an exit gate (marked A
    on Appendix 1) between turnstile 1 and the adjacent housing.

      41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7 and the steps to the west stand. There is a
    wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It had been built to segregate home and away fans at a
    lime when the Club intended they should share the west terrace. That idea was not pursued but the wall
    remained. There was. however, a gateway in the wall which did permit access between the two areas. An exit
    gate (marked B on Appendix 1) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

      42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse bounded on the left by the wall just
    mentioned and on the right by the wall of the private roadway coming from the south stand to Leppings Lane.
    There was an exit gate in the latter wall (marked C on Appendix 1) just inside turnstile G-

      43. All three exit gates. A. B and C. were o f concertina design. They could be opened only from the inside
    and were not intended for entry of spectators into the ground.

      44. Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could by
    moving to the right go round the south end of the west stand and gain entry into pens 1 and 2. They could go
    through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles 1 1 to 16 and then round the north
    end of the west stand into pens 6 or 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either of
    those courses. The obvious way in was straight ahead of the turnstiles where a tunnel under the middle of the
    west stand gave access to pens 3 and 4. Above its entrance in large letters was the word “Standing” and a large
    letter “B~. Thus B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.

        45. The length o f the tunnel is some 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels off but finally descends
     towards the terraces at a gradient o f 1 in 6 . As it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the radial
     fence between pen 3 on the right and pen 4 on the left. A short spurof brick wall projects forward from each side
     o f the tunnel at its mouth. Those emerging are thus guided straight forward rather than to either side. The
     photograph at Appendix 3 shows the west stand and terraces.

       46. As with the layout on the terraces, the configuration o f the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the areas inside
     them waseffected by a series o f piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary to analyse their resultant effect.


                                                                6
Policing Arrangements
   47. At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been under the control of Chief Superintendent Mole, then
C om m ander o f F Division within whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
the FA broached the 1989 semi-finaL but he was due to hand over command of F Division on 27 March to
Superintendent Duckenfield on the latter s prom otion to C hief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 March, but on 27 March Mr Mole bowed out and M r Duckenfield took over. Under him were
S e c to r Com m anders, all Superintendents with much experience o f policing football matches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular. Superintendent Marshall was in charge o f the area outside the Leppings Lane
entrance and the approaches to it. Superintendent Greenwood was in command inside the ground, but this
included the area between the turnstiles and the perimeter fence. They thereby swapped roles from the
previous year. U nder Mr Duckenfield’s overall com m and were some 801 officers and men on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers and others from D Division to deal with the influx of supporters into the city centre.
In all. therefore, some 1.122 police were deployed for this match amounting to about 38 per cent o f the total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the mounted section o f 34 were officers from Liverpool and Nouingham to
assist re sp e c tiv e ly in marshalling their home s u p p o rte r. The total at the ground was divided into serials
consisting usually o f eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector, t h e serials were posted to duties
at various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during and after the match. All of lhis
was provided for in an Operational Order which followed closely the Order drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into account the force’s "Standing Instructions for the Policing o f Football Grounds". The Order
described the duties o f each serial at each phase. It was supplemented by oral briefings before and on the day of
the match.

Sheffield Wednesday’s .Arrangements
  48. The Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and tum stile operators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
were briefed as to their duties on the morning of the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
ground. They wore yellow tabards. The Club’s control room, situated below the south stand, could
com m unicate by VHF radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in their control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A computerised counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total of
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end. there would be
separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). When the total for any section was within 15 per cent of its permitted capacity a warning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing that warning would occur when the numbers were within 15 per
cent o f the total terrace capacity o f 10.100. What the system could not do was monitor the distribution o f fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications '
   49. The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west com er o f the
ground between the south stand and pen 1 o f the west terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a number
o f steps. It has windows commanding views across the pitch and straight along the line o f the west perimeter
fence. The box is very small and has seats for only three officers. Superintendent Murray was in control of it
and was advisor to M r Duckenfield as he had been to Mr Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
G oddard who operated the radios. The third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone
and public address systems. At the back of the box stood Police Constable Bichard who was in control o f the
police closed circuit television system operated by a row o f consoles on a bench in front of him and behind the
three seated officers.

   50. There were five television screens showing views o f five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
stands and directed both inside and outside the ground. There was also a master screen which flicked in
rotation from one camera view to another and which made a video recording. The cameras have a zoom
facility to close in on any point o f interest. Specifically, there were good camera views of the west terracing, of
the Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them o f Leppings Lane itself.

   51. The Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
 ground and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed under the police control box. to relay
 music before the match, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through ail
 speakers or if appropriate to one area only.




                                                           7
   53. Radio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and outside the ground was
U H F on channel 25. There was a W1 FU. portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
siand-by station under the operator's bench. H and sets were issued to all ranks o f Sergeant and above.
C om m unity Constables on duty would already have their own. Other Constables had no radio.
C om m unication was on “talk through” i.e. any message from any source would be heard by everyone tuned in
and i f m ore than one source spoke messages could become garbled. Ear pieces were issued to some officers in
an attem pt to overcome the loud crowd noise which made receipt of signals very difficult. There were other
radio channels open to Sergeant Goddard: VHF to police Headquarters at Snig Hill, channel 35 to Fi
Sub-divisional Headquarters at Hammerton Road and channel 19 used by CID. There was also a set tuned to
Sheffield W ednesday's radio system between its control room and the stewards.

p
                                        15th APRIL; T H E BUILD-UP TO 2J0pm

    Eariv Arrivals
       54 15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday. The match was a sell-out. so 54.000 ticket holden
    w e r e expected. Others would come without tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain access otherwise.
    The following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
    supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite eariv in
    small numbers. Some brought cans of beer with them and were seen drinking as they walked: others took
    advantaee o f the weather and sat about on walls and open spaces. When the public houses opened, many
    resoned'there. drinking inside or spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane and its environs comprise a
    mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
    house or off-licence. Many were asking-for tickets or "spares-'. There were a few touts selling them at inflated
    prices. From an early stage, some of the fans were using private gardens and yards to urinate. As the morning
    wore on. num bers increased. Requests for tickets and trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevailing
    mood was one o f carnival, good hum our and expectation.

    Public Houses
      55. There were some 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
    Liverpool supporters did visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great amount o f alcoholic drink wa.<
    bought there.

      56. O p e n i n g time ai public houses was in general 11 am. Some remained closed all day. O f the others, some
    72. mostlv in the citv. were frequented by local patrons only. Some 23 public houses, however, served over a
    hundred Liverpool supporters each. Another 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
    many supporters drank enough to affect their mood. At first excitement: later frustration.

    The Gathering Crowd
       57. Towards the end o f the morning, fans gathered on and around the bridge near the Leppings Lane
    entrance. They seemed reluctant to enter the ground early. All turnstiles were open at 12 noon and one or two
    as eariv as 11.30 am. Some 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles and in the Leppings
    Lane are'a. They enquired at random whether fans had tickets. Those who had'not were advised to go away;
    nevertheless, many returned more than once. Those who had tickets were guided in the right direction. The
    police tried to persuade them to enter the ground early. Officers, male and female, had been posted outside
    each tum stile with the duty o f searching entrants for weapons, drink or drugs. Once through the turnstile, an
    entrant was liable to be searched again by one o f a serial o f officers positioned just inside.

        58. At about 12 noon Chief Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent Murray whether the pens on the west
     terrace were to be filled one by one successively, but was told that they should all be available from the start and
     the fans should find their own level.

       59. By 2 pm it was apparent to those inside the ground and those monitoring events in the police and Club
     control rooms that the num ber of Nottingham fans in their places greatly outnumbered those from Liverpool.
     The Kop and the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and west stands were half empty. It was
     noted about that time that the tumstile figures showed only 1 2 . 0 0 0 had entered as against 2 0 , 0 0 0 at the same
     time the previous year. On the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filling, the wing pens 1,2 . 6 and 7 were
     nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannov message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to move forward and make room for
     others.

       60. There had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. This time, there was only one. It arrived
     early, just before 2 pm. at Wadslev Bridge station. The 350 passengers were met by both mounted and foot
     police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly and passed through
     the turnstiles into the ground by about 2 . 2 0 pm without incident.

       61. Bv this time the police*Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the majority of
     Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. The numbers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
     increasing rapidly. Between the perimeter gates^and the turnstiles the crowd became congested. There was no
     longer a separate queue at each tumstile but a single phalanx filling the whole approach area. The foot officers
     outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.


                                                                9
I

      M ounted officers in and outside the tum stile area were having difficulty manoeuvring in such a dense crowd.
      The police were beset by fans bemused by the ticket and tum stile labelling asking for directions. Many had
      been drinking but up to and just after 2.30 pm the m ood remained good.

        62.        Superintendent Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd. He became anxious about the numbers
      coming down Leppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At 2.17
    . pm he radioed to control to have m otor traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. This was eventually done at about
      2_30 pm. U p to this tim e, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles and the numbers still approaching, there
      was still no panic in the crowd; no perception of crisis by the police. In the control room M r Murray, who could
      see Leppings Lane on the video, advised Mr Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. Mr
      Duckenfield reaffirmed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there was some
      major external factor such as fog on the Pennines or delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely turned up
      late even in large numbers.

                                         T H E CRISIS AT T H E TURNSTILES

       63. In the 20 m inutes from 2.30 pm to 2,50 pm there were crucial developments both inside and outside
    the g r o u n d . In pens 3 and 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as more fans came through the tunnel to the
    favoured area behind the goal. By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
    discomfort to many well used to enduring pressure on terraces. The numbers at that time were clearly in excess
    o f the m axim um density stated by the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 Edn) (the Green
    Guide) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the Green Guide has no statutory or legal force, it is the
    only official advice available about safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1. 2. 6 and 7, there was still
    ample room and bare patches of concrete were visible.

      64. Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As more arrived at the back the crush at the
    front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles became more difficult. Their efficiency was impaired and their rate
    reduced. A rriv a ls at tlie back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. The foot
    officers outside were unable to function and in danger themselves so they went through the turnstiles and out
    again through gate C where they did what they could to relieve pressure by the tubular barrier. The mounted
    officers were surrounded by the dense mass of people and became ineffective. Superintendent Marshall was in
    the midst o f the turm oil. He extricated himself and stood on a parapet o f the bridge to get a clear view. A
    drunken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a mounted officer. But these were isolated acts by
    individuals: the menace came from the massive numbers singie-mindedly determined to be in for the kick-off
    with time running out. At the back of the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack of progress as 3 o’clock
    approached. Some, mostly young men who had been drinking, tried to push and force their wav forward. At
    the front, people were jam m ed together and against the tumstile walls.-Some panicked as the pressure
    intensified. Some youngsters and women were fainting and in distress. They were helped put through the
    tubular barrier by tum stile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans climbed up and over the
    tum stile building or on to the dividing fence. This was to escape the crush rather than to gain free entry since
    most o f them had tickets.

      65. At 2.44 pm Mr Marshall radioed for reinforcements, for the Tannov to request the crowd to stop
    pushing and for a vehicle with loudspeaker equipment to come and request the same. Unhappily, at about 2.40
    pm. radio com m unication on channel 25 became defective. For a period of two or three minutes the control
    room lost contact-. A com m unications officer came promptly and switched to the standby station. With the use
    of a handset at control, contact was restored. Despite this hiatus, two of M r Marshall’s requests were received.
    The Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcements, including mounted officers from Penistone Road,
    were sent. The third request, for a Landrover, was received direct by its driver PC Buxton who arrived at 2.46
    pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. This was no more effective than the Tannoy. The
    m ounted officers besieged near the turnstiles came outside the perimeter gates. An attem pt was made to shut
    them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed or at least thinned through the
    turnstiles. The pressure from without, however, opened the gates again. Mounted officers, now reinforced to
    greater numbers, formed a cordon across the elbow of Leppings Lane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
    with the object o f reducing pressure inside the gates. They were successful in this for some minutes despite
    desperate individuals forcing their wav under or between the horses. However, this exercise was overtaken by a
    more dram atic relief o f the pressure.

    “Open the G ates”
       6 6 . Between 2.40 pm and 2.45 pm the crowd inside and outside the tumstile approach had swelled to
    over 5.000. At the head o f the phalanx conditions had become intolerable. Those who got through were short
    o f breath and sweating profusely. Many complained to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
    and asked them in forceful terms to do something. Exit gates A and B were being shaken. It was clearthe crowd
    could not pass through the turnstiles by 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the Landrover to control
    asking that kick-offbe postponed. The suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

       67. Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had become unmanageable. Although loth to do so. since it
     was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.
     Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. Other senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
     radioed control to permit the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm. whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the
     request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
     advantage and about 150 managed to get in before a mounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr
     Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third time, adding that if the


                                                               11
gates were not opened someone was going to be killed. In the control room. Mr Duckenfield had not made.a
decision. M r Murray asked him “Are you going to open the gates?”. Mr Duckenfield gave the order and Sgt
G oddard radioed to M r Marshall “Open the gates". Neither the Club control room nor any police officers
inside the tum stileswere told of this order before or aficr it was given or of any action it would require.

  6 8 . At 2.52 pm , gate C was opened wide. Fans behind turnstiles A to G and from the concourse beyond
came round to flow through it in large numbers.

   69. About two minutes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gateman’s
objection, forit to be opened. If it was not, he said, “ It’ll go and someone will get killed". Permission was given,
but this tim e reserve serials were alerted to m onitor the inrush towards the north stand. Gate B was also briefly
opened against the gateman’s wishes and about 200 of those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
left.

  70. The largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five minutes it was open about 2.000 fans passed
through it steadily at a fast walk. Some may have had tickets for the stands. No doubt some had no tickets at all.
The majority had tickets for the terraces. O f these, some found their wav either right to pens 1 and 2 or left
through the dividing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnei in front of them.
                                                      CHAPTER4

                                                   T H E DISASTER

      71 The initial influx through gate C. augmented by entrants via the turnstiles, came through the tunnel
    with great m om entum . Fans spoke of being swept through, feet otf the ground; The 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
    their progress. Upon reaching the crowded pens, some wished tago back but were unable to do so. The new
    arrivals found themselves pushed forward and the pressure became intense. At 2.54 pm. shortly after this
    influx began, the teams came onto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. Many were now
    acu telv uncom fortable and some were in distress. The mass seethed about but voluntary movement by any
    individual was difficult: hands down could not be raised and some fans found it hard to breathe. Still the flow
    continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. There were shouts for help and for the gates to be
    opened to the pitch. Police officers on the perim eter track did not immediately react. In the deafening noise
    from chanting and shouting they did not at first recognise the problem. Realisation came at different moments
    to different officers in different places.

       72. Gate 3 sprang open under the intense pressure from within. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
    afterwards, it sprang again: officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged and pushed back. Gate
    4 was opened by a policeman who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it and were directed
    to the wing pens where there was still ample room. Meanwhile.' gate 4 was closed again and then re-opened. At
    eate 3. a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his written orders and radioed for permission to
    open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon himself to open it.

      73. Just before 3 pm. the match kicked otT. At the same time, gate C. which had been closed at 2.57 pm.
    was reopened and a steady trickle continued to enter through the tunnel.

       7 4 . To escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences out of pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 and 5. Others
    tried to get over the front perim eter fence but were at first turned back by police who feared a pitch invasion.
    Near the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the point of collapse and in some instances death but
    thev were held upright by pressure all round. Further back, most were so preoccupied with the pain o f being
    pressed against barriers and with breathing problems that they saw nothing of the game. But at the rear there
    were manv who. although cram ped, were watching the football unaware of the distress at the front.

      75. At 3.04 pm. B e ard sle y for Liverpool struck-the crossbar at the Kop end. There was a roar from the
    Liverpool fans and at the same time a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. The several surges which occurred after
    the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the pitch. The force became such as to twist
    and break two spans of a crush barrier towards the front of pen 3. The evidence does not establish with
    certainty when this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm. But I am sure it occurred after
    the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. When the barrier broke those whom it had
    supported were projected towards the perimeter fence. Many fell and the involuntary rash o f those behind
    pressed them d o w n . The crushing force was transm itted and dispersed so that all along the front of pen 3 fans
    were pressed hard up against the low wall and the wire mesh of the fence above it.

       76. In pen 4 no barrier broke. Nevertheless those at the front were crushed against wall and fence. Further
     back, two barriers were bowed and some individuals succumbed to the pressure around them.

        77. Surges on terraces are common. Usually, they go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight of
     numbers, there was no receding. The pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it. standing or prone,
     life was ebbing away, [f no relief came in four minutes there would be irreversible brain damage: if longer,
     death.

       78. In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3 and 4 until the first
     fans spilt out onto the perim eter track just before kick-off. Then, the officers in command assumed that there
.    was an attem pted pitch invasion. They called up reserve serials waiting in the gymnasium and all available
     officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was made to HQ for dog handlers.

        79. Superintendent Greenwood, the G round Commander, was by the players’ tunnel at the kick-off. He
     noticed fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As he approached, he did not think the pens
     overcrowded until he was very close and saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
     situation “ retrievable"* if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. He climbed on the wall below the fence
     and signalled with both hands to those behind to move back. Other officers joined him. It was impossible.
     Those fans who would have wished to comply were powerless to do so. Behind them, there were still many


                                                              13
unaware o f the crisis, watching the game. The football continued to joyous shouting and singing round the rest
of the ground while those crushed and trapped slowly expired.

  80.    When M r Greenwood’s signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radto for the m atch to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arms towards the control
box. M r Duckenfield sent Mr M urray down from the box to have the match stopped via the linesman, the
agreed emergency drill. Before he could do so, Mr Greenwood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the
game. It was 5)6 m inutes past 3.

                                                    T H E AFTERM ATH

    . Rescue Attempts                                                                                          i
         81 From 3 o'clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and remained so. At first, fans had walked or staggered out
      winded and faint. But the final surge at 3.04 pm. and the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a horrendous
    ’ blockage o f bodies. The dead, the dying and the desperate became interwoven in the sump at the front of the
      oens. especially by the gates. Those with strength left clambered over others submerged in the human heap and
      tried to climb out over the fence. They were now helped by police and other fans who hauled them up and over.
      Numbers o f fans were climbing overthe radial fences into adjacent pens. At the back, many were hauled up
      into the west stand to relieve the pressure.

              The steps from the sump at gateways 3 and 4 were so congested with bodies live and dead that each had
     to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A number of individual
     officers and fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow that only two or three
     could get at the entwined bodies Willing hands got in one another’s wav. More officers arrived from the
     g y m n a s iu m and elsewhere in the ground. Many used their own initiative to heip those laid out on the pitch, to
     assist in getting others over the fencing and to comfort the distressed. But some stood in groups near the
     oerimeter fence not knowing what to do. They had been summoned in response to what was thought to be a
     threat to public order. What they found was a horrific scene of carnage and some young officers were shocked
     into impotence by what they saw.

         33.      It was truly gruesome. The victims were blue, cyanotic, incontinent: their mouths open, vomiting; their
     " eves staring. A pile o f dead bodies lay and grew outside gate 3. Extending further ana further on to the pitch, the
       injured were laid down and attempts made to revive them. More and more walking survivors flooded out on to
       the pitch as the players left. The scene was emotive and chaotic as well as gruesome. As the enormity of the
       disaster was realised, many o f the fans milling about were bitter and hostile to the police, blaming them for
       what had happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat upon and even assaulted. A small number of
       hysterical fans had to be subdued.

        84. Adding to the chaos, a num ber o f press photographers dodged about among rescue workers apparently
      avid to secure photographs at point blank range o f those dying through the wire mesh and those laid on the
      pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them. Police had to intervene.

         85. At about 3.12 pm. C hief Superintendent Nesbit. Commander o f the Traffic Division, arrived on the
      pitch. He took charge at gate 3 and organised a chain o f officers to simplify and expedite the extraction of
      casualties from the pen. In the absence o f any mechanical means, police and fans together pulled and worked
      at the wire mesh with their bare hands and their feet to breach the fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
      enabling officers to get in and fans to be got out.

         8 6 . By now. some officers o f their own initiative went round from the pitch to the tunnel where they met
      other officers from the turnstiles and the west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear o f the pens
      to go bacx through the tunnel. Some complied, but many resisted, wishing to stand their ground. Casualties
      were brought out through the tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were abie to get
      further in and bring out more casualties, dead and alive. They were laid on the ground in the concourse outside
      the tunnel and attempts were made to revive them.

       First Aid
         87. The St John Ambulance Brigade had some 30 personnel posted round the ground for the match - 25
       adults and 5 ju n io r cadets. They were quickly on the scene when the first casualties emerged and sought to
       revive them. T h eir Divisional Superintendent, Mr Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help those pressed against the
       fencing by feeding oxygen to them through the mesh until they could be got out.

         8 8 . Dr Purceli. Sheffield Wednesday’s doctor, came from his seat in the south stand and attempted
       resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he moved from patient to patient doing what he could,
       but in most cases it was too late.

         89. At 3.13 pm a St John's ambulance came onto the pitch at the north-east corner and drove to the
       perimeter fence close to gate 3. There was no call for doctors and nurses on the public address system until
       nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the minutes ticked past, some of them came onto the pitch to help of their


                                                                 15
own accord when they saw the casualties and the ambulance and realised the gravity o f the situation. Many
tans also worked prodigiously in attempts to revive the dead and the dying, in some cases their own relatives
and friends. Artificial respiration, mouth to m outh respiration and cardiac massage were applied by the skilled
and the unskilled but usually in vain. Those capable o f survival mostly came round o f their own accord. The
rest were mostly doom ed before they could be brought out and treated.
   90. There was an urgent need to get casualties off the pitch and to hospital. There were six stretchers in the
first aid room and three in the St John's ambulance. They were quickly brought into use. Then the fans
improvised by tearing down the hoardings around the edge of the pitch and against the stands so that lengths of
board could be used as stretchers. Improvising in this way, parties of fans and police ran repeatedly the length
o f the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east comer. A number were dead on arrival there.

In the Control Room
  91. M r Duckenfield stayed in the control room. Chief Inspector McRobbie was there in civilian clothes as
an observer. M r Duckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policewoman at gate 1 to admit those
displaced, from the centre pens. Mr Duckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw someone laid
on the pitch. Even then, he did not realise the nature o f the problem or its scale.

  92. M r M urray returned from his attem pt to stop the match and Mr Duckenfield sent him down again to
clear the pitch and assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. This was
because Mr Duckenfield could not from the control room see clearly what was happening for the milling and
increasing numbers.

   93. The Assistant C hief Constable (Operations). Mr Jackson, had attended the match in civilian clothes as
a guest o f the Club. He came from his seat in the south stand to ask what had happened. Mr Duckenfield was
unable to say: he did not tell Mr Jackson that the exit gates had been opened on his authority. Mr Jackson went
down to the pitch to discover the situation.

   94. At 3.06 pm Mr Duckenfield. still p r im a rily concerned about public order, caused a message to be sent
to H eadquarters asking for Operation Support. That was a call for all available additional police resources to
come to the ground to strengthen the police presence.

   95. M r Jackson was told by Mr Greenwood that there were casualties and returned immediately to control
to make sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile. Mr Murray had seen the plight o f those behind the
fence. He radioed to control that a fleet of ambulances was required. He also asked fora Tannoy broadcast to
those in the pens to move back but there is no clear evidence that it was made.
                                                        •

  96. Oniv when M r Duckenfield received the request for a fleet of ambulances did he realise the nature and
gravity of the situation. Then. supported by Mr Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting Operation
Support into calls for the Major Disaster Plan.

 No Information
   97. Apart from the message to clear the pitch and the belated call for medical assistance about 3.30 pm. no
 inform ation or advice was broadcast on the public address system. Mr Duckenfield feared that the crowd
 might turn hostile or might all attempt to leave together thereby hampering the emergency services if they were
 given inform ation about what had happened. The result was that apart from those close enough at the west end
 to see the terrible truth for themselves, the majority of the cro^d were left in ignorance. Many, especially
 Nottingham supporters in the Kop. still thought there had been a pitch invasion or other misbehaviour by
 Liverpool fans. They continued singing.and chanting incongruously. This infuriated some Liverpool fans who
 were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end. The police feared violence might result on;
 top of the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large number of officers to form a line across the
 width o f the pitch at the Kop end and advance up to the haifwav line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
 moved. There the line stood as an insurance against disorder but doing nothing. Other officers were posted to
 the perim eter track facing the north stand for the same purpose. To those distressed and distraught who
 wanted urgent action, this large contingent of passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
 intensified.

 Misinformation
    98. At about 3.15 pm. Mr Graham Kelly. Chief Executive of the           Mr Kinon also of the F \ and Mr
 G raham Mackrell. Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday, weni to the control room for information. Mr
 Duckenfieid told them he thought there were fataliiie<;and the game was likely io be abandoned. He also said a


                                                            16
b

    eate had been forced and there had been an inrush o f Liverpool supporters. He pointed to one of the television
    screens focussed on gate C by the Leppings Lane turnstiles and said “That’s the gate that’s been forced; there's
    been an inrush". Inevitably Mr Kelly was interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke o f the, two stories
    concerning the gate - the fens’ account that the police had opened it. the police assertion that' the fans had
    forced their way in.

      99  About 3.30 pm there was a further meeting in the C u b ’s boardroom. Mr Duckenfield went there and
    met M r Keilv, the referee and representatives of the three clubs. ACC Jackson was also there. Mr
    Duckenfield indicated the m atch was likely to be abandoned although no firm ruling was given. He added that
    he did not want people to know it was to be abandoned lest the dispersing crowd hamper the emergency
    operations.

    P u b lic A n n o u n c e m e n ts
         100. Later the managers o f the two teams were asked to go to the control room. They were invited there to
    ' make a public announcem ent to calm the crowd. M r Kenny Dalglish agreed to do so. He told the crowd that
      there were problems and asked them to assist the police and those rendering first aid. He asked for-calm and his
      message was well received. It was then 3.56 pm. At 4.10 pm it was announced that the match was abandoned
      for that dav. Again that message was received calmly by the crowd most o f whom behaved responsibly as they
      dispersed..

     Fire Brigade
        101 Meanwhile the emergency services had been in action. At about 3.10 pm a request came from the
     perim eter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the wire mesh. Sergeant Goddard contacted the police garage
     close by without success. At 3.13 pm, PC Bichard requested Headquarters to call tfce fire service to bring
     hydraulic cutting equipm ent to the Leppings Lane entrance.

        102. There was no arrangement for a fire officer to be present during the match. However, the Major
     Disaster Plan required all em e rg e n c y services to be alerted. After ’phone messages which must be described
     later, fire appliances arrived at both Leppings Lane and Penistone Road at 3.22 pm. At both entrances their
     arrival surprised police who were uninform ed as to why they had been called or where they should go.

       103. At Leppings Lane a police Inspector told Station Officer Swain "I don't really think we need you".
    • Another police officer then asked for more resuscitators as people were dying so Mr Swain radioed for ten fire
     appliances. Each carries oxygen and resuscitation equipment.

        104. At the Kop end. Leading Fireman Housley arrived with an emergency tender and Station Officer
     Fletcher in another appliance, each with a crew. The emergency tender came along the roadway by the south
     stand but owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefore backed out and went to the Leppings
     Lane entrance losing some eight minutes. From there, Mr Housley and his crew went onto the pitch with
     resuscitation equipment. They rendered help there and lateral the gymnasium. Mr Fletcher and his men ran
     along behind the south stand carrying cutting equipment and oxygen cylinders. When they arrived at the
     fence, the cutting equipm ent was not required as by then the last o f the dead and injured were being removed
     from the pens. M r Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area under the police box and firemen assisted in carrying
     victims as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.

     South Yorkshire M etropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS)
        105. Before 1986 there had been no SYMAS representative routinely present at Hillsborough matches. The
     Club was content, as indeed are many other clubs, to rely upon the St John’s Ambulance Brigade and a 999 call
     if necessary. From 1986 onwards, after representations, the Club provided two scats in the south stand for
     SYMAS staff at League matches. At one stage it was suggested they would be best placed in the north stand
     close to the gymnasium which had been designated as the casualty centre in the event o fa major incident. The
     south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYMAS staff closer to the players’ tunnel should a player be
     injured. These seats were, however, not available at Cup semi-finals. SYMAS representatives nevertheless
     attended at the semi-finals by arrangement with the police in 1988 and again in 1989. The SYMAS officers
     stood on the ramp leading to the pitch at the north-east comer. They had one ambulance outside the ground
     and one on standby.

         106. On 15 April 1989, Officers Higgins an d Eason were at the ground with an ambulance and crew. They
      noticed fans on the track and went to the Leppings Lane end whilst the game was still in progress. They began
      to attend to casualties. Meanwhile, at 2.59 pm. there had been a call from Police Constable Waugh at police


                                                                17
Headquarters to the Hillsborough police control asking if ambulances were required. This was on the
instruction of C hief Inspector Edmundson who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise and snatches o f speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no repons o f injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
ground that there might be injuries, police Headquarters notified SYMAS that ambulances might be required.
Then, seconds later. M r M urray’s request for a fleet o f ambulances was relayed to SYM.AS. They reacted at
once. Ambulanccs began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entrance at 3.13 pm and at the Penistone Road
entrance at 3.17 pm. In all. some 42 ambulances attended. 31 of them from SYMAS and 1 1 from
neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm, they had conveyed some 172 casualties to the Northern General
Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

Gymnasium
  107. The gymnasium had been in use for serving meals to the police. When the Major Disaster Plan was
ordered, it was cleared and divided into two. One end became a temporary mortuary, the other was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed and improvised, brought in more and more
casualties, the scene was initially and inevitably chaotic and harrowing. There was intense distress amongst
the injured and bereaved: relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead and sought to revive them. There
were people looking for missing friends and relations: there were recriminations, there were scuffles. Some o f
those involved were the worse for drink. Doctors and nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to attend the injured as best they could in the adverse circumstances. Those in most urgent need of
hospital treatm ent were taken to ambulances as they arrived, triage being employed to determine priorities.
Doctors were requested by the police to examine each person thought to be deceased to confirm and certify
death. A police Constable was detailed to attend and guard each o f the dead and a photograph o f each was
taken by a police photographer so that relatives coming to identify bodies could be spared the ordeal of
searching am ongst all who had died.

The Dead and the Injured
  108. O f the 9 5 who died, the evidence suggests that at least 16 and probably 21 came through gate C after it
opened at 2.52 pm. T h at is established by the statements of relatives and friends who came through with them
but survived.

   109. By com m endable hard work, a team o f pathologists headed by Professor Usher completed
post-mortem exam inations on all the deceased within 48 hours. They found that 8 8 of the victims were male
and seven female. Thirty-eight were under 20 years of age. 39 were between 20 and 29 years and only tnre; were
over 50. In virtually- every case the cause o f death was crush asphyxia due to compression of the chest wall
against other bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In ail but nine cases that was the sole cause.
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture the aorta: in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck or chest; in the remaining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. Thirteen o f those .were rib fractures. However, one was a fractured femur, one a fractured
radius and the remaining three involved' fractures of bones or cartilages round the voice box. These injuries
suggest the victim s may have been trodden while on the ground.

  110. Blood samples were taken from the dead. No alcohol was found in any of the females. O f the males. 51
had no more than 1 0 milligrams per cent in their blood which is negligible: 15 had over 80 milligrams per cent
and six over 1 2 0 miiiigrams per cent.

  111. Although the great majority of those who died were in pen 3. at least five were in pen 4. Most deaths
occurred at the front o f the pens but there were a few fatalities further back.

  112. In ait. som e 730 people comp.lained.of being.injured inside the ground and 36 outside it. Of the 730.
about 30% are thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm. The largest category of injury was
bruising, especially to the ribs and chest.

                                            S P E C IF IC INCIDENTS

     113   I have given my findings as to the basic factual background and the main sequence of events in
n a rra tiv e form. There was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to some timings and numbers.
Indeed, the consistency of the evidence has been a remarkable feature of this.Inquiry. The experiences o f most
witnesses were unforgettable and no doubt the ea rly hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
existence o f tim ed videos and photographs and o f logged and taped messages provided reliable checks by
which to prom pt and test witness recollection. Accordingly, I have not for the most part burdened the narrative
with citations from the evidence o f individual witnesses.

 •     114   However, there were several instances o f detailed evidence and assertions being highlighted by the
m e d ia in dram atic and emotive terms during the hearing. Since some o f those much-publicised incidents gave
rise to unfair criticism, they ought to be the subject of specific findings. I have therefore dealt with them
individually at Appendix 6 .

   115. This disaster was the wdrst in the history o f British football. It happened because pens 3 and 4 became
grossly o v e rc ro w d e d . They were uncomfortably overcrowded by 2.50 pm at least to a degree which required
that they should be closed to further arrivals. Even th e numbers coming through the turnstiles in the last 10
m inutes would have increased the pressure beyond danger point and there would have been injuries if not
fatalities. As it was. the influx through gate C after 1 5 2 pm so increased the pressure in the two pens as to
cause fatal crushing.

   116. The overcrowding up to 2.52 pm was due to a number of factors which can be considered broadly
u nder three heads.                                   >

                                   T H E LAYOUT AT T H E LEPPIN G S LANE END

      118 I have already ob served that the layout o f the turnstile area, of the terraces and o f the concourse
    between them was the result o f piecemeal changes. A brief history of these changes is now necessary.


    The History
       119 Before 1965. the Leppings Lane end consisted entirely o f terracing like the Kop. In that year, the west
    stand was built and the terraces remaining in front o f it were truncated to their present depth, front to back. As
    to width, thev consisted of a single standing area with no dividing fences. During the.early 1970's, hooliganism
    and pitch invasions made it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and the perimeter fences were
    therefore erected in 1977.

       120. Section 1 o f the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 empowered the Secretary o f State to designate a
    sports" stadium having, in his opinion, accom m odation for more than 1 0 . 0 0 0 as a stadium requiring a
    certificate from the local authority. Hillsborough was so designated with effect from 1 January 1979 by SI
    1978/1091. In anticipation o f that date. Sheffield Wednesday instructed Eastwood and Partners, a firm of
    consulting engineers, to act on their behalf especially in their dealings with the local authority. Dr Eastwood,
    the principal o f the firm, is a highly experienced civil and structural engineer and has advised several major
    football clubs. He recommended that a num ber o f additional crush barriers should be added since those
    already in place were insufficient to comply with the Green Guide (1976 edition). That work was approved
    and carried out during 1979.

       1 21  T he relevant local authority at the time was the South Yorkshire County Council. It set up an Officer
    Working Party consisting of representatives o f the police, the fire service, its own building surveyors division
    and its own legal and adm inistration department. The Working Party made inspections and consulted with the
    C u b an d D r Eastwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 December 1979 for an indefinite period. It has
    rem ained in force ever since and has not been amended.

        122. Schedule 3 o f the certificate sets out the m axim um crowd capacity for various areas in the ground. The
     figure for the west terrace is 7,200 and for the north-west terrace 2.900. These figures were intended to be in
     accordance with the Green Guide (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided for a maximum “packing density” of
     between 54 and 27 persons per 1 0 square metres depending on the condition of the terrace. Dr Eastwood had
     calculated 8.000 for the west terrace on the basis o f 54 per 10 square metres. He thought this a justified starting
     figure in view o f his improved system of barriers. However, he reduced it to 7.200 because there were no
     gangways on the terrace and he did not think it feasible to provide any. So. the total figure for the Leppings Lane
     terraces was and is 1 0 , 1 0 0 .

.    The 1981 Semi-Final
       123. As already mentioned, there was crushirg at the Cup semi-final in 1981. The match was between
     Tottenham H otspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The police debriefing minutes after the incident
     prophetically refer.

        “to the late arrival of a large number o f spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane
        enclosure when the match started. The flash point occurred when Tottenham scored" (at the Kop end) “after
        only three minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was happening and caused a
        crush, which resulted in the injuries".

        124. Those being crushed called for the perim eter gates to be opened onto the track. There was no
     im m ediate reaction, according to Mr Vaux who was there, but fortunately a police Inspector gave instructions
     and the gates were then opened. About 250 came out onto the track. There were broken arms, legs and ribs and
     38 were treated either in hospital or by the St John Ambulance Brigade. It is clear from the documents (a) that
     the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure of 10.100 had been exceeded by over 400 (b) that the police
     shut off further access to the terraces because o f crushing, and (c) the police view after the event was that the
     capacity figure o f 1 0 . 1 00 in the Safety Certificate was too high. This latter view was communicaied to the C u b
     by the C hief Superintendent then in com m and of F Division but it was not pursued.


                                                                21
Three Pens
   125. After this incident in April 1981-the police requested that the terrace should be divided into sections.
T h e object was to improve crowd control by reducing sideways movement. Division would enable more even
distribution to be effected when there was a capacity crowd. It would also enable the west end to be used for
both home and away supporters who could be segregated in separate pens, if necessary’ with an empty pen
between them.

   126. This proposal was agreed by the Club and the Officer Working Party and was approved by the local
authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in November 1981. They are the fence now separating pens
2 and 3 and that now separating 5 and 6. The result was to divide the whole terrace into three pens. Access from
the concourse to the middle pen was through the tunnel and to the wing pens round the sides of the west stand.
D r Eastwood suggested and illustrated an altered layout which would have'provided separate access through
separate banks o f turnstiles to the north stand, to each end of the west stand, and to each of the three pens.
Whilst the main object o f this was segregation, such a layout would have enabled each of those areas to be
m onitored numerically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its maximum capacity was not exceeded. The plan was
not adopted. The maximum capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at 2.200. but no alteration was
m ade to the Safety Certificate so to limit it nor was there any means mechanically of counting the numbers
going into that pen.

T he 1985 Changes
   127. By 1985. Sheffield Wednesday had been promoted to the First Division and was drawing larger
crowds. The im provem ent o f the Leppings Lane end was raised again by the G u b and Dr Eastwood prepared a
num ber of drawings. These illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by providing more turnstiles
in separate banks and divisions of the concourse. The police wanted further divisions of the terrace itself,
again to improve control and segregation. There was much discussion of these schemes which included
suggestions o f 29 and even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, the following alterations were carried out in
1985.

New Radial Fences
   128. On the terraces, two more radial fences were fitted. One divided the existing central pen into the
present pens 3 and 4. Gates were fitted at the mouth of the tunnel to enable each of those pens to be closed off.
T he second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. Until
those two fences were added there existed only perimeter gates 1.2.4.5 and 6. The creation of pen 3 required a
new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.

Barriers
   129. The lines of the new radial fences ran across existing crush barriers so that without modification those
barriers would have run through the fencing. The police considered the barriers would be used by fans as
convenient m ounting points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their object. They therefore wished
spans to be removed from the barriers. Had their wishes been met in full the result would have been an
unim peded run i n pen 3 from the mouth of the tunnel down the south side of the new fence to the perimeter. Dr
Eastwood dug his heels in against that proposal which he rightly regarded as dangerous. He did however agree
to some modification to the middle row of barriers in the newly created pen 3. chiefly to facilitate access.
Likewise in the new pen 5. The 1985 modifications.to the pens are shown on the plan Appendix 4.

The Turnstiles and Concourse
   130. At the entrance, modification but no increase in number was made at the turnstiles. The bank 1 to 16
was divided from A to G by the metal fence now in place and that division was projected across the concourse
inside the turnstiles in the form of a brick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through that wall but
was enlarged to its present size at the request of the police. Those alterations were made in the interests of
segregation. The more elaborate divisions which Dr Eastwood had suggested, giving separate access to each
sub-division o f the accommodation, were not pursued for financial reasons. In May 1985 the Bradford
disaster occurred. The south stand at Hillsborough had wooden decking and the Club realised it would have to
undertake expensive remedial works there. The cantilever roof of the same stand was also discovered to
require expensive repairs.

   131. In fact, shortly after the new dividing fence and wall had been built at the Leppings Lane entrance and
concourse, the Club, by agreement with Chief Superintendent Mole, ceased to accommodate home supporters
at the Leppings Lane end. There was therefore no longer any need for segregation at that end. but the wall
remained.
   1'32- Also in 1 9 8 5 . electronic counting equipment was installed at all turnstiles. This conveyed the running
count for each bank o f turnstiles, for example A to G, to a television screen in the Club control room where the
figures were displayed. In 1986. an electronic eye was installed in each turnstile booth to catch and record
anyone who clim bed over the turnstile.

Barrier 144
   1 33  In Ju n e 1986. the police requested that the crush barrier nearest to the tunnel at the entrance to pens 3
and 4 should be removed to assist the flow of fans into the pens. They found it caused obstruction because it
was in a good viewing position and spectators liked to stand against it in numbers thereby blocking access by-
others further inio the pens. The police also suggesied it might hamper effective evacuation through the tunnel
especially in an emergency. D r Eastwood considered the pros and cons of this proposal and accepted the police
view. The Officer Working Party approved the proposal at a meeting on 7 August 1986 on site. Authority was
ziven then and there by M r Bownes on behalf of the Sheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility
for the Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire County Council on 1 April 1986. Two spans of the barrier were
therefore removed, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on Appendix 4.

Effects of the Layout
   134. T he result o f these changes was to divide the terrace into a num ber o f small areas without providing
anv com puterised or mechanical means o f limiting entry numerically into any one area if all areas were open
for choice. Before the fences and pens had divided the terrace, the overall figure of 10.100 could be monitored
via the turnstiles and in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was not possible strictly to
ensure com pliance with Schedule 3 Pan I of the Safety Certificate which prescribed a maximum of 2.900 for
the north-west terrace and 7.200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 o f the Safety Certificate
provides:

      "The num ber o f spectators adm itted to the Stadium and to the several areas of spectator accommodation
'           t h e Stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Pan 1 o f Schedule 3".
      w i t h i n




      The Club had to rely upon visual monitoring.

      135. T he situation became worse however with the division of the west terrace into pens. Not only were
    there more and smaller.discrete areas bnt some were likely to attract more than their appropriate share of the
    10 . 100 total. It is well.recognised that the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, the position of the
    tunnel vis-a-vis the turnstiles A to G. its labelling and the absence o f signposts advertising the wing pens would
    draw to it those with terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely that pens 3 and 4 would fill to capacity and
    indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. Had Dr Eastwood’s plan for separate turnstile access to
    separate sections with separate toilet and refreshment facilities been implemented, total computerised control
    could have been kept.
                                                    CHAPTER 8

                              LACK O F FIXED CAPACITIES FOR TH E PENS

   136. In 1981. when the terrace was divided into three areas. D r Eastwood gave the C u b the figure of 2.200
capacity for the centre pen. He based this on the Green Guide, making such allowances as he thought right. No
d oubt the num bers could have been counted in via the turnstiles if only that pen was in use or if such pens as
were in use were filled sequentially, but not otherwise.
   137. After the 1985 changes. Dr Eastwood did not himself give any figures for the new pens 3 and 4.
Someone on his stafThowever split the figure 2,200 into 1.200 for pen 3 and 1.000 for pen 4. Those figures did
not even take account o f the fact that pen 5 had been carved out of pen 4 which-was bound to have a reducing
effect on capacity. Nevertheless., the figures o f 1.200 and 1,000 were put on a drawing emanating from
Eastwood and Partners and the figures have been notionallv regarded since as applicable by the G u b and the
police. They are in fact too high.
  138. Dr Nicholson, at the Research and Laboratory Serv ices Division of the Health and Safety Executive,
has calculated that the figures for pens 3 and 4 respectively would be 1.015 and 1.036 if the strength and
spacing o f the crush barriers had complied with the Green Guide. But they did not.

Departures from the Green Guide
   139. In pen 3, four out of five gaps in the lines o f crush barriers do not conform with paragraph 115 o f the
Green Guide (1986). In pen 4, nine out o f ten do not conform. In particular, the spans taken out of the barriers
in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess o f the m axim um o f 1.4 metres prescribed. One gap was 57% wider than
the Green Guide maximum. Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from the mouth of the tunnel to the
barrier which collapsed. Dr Eastwood justified these larger gaps by the absence of gangways. Fans had to be
able to get in and out and standard gaps tended to get blocked up. The effect of his reasoning was that the
absence of gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice of a second safety feature,
namely gaps of strictly limited width.

   140. Again, the removal of barrier 144 was bound, as Dr Eastwood conceded, to affect capacity In fact it
did more, as I shall indicate la te r
   141. Capacity should also have taken account of two further departures from the Green Guide. If. as was
the case, the perimeter gates were not regarded as exits, some 40% of those in pens 3 and 4 were more than 12
metres from an exit (and there was no gangway) contrary to the aim of paragraph 96. Four out of five: of the
crush barriers in pen 3 and six out of nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
were the old barriers which had been repaired and plated where their bases had corroded and fresh concrete
had been applied, raising the level of the steps. The point is not academic since, in the event, many fans were
bent painfully over barriers under great pressure.

   142. D r Nicholson calculated that when all relevant factors regarding the configuration and the Green
G uide are taken into account, the maxim um capacity for pen 3 should have been 822 and for pen 4. 871.

Safety Certificate
   143. W hatever should have been the maximum capacities for pens 3 and 4. the fact is that no figures at all in
respect o f them were put into tKe Safety Certificate. Despite all the changes in layout of the fences and barriers,
the two figures, 2.900 for the north-west terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace, have remained as the only
m axim a with which the Club has to comply.

   144. Section 2(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 provides (so far as is relevant):

   “ A Safety Certificate shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
   expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in u se. .. "
   Seciion 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):
   “W ithout prejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety Certificate-
   (a) shall specify the maximum number o f spectators to be admitted to the siadium:
   (b) may specify the maximum number to be adm itted to different parts of it:
   (c) shall include terms and conditions-
   ... (iii) as to the number, strength and situation of any crush barriers."
S ection 2(2) was repealed by the Fire Safety and. Safety of Places of Sport- Act 1987, section 19. which
eave power to the Secretary o f State to lay down, by order, terms and conditions. No order has yet been
made an d guidance from th e Home Office has recommended local authorities to approach their
fu n c tio n u nder section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See Home
Office C ircular 71/1987 dated 25 November 1987. Annex A. paragraph 6 .)

  145. It is clear th at when the certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire County Council went
f u rth e r than simply to fix the maximum numbers for the whole Stadium. They prescribed figures for
each part o f the ground not merely by the four points o f the compass but by specified sections.’

    146. Section 8(1) o f the 1975 A n requires the holder of the certificate before carrying out any
proposals to alter or extend the stadium or any of its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
operation to give notice of those proposals to the local authority. That' obligation is specifically
repeated in Sheffield Wednesday's certificate at Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2). The Club complied with
the requirement. Having received notice of the alterations to the pens and the barriers, the local
a u th o ritv ought, in my view, to have amended the Safety Certificate accordingly. They did not do so.

Why was the Safety Certificate not .Amended?
  147. .A lthough D r Eastwood acknowledged that the various changes to the layout w ou ld have had
an effect on capacity, he did not take active steps to see that appropriate amendments were made. He
savs he m entioned from time to time that the alterations would have an effect on capacity and that he
did not realise the Safety Certificate was not regularly updated. However. I find two m em onm di in
earlv 1987 highly significant. Dr Eastwood’s assistant Mr Strange was concerned with queries from
the FA as to Hillsborough's capacity for a semi-final. Mr Strange recorded these questions in a
m emorandum:-

  "Has any account been taken for alterations done on Leppings Lane over the last few seasons? Is the 10,200
  or so figure still correct? I said that in my opinion it needs to be adjusted, better do it now than laier.”

   1 48.   M r Strange’s next memo (a few days later) records as follows:-

  ~Dr Eastwood says le av e the capacity at Leppings Lane end as it is. providing police have gates under West
  stand open st> that people can distribute throughout the terrace evenly.”

Although he says the last nine words do not report him accurately, Dr Eastwood accepts the rest of that
message.

    149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought to have been reviewed and
 altered. T he unhappy situation is that the police believed even the overall figure of 10,100 to be too high as far
 back as 1981. T h at was reported to the Club but apparently not to Dr Eastwood. Meanwhile, that global figure
 had been rendered academ ic by the sub-division o f the terrace which was not reflected in the Safety Certificate
 at all. If proper m axim um figures had been inserted in the certificate for each of the pens, the Club and the
 police might well have been prom pted to find some means of limiting the numbers entering those pens other
 than by visual m onitoring. This could have been done by implementing one of D r Eastwood’s plans for totally
 separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It could have been done by insisting on sequential filling of pens at
 all matches; alternatively, by counting fans into each viewing area.

 The City Council
    150. T hat the Safety Certificate was not amended and individual capacities not reviewed cannot be laid
 solely at D r Eastwood's door. He was. after all. consultant engineer to the Club and responsibility for the
 certificate was that o f the local authority. When the South Yorkshire County Council handed over to the
 Sheffield City Council, the latter delegated all its powers and duties under the 19/5 Act to its General Purposes
 Panel. Apparently, therefore, the decision-making body on behalf of the Council was that Panel, although two
 specific functions were delegated to the Head o f Administration and Legal Department - the power to issue a
 prohibition under section 10 o f the 1975 Act and the power of entry and search under section 11 o f the Act.

  151. In practice. M r Bownes. the Council's C hief Licensing Officer in the Administration and Legal
 Departm ent, bore the brunt o f th£ Council's duties under the Act.
Id
         152. The Officer Working Party was superseded by a Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory G roup.'but
i l   apart from the change of the nam e the system continued as before. Mr Bownes attended the inspections
j®    and meetings o f the Advisory G roup together with the representatives of the police, the fire service, the
I     departm ent o f health and consumer services, and the building engineer’s division o f the Council. The
■ ■   laiier was an engineer and ought therefore to have been alive to the same issues as Dr Eastwood.

1        153. The A d v is o r y Group se em s to h a v e w ork ed in a very in form al m anner. A s h o r tp a s s a g e fro m Mr
      B o w nes’ e v id e n c e g iv es th e flavour o f i t : -

           ■Q      W ho was taking the lead in the working party as you understood it?

            A      T h at is a good question, sir. Leads were coming from several different directions really.

            Q      W ho chaired it. if anyone?

            A      Nobody as such. sir. It was an inspection rather than a meeting as I understand it.

            Q      W ho decided what should be inspected?

            A      Effectively the group itself, sir. it seemed to me. There was also some input from the C'.u'o
                   representative as to. if you like, an element o f direction as tow,-.at should be looked at.

            Q      A part from the inspections the working party met. presu-.aoly, or did they only meet on
                   inspections?

            A      No. sir. I have referred to three previous meetings.

            Q      W ho took the chair when it met?

            A      I suppose it could be said that I did. to some extent.

             Q     T here is no point in having inspections unless you form conclusic-ns as a result o f that inspection, is
                   there?

            A      T h at is correct.

             Q     T here must presumably have been some meeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
                   together and decided what, if anything, should be done.

             A     There was not. to my recollection, no.

             Q     How did you decide what should be done, if anything needed to be done?

             A     There were discussions on the site, particularly in relation to barrier 144. which took place at the
                   time.

             Q     Nothing more than that and no record anywhere of any decisions that were made?

             A     No. sir."

       The decision to remove barrier 144 was assented to on behalf of the City Council by Mr Bownes. It was not
       referred to the General Purposes Panel. W hether Mr Bownes strictly had any power to assent to it is to sav the
       least very doubtful. But he himself admits that he was ill-equipped to do so. Hs knew very little about football
       grounds. He had read the file passed on from South Yorkshire County Council and assumed all had been run
       satisfactorily by them.

         154. It was recorded, however, in a report which Mr Bownes drafted that "the conditions (in the Safetv
       Certificate) give some cause for concern as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas". The
       report to the General Purposes Panel suggested that new Safety Certificate conditions should be drafted.

          155.      The task of revising the Safety Certificate was begun m June 1986. In July 1987. a draft was sent to the
       fire service to which they replied in August. In September 1987. the Panel was informed that the redrafting was


                                                                    26
u


    -progressing steadily" and should be subm itted to the Panel in October. The final draft was not circulated until
    30 March 1989. 16 days before this disaster.

       156. Meanwhile, ihe Safety Certificate has remained unamended since 1979. The enlargement of the Kop
    in 1986 increased its capacity to 21.000. .Although this was known and agreed by the Council it had not b«en
    the subject of any change in the certificate which still showed the capacity of the Kop as 16.350. M r Mackreil.
    Sheffield Wednesday's Secretary, raised the question o f amendments to the Safety Certificate and in particular
    with regard to the Kop in April 1987 with Eastwood and Partners but nothing resulted.

      157. Sheffield United Football Club was designated under the 1975 Act on 3 July 1984. A Safety Certificate
    was about to be issued by South Yorkshire County Council at the time it handed over to the Sheffield City
    Council on 1 April 1986. No certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

        158. The explanation given for these delays was pressure of work. Mr Bownes as Chief Licensing Officer
    was responsible for 32 other licensing systems when this one was added to his burden. He had a sum o f only
    five. I fully accept that the addition o f further statutory responsibilities to the already heavy workload of a local
    a u t h o r i t v with curbs on its expenditure creates problems. But it is d e a r that the attention given :o this
    im portant licensing function was woefully inadequate.

    Summary
       159. The Safety Certificate contained no maximum figures for individuai pens. There was therefore no
    sanction or provision focussing attention as to the need to limit entry to :he pens by numbers. The layout at
    Leppings Lane as it evolved made electronic or mechanical control over numbers entering individual pens
    impracticable if all pens were to be available. Given an important match and a capacity attendance, fans were
    likelv to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 and 4. Those pens were likely to become overfull well before
    warning came from the turnstiles that numbers were approaching the rerrace maximum o f 10.100. Control
    over numbers and the avoidance of overcrowding therefore depended entirely on visual monitoring o f the
    crowd.




                                                                27
                                                   CHAPTER 9

                       LACK O F EFFEC TIV E M ONITORING OF TH E TERRACES

   160. M onitoring the spectators on the terraces so as to avoid overcrowding involves observing the numbers
and their distribution in each area, making decisions as to when an area is “full”, taking steps to close it off
an d moving spectators from one area to another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problems. 1) Who
should carry it out? 2 ) When is an area “full"? 3) Fear of hooliganism.

Who should .Monitor the Terraces?
   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be the police? Should it be both? Or should it be by
arrangement, depending upon the ground or section of the ground in question?

   162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its premises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at that event. The Green Guide (1986) provides:

       “ 23. The safety o f the public inside the ground is the responsibility of those who stage the event and
             adm inister the ground in which it is held, ie the "management”. This responsibility appiies in
             both normal and emergency situations...

         195. ...there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

               (a)   controlling or directing members o f the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to
                     help achieve an even flow of people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal o f spectators on
                     the terraces o r viewing slopes;

               (b)   patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarms or extinguishing
                     fires;

               (c)   m anning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which
                     are continuously open whilst the ground is in use:

               (d)   assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control: and

               (e)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency."

T he Interim Popplewell Report
  • 163. There was considerable controversy in the course of the public inquiry held by Mr Justice Popplewell
in 1985 as to the responsibility of the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 of his interim report. Mr Justice
Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the Minister of Housing and Local Government in 1969 as
follows:-

   “The responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police and the club operating the
   ground. The broad line o f division being that police are responsible for movement of spectators in public
   thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the control of
   spectators once they are on the club’s premises . .

M r Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observ e that in practice the police
have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph 3 . 8 ):

   “ It follows, therefore, that as a m atter of practice, while the physical safety of the building and the
   maintenance and good housekeeping o f the ground must always be the responsibility of the club, the police
   have to take the de facto responsibility of organising the crowd, with all that entails, during the game . . . "

 M r Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation of the grouridas a procedure in which o n ly the police
 could bear the responsibility o f supervising the organisation of the crowd.

 The Final Poppiewell Report                                                                    V
    164.     He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 o f his Final Report. There, he came dow n more firmlv in
 favour o f noiding the club responsible for cro^d safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said "Because, as a matter of
practice, police officers have regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been
a s s u m e d by the clubs that the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed from
them to th e police. A police presence'is there to assist in the enforcement oflaw and order. Those responsible
for organising a private function, however, have the prim ary and continuing obligation and responsibility to
e n su re reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises." Mr Justice Poppleweil ended that
section as follows: “It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club, or the occupier o f the ground
who is putting on the function, that the prim ary and continuing obligation rests."

    165. T here remains, however, the question whether there are some grounds or parts of grounds where the
club may need to rely upon the police (whom they pay to attend) to control fillingof pens and monitoring them
for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the ciub. they may need,
and by agreement be entitled, to employ the police to a a as their agents in certain circumstances. This very
difficult an d grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed in greater depth at stage two
o f this Inquiry.                        •

.A rran g em ents at Hillsborough
  166. W hat is clear, however, is that de faz:o the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibilitv for
control ot the pens at the Leppines Lane end. The evidence o f the senior officers who had been concerned with
policing at Hillsborough over the years was ail one wav on this point. Only Mr Ducker.iield. who had not
policed at Hillsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.

  ' 167. M r Lock is n o w security officer at Sherfield Wednesday and was formerly a police Superintendent at
Hillsborough matches occupying Mr Murray's role. He claimed there had been a formal aithough unwritten
agreement between the Club an d the police in about 1982. whereby the police agreed to steward the Leppines
Lane end of the ground. Such a formal agreement is denied by other senior officers and I do not accept that aiiv
formal agreement was reached. Nevertheless, a practice or arrangement did develop which was known and
accepted by both Q u o and poiice. Its etfect was that throughout the ground the stewards were responsible tor
manning exits and entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for assisting spectators to their seats in the
stands a n d for helping to control the exits after the match. They were also responsible at the Kop end on the
terraces for keeping gangways clear and helping to control the crowd which usually consisted o f home
supporters. At the Leppings Lane end. however, there were no gangways on the terraces and the crowd
consisted usually (a n d always since 1987) o f away supporters. M r Mole and other senior officers accepted that
it would have been unreal and unreasonable to expect stewards to go onto those Leppings Lane terraces. Thev
would not have been effective there: moreover, they could well have been in some danger from hostile awav
supporters. The police accepted, therefore, that the proper filling o f the pens and monitoring them for
overcrowding could and would not be carried out by stewards. Many stewards have tended to be either
extremely young o r som ewhat elderly. They are paid only a modest sum (£9 at Hillsborough) and they are not
suitable either by physique o r by training to cope on a crowded terrace with no gangways.

Case for the South Yorkshire Police
  168. Notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence from senior police as already mentioned and from the
Club. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police continued throughout the hearing to contend that the Club and
not the police were responsible for filling and monitoring the pens and that this was well known to both parties.
He m aintained that the police were there essentially to secure and preserve law and order. Quite apart from the
police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance of the South Yorkshire Police has not alwavs
been to th at effect.

H arris -v- Sheffield United Football Club Limited
   169. In March 1986. the South Yorkshire Police Authority obtained a judgement against Sheffield United
Football Club for m o n e y due for police services provided at Sheffield U nited’s matches" The defence had been.
inter alia, that the police were not providing “special police services". They were doing no more than
performing their norm al police duties o f securing and preserving law and order amongst a crowd. The police
argument was that they had additional duties. In his judgement, Boreham J summarised the instructions for
policing as providing fo r-

 “(a) the m aintenance of enforcement oflaw and order.

  (b) the enforcement of the Club's ground regulations, many of which are concerned with law and order;

  (c) the safety and comfort o f the spectators, officials and players."


                                                         29
He referred to the argument o f Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police as follows:-

  “Thirdly. here the police were not discharging their own duty to the public; they were in fact discharging the
  C lub's duties to the spectators whonxthe Club invited to the ground. The Club chose to invite large numbers
  to th eir private premises: it was the Club's duty to provide for their safety, health anc com foh. They couic
  have employed a se c u r ity firm as banks and others have to do to protect their interests: they chose to recurs:
  the police to perform those duties knowing that the police expected payment. Fourthly, the police within the
  ground provided services which it was not within the scope of their public duty to perform. For instance,
  they assisted in crowd m anagem ent and in the enforcement of such ground regulations as refused entry :c
  those who tried to enter without paying or prohibited spectators encroaching on par.s of the ground which
  th e ir entry fee did not entitle them to enter. It may be. submits Mr Bentley, that the maintenance oflaw ar.c
  o rd er was the p redom inant aim but there were other services performed."

The learned Jucg e found:-
                                                 >

  “ In addition to what may be called their law and order role the police were expected and did take p a n ir.
  c r o w d m anagem ent, ensuring the safety of spectators, the enforcement of the Club's regulations and to ce cr.
  h an d to assist in the event o f some emergencies such as fire or accidental injury."

Police Practice at the Leppings Lane End
   170. At League matches at Hillsborough. the police practice was to decide in advance how many and which
pens would be used. If a m odest crowd was anticipated o nly one or two pens might be needed. It was b e tte r::
confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent them running about and (b) to reduce the num ber of police
required. The practice was then to fill the pens one by one. This involved making a judgement as to when a pe.~
was full. There would then be a police decision to close that pen and fill another. It was regarded as impractical
and unsafe for police officers Gust like stewards) to go onto the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
This m eant th at m onitoring the numbers in an y pen had to be done from vantage points outside it. Here, the
police were m uch better piaced than the stewards. There was a good view from the control box and the
television screens there. T n ere were officers on the perimeter track. No stewards were placed there because
having both police and stewards interfered with the viewing. There were also police in the west stand who
could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the police a good appreciation of
the state of the terraces. W hen it was necessan to shut off access to the pens officers or. :he concourse ccuic r ;
informed by radio and could take the necessary steps.

“Find T heir Own Level”
   171. At Cup semi-finals, a different approach was adopted. .All the pens were opened from the start and the
policy was “to let the fans find their own level” . This phrase was repeated again and again by police officers a:
the Inquiry. W hat it m eant was that no specific direction was given to fans entering through the tumstiies.
They were free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. If they became uncomt'onabie or wished tor ar.y
o ther reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
the fans on the terraces would level themselves out and that distribution would be achieved without police
intervention. O n these occasions, the gates at the top o f the radial fences were locked in the open p o sitio n .!;
was sought to argue, therefore, that there was freedom o f movement from one pen to another enabling fans ;o
“find their level” .

   172. This argum ent was bad both in theory and in practice. In theory, the whol-e object o f the radial fences
had been to achieve even distribution by directing fans into desired positions. To say then that they could move
freely from one pen to another would defeat.the object and enable fans to go from a less popular to a more
popular area w ithout inhibition. In practice this did not happen because the position and size o f the gates was
such, that once a substantial num ber of spectators were in. the gates were unnoticeaole and inaccessible
especially to those towards the front who might have most need of them.

  173. The sam e argum ent was deployed to suggest that individual maximum capacities for individual per.s
need not be assessed since the presence o f the open radial gates still meant that the terrace was One area. In
practice this simply was not so. The photograph at Appendix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.39 pm shows
very clearly the congestion in pens 3 and 4 contrasted with the sparseness in pen 6 . This gives the lie to the
suggestion that the fans could, if uncomfortable, "find thetr own level".

  174. The effect o f th is policy was that whereas at League matches the police had to make a positive decision
when to close one pen an d open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was much more likely, the poiice


                                                          30
left it to the fans themselves to “find their own level". Effectively, they were left to monitor their own comfort
and s a fe ty so as to avoid overcrowding. The police would only intervene when there was some over, sign that an
area was “full”.

When is an Area ~FuiP?
   175   O ver the vears. spectators on terraces have come to accept conditions which a rt often very
uncomfortable and not infrecueatiy downright dangerous. They are subjected to buffering and squeezing to
get in an d out o f the terraces. They are packed tightly and exposed to surging and swaying during the match.
They pu t up with these conditions because they are devoted to the game and because there is iittie they can do
about them. Thev believe the discomfort will pass and nothing very untoward will happen. Usually that is the
case and they a r e reassured by it. Mcst clubs have not. until very' recently, consulted their supporters as to their
grievances or suggestions. T he practice has been to pack them in on the assumption that if they are prepared to
nut up with it theconditions must be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
in recent vears. this has been due principally to the increased proportion of seating as against standing
accom m odation. Terraces have stii! been packed.

   176. It is said that many fans enjoy these features of terrace viewing. Clearly close proxirr.tty. shared
discomfort, weathering sways and surges together and chanting the same songs and slogans sn mcsse co evoke
good hum o ur an d have produced a soirit o r cuit o f the terraces which many enjoy. Equally there are many who
simply endure these things for ihe football, for a cheap ticket or indeed for the chance of getting :r. at ail. And
before Hillsborough most fans on :he terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had net realised the narrow
margin o f safety between an _ncomfortabie crush and a fatal one.

  177. The Green Guide sought to improve sa fe ty and comfort by laying down cr.teria for maximum
cap ac ity , ie defining what is "fuiP. The standard set was 5-i persons per 10 square metres in favourable
conditions but fewer, down to 27. in less favourable conditions. The tendency may have been to aim off too
little from the higher figure for shortcomings in the layout. Certainly the figures considered appropriate in
pens 3 and 4 at Hillsborough were too high, as a lre a d y indicated.

   I7S.     Even taxing the highest figure suggested in the Green Guide, the problem remained that those
supposed to be monitoring pens visually had and have little idea of what 54 persons per 10 square metres look
like. M r D uckenneld's opinion was that when a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be 'shoulder to
shoulder and chest to back". Tha; \ iew m a y derive from seeing the sort of density crowds regularly endure
without injury resulting. But it is much more dense than the Green Guide maximum.

   179. The South Yorkshire Fire 3rigade provided the Inquiry with photographs of people standing in an area
o f 10 square m etres at various densities o f packing. Together with my Assessors and others. I took pan in a
sim ilar experim ent at the Health and Safety Executive's Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a room o f measured
area at densities of 54. 80 an d ICO per 10 square metres. It was clear from the photographs and from our
experiment that the m axim um density set out in the Green Guide left considerably more room than those
m onitoring the terraces wouid have left beiore declaring an area "full .

    180. The te n d e n c y has been to allow the pens to fill until the fans complain or show signs o f discomfort. If
 the density at the front appeared less than at the back, the Tannoy would invite the fans to move forward to
 make room for more. The evidence before the Inquiry and many anecdotal letters I have received clearly snow
 there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused
 discomfort and sometimes, for brief periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
 eases a n d the incident passes unrecorded.                                . -

   181. After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final. Hillsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 1987.
 There was evidence that the central pens were uncomfortably overcrowded on,that occasion and again at the
 1988 C up semi-final, although entry to the tunnel was blocked off by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
 because the pens were deem ed to be -full".

 Fear of Hooliganism
    182. Over the last few years, hooliganism at and associated with football matches has strongly influenced
 the strategy o f the police. In their plans and management they have concentrated on averting or containing
 threats to public order. This is understandable and indeed commendable. But it has led :o an imbalance
 between the need to quell a minority o f troublemakers and the need to secure the safety and comfort o f the
 majority. In the police Operational Order, the emphasis was upon prevention of disorder and in particular
 prevention o f access to the field of play. There was no express requirement that officers on the perimeter track


                                                            31
or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed. the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling the unruiy since
the less room they h a d the less scope there was for misbehaviour.

Summary
   183. Although the police had accepted de facto responsibility for monitoring the pens, their policy on the
day was to leave fans to “find their own levei" and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.
Whilst in theory the police would intervene if a pen became "fu ir, in practice they permitted the test of
fullness to be what the fans would tolerate.

  184. Bv 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncomfortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries: to ajlow in a large stream was
courting disaster.

                                    T H E BUILD-UP AT T H E TURNSTILES

   185. T he decision to open gate C. and subsequently gates A and B too. was forced on to the police by the
crowd conditions which developed outside the turnstiles. The crush was so severe that injuries were being
su ffe re d an d deaths were feared unless the pressure could be swiftly relieved. Why the crowd pressure had built
to such intensity was one o f the principal issues during the hearing. The suggested causes must be considered in
turn.

The Physical Layout
    186. I have a lre a d y described and illustrated the approach to the turnstiles (Appendices 1 and 2). At
P e n is to n e Road and at many other grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced and with a
sufficient waiting area for queues to form. Not so at Leppings Lane. The building line, the bridge over the Don
and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perimeter gates set in an arc. and across a short
forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. Tne pairs o f turnstiles were close together and the forecourt, especially
as divided by the metal fence, provided little space for a waiting crowd.

The Num ber of Turnstiles
   187. T he decision to till the whole of the north stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
there to adm jt 24.256 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G) serving :he terraces had to admit
10.100. ie an average o f just u nder 1.450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road end. 29.800 were
served by 60 turnstiles, or just und er 500 per turnstile.

   188. T he Green Guide recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which specucors can pass through
turnstiles depends on a variety o f local circumstances but states “in general based on observation and
experience, it is unlikely that the maximum notional rate per turnstile would exceed "50 per hour". Since the
semi-final was an all ticket m atch requiring no cash transactions, the Club considered that a higher rate of
about 1,000 per hour per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assumes the turnstiles
working at m axim um efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly 1 %hours to acc.it all those with terrace
tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

   189. The Green Guide provides (paragraph 44):-

  “Tum stiles should be o f such numbers as to admit spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
  kept waiting for admission

   190. T he Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need, and Dr Eastwood’s various schemes, for
im provem ent o f the turnstile arrangements. T he mathematics are elementary. Both the police and the G ub
should have realised that the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the waiting area outside them would be under strain
to adm it all the Liverpool supporters in time. Success dependedon thespectators arriving at a steady rate from
an early hour and upon the m axim um turnstile rate being maintained. In fact neither o f these requirements,
which are inter-linked, was fulfilled. That they might not be so was in my view foreseeable.

The “Late” arrival of Liverpool Fans
   191. Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5.000 and became
unmanageable. The case m ade for the police was that large numbers of Liverpool supporters arrived late; a
high proportion o f them were drunk and unco-operative; a high proportion had no tickets; all of them were
hell-bent on getting in on time. They say this was unforeseeable and explains why they lost control.

   192. W hether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm were “late? was much debated. The ticket
simply requested its holder “to take up [his] position 15 minutes before kick^rT . That may have been
intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be unreasonable for a
standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm. Whether they were “late" or not.
however, there was certainly a large concentration o f Liverpool fans arriving at about 2.30 pm and after.

Traffic Delays
  193. It is unlikely that traffic conditions had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
Liverpool traffic routes. There were roadworks on the M62 which was the recommended route. At various
points the carriageway was reduced from four lanes o r three lanes to two. but no serious delays were reported.

                                                           33
On the M63 there were longer delays due to a contraflow and at its junction with the A560 there was heavy
congestion due to volume o f traffic. However, the Liverpool routes were clear by 2.20 pm and those witnesses
who com plained o f delays en route had nevertheless managed to be in range of the ground in am ple time.

Fine Weather and Drinking
    194. The likeliest explanations for the sparse Liverpool attendance in the ground before 2.30 pm were four­
fold - the warm weather, drinking, disinclination to enter the ground early and prolong the standing, and a
te n d e n c y o f Liverpool supporters to cut it fine.

   195. The police emphasised that at the 19SS semi-final there was no comparable build-up o f “late" arrivals.
They claim, therefore, that they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988. although the weather
was fine, it was 11 *F cooler than in 1989. 15 April was the s o n of fine spring day which tempted fans to sit or
stand about in the sun with a drink. If you had a ticket it would seem more pleasant and sensible to rcfax in that
way th an to en ter the ground early and stand on the terrace for an extra hour. Pre-match entertainmer.t in the
ground had been advertised but did not take place. Even if it had. it may not have been an encouragement to
many fans to enter so early.

Was D runkenness a Major Factor in the Crisis at the Turnstiles?
   196. O f those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very many had been drinking at public houses or had
brought drink from home or an off-licence. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority
were not drunk no r even the worse for drink. The police witnesses varied on this. Some described a high
proportion as drunk, as “lager-louts" or even as “animals". Others described z generally normal crowd with an
unco-operative m inority who had drunk tco much. In my view some officers, seeking to rationalise their loss
of control, overestimated the drunken element in the crowd. There certainly was such an element. There were
youngsters influenced by drink and bravado pushing impatiently at the rear of the crowd thereby exacerbating
the crush. But the more convincing police witnesses, including especially Detective Superintendent McKay
and C hief Inspector Creaser as well as a number o f responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this element as a minority. Those witnesses attributed the crush to the sheer numbers of fans all
anxious to gain entry. There was no criticism o f the crowd by any o f the witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
or even 2.35 pm. What happened then was not a sudden deterioration in the mood or sobriety of those
assembled there. No doubt those coming behind would have had more to drink and would have induced the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd became packed into a confined
turnstile area an d its very density hampered its passage through the turnstiles.

   197. Superintendent Marshall and other officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police
exhortations-to stop pushing and to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In that crush most people
had no control over their movements at all. Two incidents involving police hones illustrate the point. One
horse was found afterwards to have cigarette bum s on its rump. Clearly that was the despicable work o f a
hooligan whether in drink or not. However, there were also eyewitness accounts of a horse being physically
lifted o ff its feet by the crowd. That occurred, as the police accepted, without malice or intent but as an
involuntary consequence of crowd pressure which those by the horse’s flanks could not resist any more than the
horse itself.

Reduced Efficiency of the Turnstiles
   198. The labelling of the turnstiles in the order A. C. B was confusing. A fan with a B ticket who went by
mistake to the wrong side of the metal fence would have had the greatest difficulty in getting back and round to
the correct side. T he colour coding was inefficient because the coloured wooden panels were affixed to the
turnstile walls,so low that they were not easily visible through a crowd. Tne information on the ticket printed by
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was misleading and its layout unhelpful, as MrMackrell frankly conceded.

   199. The result was that in- the early, stages, police officers were- pestered by fans for help as to where they
should go. Later, as the crowd became more dense, fans were presenting their tickets at the wrong turnstiles.
There were also Liverpool supporters who had acquired tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Leppings
Lane. They caused delays in the turnstile operation when entry was refused and after a while the police
instructed the operators to let them through. There was further delay because the crush made it difficult for
fans to get into the turnstile entrances. Once there, the pressure from benind'was such as. on occasions, to jam
them in the doorway or against the paddle of the turnstile. Finally, there were fans without tickets who sought
to enter by offering payment, by seeking to go over or under the paddle or by sliding through with a ticket
holder. All of these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst period was only about 600 per
hour per turnstile. The waiting crowd therefore expanded and as the minutes passed frustration grew. Visitors


                                                         34
who had paid for tickets and travelled from afar realised they were making little forward progress. Frustration
increased pressure a n d induced panic at the front. Determination to ge: into the match was intensified by
determ ination to get ou t o f the crush.

Were Fans Without Tickets a M ajor Factor in the Build-Up?
  '’00. It has become a fact o f football life that fans do turn up at all-ticket matches without tickets. It is not
□ossible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable estimate of.the number without tickets on 15 April. Poiics-
estimates varied from about 200 to about 2.000. There were certainly frequent requests for tickets or "spares'
during the hours before the build-up. Many o f those warned off by the police were seen to return to the area.
Some were hanging ab o u t on the bridge. Again, however, the police witnesses who most impressed me did not
consider the nu m b er o f ticketless fans to be inordinately large. This accords with two other sources of
evidence.

   "’01 First, there was a wide range o f witnesses who observed inside the around that the Liverpool erid was at
a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 and •*. The north stand stiil had many empty seats and the wine
pens were sparse. The match being a sell-out. there were clearly many ticket holders to come and they could
account for the large crowd stiil outside the turnstiles. Had the Liverpool accommodation been full by 2.40
pm. one could have inferred that most or much of the large crowd outside lacked tickets.

  ■>02. Secondlv. such figures as arc available from the G u b ’s electronic monitoring system and from analyses
bv”the HSE suegest that no great num ber entered without tickets. They show that the number who passed
through turnstiles A to G plus those who entered through gate C roughly equalled the terrace capacity figure of
10.100 for which tickets had been sold. The Club's record showed 7.033 passed through turnstiles A to G.
However, the counting mechanism on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE did a study using the video rT:m
and projecting figures from the other turnstiles. This gave an assessment of 7.494. witn a maximum of ".544
passing through A to G. Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the number who entered the ground whilst
gate C was open at 2.240 with a m axim um o f 2.480. Accordingly, the HSE's best estimate o f the total entering
through gate C and turnstiles A to G was 9.734 with a maximum of 10.124.1 recognise that these can only be
rough checks because, for example, some with terrace tickets were allowed through turnstiles 1 to 16 and there
would be other sim ilar factors which have not formed p an of the assessment. Nevertheless, the figures do
suggest that there was not a very significant body o f ticketless fans in the crowd which buiit up.

The,“Conspiracy” Theon-
  203. On behalf o f South Yorkshire police, the theory was advanced that the "late" arrival o f so many
Liverpool supporters was planned to buck the system. The suggestion was that fans without tickets conspired
to arrive late and create such trouble as would force the police to admit them to the match. Tne slender
evidence upon which this iheory rested came from two sources: overheard conversations in public houses and
the antecedent history o f Liverpool supporters at away matches.

    204. One witness said he heard three Liverpool supporters saying, in effect, that they would manage to get
 in without tickets by causing trouble so that police-would open a gate, and that they had done this before.
 A nother witness heard, two of a group o f Liverpool supporters say they had no tickets, that they would go to the
 ground just before kick-off. that no-one would stop them getting in and that they had not been stopped yet.
 Statements were put in relating to two other small groups talking in similar terms.

 Liverpool Supporters a t Awav M atches
   205. The South Yorkshire police prepared a dossier o f repons on the behaviour of Liverpool fans at away
 matches with the object o f showing a pattern o f troublesome behaviour by large numbers either without tickets
 or with forged tickets. W ithout setting out the whoie history, it can be summarised as follows.

   206. On three occasions Liverpool fans without tickets were allowed into all-ticket matches upon payment.
 (At Watford on 13 February 1988. 1.500 were admitted: at Southampton on 24 September 1988. 150 were
 adm itted; at Southam pton again on 12 December 1988. 750 were admitted.) At Norwich on 1 April 1989.
 Liverpool su p po n ers a r r iv e d w ithout tickets bu t 1.272 tickets had been returned and fans from both Liverpool
 and Norwich were a llo w e d to buy them for cash. A similar situation occurred at Wimbledon on 13 May 1989.
 There were six other occasions from 1986 to date, including the Cup finais of 1986 and 1989. when numbers of
 Liverpool su pp o n ers turned up without tickets or otherwise behaved badly.

    207. Four points m ust be noted, however. On none of the occasions when ticketless fans were admitted for
  paym ent was the m atch a sell-out. There was therefore room in the ground on each occasion. Ai a seil-om fans


                                                            35
might not expect to be allowed in. even for payment. Secondly, no trouble o f the kind alleged was encountered
at the 1988 semi-final when Liverpool visited Hillsborough. Thirdly. Liverpool visited Hillsborough again in
January 1989 w ithout any trouble. Finally, no forged tickets were in use on 15 April apart from three crude
photocopies.

No Conspiracy
   208. I have already found that there was not an abnormally large number o f fans without tickets on this
occasion. With one or two exceptions. the police witnesses themselves did not subscribe to the “conspiracy”
theory. I am satisfied that the large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm did not arrive
as a result o f any concerted plan. There were. I accept, small groups without tickets who were willing to exploit
anyadventitious chance o f getting into the ground. They, together with the minority who had drunk too much,
certainly aggravated ihe problem faced by the police. But that main problem was simply one of large numbers
packed into the small area outside the turnstiles.

The Police Operation at Leppings Lane
  209. The Operational O rder for 15 April followed closely that laid down for the 1988 semi-final. Tne
emphasis was on m aintaining law and order. Side roads were to be blocked off to prevent carnage in residential
areas. Pairs of officers were to patrol streets to prevent “clash of rival supponers-. Officers were to watch pubiic
houses, shops and supermarkets “where looting could take place". Outside the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
supponers entering did not have banners, weapons, missiles or alcohol.

  210. Unfonunately. hooligan behaviour has made all these steps necessary. But the only written provision
aimed at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was one enjoining officers “to ensure orderiy queues are
formed". There was no provision for controlling the entry of the crowd into the turnstile area.

  211. As long ago as 1924. the Departmental Committee on Crowds stated:-

  “The control o f crowds should begin at a point some considerable distance from the entrance to the ground.
  The advantages o f an arrangement of this kind a r e ... in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds.-

This was paniculariy im p o n an t at Leppinzs Lane where the turnstile area was so small and awkwardly laid
out. If a large crowd was perm itted uncontrolled entry through the perimeter gates, the forming of queues at the
turnstiles and control by officers, whether on foot or mounted, would become impracticable. Tnose waiting at
the turnstiles would become a single growing mass. Once that happened, it would be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  212. W hether steps were taken and what steps to avoid this happening was left to oral briefing and ad hoc
instructions on the day.

Previous Experience
  213. The senior police officers said it had never happened before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two previous occasions when the Leppings Lane terraces had been used to fill the whole o f the nonh
and west sides o f the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987 and 1988. In 1987. the match was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 1 2 noon, and kick-off was postponed for a q u an e r of an hour because o f late arrivals..

Policing in 1988
  214.' As to 1.988. there was a very large and consistent body of evidence that, on the day. the police in
Leppings Lane conducted an efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those without tickets and
control the flow of fans towards the ground. I do not believe that so many witnesses without either opponunitv
or reason to put their heads together could be mistaken about what they experienced on that occasion. Yet. the
police m aintain that no filtering exercise other than on a random basis was conducted in 1988 and that their
policy and practice then were no different from those of 1989.

  215. The answer to this conflict must. I think, be that whilst the policy may have been no different, in
practice the policing in 1988 was more efficient and was not put to the same test and strain asa year later. There
was not so large a swell in numbers approaching the ground from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm as in 1989.
Nevenheless. there had been warning signs in 1988. Detective.Superintendent McKay gave the following
evidence:’



                                                          36
 “Q   Were you aware o f a build-up o f numbers last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles?

 A    Yes. • . There was a huge build-up around 10 minutes to 3 when many, many Liverpool supporters
      came at that tim e. They had been drinking, the ones that I saw and there was quite a sizeable crush
      built-up - sizeable queue.

 Q     Queue o r crush?

 A     C om pacted queue, built-up in the area by the turnstiles which I believe are marked A to G. That crcwd
       reached back alm ost to the gates. It never got any bigger than that and the turnstiles operated relatively
       freely and they dealt with that crowd. Fans were still arriving at about 1 0 past 3 but by then th e . . .

 Q    This crowd that you have described of the late arrivals at about 10 to - was it an orderly crowd?

 A    Oh no. No. The orderly crowd had gone in. and when I say they were not an orderly crowd, obviously
      mixed a m o n tst those people w ere. . .

  Q   O f course, but taking it generally?

 A    But by and large they had taken a lot o f drink on board and they were in such numbers that excluding
       them from the ground was completely out of the question.

  Q    Were they standing in an o rd e rly queue or was there some pushing and shoving?

  A    There was a lot o f pushing and shoving. There was an urgency to get into the ground.

  Q   But fortunately it does not appear to have been in nearly such'numbers as this year.

  A   It w asn't.”

Police Intelligence in Advance
  216. Apart from that experience in 1988. the tendency of Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
unknown. Witnesses said that they get through the turnstiles at their home ground. Anfieid. quite quickly ar.d
lend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent tendency to postpone arrival was noted by the
Sheffield City Council Advisory Group, with police present, on 23 Marsh 1988. The minute reads:-

  “ As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed o f people arriving some 15 minutes
  before the start o f the game hoping to gain admission. This trend may be due to the banning o f alcohol at
  sports grounds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football match. As
  the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for the majority of the time, and that the late arrival
  problem could perhaps only be dealt with by education of the spectators” (j/c).

  217. In so far as Liverpool supporters’ behaviour at away matches may have been indicative of what police
problems m ight arise on 15 April, most o f the facts should have been available at the planning stage. As in other
forces. South Yorkshire Police had a liaison officer whose job was to seek, receive and collate relevant
inform ation as to the visiting supporters. The Association of Chief Police Officers' Guide to Policing Football
highlights the im portance o f such liaison:-

  “ It is im p o rtan t that the officer responsible for policing the match determines the pre-match planning in the
  light o f the intelligence at hand. Whilst that intelligence can be obtained from a variety o f sources, the prime
  source for footbail intelligence is the Police National Intelligence System which is based on the network of
  police liaison officers. Summaries completed by police officers o f the home club force are forwarded to the
  visiting club’s liaison officer making available intelligence about fans' behaviour at both home and awav
  fixtures. This inform ation will be collated and made available for future matches involving that club”.

  218. The FA had also laid down in a m emorandum issued in the 1985/6 season measures to be adopted by
the away club which included the following:-

   “ It is the responsibility o f the away club to advise the home club o f the recent behaviour o f their supporters
   at away matches, irrespective o f whether the behaviour has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
   Association or not” .

   219. It does not seem that information of this kind was passed to the Sheffield Wednesday Club or played


                                                          37
any p a n in the South Yorkshire Police plans. Had the latier been informed of the h istorv contained in the
dossier a n d sum m arised above it may well have influenced police strategy in Leppings Lane.

  220. T h ere is presently a proposal that a national computer-based police football intelligence system should
be set up to make the necessary information readily available.

Police Intelligence on the Day
  221. T n e unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures for entry available from the
G u b ’s com puter and observations on the video screen should have enabled those in the control room to
m onitor the numbers arriving and still to arrive at Leppings Lane. Radio contact with mobiie (Tango) patrols
detailed to m onitor licensed premises in the district could have indicated the numbers still to come. But at 2-.30
pm when M r Murray told M r Duckenfield they would “get them all in by 3 o’clock” he seems not to have
appreciated that in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were many more still to come. Certainlv. Mr
Marshall outside the turnstiles was not told and could not otherwise have known that there were still manv
Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.

M r M arshall and M r Greenwood
  222. T he division o f com m and between these two officers did not help. Mr Marshall was in charge o f the
serials outside the perim eter gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
inside an d ju st outside the turnstile area. M r Greenwood’s area as Ground Commander extended from the
pitch to the perim eter gates. He in fact stationed himself near the players’ tunnel. He was whoilv unaware o f the
growing problems at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers who were under
pressure there. No-one in the control room thought to tell him.

Control Lost
  223. In the result, the large concentration o f arrivals from 2.30 pm to 1 4 0 pm pressed unrestrained into
the turnstile area through the perimeter gates which were fully open. When that area was full, later arrivals
swelled the crowd out to the forecourt and even into the road. As already recounted, the foot'officers at the
turnstiles became trapped and endangered and retired through the turnstiles. The mounted officers could not
operate am idst such a dense crowd in a confined space. They came out of the turnstile area. There were then
the belated attempts to close the perimeter gates and prevent more fans joining the mass untii it had a chance to
dim inish through the turnstiles: still later the attempt to put a cordon o f horses across the entrance.

  224. Despite knowledge o f the difficult layout, the very large num ber of fans to be got through so few
turnstiles an d the tendency of fans to arrive in the last half hour, no contingency plans were made to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the day, the need to dose Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 pm and the
other available intelligence already summarised, should have prompted those in command to take precautions
against such a crush. If some of the perimeter gates had been closed and cordons o f mounted and foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow o f fans into the turnstile area could have been
controlled before that area became engulfed. It was the crush itself which produced the frustration and the
panic and brought out the worst in those who had .drunk too much. Earlier control of entry would have
prevented the crush and maintained the good mood which had prevailed until 2.30 pm.

  225. It should moreover have been obvious by 2.40 pm. if not earlier, that a large p an o f the crowd could
not be ad m itted umil well after 3 pm. Had a decision to postpone kick-offbeen made and announced much of
the frustration and with it the impetus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A combination of
controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably have obviated the need to open the sates.

Postponement of Kick-off
    226. At various stages in his evidence, M r Duckenfield gave three accounts of whv he thought it too late to
postpone kick-off. Once it was that one o f the teams had already come onto the pitch! Then it was that a group
o f photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams were coming out. Finally he did not
know why he thought the teams were coming out. They did not in fact come onto the pitch until 2.54 pm two
minutes after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a postponement o f kick-off before
gate C was opened. It should not, however, have needed a police Constable in the thick of the crowd (and there
were others o f like mind) to think of postponing the kick-off The need should have been clear in the control
room.

  227. The truth was that Mr Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with Mr Murrav
Kick-off would not be postponed unless there were some major cause for delayed arrivals e° a jam on the

                                                        38
.•motorway o r fog. I accept that the thinking behind this policy was not callous or punitive. If kick-off is
 postponed whenever a proportion o f fans choose to leave the public houses late, the practice may grow and
 kick-off times would become meaningless. But. a com m ander must deal with the problem o f the day. Faced
 with a situation which was becoming dangerous, crowd safety should have been his param ount consideration.
  Kick-off shouid have been delayed.

Summary
   228.     The layout o f the turnstiles and the n um ber they were required to serve left no margin o f safety azainst
an uneven flow o f fans. Because police strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it. the arrival o f a
large n u m b er o f supporters between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm created an unmanageable crush. The presence of
a substantial m inority of fans who had drunk too much aggravated that problem. Having lost control and
rejected the option o f postponing kick-off. the police were faced with a serious danger o f deaths or injuries.
They were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gates. Superintendent Marshall was rizht at that
stage to ask for it an d M r Duckenfieid was right to agree. But the possible effects of so dramatic a step required
other action.

                                T H E BLUNDER O N O P E N IN G THE GATES

   229.     T h e decision to o rd er the opening o f the gates was not accompanied o r followed by any other orderto
deal with the consequences. W hen gate C was opened, a steady stream of about 2.000 fans poured through it
over som e five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground somewhere and unless they were diverted
their likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. No warning was issued from the control
room th at the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not aim ed . Neither the Club controi room
nor the C hief Steward at the Leppings Lane end was warned. Not even Mr Greenwood, the Ground
Commander, was informed. From 2.47 pm when M r Marshall made his first request untiL2.52 pm when Mr
Duckeniield acceded to it. there were five minutes in which orders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was no t done. In evidence. Mr Duckenfield began by saying that no officer mace any
wrong decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not consider where the people
would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no
order was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. M r Duckenfleld said it did not cross his m ind to detail
officers on the concourse to shut off the tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how
full pens 3 and 4 were. That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its own observations and using
 intelligence from around the ground.

  2 3 0 .1Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm. the tunnel should have been closed off whether gate C was to
be opened or not. jThe exercise was a simple one and had been carried out in 1988. .-Ml that was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
1988 clobure seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not figure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 19S9.

  231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view of the
pens and o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect
when gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas of the wings and this disaster
could still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first magnitude.

   232. Significantly, when permission was given to open gate A. Mr Duckenfield did order serials to go \o that
p an of the concourse to m onitor the influx towards the n o n h stand. He did this because he feared tha; if fans
went to the n o n h stand without tickets, they would not get seats and. there being no perimeter fences at the
n o n h side, they might invade the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety and the risks o f overcrowding. Because those entering through gate C could not get onto the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to ale n officers to m onitor them. The possibility of overcrowding simply
was not considered.

                                            TH E BARRIERS IN PEN 3

Barrier 144
  *233. The removal o f barrier 144 in 1986 should have reduced the notional capacity o f pea 3 as aireadv
mentioned. But it did more. In the absence o f barrier 144. the influx of fans after 1 5 2 pm met no retarding
structure as it came into pen 3. The pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radiai fence to
the lowest line o fb a rrie n . The pressure diagonally from the tunnel mouth down to barrier num ber 124a which
collapsed was unbroken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen
through the gap in the barrier above it created in 1985.

  234. Inspector Bullas. positioned in.the west stand, described what he saw looking down on the pens
around 3 pm.

  "... I saw from the direction of the tu n n el«. kind o f movement down the terracing... the type of thing that you
  see on the nature programmes, the molten lead flowing down the side of the mountainside, the molten lava...
  a "river o f people” ... going directly towards the pitch but there again spreading... out.”

   235. Dr Eastwood conceded in evidence that the removal o f barrier 144 was likely to have contributed to
the collapse o f 124a. Later, he sought i.o resile from that answer, but 1 think his earlier admission was correct. It
was argued that if b arrier 144 had remained, the influx from gate C would have buiit up further back and the
tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel or might have broken barrier 144 itself. This is speculative and I
think unlikely. W hat remained o f barrier 144 in pen 4 did not cause a build-up: nor did it collapse. But its
remaining in position m ay well have accounted for no barrier further down pen 4 collapsing and for the lesser
carnage in that pen.

W hen did Barrier 124a Fail?
  236. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police sought to argue that this barrier collapsed or may have
collapsed at about 2.47 pm. His purpose was to suggest that the opening of gate C was not causally linked with
the crushing and fatalities resulting from that collapse. I have already found that whilst the evidence does not
permit the time o f collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 pm. I now give my reasons:

  (a) I have several times watched the BBC video tape on which Counsel relied. I do not find the incident he
      identifies at 2.47 pm suggestive o f a collapse at that time:

  (b) the evidence o f fans who were near or at the barrier was overwhelmingly to the effect that the collapse
      occurred at or after 3 pm:

  (c) the biggest group o f witnesses was that which related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley's
      "near-miss” at the Kop end at 3.04 pm:

  (d) the appearance on video and photographs o f fans in the area ofbarrier 124a afte'r the incident at 2.47 pm
      and before the final crush is not consistent with it having collapsed so early;

  (e) it is highly unlikely that if so catastrophic an event had occurred as early as 2.47 pm. the police on the
      track and elsewhere would have taken until nearly 3 o’clock to realise something was seriously wrong.
      Indeed, if Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his timing of the collapse, the failure o f
      the police to respond for so long would expose them to even graver criticism than that made in this
      Report.

D r Eastwood’s Testing of the Barriers
   237. Two sections o fb a rrier 124a in pen 3 collapsed as a result o f the overcrowding. That collapse caused a
n um ber o f deaths. D r Eastwood and his staff had undertaken the periodical testing of crush barriers required
by the Green Guide a n d by the Safety Certificate. Barrier 124a had been tested in July 1988 and passed.

  238. The test had. been carried out in accordance with Dr Eastwood’s interpretation of Annex C to the
Green Guide. That requires an evenly distributed force o f 6.0kN/metre width to be applied for 3 five minute



                                                          41
periods, th e interval between applications to be as short as possible. A record has to be kept o f the amount of
deform ation during each loading and of the percentage of recovery-. If the-recoverv is less than 50% after the
third  application o f force, the barrier has failed the test. If recovery is between 50% and 75%. there must be a
re-test. T h e question is: 50% o r 75% of what? Is the recovery to be in relation to the position of the barrier
before th e first application o f force or before the third? If the former, a span o f 124a recorded 53% at the 1988
test and should have been re-tested. If the latter, it recorded 100% and passed. Unfortunately the Green Guide
is unclear as to the correct interpretation. D r Eastwood took the latter view and so passed the barrier. He
justified his interpretation in evidence. He said failure to recover to the original position could be due to a
“ sh ak e-d ow n" effect related to some giving in the ashes under the concrete or to some other extraneous factor
rather th an to any defect in the material o f the barrier itself.

  239. I think, after consulting Professor Maunder, that safety ought to have dictated recovery should be by
reference to the position o f the barrier before the first application of force. 1 accept, however, that the Green
Guide is ambiguous and D r Eastwood’s interpretation is tenable. It has some support from the British
Standards tests on steel structures. Clearly, however, for the future, the Green Guide should be clarified on this
point.

Corrosion
  240. Inspection o f barrier 124a. and indeed other barriers at Hillsborough, by the HSE snored
considerable corrosion o f the metal at vulnerable points where water couid accumulate. Dr Eastwood agreed
that if a significant degree o f corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a barrier should be condemned.

   241. The Green G uide does not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, inter alia-.

  "C rush barriers and balustrades should be examined for deformation or any other oven signs o f weakness".

Paragraph   6   o f Annex C provides:

   “If during any test, even though the barrier ... satisfies the above loading requirements, doubt should arise
   for any reason (including such matters as cracking o f the terracing or distortion of connections) as to the
   safety o f the barrier ... a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results o f this investigation
   remove the doubt as to s a fe ty of the b a rrie r... (it) should be deemed to have failed the test”.

  242. Since corrosion is a likely cause of deterioration, a revision of the Green Guide should make specific
reference to it.

Causation
  243. T e s t s done by the HSE suggest that although barrier 124a passed theloading test in 1988 and probably
would have been able to sustain a force which did not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist the load
im posed upon it by reason of the numbers in pen 3, the excessive gap in the barrier higher up the pen and the
absence o f barrier 144. Corrosion probably played a part, but the effective cause of the collapse was the
excessive and unanticipated pressure to which the barrier was exposed.

                                    THE CRUSHING NOT RECOGNISED

Observation from Control Room
                  i
   244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control room could be exrected
to keep a close watch on pens 3 and 4. They had a direct view of them from an elevated position thrcuzh their
window. Although they had no field-glasses. there was the zoom facility on the TV camera. Tne radio"was bv
then working again and although reception was difficult due to crowd noise and possiblv excessive air traffic
on channel 25. attem pts could have been m ade to alert officers on the perimeter track to watch for
overcrowding and report their observations. In the event, pens 3 and 4 became more and more crowded, surges
took piace. fans were showing and signalling distress. None o f this was seen or recognised in the ccntroi room.

Officers on the Track
   245. The 20 officers detailed to the perim eter track were distributed round the pitch so that some five
officers were at the west end. T neir written instructions made no reference to the avoidance o r detection of
overcrowding. Tne same applied to the officers in the west stand. Mr Greenwood admitted that his oral
briefings also contained no mention o f m onitoring the pens for overcrowding.

   246. The Operational O rder for 19S8 had instructed officers to forbid anyone "access to the track from the
terraces without the consent o f a senio' officer {except to receive medical attention)". At the end o f the 1988
semi-final, there was a m inor pitch invasion. Accordingly, that prohibition was emphasised ir. the 1989
Operational O rder by being put into capital letters. Tne combination of no instructions as to overcrowding and
a strong prohibition on opening the gates was likely to make police recognition of crushing slow and their
response reluctant. Small wonder that the growing pressure and congestion between 2.50 pm and 159 pm
went unheeded or certainly unremedied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem, the rjie resuired
consent o f a senior officer before a gate could be opened.

  247. “Senior officer" meant an officer o f Inspector rank or higher. The Inspector in charge of the 20 officers
on the track was Mr Darling. He stationed him self by the players' tunnel, the most central position for
supervising his men. In evidence he said:

  “ I would only take action if I thought crowding had got to such a stage that the fans were in danzer. I'd then
  inform ground control and I would expect som eone deployed to the back of the stand."

  That underlines the inhibition against opening perimeter gates. So did the evidence of one Constable who
said it had been so drum m ed into officers not to open the gates that when he saw distress in pen 4 . he "debated"
with him self before opening the gate, thinking: “ If I'm wrong. I’m going to get a right bollocking for this."
Naturally, one would hope that common sense and hum anity would make some officers cut throuzh the rules
and open a gate if fans were clearly in distress.

  248. This is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress and even then not immediately.
Hence, gates 3 and 4. having been opened, were shut again before they were finally opened and at first those
seeking to climb out over the ftnce were pushed back. This reaction of the police did not go on for as long as
some witnesses believed. They probably m isinterpreted the hand movements from Mr Greenwood and others
aimed at persuading fans to move back and relieve the pressure as attempts to stop those climbing out at the
front.

  249. Nevertheless, there was a period during which the failure to recognise the problem and the inhibition
against tackling it caused vital time to be lost.

                                       THE RESPONSE OF THE POLICE

The Officers in Command
  250. Even when realisation o f the problem came to officers on the track, it was some minutes before it
reached the control room . W hen spectators first-appeared on the track, the immediate assumption in the
control room was th a t a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning o f a match. It
became siill less likely when those on the track m ade no move towards the pitch. M r Motson. the BBC
commentator, recognised and said, well before the match was stopped, that the trouble seemed to be
overcrowding and not m isbehaviour. Still, the assumption to the contrary persisted in the control room. Until
Mr Murray radioed for a fleet o f ambulances, about 3.06 pm. Mr Duckenfield continued to treat the incident
as a threat to the pitch and to public order. The message calling up all available omcers mentioned a pitch
invasion. O peration Support was initiated and dog handlers were requested.
   251. U ntil C hief Superintendent Nesbit arrived, there was no effective leadership either from control oron
the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve
pressure. Some officers did this on their own initiative. Apart from the Tannov request to clear the pitch, no
attempt was made to clear and m ark ofT a casualty area where first-aid could be given without hindrance by
fans and photographers milling about between the bodies. There was no co-ordination of the eariy provision of
first-aid or o f stretcher parties o r o f the rescue effort through gates 3 and 4. No request for help was broadcast to
doctors and nurses in the crowd until about 3.29 pm when it was too late. Probably, there was little that could
have been achieved in most cases however soon doctors had been summoned, but there were marginal cases
where earlier attention might have made a difference.
   252. Tne plight o f those behind the fencing and the existence of injuries were known to officers at the scene
 from 3 pm . But the M ajor D isaster Plan was not started until 3.06 pm at earliest when the ambulance ser.-ice
was called. No request for cutting gear or for the fire brigade was made until 3.13 p.m. Again, it is unlikely that
 these services could have saved lives if they had been called promptly, but it is possible.
Police on the Pitch
   253. Despite the initial lack of leadership, many offictrs did all they humanly could to rescue and revive the
victims. M any-supporters who gave evidence paid tribute to these efforts: It is also fair to say that the number
o f officers who could at first be usefully involved at the two open gaies was necessarily limited.
   254. C hief Superintendent Nesbit's action in deploying a line of officers across the middle of the pitch has
already been m entioned. I can well understand the resentment it caused. However, the police assertion that a
rush by some fans towards the Kop end raised fears of conflict are well borne out by the video tape. In my
judgem ent. Chief S uperintendent Nesbit was well justified in using some of the many officers called up
pursuant to Operation S upport to prevent possible violence. To have had open fighting in a ground where
some 90 spectators already lay dead would have been an unthinkable and obscene development.
 Fans on the Pitch
    255. M any fans who escaped onto the pitch alive were in a state of collapse or close to it. Most o f those who
 retained their strength strove magnificently to assist the victims. They helped pull them clear; they helped with
 first-aid: they helped carry the improvised stretchers.
   256. T here were fans, however, who were distraught, angry, drunk, or all three. Their conduct in abusing,
 assaulting and spitting at the police was disgraceful, the more so since earlier police failures had little to do
 with those officers now doing their best for the injured. In addition, there were abuse and assaults on
 am bulance men and-firem en in the course of their rescue work. This was probably because their similar
 uniforms caused them to be m istaken for police. However, although the abuse was widespread, the number of
 assaults an d spittings was on the evidence comparatively small. In deploring them, one must recognise the
 uniquely horrifying experience which those responsible had just suffered and were still suffering.
 False Reports
    257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reported in the press, and said to have emanated from
 police officers present at the m atch, of “mass drunkenness". It was said that drunken fans urinated on the
 police while they were pulling the dead and injured out, that others had even urinated on the bodies of the dead
 and stolen their belongings. N ot a single witness was called before the Inquiry to support any of those
 allegations although every opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties to have any witness
 called whom they wished. As soon as the allegations I have mentioned were made,ra the press, Mr Peter
 Wright. C h ief Constable of South Yorkshire, made a dignified statement dissociating himself from such grave
 and emotive calumnies. Those who made them, and those who disseminated them, would have done better to
 hold their peace.

                                     THE PERIMETER GATES WERE TOO SMALL

       258. T h e perim eter gates in the pens were not designed as exits. They were intended to afford access by the
     police to cope with any local disorder or with an emergency. The kind of emergency contemplated was not
     massive crushing but. for example, the collapse o r illness o f an individual. Emergency evacuation o f the pens-
     had been considered by the Officer Working Parry. Although fire risk was minimal since the terraces, wes;
     stand a n d tunnel were o f concrete construction, the fire brigade were the principal arbiters of evacuation
     procedure. They aim ed to be able to empty the pens in six minutes. The plan was to evacuate spectators via the
     tunnel. I f for any reason that option became impracticable, eg due to a bomb threat, then the alternative route
     would be along the back of the terraces, through the gates in the radial fences and round the sides o f the wes;
     stand. T h e tire brigade were satisfied .that each o f these routes would enable the pens to be evacuated in less
     than six minutes, without relying on the gates to the pitch. Those gates would also be available, but their use
     was excluded from the calculation of evacuation time.

       259. T ne need to provide for speedy and large scale evacuation from the front of the pens to the pitch was
     not anticipated. The Green Guide (1986) provides as follows:

       “209. Access to the pitch must be made as difficult as possible in normal circumstances whiie at the sarre
       time ensuring that the police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose o f crowd control and
       enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event of serious emergency . . .

       214. . . . at some major soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd movement forms a necessary p an of the
       safety measures, it may be necessary to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
       circum stances . . . but allows for access in emergency.

       215. For most m ajor stadia, whether used for association football or other spons. the pitch penm eter fence
       will be required either to prevent access to the pitch as mentioned above, or at least to discourage attempts
       by spectators to enter the piaying area. Gates or other access points (minimum width 1.1 metres) should
       nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency . . . Provision o f such gates or access points is particularly
       im portant to allow full access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a place o f safetv in
       an emergency'.       Such gates or access points should be properiy stewarded and                             clearly
       m arked so that immediate access to the playing area or perimeter track can be ensured”.

       260. G ate 3 was .82 metres in width: gate 4 was .79 metres in width. There were therefore dear depanures
     from th e Green G uide standard.

        261. T he Safety Certificate provided (by Schedule 2 Paragraph 24) as follows:

       The (club) shall arrange for the Stadium to be inspected by a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer . . . at
       least once each period of 1 2 months . . . and . . . shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
       the . . . Council a Certificate by the said Chartered Engineer as to the current compliance or non-compliance
       with . . . the appropriate provisions and recommendations o f the (Green) Guide of all structural parts of the
       Stadium

        262. It was argued that there was no breach o f the Safety Certificate since the Green Guide specifically
      provides for flexibility. However, in my view the Safety Certificate cannot and certainly should'not be
      interpreted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic requirements as the size of exit gates to the total
    ; discretion o f the club and its advisers. One of the matters for consideration at stage two o f this inquiry will b e :
    ’ whether, and in what respects, the Green Guide needs to be clarified and toughened.

        263. D r Eastwood explained the small width o f the gates by reference to the dilemma facing the police. They
     wanted a gate sufficient for its intended purpose ie police access and small scale emergencies. On the other
     hand, they did not want a flood gate of such size as to endanger the prime principle o f preventing pitch
     invasions. In the light o f Hillsborough, this is perhaps the most poignant example of the difficultyof achieving
     a balance between stopping hooliganism and ensuring crowd safety.

       264. Even if the width o f gates 3 and 4 had complied with the present Green Guide standard, they would
     have been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure and release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
     Green G uide says nothing about the num ber o f gates required for a pen of given size. Whilst the Quo.


                                                                45
D r Eastwood, the Officer Working Party and the local authority can be criticised for failing strictly to conform
to the G uide, the real failure was com m on to all those who have been responsible for considering safety on the
Terraces. T he anxiety to protect the sanctity of the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to'the risk
o f a crush due to overcrowding. Certain it was. that once the crush occurred on 15 April gates 3 and 4 were
wholly inadequate for rescue purposes.                                                    i

                                       BRIEF SUMMARY OF CAUSES

  265. T n e im m ediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the failure, when gate C was
opened, to cut otTaccess to the central pens which were already overfull.

  266. They were already overfull because no safe maxim um capacities had been laid down, no attempt was
m ade-to control entry to individual pens numerically and there was no effective visual monitoring of crowd
density.

   267. When the influx from gate C'entered pen 3. the layout o f the barriers there afforded less protection
than it should and a barrier collapsed. Again, the lack o f vigilant monitoring caused a sluggish reaction and
response when the crush occurred. The small size and num ber of gates to the track retarded rescue eiTons. So.
in the initial stages, did lack o f leadership.

  268. T ne need to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. Tnat occurred because, as
both Club and police should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers
dem anded o f it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The Operational O rder and police tactics on
the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival o f large numbers should that occur in a short
period. T n at it might so occur was foreseeable and it did. The presence o f an unruly minoritv who had drtir.k
too m uch aggravated the problem. So did the Club's confused and inadequate signs and ticketing.

                                       TH E FA*s CHOICE OF GROUND

   269. T h e FA were strongly criticised by the Football Supporters’ Association and others for having
imposed the Hillsborough venue on Liverpool for a second year running. The Liverpool supporters had to
travel m uch further to Sheffield than their Nottingham rivals. The police required that if the match was to be at
Hillsborough at all, Liverpool would have to have the west and north side accommodation. The disadvantages
of that and the disparate num bers o f home supporters o f the two clubs have already been set out. Liverpool had
had to knuckle und er to the arrangement in 1988. They resented having it imposed in 1989. To hold the match
at Old.TrafTord would have been a perfectly good and acceptable alternative. Indeed, the FA nominated Old
Trafford as the venue for the replay should there be a draw at Hillsborough.

   270. M r Kelly, the FA’s C hief Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring Hillsborough, but the o nlv one
which seemed to have any validity was that the 1988 match had been considered a successfully managed ever.t.
He adm itted that a telephone call from ;he Chief Executive of the Liverpool Club protesting and putting
Liverpool's case had not been mentioned to the FA committee which finally decided the venue. M r Keily
frankly conceded that “there was an element o f unfairness" to Liverpool in choosing Hiilsborough for a second
time. I think the decision was ill-considered. No doubt in future the FA will be more sensitive and responsive
to reasonable representations.

  271. However, it was not suggested that the choice of venue was causative o f this disaster. The onlv basis on
which that could be said would be that, because o f its layout, the Leppings Lane end was incapable of being
successfully policed for ih is semi-final. 1 do not believe that to be so.

                                                    P O LIC E

Choice o f E nds by the Police
   272. T here was much bitterness amongst Liverpool supporters that they had to make do again for the
second year with the Leppings Lane end. But. cogent as their complaints were, they amounted to reasons for
choosing.a different ground altogether. Given Hillsborough as the venue. I think the police were right to
allocate the sections o f the ground as they did. The direction o f arrival and the need for segregation made it
sensible a n d to reverse the 1988 arrangements would have made for confusion. As with choice o f venue. I do
not consider choice o f ends was causative o f the disaster. Had it been reversed, the disaster could well have
occurred in a sim ilar m anner but to Nottingham supporters.

Police Planning
   273. T he O perational Order for 1989 left much unsaid. Apart from the lack o f any provision for late or
congested arrivals, or any provision for the avoidance o f overcrowding on the terraces. there was a number of
other omissions. For example, there was no specific deployment of officers to man the perimeter gates. The
O rder did not detail the duties of the m ounted officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, who included
Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling their own fans. The duties o f Superintendents (especially Mr
Greenwood and M r Marshall) were not defined so as to achieve clarity and efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision requiring mobile (Tango) patrols to assist the emergency services was omitted from the text.

  274. T he 1988 O rder was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the number of officers deployed in
shopping areas and to emphasise in capital letters the embargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
with the 1988 event led to complacency. T hat iom e thought the pens overfull in 1988 and that the tunnel was
closed o ff on that occasion did not figure in or influence the plan for 1989.

  275. M r Duckenfield was promoted and put in charge o f F Division only 21 days before this semi-final. Tne
pre-planning was already in progress under Mr Mole who had been in command both in 1987 and in 1988. It
might have been wiser to have left Mr Mole in charge o f this operation. On the other hand, it is quite
understandable that M r Duckenfield should have been expected to take command of events in his Division
from the date o f his promotion. In view o f his lack o f experience at Hillsborough and of a semi-final match,
however, it was im perative that he be fully briefed and that he should also brief himself.

   276. H e was not informed of the crushing incident in 1981 nor did he make inquiries which would have
revealed it. He did not know the arrangement as between Club and police for monitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces. He did not visit and tour the ground before approving the Operational Order. Although he attended a
m atch on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control o f the game to the Superintendents.

Policing on the Day
  277. O ne o f the regrettable features of the football scene as it has developed is the enormous expenditure of
money, tim e and effort in employing large numbers of police all over the country to guard against the sort of
disorder and m isbehaviour which have become endemic. Police management of a game o f football has become
a m ilitary operation. The problems faced and the responses received must be disheartening and may have
tended to harden police altitudes to supporters in general.

  278.. It is fair to state that over many years the South Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
public. They have handled crowd problems sensitively and successfully at a large number of football games
including m ajor matches, during strikes in the coal industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts.
Unfortunately, their policing on 15 April broke down in the ways already described and, although there were,
other causes, the m ain reason for the disaster was the failure o f police control.

   279. In ail some 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most
p a n the quality o f their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank. There were many young Constables
who as witnesses were alert, intelligent and open. On the day, they and many others strove heroically in ghastlv
circum stances aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victims. They inspired confidence and hope.

  280. By contrast, with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in command were defensive and evasive
witnesses. T heir feelings of grief and sorrow were obvious and genuine. No doubt those feelings were
intensified by the knowledge that such a disaster had occurred under their management. But, neither their
handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities ofleadership to be
expected o f their rank.


                                                        49
   2 8 1. M r Duckenfield leant heavily on M r Murray's experience. Between them thevmisjudged the build-up
at the turnstiles and did little about it until they received Mr Marshall's request to open the gate. They did not.
for example, check the turnstile figures available from C u b control or check with Tango units "as to the
numbers still to come. They did not alert M r Greenwood to the situation at th r fringe o f his area o f command.
They gave no instructions as to the management o f the crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they dedined to
postpone kick-off.

  282. W hen M r Marshall's request came. Mr Duckenfield’s capacity to take decisions and give orders
seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening of the gates, he failed to give necessary
consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. He misinterpret ed the cmergtr.ct of
fans from pens 3 and 4. When he was unsure of the problem, he sent others down to “assess the situation'
rather than descend to see for himself. He gave no information to the crowd; * •

   283. Most surprisingly, he gave M r Kelly and others to think that there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
 fans forcing open a gate. This was not only untruthful. It set off a widely reported allegation asainst the
 supporters which caused grave ofTence and distress. It revived against football fans, and especially those from
 Liverpool, accusations o f hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationwide but from Europe too. I can
 only assum e that M r Duckenfield’s lack o f candour on this occasion was out of character. He said his reason for
 not telling the truth was that if the crowd became aware of it there might be a very hostile reaction and this
 might im pede rescue work. He did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
 officer. However, reluctance to tell Mr K elly the truth did not require that he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
•although Assistant C hief Constable Jackson was at hand. M r Duckenfield did not disclose the truth :o him
 until much later.

  284. The likeliest explanation o f Mr Duckenfieid’s conduct is that he simply could not face the enorrr.itv of
the decision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom. That would explain what he said to Mr Kellv. what
he did not say to M r Jackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective contro'i of the
disaster situation. He froze.

The Police Case a t the Inquiry
  285. It is a m atter o f regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
prepared to concede they were in any respect.at fault in what occurred. Mr Duckenfield. under pressure of
cross-examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But. that apart, the poiics
case was to blame theTans for being late and drunk, and to blame the Club for failing to monitor the pens. It was
argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate C but was due to barrier 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt. It would
have been more s e e m l y and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

                         T H E C m ' CO L'NCIL AND T H E SAFETY CERTIFICATE

   236.     T he perform ance by the City Council of its duties in regard to the Safety Certificate was inefficient and
dilatory. T h e failure to revise or amend the certificate over the period o f three years preceding this disaster,
despite im p o rtan t changes in the layout of the ground, was a serious breach of duty. There were, as a result, no
fixed capacities for the pens. The certificate took no account o f the 1981 and 1985 alterations to the ground.

  287. A. num b er o f breaches o f Green Guide standards were permitted and persisted eg the spacing of the
crush barriers, the width of perimeter gates and the gradient in the tunnel ( 1 in 6 as against the Green Guide
maxim um o f 1 in 1 0 ).

  238.      T he Advisory Group lacked a proper structure: its procedure was casual and unbusinesslike. Its
accountability to the General Purposes Panel was ill-defined. Decisions were taker, informallv and too much
was left to M r Bownes. In particular, the decision to remove barrier 144 was not resrred to the Panel andouzht
not to have been made.
                                                   CHAPTER 20

                                       THE CLUB AND DR EASTWOOD

  289. It should be recorded that in general the Q u b has over the years adopted a responsible and
conscientious approach to its responsibilities. If retained the services o f D r Eastwood as consultant enzineer
and abided by his advice. For his part. D r Eastwood is skilled and experienced in this field, as afreadv
indicated, and he sought I have no doubt to act efficiently and professionally in his advice and practical work.
The Club also retained M r Lock who had acquired great experience and knowledge of Hillsborough during his
police service. A num ber of witnesses described Hillsborough as a very good ground, “one of the best in*the
country”. The police agreed that relations between them and the Club were good. Over the last four vears. the
Q u b had spent some £ 1 'k million on ground improvements. -

   290. Nevertheless, there are a num ber o f respects in which failure by the Club contributed to this disaster.
They were responsible as occupiers and invitors for the layout and structure o f the zround. The Leppines Lane
end was unsatisfactory and ill-suited to adm it the numbers invited, for reasons already spelt out. The Q u o was
aware o f these problems and discussed solving them in various ways between 1981 and 1986. In the result
there rem ained the same num ber of turnstiles, and the same problems outside and inside them. The plan for
this semi-final, involving as it did the loss of 1 2 turnstiles for the north stand and large numbers to be fed in
from Leppings Lane, was one agreed between the Club and the police. Tne Q u b knew best what rate of
adm ission the turnstiles could manage and ought to have alerted the police to the risks of the turnstiles being
swamped.

   291. The alterations inside the turnstiles and on the terraces clearly affected capacity, but no specific
allowance was made for them. In that respect, both D r Eastwood and the Club should have taken a more
positive approach. Either a scheme such as one of those D r Eastwood put forward should have been adooted
giving m ore turnstiles and total separation of areas or at the very least the capacity of the new peas and of the
terraces as a whole should have been treated more cautioLisiy. The police view in 1981 that 10.100 was too nigh
a figure was known to the Club (although D r Eastwood says not to him). Yet. despite that and the sub-division
into pens, the figure remained.

   292. .Although the police had assumed responsibility for monitoring the pens, the Club had a duty to its
visitors and the Club’s otncials ought to have alerted the police to the grossly uneven distribution of fans on the
terraces. The Club operated and read the closed circuit television and the computer rotaliser. Liaison between
Club and police on the day failed to alert the latter to the number o f Liverpool supporters still to come. Tne
onus here was on the Club as well as on the police.

   293. The removal o fbarrier 144 was the responsibility o f the Club although it clearly acted on the advice of
D r Eastwood and the Advisory Group which in this instance was misguided.

  294. Likewise, the breaches of the Green Guide were matters which the Club should have appreciated and
remedied.

    295. Lastly, as already indicated, the poor signposting on the concourse tended to produce under-filling of
the wing pens and over-filling o f pens 3 and 4. Poor signposting outside the turnstiles and the unhelpful format
o f the tickets also led to confusion aggravating the build-up in the turnstile area.

                                 FIRST AID AND EMERGENCY SERVICES

No Fault by the Emergency Semees
   296. I say at the outset of this chapter that no valid criticism can be made o f the response by the St John
Am bulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by the fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any
criticism o f them . The only attack on SYMAS came from two Liverpool doctors. One claimed thatambuiances
did not arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipment and that there was a lack of triage. He was proved to be
wrong in all three respects. Unfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April when he said more
lives coulcf have been saved if staff and equipment had arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong in fact
as to the tim es o f arrival o f ambulances, he conceded in evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives
could have been saved. His comments on television were irresponsible. The other doctor complained of :he
absence o f defibrillators. I am satisfied on overwhelming evidence that to attempt to use a defibrillator on the
pitch with people milling about would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk of injury from the electr.c
charge.

  297. I find that all three of the emergency services nam ed above responded promptly when alerted, that
they brought appropriate equipm ent and that their personnel operated efficiently.

  298. It would be unreasonable to expect, at any sports stadium, medical facilities capable of dealing with a
major disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators. stretchers, other
equipm ent and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 1 0 0 casualties is not practicable.

  299. W hat is required is a basic level of provision for first aid. for professional medical attention and for
am bulance attendance, together with a system of co-ordination with the emergency services which will bnnz
them to the scene swiftly in whatever numbers are required. What will amount to an appropriate basic
provision for the future e^the equipment in a first aid room , requires expen evaluation and advice.

   300. O n the day, there was no clear understanding between the Club and Dr Purcell as to his role. He
believed he was prim arily there to attend to the players. Tne Club regarded him also as the “physician avaiiabie
to attend at the first aid room if required- , as laid down in the Safety Certificate.

  301 .• T h ere was insufficiently close co-operation between the police and the emergency services. It is clear
that SYMAS and the fire brigade should have been called earlier than they were. However, in view of the nature
and extent o f the crushing, the tim e when police rescue began and the pathetically short period forwnich those
unable to breathe could survive, it is improbable that quicker recourse to the emergency services would have
saved m ore lives.

   302. Finally, there was evidence that an advertising board had to be knocked down at the north-east comer
o f the ground to allow an ambulance onto the pitch and that at the top o f the ramp leading to the pitch the
access for am bulances was inadequate. There was also evidence that the pre-match arrangem ent for
am bulances to use the two gates from Penistone Road at the north-east end o f the ground as in and out routes
was frustrated by the presence o f vehicles ju st inside the ground. In the event, none of these matters affected
operations. The hoarding was quickly knocked down. The difficult access to the ramp was negotiated and
am bulances used one entrance satisfactorily by backing out when loaded.

                                              COM M UNICATIONS

     303 One problem which impeded police control and the gathering of intelligence was the intermittent
f lure o f c o m m u n i c a t i o n by radio. There was the period o f two or three minutes when the control room was
out o f radio contact. Even when that was remedied, it was only by using a hand set in the control room. This
meant that control could not override any other messages. N o effective radio communication seems to have
reached control from the perimeter track at the relevant time. Mr Greenwood’s request for the match to be
s t o p p e d and various messages from Constables reporting the distress in the pens did'not register. Likewise,
c o m m u n i c a t i o n from Leppings Lane to control was unreliable. Undoubtedly these breakdowns made it more
difficult for those in com m and to make proper assessments and exercise effective command.

                                            CHAPTER 23 - INTROD UCTION

    Limited Objectives                  <
      304. It is im po rtan t to stress the limited objectives o f the interim recommenda^ons I can make in this
    Report. My purpose is to propose instant measures capabie of being implemented forthwith and where
    possible before the com m encem ent o f the 1989/1990 season. They are designed to prevent overcrowding and
    crushing on terraces in the short term and to improve safety procedures. They do not and cannot meet all the
    problems or address all the issues o f post-Hillsborough football. Wider issues such zs membership schemes,
    identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia and long term recommendations fall to be considered in mv Finai
    Report. So do a n u m b er o f other specific matters such as a comprehensive review of the Green Guide, the
    problem o f excessive pre-match drinking, fans without tickets and ticket touts. I mention these matters lest it
    be thought I have decided no. recommendations need be made concerning them. I have not. But before
    deciding what if any recom m endations to make about these and other matters, mere evidence and studv is
    required.

      305. Accordingly, the main thrust of these interim recommendations, as a holding exercise, is to reduce
    numbers on the terraces, to increase vigilance and to achieve a proper balance ir. crowd control between
    prevention o f disorder and maintenance of safety.


    Perimeter Fences
      306. It would be imprac:icai and unwise to recommend works of construction or radical structural chanees
    now. before com pleting the extensive study and consultation which will form stage r*o o f this Inauirv. Hastv
    interim recom m endations of that kind might well prove to be ill-judged after further study and require to be
    changed in a m atter o f months.

       307. In particular. I do not at this stage make any recommendation as to removing perimeter fences or
    replacing them with structures o f different design. Understandably, there was a wave of popular feeling aeainst
    such fences in the im m ediate aftermath of Hillsborough. The horrifying spectacle of people being crushed
    against the fencing focussed blame for the disaster on the fences themselves. There were pleas ;o dismantle
    them and em otive references to the fans being treated like "caged animals” . Some ciubs removed their fencinz
    straightaway. It was therefore very tempting to consider at an early stage making a recommendation that the
    fences should be removed. I confess to being so tempted.

      308. Regrettably, only a m onth after Hillsborough, there were incidents which showed that violence and
    hooliganism are still liable to erupt at football grounds. On 13 May at Selhurst Park, Birmingham Citv
    supporters invaded the pitch and fought with supporters o f the home club. Crystal Palace. Five police officers
    and 16 supporters were injured and required treatment at a local hospital. On the same day at a match between
    Bristol City and Sheffield United, spectators spilt onto the pitch and there was fighting on the terraces. At the
    Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton on 20 May, there was a pitch invasion, albeit a comparatively
    benign one.

      309. Even the Football Supporters’ .Association (FSA) felt it necessary to say in their final submission.

           '•With some reservations, the FSA accept that perimeter fences are necessary for crowd control.”

       310. Bearing in m ind those matters, and the need to consider further expert evidence. I have decided that it
    would be unwise an d premature for me to make any recommendations now either to remove or to preserve or
    to alter the structure o f perim eter fences. 1shall make recommendations about them in my Final Report.

      311. For the present. I would emphasise that, although the fencing prevented escape, the real cause of the
    Hillsborough disaster was overcrowding and it is against that danger that my interim recommendations are
    primarily directed. W hilst declining to recommend the removal o f the fences. I do consider that the gates to the
    pitch should be kept open whilst the terraces are occupied. This will have. 1 hope, three beneficial effects.
    Obviously, an open gate is a more ready escape route than one which has to be locked. Secondly, the sight of
    open gates will be reassuring to spectators on the terraces. Thirdly, the existence of gaps in the fencing bv
    reason-of the open gates will concentrate the minds o f police officers or stewards on the track to the need for
    careful m onitoring o f those on the terraces.


                                                            55
  312. It will o f course be necessary to have a police presence sufficient to prevent pitch invasion for improper
reasons through the open gates. However. I am encouraged to think that this is not an insuperable problem by
the fact that, for example at Anfield. LiverpooFs ground, there were no gates in the perimeter fencing before it
was taken down. T here were instead gaps or “ access points" as they are o ile d in the Green Guide (paragraph
215). T h e ir existence did not. so far as I am aware, prevent the authorities from maintaining order. Also, the
gates were open throughout the replay o f this ill-fated semi-final at Old Traflord on 7 May 1989.


Reduced Numbers
   313. In the assessment of figures for capacity, the criteria in Chapter 16 of the Green Guide were not at
Hillsborough, and may not elsewhere, have been applied with sufficient rigour.. Therefore, in addition to
rem inding and enjoining local authorities and clubs to make ail -necessary deductions when assessing the
figure for m axim um capacity in accordance with the Green Guide. I recommend reducing that figure bv a
further 15% as an in te rim measure.


Safety Certificate
  314. T he Safety Certificate procedure should, if it is properly administered and enforced, go far towards
achieving crowd safety. W hether it succeeds depends upon the vigilance and commitment of the local
authority issuing the Certificate. I do not know whether the poor performance of the local authority at
Hillsborough was typical. Arguments have been put to me suggesting the need for some national oversight or
inspection o f local authority certification procedures. This raises complex issues whic.i 1shall want to consider
further at stage two o f the Inquiry. For the present, I make recommendations as to the content of Safetv
Certificates and arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing them.

                                    CHAPTER 24 - THE RECOMMENDATIONS

       315. T h e recom m endations which follow are the minimum necessary to ensure that existing football
    grounds can for the present be safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at Sheffield and other
    inform ation I have received. They complement the recommendations which Mr Justice Popplewell set out
    after his inquiry at Bradford.

       316. T hose which are asterisked should be carried out before the 1989/90 season starts. The rest should be
    started forthw ith an d com pleted as soon as possible.

    Maximum Capacities for Terraces
    *   1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
      should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

        A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
        ano ther pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

    *    2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
        Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

        (a) in arriving at "the Green Guide figure'’, proper and realistic allowance must be made for ail factors
            which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
            in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

        (b) after assessing “the Green Guide figure”, a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
            margin.

    *     3. Arrangem ents should be made:-

        (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacitv
            figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically bv a
            ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

        (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.'


    Filling and Monitoring Terraces
    ★     4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
        responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
        other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
        variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

    ★     5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
        area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
        sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
        period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
        or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
        below, and by radio to the control room.


    Fences and Gates
          6. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those-with
       duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
     • crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
       demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
       different crowd densities.

    ★         All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
        different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency Exit”.


                                                             57
©   ★        8. W here there are perimeter fences* all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
            when spectators are on the terrace.

    ★         9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
            a police officer authorised to d e c id e whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
            T he officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
            stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
            either himself or via an officer close at hand.

    ★        10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
            are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
            necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
            brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it shouldbe a decision of a
            nominated senior police officer at the ground.


    Crush Barriers
    ★         11. Ail crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
            to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

    ★         12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
            complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not. the assessment of the
            maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
            reflect the fact.


    Safety Certificates
              13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
            which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
            ambulance service and the building authorin'. Such a review.should Include an inspection of the stadium. Its
            object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
            substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
            recommendations in this report.

              14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
            which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

              15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
            Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


               16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
            amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
            accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authorin’ are regularly and
            effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
            with the local authority’s rules.

                17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
             of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police; ofthe fire and ambulance services, of
             the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters’ dub. The Advisory Group's terms of
             reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
             ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
             and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
             written reports for consideration by the local authority.


        Duties of each Football Club
        ★      18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
             inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
             anticipated.


                                                                    58
★      .19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
     as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
     turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot •be done,- the capacity of that viewing area should be
     accordingly.

★      20. Turnstiles should be dosed when the permitted capadty of the area served by them is about to be
     reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
     operators for this purpose.

       21.    Closed drcuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
     concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match

★      22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
     reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
     and dear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
     area.

★      23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
     the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
     should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

★     24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
     by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
     admitting spectators to the ground.

       25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ dub as to the provision of pre-match
     entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
★     26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
    should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football dub and local authority
    concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

★      27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
     officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
     is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it

★       28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
      any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
      sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

★      29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
    - Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exerdse it

         30.     There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
      monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
      at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
      in the interpretation and use of these data.


Communications
    31.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
  received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
  priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be
  used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
  sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.
          32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
        with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.'
          33. Within the control room, there shoald be a public address system to communicate with individual
        areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
        announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
        noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
        match.
          34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
        Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
        the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.


    Co-ordination of Emergency Services
          35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
       liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.
    ★     36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
        ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
        spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
>       concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
        rooms of each of the emergency services.
    ★     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
        services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility’
        within the ground itself.
    ★     38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
        the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
        they are required.

    First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances *
    ★     39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
        dub should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

          40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
        equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
        medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.
    ★     41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
        any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
        present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
        match. His whereabouts should be known to those ia the police control room an<Lhe should be immediately
        contactable.
    ★     42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
        attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

          43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
        be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
        requirement of the Safety Certificate.

                                              SPECIFIC INCIDENTS

Mr Hicks* Evidence
   1.    M r and M rs Hicks’ two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived early en famille but had tickets
for different sections. T h e two daughters had standing tickets: they went into pen 3. Mrs Hicks had a seat in the
north stand. M r Hicks Took up a standing position in pen 1just below and to the west of the police box at about
2.15 pm From there, he had a view o f die centre pens. He kept an eye on them as they filled up since he knew his
daughters to be there.

      His evidence was th at by 2.50 pm he could see people were in distress. At about 2.55 pm he and others
called to a senior police officer at the top o f the steps to the control box to draw hisattem ion to the crushing. Mr
Hicks was oniy about 10 feet from the officer. He described him as wearing a flat cap with gold or silver braid
and a light coloured anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officerwho stopped the match. Mr Greenwood, who
did stop the m atch, was certainly not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can clearly be seen on the video.

  3. M r Hicks says th at he and others shouted several times to this officer in attempts to alert him to the
distress in the pens. T here was no reaction although Mr Hicks believes the officer must have been in earshot.

   4. T hat officer descended from the steps and two cameramen whom M r Hicks believed were from
television came and appeared to direct their cameras towards the pens. Another senior officer appeared r*o
steps down from the platform. He was a stocky figure: he also wore a flat cap but with black braid. Mr Hicks
says that he and two o r three others tried several times to capture this officer’s attention without success. Then
Mr Hicks says he shouted “ For C hrist’s sake! C an’t you see what’s going on? We can. and you have cameras". Tr.e
officer is said to have replied dismissively “Shut your fucking prattle".

  5. When the disaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. Victoria was put in an ambulance and Mr
Hicks accom panied her to hospital where she was found to be dead. Sarah died at the ground.

   6. M r Hicks was an impressive witness and. despite his grievous loss, remarkably stoical. He gave his
evidence clearly and w ithout rancour. He was certainly mistaken about M r Greenwood being one o f those on
the steps and it has not been possible to identify either officer from M r Hicks’ descriptions. He may well aJso
have been im precise as to timings. Nevertheless. I see no reason to doubt that what he described did occur in
relation to two officers. As M r Hicks generously said himself, the dismissive abuse from the second officer
(although reprehensible) may have been due to his being preoccupied with trying to see what was happening at
pens 3 and 4 around kick-off time.

The Goalkeeper and G ate 4
  7. M r B am brock. a Liverpool supporter, said he went through the tunnel. He would have liked to have
turned back when he saw how crowded the pens were. He went with his father and 13 year old brother Stephen
towards the front o f pen 4. He saw the teams come onto the pitch. Conditions at the front were, he said, alright
until about 2 m inutes to 3. Then the pressure in the pen increased and he and his father became separated. His
feet came off th e ground. He shouted to police officers through the fence to get them out and help them. The
police did not react. T h e Liverpool goalkeeper. Bruce Grobbelaar. spoke to a policeman on the track. The p te
was then opened by a blonde policewoman and about 25 to 30 people went through it. They included the
witness’s father and his brother Stephen who had a broken arm. A police Constable shut the gate. It was then
reopened by the sam e policewoman, the witness thought, and he got out.

  8. M r Eccleston, a m ale nurse and an impressive witness, was sitting in the north stand. He noticed pens 3
and 4 were full and realised som ething was wrong when fans started coming over the perimeter fence but did
not invade the pitch. He said the Liverpool goalkeeper appeared to notice this too.

  9. Mr G robbelaar was out o f the country during the Inquiry and was therefore not called. However, he
m ade a statem ent which was put in as his evidence. In the course of it he said:-

  “ Kick-off happened and we got into our stride pretty quickly-w e forced a corner pretty early on and the bail
  came down to my end - 1 rolled it out to the full back once and play went on until Peter Beardsley hit the
  crossbar o f the N ottingham Forest goal from a corner and came back into play. I remember just after that
  there were shouts an d screams from the crowd just behind me. it was different: not the ordinary crowd noise
  and 1 turned around to look. W hat amazed me first was the concentration and squash o f fans in the centre


                                                           63
sea ion, the end areas still had plenty o f space. It was only then I became conscious that the crowd was
squashing forward and wasn’t able to go sideways and that's 'when I noticed the fencing alongside them
holding them in. I saw fans being pulled up into the stand above the terraccs. I saw fans climbing over into the
empty areas at the side and I saw fans climbing o u t over the front onto the pitch which was particularly
difficult because o f the spikes on the top o f the fencing but they were getting out.
  “Play was still going on and I was in a terrible position trying to concentrate on play and having my
attention taken by what was happening behind m e. The ball came down to our end and Nottingham Forest
won a corner, it was taken and we cleared our box area and as play was going forward over the centre iine I
heard a shout, ‘Bruce - please help’ - a desperate shout from a fan squashed up against the fencing to the
right of my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces. He screamed. ‘Please get the fucking gate open - Help,
help’. All the people who could speak were pleading for help..There were two policemen near the gate right
alongside the fan who had shouted to me and so I shouted to them. ‘Get the gate open’. I was still trying to
concentrate on play and was still having my attention taken by what was happening behind me - there were
lots o f fans on the pitch behind the goal area by them too. I called again to the policemen, ‘Open the fucking
gate’ and one just turned away from me and looked back at the crowd but the other went to the gats and
opened it and it was like taking the top off a shaken coke bottle - people were everywhere on the play area
around my goal. Play was still going on and it cam e down towards me again for the left hand comer. It was
a Nottingham Forest throw-in, away to my left, the bail was out o f play and a fan came up to me on the
pitch an d said, ‘Bruce, they’re killing us’. I said ‘W ho's killing you?’, and he said ‘They’re crushing us-our
fans’. I said ‘Go and get some help', and then a policeman came on and spoke to this fan. I don’t know
who the fan was. and then he led him off. It was about this time I saw a policeman running onto the pitch
from my right across my box and to the referee who blew up, recovered the ball and told all players to clear
the pitch."
   10. It is clear from the video that M r G robbelaar’s recollection of the sequence o f events, even with regard
to the game, is inaccurate in a num ber o f respects. For example, the two Nottingham Forest corner kicks
occurred minutes before Beardsley struck the bar. Further, it seems highly probable from other evidence that
gates 3 an d 4 were open continuously well before M r Grobbelaar says the fan asked him to get the gate open. It
seems surprising too that with all the noise M r G robbelaar would hear the precise words of an individual fan,
let alone respond twice to them , whilst the game was in progress.
  11. .As to M r B am brock’s account, the evidence of PC Fiona Richardson was that she was the only
policewoman on the track in the early stages although others came from the seated area as the incident
developed. PC R ichardson began at gate 1 and, although she did go and help people out through gate 3. she
did not go to gate 4, and did not open it twice or even once. The two officers who spoke o f opening gate - were
both made.
  12. I think M r G robbelaar did become conscious o f distress in the crowd behind him and did speak to a
police officer at some stage, probably earlier than he now thinks. Not to reach that broad conclusion would
involve attributing his whole account to invention or fantasy and I see no grounds for doing so. However, his
detailed account was not tested in cross-exam ination and its inconsistencies and errors when compared with
other incontrovertible evidence would make it unsafe to derive more than the broad conclusion stated above.
The incident shows how honest witnesses can becom e confused and their evidence flawed when recollecting
events experienced under tension or emotion.
   13. As to the opening o f gate 4 there was an apparent conflict of evidence. PC Illingworth said that about
five m inutes to 3 he opened it and guided fans emerging through it to gate 5* PC Hooson said that it was he
who opened gate 4 ju st before kick-off. I am satisfied from the evidence o f a number o f fans that, like gate 3,
gate 4 was opened m ore than once. The probability is. therefore, that whilsj.PC Illingworth was shepherding
fans to gate 5, gate 4 had been closed again until it was re-opened by PC Hooson two or three minutes later.
Oxygen
   14. It was alleged by a doctor that an oxygen cylinder provided to him on the pitch was empty. D r Phillips, a
Liverpool supporter, had been in pen 3 with his brother and others. He came under pressure and climbed into
pen 2. W hen the disaster occurred and gate 2 was opened, he went through it, injuring his head as he did so. He
came onto the pitch som etim e after 3.10 pm and started resuscitation procedures. He was given an oxygen
cylinder. He believes this was from St John Am bulance. It was. he thought, too early to be the fire service. The
cylinder was switched on but D r Phillips says it gave no oxygen since it was empty. There was one oxygen
cylinder on the St John’s am bulance which came to the scene. Mr Wells, the Divisional Superintendent of St
John, took that cylinder onto the pitch. He said it was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a patient being
treated by Dr Phillips and says that oxygen was flowing into that patient. Moreover, Mr Wells tested the
cylinder afterwards and found it was still half full. It has a capacity that will last for 5 hours 40 minutes on a
high-s«iting.


                                                          64
   15. There was evidence from Assistant C hief Fire Officer Hornsby that a Maxaman resusritator had failed
to work p ro p eriy .lt was delivering an oxygen flow appropriate to a “child" setting rather than a full “adult"
flow. On exam ination, it was found that a retaining n u t in the control knob had worked loose, possibly due to
vibration in transit, a n d this had affected the flow o f oxygen. The device had last been tested on 10 April 19S9.
  16. I accrpt the evidence o f M r Wells that the St John Ambulance cylinder was charged with oxygen and
working properly. In my view, D r Phillips may have been mistaken as to the cylinder o f which he complains
being empty. He agreed he was under great pressure, in an awkward situation: his head was injured and he
became very angry at what he regarded then as wholly the fauit o f the police. He conceded that if the cylinder
was not em pty there was a possible alternative - that the master tank top valve was shut. It seems unlikely that
he could have been referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was clear that the bottle he received was a
simple piece o f equipm ent not designed to breathe for the patient but merely to supply oxygen.
  17. I conclude that on a balance of probabilities the evidence does not justify a finding that an empty
cylinder was brought to the scene.
Calling the Fire Service
   18. PC Bichard’s call to police Headquarters at 3.13 pm for the fire service to bring hydraulic cutting
equipm ent to cut metal fences (see paragraph 101 supra) was heard by Chief Inspector Edmundson. He went
into the adjacent operations room to give instructions for the message to be passed to the fire service. There, a
temporary control room assistant was already speaking to the fire service about a house fire. Mr Edmundson
interrupted the call and asked the assistant to tell the fire service that cutting equipment was wanted at
Hillsborough. There followed a conversation between the assistant and Miss Davies at the fire service in the
following terms: -
  Police          Can we have cutting gear for Hillsborough, please - straight away?
  Fire Control    Just a minute. Right - what’s the address?
  Police          C utting equipm ent for Hillsborough football ground - straight away.
  Fire Control     Hillsborough football ground?
   Police          Yes, Hillsborough football ground.
   Fire Control    W hat road is that on? Do you know?
 . Police         J h e r e has been a m ajor accident, all the ambulances are up there.
  Fire Control     W hat road is it on?
   Police          I.have no idea; Hillsborough football ground.
   Fire Control    W hat road is it on? Do you know?
  Police           “Hillsborough football ground - what road is it on?” (this was said to someone in Police
                   Force Control) - “Penistone R oad” (to Fire Control).
  Fire C ontrol    Penistone Road.
   Police          Penistone Road, OK.
   Fire Control    Penistone Road, just a m inute - what’s exactly involved?
   Police          It’s football, a big m atch, Liverpool v Notts Forest.
   Fire Control    Yes. but why do you want us; you said it was an RTA [Road Traffic Accident].
   Police          No, no, no; m ajo r incident inside the ground.
   Fire Control    M ajor incident inside - do you know exactly what it is?
   Police          No, I don’t; they want all the cutting gear.
   Fire Control    For what - do you know?
   Police          Hang on a sec.
  At that point C hief Inspector Edmundson intervened and spoke for the police. The conversation
concluded:-
   Police          (M ale voice)-H ello!


                                                          65
  Fire C ontrol   Hello! Now you wnt some cutting gear - what exactly is it for?

  Police          There has been a m ajor accident a : Hillsborough football ground ■where the semi-final is;
                  the crowds have forced their way in, they have broken fences and gates down. I don’t know
                  exactly w hat it is but there are people trapped.

  Fire C ontrol . RightJ O K - leave it with us.

  That conversation took 1 m in u te 13 seconds. It was published in a number o f newspapers with strong
critical com m ent mostJy against the fire service. T h e thrust o f the criticism was that valuable tim e was wasted
by the fire service asking unnecessary questions as to where and why curling equipment was required.

   19. T here was a m eeting o f the emergency services in August 1988 to discuss procedure in the event o f a
major disaster at Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. It was pointed out and minuted that “It was imperative that
the Police C ontrol give the exact location of any fire or incident and as much detail as possible. No senior fire
officer is on duty at the m a tc h :. . Fire service will attend via Penistone Road or Leppings Lane as directed by
the police.”

   20. T he message from PC Bichard contained all the necessary information - Leppings Lane end. hydraulic
cutting equipm ent, to cut metal fences. Regrettably, it was not passed on by Headquarters in those terms. Miss
Davies had rightly been trained to require a precise location and needed to know the problem which would face
the fire service so th at the appropriate response could be made. In fact, there are several football grounds in the
Hillsborough district although clearly Sheffield Wednesday’s ground is the principal one. In the result,
although C h ief Inspector Edm undson clarified, to an extent, the nature of the problem, the locus which
emerged in the course o f the conversation (Penistone Road) was not that contained in the originai message
from ground control (ie “Leppings Lane end.") W hilst on the face o f the conversation the fire service may seem
to have been slow in the uptake or perhaps pedantic, in my view the police ought to have been more specific.
They had the necessary inform ation to be so.

  21. I am satisfied, however, that the delay o f 1 minute 13 seconds over the call, and even the delay
occasioned by the cutting equipm ent going to Penistone Road rather than Leppings Lane, did not affect the
outcome: Even had those with cutting equipment gone directly after a briefer 'phone call they would not have
arrived at a stage early enough to m ake cutting the fencing a helpful exercise.

M r Kenny Dalglish
  22. W hen the Liverpool’ m anager went to the control room and agreed to make the announcement
broadcast at 3.56 pm, he says in a statement that he could not get the Tannoy to work. Spectators could see
him trying to address them and indicated to him manually that nothing could be heard. An officer pressed
buttons on the m achine and M r Dalglish says he tried again with similar lack o f success. He was then taken
under th e police box to the room used by the disc jockey to broadcast pre-match music. There, the microphone
worked and he broadcast his message.

   23. M r Dalglish was not called. There was no other evidence about this incident. I accept it occurred as he
described. W hy the Tannoy could not at that tim e be successfully operated from the police box is. however,
strange and unexplained. Unlike the radio, it had operated satisfactorily from the police box at the critical
times save th a t its messages may not always have been heard above the prevailing noise. It had worked at about
3.30 pm when it called for medical staff. I can see no grounds for criticising the police in regard to this incident
and certain it is that the briefdelay in relaying M r Dalglish's message can have had no significant effect.

      Football Stadium, S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y ' s ground. O n ly six m i nu t es
      into the game, play was s to p pe d w h e n it was r e a l i s e d that spec t at o rs
      on the t e r ra c es b e h i n d the Liverpool goal had been s e v e r e l y crushed.
      In the result, 95 d i ed and a p p r o x i m a t e l y 160 r e c e i v e d hospital

      First Aid
1.2   The St John A m b u l a n c e B r i g a d e had some 30 personnel p o s t e d r ound the

       q u i c k l y on the s cene w h e n the f irst c a s u a l t i e s e m e r g e d and soug ht to
       r e vi v e them. T h ei r Divisional S u p e r i n t e n d e n t t ried u n s u c e s s f u l l y to

1.3   S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y ' s d o c t o r c a m e f r o m his seat in the s outh stand
       and a t t e m p t e d r es u sc i t a t i o n . A s s i s t e d by a m al e n u r s e f r o m the
       crowd, he m o v e d from p a t i e n t to p a t i e n t d o i ng w h a t he could, but in
      m o s t cases it was too late.
1.4   At 3.13 p m a St J o h n ' s A m b u l a n c e came o n t o the p i t c h at the
      n o r t h - e a s t c o r ne r and d r ov e to the p e r i m e t e r fence c l os e to g a te 3.
      As the m i n u t e s t i ck e d p as t do c t o r s and nurs e s in the c ro w d c am e onto

       and the a m b u l a n c e and r e a l i s e d the g r a v i t y of the s i tuation. Many
       fans also w o r k e d p r o d i g o u s l y in a t t e m p t s to r evive the d ea d and the
       dying, in some cases t h e ir own r e l a t i v e s and friends. Arti f ic i al

       a p p l i e d by the s k i l l e d and the u n s ki l le d , but u s u a l l y in vain.
      T h o s e c a p a b l e of survival m o s t l y came c o u n d of t h ei r own accord.
      The rest w e r e m o s t l y d o o m e d b e f o r e they c o u l d be b r o u g h t out and
       treated.
1.5   T h e r e was an u rg e nt need to get c a s u a l t i e s off the p i t c h and to

        d e t a i l s o f i n j u r i e s and cause o f deat h.        This i nformati on i s
        required by HM Coroner under whose a u s p i c e s they work.                        Following
        Hi l l sborough, po s t mortems were performed in the S h e f f i e l d
        Medico-Legal Centre.

5.2    A team o f p a t h o l o g i s t s headed by P r o f e s s o r Usher completed
       post-mortem exami nati ons on a l l the deceased wi t hi n 48 hours. They
        found t hat 88 o f the v i c t i ms were male and seven female.
       T h i r t y - e i g h t were under 20 ye a r s o f age, 39 were between 20 and 29
       years and only t hree were over 50.                   In v i r t u a l l y every case the
       cause o f death was crush asphyxi a due t o compression on the c h e s t
       wall a g a i n s t ot her bodi es or f i x e d s t r u c t u r e s so as t o prevent
        inhalation.            In a l l but nine c a s e s t h a t was the s o l e cause.     In one,
       p r es s ur e on the c h e s t had been so gr e a t as to rupture the aort a; in
       s i x ca s e s t here were a l s o i n j u r i e s t o t he head, neck or c h e s t ; in
       the remaining two c a s e s , natural d i s e a s e was a c o n t r i b u t o r y f a c t o r .
       In 18 c a s e s bones were f r a c t u r e d .      Thi rt een o f t hos e were rib
       fractures.             However, one was a f r a c t u r e d femur, one a fract ure d
       radius and the remaining t hree i nvol ved f r a c t u r e s o f bones or
       c a r t i l a g e s round the v o i c e box. These i n j u r i e s s u g g e s t the v i c t i ms
       may have been trodden whi l e on the ground.

5. 3   The d i s a s t e r , u n l i k e an e x p l o s i o n or pl ane crash, had l e f t a l l o f
       the bodies i n t a c t and for the most part i n s t a n t l y r e c o g n i s e a b l e .    It
       was unnecessary t o r e s o r t t o compl i cat ed i d e n t i f i c a t i o n procedures
       such as X-ray and dental c h a r t i n g . At the Coroner's s u g g e s t i o n ,

       and t h e s e , a p p r o p r i a t e l y numbered, were e x h i b i t e d in an ante room

       i d e n t i f i c a t i o n from t h e s e photographs, the numbered body was taken
       from the mortuary area i n t o a r e l a t i v e l y small screened o f f space
       i n s i d e the main gym where i d e n t i f i c a t i o n was confirmed. No
       r e l a t i v e s were requi red to s ee more than one body at a time and they
       were spared the harrowing t as k o f walking between rows o f corpses
       s eeki ng to i d e n t i f y t h e i r loved one. A f t e r i d e n t i f i c a t i o n , the
       newly bereaved were gi ven over t o the s o c i a l workers, q u a l i f i e d
       c o u n s e l l o r s and c l e r g y in a t h i r d compartment o f the gym.

       teams o f up t o s i x p a t h o l o g i s t s carr yi ng out post mortems at the
       same time. The p a t h o l o g i s t s , some from the U n i v e r s i t y and some from
       the NHS, were o rga ni s ed to work in morning, aft ernoon and evening
       s e s s i o n s , but no p a t h o l o g i s t was t o do more than two s e s s i o n s in any
       one day. Using t h i s system 70 p os t mortems were performed on Sunday
       16 A p r i l , and the remaining 24 were performed on the morning o f
       Monday 17 A p r i l . The v a s t ma j or i t y o f bodi es were r e l e a s e d t o the
       r e l a t i v e s on Wednesday and Thursday, 19 and 20 A p r i l , and the l a s t
       body was removed from the Centre on Monday 24 A p r i l .

A MERSEY GENERAL PRACTITIONERS EXPERIENCE

On the Saturday o f the Hi l l sborough d i s a s t e r I was on c a l l f or my
P r a c t i c e , which i s s i t u a t e d in Runcorn New Town. Runcorn i s c l o s e
to Liverpool and has a high popul at i on o f ex - Li v e r p u d l i a n s amongst
its residents.              Our P r a c t i c e covers two o f the manor e s t a t e s .  We
have a t o t a l P r a c t i c e popul at i on o f about 10, 000 p a t i e n t s .     My two
s t epsons are avid Liverpool supporters and so when my w i f e and I
came in on t h a t Saturday afternoon we switched on the TV t o catch
the second h a l f o f the Liverpool game.                 I t soon became apparent t hat
a t e r r i b l e d i s a s t e r had taken p l a c e and we were both q u i t e stunned
as the death t o l l continued to mount. Our personal r e a c t i o n was one
o f shock and d i s b e l i e f at the s cenes on the t e l e v i s i o n .

Fa i r l y s h o r t l y I began to r e c e i v e c a l l s from p a t i e n t s with r e l a t i v e s
who had gone t o the match and whose whereabouts were not known.
Later in the evening and throughout the n i gh t I r e c e i v e d c a l l s from
r e l a t i v e s o f people who had returned from the match and who were
o b v i o u s l y in deep d i s t r e s s . I had completed a two year p a r t - t i m e
course in c o u n s e l l i n g and a l s o my wi f e i s employed by the P r a c t i c e
as P r a c t i c e Couns el l or. My advi ce g e n e r a l l y was t o l e t pe opl e t a l k
and to l e t them repeat themselves i f t hey wished t o , to encourage
them to ex pres s t h e i r emotions, to al l ow them t o c r y, and t o touch
ttiem and p h y s i c a l l y demonstrate support.

By Sunday morning with many c a l l s s t i l l coming in i t became apparent
t hat we would need to or ga n i s e some form o f d i s a s t e r c o u n s e l l i n g
with a number o f pe op l e , and t hat we would need to s t a r t t h i s f a i r l y
immedi ately.      I t h e r e f o r e asked everyone t o c o n t a c t the surgery on
Monday morning for f u rt her d e t a i l s o f a group for anyone who wanted
i t , and a l s o to c o n t a c t the surgery i f they requi red i n d i v i du al
counsel 1ing.

We spend most o f Sunday afternoon and evening w r i t i n g out p o s t e r s
f or p u t t i n g up in the surgery and d u p l i c a t i n g a handout on the
P r a c t i c e p h o t o c o pi e r . We decided to hold group s e s s i o n s every
eveni ng so t h a t peopl e could choose which ones they came t o , and
a l s o o f f e r i ndi vi dual c o u n s e l l i n g at ot h e r times t o s u i t p a t i e n t s .

We warned a l l the r e c e p t i o n i s t s on the Monday what was happening and
they q u i c k l y d i s t r i b u t e d t he handouts which we had provided and had
t o d u p l i c a t e more s u p p l i e s .   Four men attended the f i r s t group
meeti ng, a l l o f whom had been at the match, al though not d i r e c t l y
i nvol ved in the crush. Two o f t h e s e had a couple o f s e s s i o n s o f
i ndi v i dua l c o u n s e l l i n g . A f i f t h man, who had been i n j u r e d , came t o
f u rt her group s e s s i o n s .

We kept the s e s s i o n s going f or two weeks a f t e r the t ra gedy .        This
was p a r t l y because the p a r t i c i p a n t s f e l t they did not want any
f urt her help at t h a t time and p a r t l y because o f the rapid response

This can summarised as:

*   Post-Traumatic S t r e s s Disorder

Pos t - t r auma t i c s t r e s s di s or d e r (PTSD) i s a term given t o a range o f

groups o f symptoms:              ' d e ni al / numbi ng1 with withdrawal, r e p r e s s i o n

and nightmares. Concomitant symptoms i ncl ude a n x i e t y , anger,
ag g r e s s i o n and psychosomatic symptoms.

Normal bereavement r e a c t i o n s i ncl ude i n i t i a l shock, d e n i a l , anger

Vul nerable i n d i v i d u a l s may be p r e c i p i t a t e d i n t o a n x i e t y or

The degree and type o f morbi di t y experi enced can be r e l a t e d to the
nature o f the d i s a s t e r and the i n d i v i d u a l ' s personal expe r i e n c e of

       A Word o f Warning

9.2    This paper i s an attempt t o review how the churches responded t o the

       when another d i s a s t e r s t r i k e s .              The l e s s o n s are not meant to be
       prescriptive.               D i s a s t e r s , by t h e i r very nature, produce chaos .
        People are in shock, v i c t i m s , mourners, emergency s e r v i c e s and
       helpers.            You cannot plan where the d i s a s t e r i s l i k e l y to take

       The Hi l l sborough Story

9.3    My invol vement was one o f those s t range i n c i d e n t s .           The t e l e v i s i o n

       c l e r g y at a v i c a r a g e near enough to the ground to be a c c e s s i b l e , but
       where parking would not be a problem. By a combination o f a l i f t
       and walking we a r r i v e d a t around 4 pm. We found the Club Chaplain
        (a Methodist m i n i s t e r ) , who was abl e to g i v e us the f i r s t hard
       i nformat i on; a t l e a s t 50 or 60 dead. The p o l i c e are going to

       s t range q u i e t n e s s , as thousands moved home, so we ran.

9. 5   Our f i r s t major problem was a broadcast appeal f or hel per s - s o c i a l
       workers and ot hers to come to the Boys' Club. At the same time as
       the f i r s t enqui ri ng f r i e n d s and r e l a t i v e s were a r r i v i n g , hordes o f

       need, g i v i n g them space and support, was in danger o f becoming
       secondary to the t as k o f managing the log-jam o f h e l p e r s .                          Soci al
       S e r v i c e s began t o take names and send some home, a l s o t aki ng o f f e r s

       with the bereaved, but were f r u s t r a t e d f or lack o f c l i e n t s . What the
       uncert ai n enqui rer wanted was a q u i e t s upport i v e r e l a t i o n s h i p which
       asked nothing o f them. We t r i e d to a t t a c h a s o c i a l worker and
       clergyman to each enqui ri ng f r i e n d or small group. At t h i s s t a g e we
       were s e e i n g people who had been at the                        match, some whoknew
       r a t i o n a l l y t hat t h e i r f r i e n ds were dead, or s e r i o u s l y i n j u r e d , but
       who wanted to know f or s ure.                     Two coaches p u l l e d up o u t s i d e , wa i t i n g

       s t i l l not sure whether t h a t was r i g h t or a p p r e c i a t e d .

9.6     Information was s c a r c e .                We had been given an I n s p e c t o r to a c t as
       our Liai son O f f i c e r with the p o l i c e .             He seemed t o know almost l e s s
       than we did about what was happening. The s o c i a l workers were
       making l i s t s , the WRVS t e a and sandwiches, and the c l e r g y wondering
        i f they were being any u s e .                  I was r e l i a n t on messages from one or
       two hel pf ul i t i n e r a n t c l e r g y who were moving between the two
       h o s p i t a l s and the Boys' Club.               I was t o l d more help was needed at
       the Northern General H o s p i t a l , so some were despatched up t h e r e .
       Queues for the t e l e phone were e n d l e s s .                 Soci al S e r v i c e s produced two

       t h a t a l l the bodi es were a t the ground and they wanted us to take a

       t hey i d e n t i f i e d the b o d i e s . We a l s o had to make sure t h a t t here
       were s u f f i c i e n t c l e r g y and s o c i a l workers l e f t to r e c i e v e coaches
       and cars coming from Liverpool who were probably going to be

       a church hal l about quart er o f a mi l e away.                        I chose an ecumenical

       or c l e r g y who were not prepared to work t h i s way were c l e a r l y t o l d
       t h a t t h i s was the arrangement.

9.7    The bodies were in the gym underneath the North Stand.                         I t had beer

9.8    When we a r r i v e d , the p o l i c e wanted us to at t a c h our support a f t e r
        the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n had taken p l a c e . This was c l e a r l y unacceptabl e
        and the p o l i c e q u i c k l y learned t h a t we were most hel pf ul i f there
        was an e s t a b l i s h e d r e l a t i o n s h i p bef o r e the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n proces s

        unreasonabl e for the p o l i c e to exp e c t g r i e v i n g r e l a t i v e s to queue
        f or hours in the f r e e z i n g temperatures wa i t i n g to go through the
        dreaded blue doors. One clergyman, who was a l s o Chairman o f the

        l i s t s o f peopl e as they ar r i ve d and then went with t h e i r ' p a i r ' to
        wai t in the warm in the a n c i l l a r y rooms to the gym. His red-caped

        sorre s e c u r i t y as a someone c l e a r l y in c o n t r o l .

9.9    As news spread o f the body i d e n t i f i c a t i o n process a t the ground,

        o f f e r o f prayer a t the appropri at e moment. All were accustomed to
        death; most had seen and touched dead b o d i e s . Clergy and s o c i a l
       workers had learned t h a t i t was not words t h a t counted, but an
       embracing, supporti ng p r e s ence.                  Clergy were good at being a
       presence and t a l k i n g j u s t s u f f i c i e n t l y t o t hose in shock. The
       oc c as i onal b i b l e was soon put way and maybe i t was the e v a n g e l i c a l
       c l e r g y who l earned the most.               But we a l l learned q u i c k l y as we were
        doing the j o b .            The c l e r g y were not a f r a i d to touch the dead and the
        living.            The s o c i a l workers were a b l e to meet the physi cal needs,
       al though t here were i n s t a n c e s o f f a m i l i e s spending the n i gh t in
       c l e r g y homes.          I t was o f t e n the c l e r g y (male and female) who were
       c l o s e s t when the green bag was opened to reveal the o f t e n

       opport uni t y t o hold and touch the b o d i e s , however b r i e f l y .             During
       the f o l l o w i ng days, the g l a s s window a t the mortuary t hat s eparated
       mourners from t h e i r loved ones proved a s e r i o u s and pai nful b ar r i e r

          i s a real r o l e for me. At l a s t I am doing something nobody e l s e can
          d o ' , and to avoid r e c o g n i s i n g the t o l l i t was t a k i n g .    By 3 and 4
          am I was sending peopl e home a l s o , in the b e l i e f t hat the flow o f
          r e l a t i v e s was c e a s i n g . A busload a r r i v e d from the r e c e p t i o n c e n t r e
          with an attachment o f s o c i a l workers and c l e r g y , t hr e a t e n i n g our by
          then smoothly ope r at i ng system. At 5 am we were short - handed, the
          few remaining, i n c l u di ng my s e l f , having to carry q u i t e a load.
          People who had been d e s p e r a t e l y seeki ng s ur v i vo rs at the h o s p i t a l s
          were a r r i v i n g to f i nd t h e i r worst f e a r s confirmed. Hopes dashed
          were sometimes the most d i f f i c u l t t o handle.

9. 11   Thi rdl y, the working r e l a t i o n s h i p s with p o l i c e and Soci al S e r v i c e s
          improved immensely as the eveni ng wore on. We began to r e s p e c t and
          val ue each o t h e r , even support and care for one anot her. One p o l i c e
          o f f i c e r , who was r i g h t a t the heart o f the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n p r o c e s s ,
          was r e l i e v e d a f t e r the c l e r g y poi nted out how much s t r e s s he was
          under. We learned from each other and began to s ee one another as
          human bei ngs with i ndi v i dua l needs and g i f t s behind the uniforms
          which o f t e n produce the wish to s l o t people i n t o s t e r o t y p e d images.

9. 12     Fourthly, the r o l e o f the Bishop was important. With h i s Press
          O f f i c e r (a v i t a l adj ut a nt on an o c c a s i o n l i k e t h i s ) he came, saw,
          l i s t e n e d and went. Sunday f ol l owed and the need for a Cathedral
          event o f some kind was obvi o us . We d i s c u s s e d i t b r i e f l y and f i x e d
          U as the need for some focus o f prayer and worship, i f only for
          t hose i nvol ved as c a r e r s , was going t o be s u b s t a n t i a l .        I t was good
          for t hos e who were working so hard to know t hat he had been, seen
          and shared. The Archbishop o f York f u l f i l l e d a s i m i l a r r o l e on the
          Tuesday f o l l o w i n g .

9. 13     F i n a l l y , we l a t e r l earned how good an environment we had e s t a b l i s h e d
           in many r e s p e c t s for the i d e n t i f i c a t i o n p r o c e s s . I returned a few
          weeks ago and was st ruck by how much space we had in the gym
          compared to the f a c i l i t i e s a t the mortuary. There was a need for
          space - a space to touch, t o weep and not to be hurri e d.                          The gym
          provided t h a t .          The Medico-Legal c e n t r e , as i t i s known, d e s p i t e the
          support and e x p e r i e n c e o f the s t a f f , could not provide nearl y as
          wel 1.

9. 14     An hour or so at home, and then I had to t hi nk i f the rota we had
          arranged, with the help o f the Rural Dean, f or the Medi co-l egal
          c e n t r e was in p l a c e f or i t s opening a t 9 am. We needed c l e r g y t here
           for the r e s t o f the week u n t i l the bodies were removed.                        I went to
          the h o s p i t a l s t o s ee the c h a p l a i n s . At the Northern General the
           load had f a l l e n on a new but abl e woman deacon a s s i s t a n t chapl ai n;
           the f u l l - t i m e chapl ai n was in A u s t r a l i a .      She had s u f f e r e d some o f
          the outrageous t reatment t h a t some male c l e r g y di sh out to t h e i r
           female c o u n t e r p a r t s , i gnori ng her and moving wi thout r e f e r e n c e to

           supposedly on s a b b a t i c a l , had been t here in the end o f provi de the
          support and a u t h o r i t y she needed. Denominational ism was more market
          at the h o s p i t a l s , each chapl ai n a l r ea dy being c l e a r l y d e l i n e a t e d
           r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s and a u t h o r i t y . The Royal Hal lamshire seemed to
           have s urvi ved the ordeal a l i t t l e b e t t e r , the Hospital Chaplain
           seemed exhausted but c o n t e n t t h a t procedures had worked reasonably

          media. There were no e x p e c t a t i o n s at t h i s s t a g e o f the need for

          The need f or r i t u a l mourning, a focus for the pain hadn' t y e t
          emerged.

9 . 15   The week held much in cont inued work with the bereaved, enormous
          media i n t e r e s t and the need to be cari ng f or t hos e who had done the
          c a r i n g . On the Tuesday eveni ng, a l l t hos e who had helped in the
          c l e r g y teams in r e c e p t i o n c e n t r e , mortuary, or h o s p i t a l s were
          i n v i t e d to B i s h o p s c r o f t t o l i s t e n to the e x p e r i e n c e s o f a m i n i s t e r
          who had been through a s i m i l a r ordeal at the Kegworth a i r c r a s h .
          Then in small groups, we t o l d our s t o r i e s with en ab l e r s who had not
          been d i r e c t l y i n vo l ve d .           We d i d n ' t a l l ow our f e e l i n g s on inadequacy,

          The f i n a l simple gat he r i ng for prayer and q u i e t in the Bi shop' s
          c h a p e l , most o f s i t t i n g on the f l o o r because o f the crowd, was a
          f i t t i n g climax t o an important evening in the proces s o f h e a l i n g .
         Our b e l i e f in a God who somehow l o ve s and s u s t a i n s us through such

          the s t r u g g l e to m i n i s t e r a dequa te l y. The h e a l i n g proces s went on
          f or many weeks and months, but, with the Rural Deans keeping a
         watching b r i e f , the Angl ican c l e r g y coped remarkably w e l l .

9.16     O v e r a l l , the m i n i s t r y seemed t o be e f f e c t i v e . Many good
         r e l a t i o n s h i p s were b u i l t with the bereaved. Many c r o s s e d the
         Psnnines to take f u n e r a l s , or a t l e a s t take part in them. One
         church c l o s e t o the Hal lamshire Hospital provided care for r e l a t i v e s
         o f t hos e in i n t e n s i v e care; meal s, ove r ni ght s t a y s , h o s p i t a l i t y and
         support were l a i d on f or them o u t s i d e but c l o s e to the h o s p i t a l .
         Contacts with Liverpool c l e r g y were made and between the d i o c e s e s ,
         De br i e f i ng with p o l i c e and Soci al S e r v i c e s was wort hwhil e. All
         mourners, Club and ot her a g e n c i e s , seemed s a t i s f i e d t h a t we had
         played an important r o l e .

         The Lessons

9. 17    A simple major i n c i d e n t plan for the involvement o f the churches
         should be agreed with the p o l i c e and Local Authori t y Soci al
         Services.

9. 18    Such a plan should be ecunemical                     in p r a c t i c e and should carry the
         a u t h o r i t y o f the church l e a d e r s .

9. 19    There should be one r e c og ni s e d church c o - o r d i na t o r for a l l the
         churches , f or a major i n c i d e n t plan, who should be at Bi s hop' s s t a f f
         l e v e l , or e q u i v a l e n t in ot her denominations. He should be the f i r s t
         t o be c a l l e d o ut , but should have two d e p u t i e s t o cover for
         absence.

9. 20    This c o - o r d i na t o r should have a c e l l - p h o n e and an al ready
         e s t a b l i s h e d network o f ot her c l e r g y whom he can begin to t r i g g e r .
         Rural Deans and C i r c u i t Superi ntendent s are o b v i o u s l y key f i g u r e s in
         th is process.

9.21     Those a t second         t i e r l e v e r - Rural Deans e t c - should i d e n t i f y
         c l e r g y (men and     women) and ot her l ay m i n i s t e r s who are l i k e l y to
         have the s k i l l s     and stamina f or such work. They must not be a f r a i d
         not to c a l l out       some c l e r g y .

i.22     There should be no general (broadcast or o t h e r wi s e ) appeal s for help
         and t hos e who turn up wi thout being asked may have to be s e n t away.

                                                      33
The r i g h t environment f or r e c e p t i o n c e n t r e s and temporary mortuaries
are e s s e n t i a l for pas t or al care during the f i r s t 24 hours a f t e r an
i n c i d e n t . As part o f the major i n c i d e n t plan, premises in each
neighbourhoold s u i t a b l e for such purposes should be i d e n t i f i e d with
the p o l i c e and l o c al a u t h o r i t y . In a l a r g e c i t y , one such c e n t r e
every mi l e or so should be adequate.

F e e l i n g s o f h e l p l e s s n e s s and chaos have t o be accept ed - they cannot
be organi s ed away. N e v e r t h e l e s s , a u t h o r i t y has to be c l e a r and
communication as good as p o s s i b l e .

Proper support has t o be ensured f or t h o s e in the h o s p i t a l s , as well
as on the s cene.       Long term care should a l s o be o f f e r e d by l ocal
churches f or r e l a t i v e s o f t hos e in i n t e n s i v e care.

Space needs to be provided for l i s t e n i n g to the e x p e r i e n c e s ,
r e l e a s i n g the emotions and f o c u s s i ng the prayers.

10. 2   The media were organi s ed by the Regional Publi c Re l a t i o n s O f f i c e r at

        o f managing the p r e s s , and a s s i g n i n g appropri at e peopl e to handle

12. 1   "     No v a l i d c r i t i c i s m can be made o f the response by the St John
            Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by the Fi re Brigade on 15 A p r i l .
            Indeed, no represent ed party ventured any c r i t i c i s m o f them. The
            onl y a t t a c k on SYMAS came from two Liverpool d o c t o r s . One claimed

            in evi dence t h a t i t was not p o s s i b l e to say whether l i v e s could have

             MY RECOLLECTIONS OF THE SHKPF THID FOOTBALL DISASTER
                           RECORDH) AT 9.30 PM


On the Saturday it happened„VJe had just got the Department shut down.         I
have taken a wander around.     My junior staff have gone hone at long last, I
have had a last word with Mr                     the Charge Nurse and agreed
with him that everything went fairly well.       I have attended my first and
hopefully last Press Conference, dressed in a casual T shirt and running
shoes and I am dying for a drink.      It was a bright day, the first decent
Spring weekend and I would not normally have been on-call but for the fact
that my senior colleague was                                      I was in the
process of moving.     I was taking my dog and son for a walk between the old
house and the new when my bleep began to go off.      But my first reaction was
one of irritation.     Didn't they know I had been a Consultant for a whole
month, were they still trying to bleep me when there was a Senior Registrar
on.   The bleep went off again coinciding with the passage down a nearly
road of two fire appliances and an Ambulance heading into town, obviously
in a hurry.     I began to move as quickly as one can with a seven year old
towards the end of the park where I knew there was a phone booth.      I
dialled the Ambulance number which I knew would ring a phone directly in
the Department.     At that point I was still mildly curious.   I wondered if
there might be a fire scmewhere possibly in or near a Department Store.
The Charge Nurse on duty told me that the Police had put both Hospitals on
"Standy By" because there had been a stand collapse at the local football
ground.       Sheffieldhas two football grounds but I did not stop to ask
which,      we rant tomy house a further mile away and my wife drove me back
to within striking distance of the hospital before dropping me at the
corner.I sprinted across the grass in front of the hospital and       came in
through the underground car-park.


The Department when I reached it did not seem to be in a state of frantic
activity.     One or two people were setting up drips and there was a general
move of members of the public towards the door as if sonebody had told them
that there was scmething going on, and that they should go hone.      A number
of doors were still locked that should have been opened, and it took time
to find the keys.     I located the major incident signs with comparative
ease, and put passing clerical staff onto this task.      It was 3.35 pm in the
afternoon.     One of my SHOs was buys phoning his colleagues and getting no
reply.    Two General Practitioners arrived, both with anaesthetic
experience.     By change I spotted Dr Daly the Consultant   Physician, about
to leave the Hospital.     I told him what had happened and he agreed to go
and clear sane medical beds.     Professor Johnson arrived and several other
                                   -2 -


members of the General Surgeons.     I told them I had declared a major
incident at the time at which I had arrived which was roughly 3.30 pm.           It
seems I was not the first, at the time of my arrival there were two
Policemen setting up an incident roan near the photocopier.        I did my best
to meet each strange medical face that arrived, introduced myself and
suggested that they take up positions in accordance with their authority
and experience.    Nobody tried to take charge.      There was wide spread and
whole hearted support frcm all quarters.


The first patient to arrive was seriously ill with an E.T. tube in place
and no signs of life.   His body was subsequently the first and only to take
up position in the temporary mortuary.        Several more Ambulances arrived in
quick succession, turning up at the major injuries door and they began to
develop an Ambulance jam.   At this point I delegated one of the SHOs to act
as temporary traffic Policeman and he directed the rest of the Ambulances
around to the triage point outside the orthopaedic door.        Fran that time on
all the casualties were brought in through that door and there were no
further mistakes made in delivery.        Injuries were mostly minor and
intermediate.   Very few ended up on the major resuscitation end.      Minors
ran well with a Professor of Surgery, Consultant Physician and an
Orthopaedic Registrar doing a continuous round of patients that they found
in the cubicles.   I delegated two of my experienced SHOs to act as liason
with this group so that they could keep the co-ordinating Sister informed.
This group organised a transfer of patients frcrn a intermediate injuries
area up to x-ray and subsequently to the transit and the wards.       Sister
              was in charge of minor injuries and I directed such staff as
arrived to volunteer there assistance down to minor injuries where the
majority of patients were arriving.       Throughout the afternoon I did not see
any patients myself other than to give a few of them cursory glances to
make sure the triage instructions were being carried out accurately.         Mike
Hockey the Senior Registrar managed triage with great precision and speed
but this did not prevent medical students or porters sonetimes wheeling
patients in the wrong direction.


We saw eighty patients this afternoon, twenty-five of whan were admitted,
one of whan remains seriously unwell on Intensive Care.       At 6.50 pm I
declared to anyone who is interested to listen that there were no further
live casualties to be brought frcrn the scene and that the incident was now
over.   Still they hung around in large and scrnetimes inquisitive groups.        A
rumour had gone about that the number of bodies at the scene exceeded the
capacity of the local Medical-Legal Centre and that we were expecting
another forty bodies to put into our temporary mortuary.       A number of
                                      -3 -
 trollies were wheeled into Physiotherapy instead in case this happened.                  I
 phoned the Medical-Legal Centre and was told that this was not necessarily
 the case and that they had enough space for the eighty bodies that were
 then thought to have been killed in the incident.          Once I knew no further
 action was likely to take place I informed the Ambulance Control that we
 could once again take 999 cases such as heart attacks and that we would
gradually revert to being a normal A&E Department.


At 7.00 pm I met Dr Perks and Mr Baldwin on the Transit Ward.and together                        „       ,
                 o                                                           o            ry\- Xh/laA I'A. ■
we made-eaif-*ay up through the hospital with—in-the- only--i±ft- available~at
.that-stage, to track down the whereabouts of the patients.          The majority
appeared to be on ward G2 or K1 although there were six more or less
medical cases on ward Ll.       The majority of injuries appeared to be traction
injuries to the limbs or crushing injuries to the chest and abdanen.                The
majority of patients were conscious, though few wanted to talk.              Several
cowered under their blankets and pretended to be asleep but the only man
who was showing any distress was a young Policeman who had helped pull dead
children frcm the crowd.       He assured me that there had been scenes at the
football ground that no one wanted to see in their lives.


The Press Conference ran frcm 7.45 pm until 8.30 pm and was carried out
between Mr Tony Maplebeck, David Baldwin and myself.           I was careful to give
considered answers to sane of the questions, and to confine my opinions to
my own experience.


When I got back to my Department, I found it virtually empty.           The public
had for once decided to stay away.           We closed on time at 9.00 pm.       I did my
best to thank as many people as possible, throughout the afternoon and the
evening and there seemed to be a quiet satisfaction, that we had managed
reasonably well.       We did indeed manage well but that was only because we
had ccmparatively few serious injured or dying people, and we had had about
half an hour to forty minutes lag time between the first intermation of the
disaster and the arrival of the first patient.          It strikes me that the
Northern General bore the brunt of the activity.          My conversation with Jim
Wardrobe at 9.00 pm tonight confirms that.          My other impression was that
the problems were few and related mostly to the difficulties of
conmunicating with people who were not on site.          This seems to be true of
all disasters.       I was unaware of any difficulty in imposing a degree of
authority on proceedings and was grovel^ helped by my more senior
colleagues in this respect.

There is little else to say, but for the fact that if we had to do the same
thing again tcmoorcw, we could and I think we would do it just as well.

    D iagnosis:   Soft tiss u e in ju ry to abdomen 919. 8

    HISTORY: Mr                was admitted on 15.4.89 following a crush injury at a football
    match.

    On admission he was complaining of lower abdominal pain and examination showed some tendern.
    in both right and left iliac fossa together with superficial abrasions. He had no
    peritonism.

    He was observed on the ward and all observations remained stable. He underwent an ultrasou
    scan of the lower abdomen which did not show any abnormality and his symptoms and signs
    gradually subsided. Whilst on the ward he became very upset as he had lost a close friend
    at the football ground disaster. He was seen by the Psychiatrists who did not think he was
    suicidal and felt that he would be better in his home environment.

    He was discharged home on 21.4.89 and we have arranged for him to be reviewed by
    Mr Mackie, consultant Surgeon at the Walton Hospital, Liverpool on 24.4.89. We have not
    arranged to see him again.                                                        •

        ON EXAMINATION:     He had left parasternal superficial tenderness.                                        He had a blood
        pressure of 130/90.   The examination was otherwise unremarkable.

        INVESTIGATIONS:    Abnormal - The initial ECG appears to have been mislaid, but m y
        recollection is that this showed acute right heart strain. .. ... ________ ________ _
        Investigations normal — Admission chest x-ray unremarkable.

        PROGRESS:   Mr        made an uncomplicated recovery on the ward. A repeat chest '
        x-ray including rib views was normal. He was discharged home.    Follow-up has been

      DIAGNOSES:        1) Crush injury (Hillsborough Accident)
                        2) Mild head injury
                        3) Post traumatic cortical blindness

      M EDICATION ON D ISC H A R G E:    N IL .

      This 48 year old man was crushed in a football crowd.     He lost consciousness but
      was unclear for how long. He remembers being trampled on and specifically remembers
      a blow to the back of his head.    Following the injury he had episodes of bluring
      of vision with no true diplopia, but also had occasional complete loss of vision.

      PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:          He had skin grafts to his face following a b u m in the past.

      ON EXAMINATION:    He had a boggy swelling over his occiput which was very tender.
      General physical examination was unremarkable as was detailed examination of the neuro­
      logical system.

      INVESTIGATIONS: Abnormal - skull x-ray on admission showed no fracture but bony
      occipital dysplasia was noted.
      ECG on admission showed changes compatible with acute right heart strain.
      Normal - No other investigation.

      PROGRESS:    Mr         was reviewed by the Neuro-Surgical Service. They felt that
      his symptoms were those of transient cortical blindness following head injury. He
      had persistent pain over his head which was felt to be a combination of local soft
      tissue injury with possible occipital neuralgia.

      Mr         made a good spontaneous recovery and was allowed home.                       Follow-up has
      been arranged with Dr Richard Watkins at Chester Royal Infirmary.

      PNC/CMP/2.5.89

      DIAGNOSIS:   1) Neuropraxia bilateral femoral nerves
                   2) Traction injury right brachial plexus
                   3) Crush injury (Hillsborough Accident)

      This 21 year old man was crushed against a crowd barrier at the side of the football
      pitch. His right arm was pushed against his chest. Apparently he was pushed against
      the fence for approximately 20 minutes.  When released from the crowd he was unable
      to stand and he noticed his right arm was weak.

      PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:     Nil of note.

     EXAMINATION:    On examination he had signs of an extensive right brachial plexus neuro­
     praxia, which was rapidly resolving on subsequent review.     He had impaired sensation
     in all modalities over approximately C4 to C8 in the rightarm. He hadminimal
     voluntary movement in his right arm which was areflexic.    In his legs he had impaired
     sensation from LI to L5, mainly LI to L3 on the right and LI and L2 on the left.
     He was unable to be voluntarily lift his legs off the bed.  Lower limb sensation and
     power and reflexes were normal.

     INVESTIGATIONS:    Abnormal - nil.
     Normal - Chest x-ray and pelvic x-rays were normal.      Initial serum biochemistry was
     normal.   Haematology-results unfortunately mislaid. Initial ECG was normal, and in
     particular, in contrast to many of our patients, showed no evidence of acute right heart
     strain.

     Mr       fs power was slowly improving by the time we arranged transfer to the Neurologic
     Service at Walton Hospital in Liverpool.

                                   Forew ord



T he Chairm en o f T rent and Mersey Regional Health Authorities agreed that following the publication
o f the final enquiry report by the Right Honorable Lord Justice Taylor into this disaster, a small group
should meet and discuss the ‘lessons for health care’.



Accordingly, a one day symposium was held in Macclesfield on the 19June 1990. The purpose of this
symposium was to enable the experience gained by the two authorities in dealing with the tragedy and
its aftermath to be shared; to highlight the lessons for health care which had been learnt; to produce a
report to the two Regional Health Authorities, which could be circulated to others to enable them to
benefit from this experience.

A symposium ‘Hillsborough - The Lessons For Health Care’ was held on the 19 June 1990 in
Macclesfield, Cheshire. It had been agreed that this seminar which was jointly organised by Mersey and
Trent Regional Health Authorities should follow the publication o f the final report o f the enquiry by
the Right Honorable Lord Justice Taylor.




                                             AIMS
The aims o f the symposium were to receive presentations from the health care services involved in order
to :

        enable the experience gained to be shared,

        highlight the lessons learnt

        produce a report and recommendations to the two Regional Health Authorities.




                      T h e Pa r t ic ip a n t s
From the outset it was intended that the symposium would be a meeting o f those staff from a wide range
o f health care services, who had had a direct experience and part to play in the provision o f health care
following the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Participants were drawn from both T rent and Mersey
Regional Health Authority areas and their experience covered the immediate ‘acute’ phase o f providing
care to the longer term physical and psychological aftermath o f the disaster. The participants were as
follows:

The symposium was chaired by Mrs Rosemary Hawley, M ember o f Mersey Regional Health Authority.




                               T h e F o rm at
The symposium was relatively informal allowing the maximum o f communication and discussion. The
first part o f the symposium consisted o f reports by managers and professional staff, directly involved
in directing care both in T rent and Mersey, each presentation being followed by discussion. The second
part o f the symposium involved feedback and discussion o f proposed recommendations drawn from
both the presentations, the associated discussion and the papers circulated prior to and during the
symposium and associated papers that had been discussed and circulated.



A draft o f this report was circulated to all members o f the symposium for com m ent prior to the
production o f the final report.

1.1   O n 15 April 1989 a football match to decide a semi-final round o f the FA Cup competition
      was played between the Liverpool and N ottingham Forest Clubs. The neutral venue chosen
      was Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. O nly six minutes into
      the game, play was stopped when it was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the
      Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. As a result, 95 died and approximately 160 received
      hospital treatment.




                        F ir s t A id         at the          Ground


1.2   The St John Ambulance Brigade had some 30 personnel posted around the ground for the
      match - 25 adults and 5 junior cadets. They were quickly on the scene when the first casualties
      emerged and sought to revive them. Their Divisional Superintendent tried unsuccessfully to
      help those pressed against the fencing by feeding oxygen to them through the mesh until they
      could be got out.



1.3   Sheffield Wednesday’s doctor came from his seat in the South Stand and attempted
       resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he moved from patient to patient,
       doing what he could, but in most cases it was too late.



1.4   At 3.13 pm a St John’s ambulance came onto the pitch at the north-east corner and drove to
      the perimeter fence close to gate 3. As the minutes ticked past doctors and nurses in the crowd
      came onto the pitch to help o f their own accord when they saw the gravity o f the situation.
      M any fans also worked prodigiously in attempts to revive the dead and the dying, in some
      cases their own relatives and friends. Artificial respiration, m outh to m outh resuscitation and
      cardiac massage were applied by the skilled and the unskilled, but usually in vain. Those
      capable o f survival mostly came round o f their own accord. M any o f the rest were doomed
      before they could be brought out and treated.



1.5   There was an urgent need to get casualties off the pitch and to hospital. There were six
       stretchers in the first aid room and three in the St Jo hn ’s Ambulance which were quickly
       brought into use. Then the fans improvised by tearing down the hoardings around the edge
       o f the pitch and against the stands so that lengths o f board could be used as stretchers.
       Improvising in this way, parties o f fans and police repeatedly ran the length o f the pitch bearing
       casualties to the north-east corner. A num ber were dead on arrival.




                                                  5
         2 .A m b u la n c e S e r v ic e s
2.1   Prior to 1986 there had been no official South Yorkshire M etropolitan Ambulance Service
      (SYMAS) presence at football matches in the area. However, following an assessment o f the
      Bradford Football Club fire the C hief Ambulance Officer decided that SYMAS should provide
      ambulance cover to the Football Clubs in South Yorkshire. Therefore on the day o f the
      Hillsborough disaster there were two SYMAS ambulancemen and two officers on duty within
      the ground, with one ambulance available immediately inside the ground and one ambulance
      and crew on standby nearby. This cover was provided at no cost to the club.



2.2   The two SYMAS ambulance officers at the ground noticed fans on the track and went to the
      Leppings Lane end whilst the game was still in progress. They began to attend what was then
      believed to be a small num ber o f casualties.



2.3   At 3.07 pm after hearing from the ground that there might be injuries, Police H Q notified
      SYMAS that ambulances might be required. Then seconds later there was a request from the
      Police at Hillsborough for a fleet o f ambulances, this was relayed to SYMAS. They reacted at
      once. Ambulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entrance at 3.13 pm and at Penistone
      Road entrance at 3.17 pm. In all, some 42 ambulances attended, 31 o f them from SYMAS
      and 11 from neighbouring authorities. By 4.05 pm they had conveyed some 172 casualties
      to various hospitals.



2.4   Prior to the game commencing the Hillsborough gymnasium had been in use for serving meals
      to the police. W hen the M ajor Disaster Plan was initiated, it was cleared and divided into two.
      O ne end became a temporary mortuary; the other was used as a casualty clearing area for the
      injured. As the stretchers, designed and improvised, brought in more and more casualties, the
      scene was initially and inevitably chaotic and harrowing. There was intense distress amongst
      the injured and bereaved: relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead and sought to
      revive them. Doctors, nurses and off duty ambulance personnel had followed the casualties
      in from the pitch and sought to attend the injured as best they could in the adverse
      circumstances. Those in most urgent need o f hospital treatment were taken to ambulances
      as they arrived, triage being employed to determine priorities. Doctors were requested by the
      police to examine each person thought to be deceased to confirm and certify death.



2.5   Because o f its position in relation to Hillsborough and the better road traffic conditions the
      N orthern General Hospital (N G H ) was designated as the first receiving hospital and the Royal
      Hallamshire Hospital (R H H ) as the second receiving hospital, although in terms o f distance
      both hospitals are approximately 3 miles from Hillsborough.



2.6   As the incident unfolded extra staff were called into SYMAS headquarters to man telephones
      and perform control duties.



2.7   D uring this incident SYMAS also responded to a total o f 127 medical emergencies and 999
      calls within the County.




                                                 6
2.8    SYMAS were assisted during the incident by ambulance vehicles from Derbyshire, West
       Yorkshire and St John Ambulance Brigade.



2.9    In the first lh r 23 min, 222 casualties, plus deceased persons, were transported from the
       incident by the Ambulance Service.



2.10   SYMAS closed the incident at 5.30 am on Sunday 16 April 1989.



2.11   Subsequently between M onday 17 April 1989 and Saturday 22 April 1990 all ambulance staff
       involved in the incident were interviewed/debriefed by the SYMAS management team and all
       were offered continuing counselling facilities.



2.12   The recommendations contained in Lord Justice Taylors report regarding Co-ordination of
       Emergency Services, First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances have all been implemented
       and an assistant C hief Ambulance Officer has responsibility for matters relating to ‘Safety at
       sports grounds and crowd safety’.

3.1     Both hospitals were requested by the police at about 3.10 pm to standby as there had been an
        incident at Hillsborough, no details were initially given and there was considerable doubt as
        to the nature and extent of the problem. There was at this point no request to implement the
        major disaster plan. Following an initial few minutes when information on the size and scale
        o f the tragedy was scarce the hospitals initiated their staff call out procedures which resulted
        in significant surgical capacity becoming quickly available. However, in the event, due to the
        nature o f the injuries sustained, this expertise was not required. The time of the incident was
        fortunate because operating theatres were quiet and there were no out-patients, who would
        normally have been present during a weekday. M any non-medical staff also offered assistance
        having been alerted by the television coverage o f the event.



3.2    Relatives and friends o f casualties arrived very quickly and required substantial support and
        counselling. Organising facilities within the hospitals caused initial problems because o f the
        large numbers who arrived, mostly from outside the area.



3.3    D uring the afternoon the num ber o f calls from relatives increased as the tragedy unfolded and
       was reported on television. Relatives and friends appeared to be unable to get through on the
        police emergency num ber issued by the media and rang around the hospitals seeking
       information. Initially hospital staff responded to this situation. Eventually telephone lines,
        manned by social workers and volunteers, were opened at each hospital to take details of
        relatives enquiries and liaise with the police (casualty bureau) documentation team.

3.4     The first casualties arrived in the N G H A & E D epartm ent at approximately 3.25 pm and the
        last at approximately 4.45 pm. The Departm ent was ‘back to normal’ by approximately 5.30
        pm. In the first hour 87 casualties from the incident plus 5 routine patients from the
        com m unity arrived at the A & E department.

NB:     Three m inor casualties arrived at Barnsley D G H where they were treated and discharged.




3.7     The total num ber o f casualties remaining in hospital at 9.00 am on Wednesday 26 April was
        one in Intensive Care at the N G H and four in Intensive Care at the R H H .



3.8     O ther hospitals involved in support roles were:


         3.8.1    King Edward VII Hospital, Sheffield, to which 19 orthopaedic transfers were made
                  early in the emergency to clear beds at Royal Hallamshire Hospital.



         3.8.2    Lodge M oor Hospital, Sheffield, which prepared one ward ready to receive transfers
                  to clear beds at both the N G H and R H H and to release staff for duty at the two
                  receiving hospitals. This accommodation facility was not subsequently taken up.



         3.8.3    Beds were cleared at the Jessop Hospital for W omen, in the event that accommodation
                  was needed for relatives o f casualties at the N G H and R H H and to release staff for
                  duty at the two receiving hospitals. This accommodation facility was not subsequently
                  taken up.



         3.8.4    The Children’s Hospital brought its readiness state up to full alert to receive
                  casualties if required.




                                                  9
          3.8.5    Staff from several other hospitals and both District and Regional Headquarters
                   departments undertook duties at the N G H and R H H .



          3.8.6    The Sheffield Bed Bureau, in response to the major emergency, arranged that
                   Chesterfield and Rotherham Hospitals would take general practitioner emergency
                   admissions if required and for Lodge M oor Hospital to take medical emergencies.

3.9       There were many visitors to the hospital very soon after the event who were anxious to have
          news o f their friends and relatives. It is estimated that for a number o f hours between 200 and
          300 people were present at any one time. A patients relatives’ base was very quickly established
          and manned by members o f staff and various voluntary agencies including the Salvation Army,
          League o f Friends, Social Workers and Chaplains o f all denominations. Senior managers took
          responsibility for co-ordinating activity but the main problem was in providing information.
          A regular supply o f refreshments were provided by both hospital staff and volunteers
          throughout the night.



3.10      The hospital chaplaincy arrangements worked particularly well and were co-ordinated with
          those o f social workers. Because patients relatives were able to congregate in one place
          information was more easily disseminated as it became available.

3.11      At approximately 3.20 pm the receptionist in the Barnsley D G H A & E Departm ent was
          warned on the Ambulance Control telephone that casualties from a major accident were being
          taken to Sheffield Hospitals and that Barnsley may get the overflow.



3.12      In the event only three patients with m inor injuries arrived at the Barnsley Hospital.

3.13      Com munications within and between the N G H and R H H were very effective. The ex­
          directory M ajor Accident (MAJEX) telephone num ber providing direct communications
          between the two hospitals contributed to this.

                 VOLUNTEERS AND OTHER AGENCIES

3.14   Volunteers both from organisations and as individuals reported to the hospitals to offer their
       assistance and made effective contributions, as did the social work staff of Sheffield City
       Council. Num erous offers o f help were received from Sheffield residents, particularly to
       provide transport and accommodation to relatives o f the casualties.

3.15   The Sheffield District Health Authority has an established procedure with appropriate
       communication links for District-wide control in the event o f a major emergency. This is
       particularly im portant in Sheffield where there is more than one major accident centre which
       might also have several supporting hospitals. The purpose o f the District Hospital Control
       is to provide effective communication between the hospitals and other agencies and avoid the
       individual hospital managers having to concern themselves with other than the operation of
       services within their individual hospitals.



3.16   The N orthern General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals established their own local control
       for co-ordination o f services within the respective hospitals. The District hospital control was
       based in the Royal Hallamshire Hospital with its own external and link lines. It was staffed
       by senior District headquarters staff.



3.17   Tasks which District Hospital Control undertook included:-

        General

        3.17.1     Establishing links with hospital controls at the Royal Hallamshire and N orthern
                   General Hospitals to provide support and take pressure off U nit General Managers
                   wherever possible.

        Specific

        3.17.2     Liaison between District General Hospitals and Support Hospitals and arranging: -

                   3.17.2.1 Transfer to vacate beds

                   3.17.2.2 Provision o f additional staff

                   3.17.2.3 Provision o f additional equipment and supplies.


        3.17.3     Liaison with other Districts and arranging necessary support, including diversion o f
                   emergency cases, especially those not originating from the disaster. The Bed Bureau
                   made a major contribution to this task.

        3.17.4     Liaison with Press, Regional Health Authority and Departm ent o f Health. Regional
                   Health Authority Press Liaison Officers provided impressive support to U nit
                   General Managers and District General Hospitals during the Hillsborough disaster.

        3.17.5     Co-ordinating the arrangements for visiting VIPs

4.1   The prime objectives o f pathologists in a major disaster are to assist in accurate identification
      o f the victims and to provide details o f injuries and cause o f death. This information is required
      by H M Coroner under whose auspices they work. Following Hillsborough, post mortems
      were performed in the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre.



4.2   The Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre is unique in the U nited Kingdom. The Centre was able
      to provide modern post mortem facilities for teams of up to six pathologists carrying out post
      mortems at the same time. The pathologists, some from the University and some from the
      N H S , performed 70 post mortems on Sunday 16 April, and the remaining 24 were performed
      on the m orning o f M onday 17 April. The vast majority o f bodies were released to the relatives
      on Wednesday and Thursday, 19 and 20 April, and the last body was removed from the Centre
      on M onday 24 April. The 95th victim died later in hospital.

                 RELATIVES AND STAFF

5.1   The experience o f people faced with terrible events is always personal and deeply disturbing,
      but those involved as casualties, relatives, witnesses, and other local people need to be helped
      to overcome the enormous shock, numbness, disbelief and extreme stress. This can also apply
      to the rescuers and this was particularly true at Hillsborough, even for long service Police and
      Ambulancemen.



5.2   Substantial Social Services organisation was required during the initial period o f great distress.
      M any relatives arrived at both hospitals. (At one stage up to 300 people attended at R H H
      seeking information.) The Social Services staff worked throughout the first night and the two
      following days. W hat wasn’t foreseen in the hospital plans was the am ount o f space required
      for this function. Difficulty was experienced in both hospitals especially in providing
      accommodation with privacy for social work.



5.3   The hospital staff cafeteria was set aside as a relatives’ area, and this provided access to social
      workers, volunteers and clergy. Both hospitals were inundated with offers of help from
      psychologists from all over the country, some ofwhom had been involved in previous disasters.
      Sheffield Occupational Health were a great assistance, as was the Sheffield Social Services
      Department.



5.4   In total 180 social workers in Sheffield were involved with victims, their relatives and others.

6.1      Preface

        Prior to the symposium, a paper based on the T rent Regional Health Authority Major
        Accident Procedures Code o f Good Practice was used to provide a framework for the
        recommentations contained in this report. The paper is found at ANN EX ‘A’.



It was noted at the Symposium that:

6.2      Psychological theory would suggest that people at different stages o f life are likely to respond
         differently to being involved in a disaster. In particular, children, adolescents and young adults
         may be distinguished from older groups in terms o f their respective development levels and
         limited life experience which will affect both their immediate experience of the disaster and
         subsequent coping strategies.



6.3      Adolescents and young adults inevitably formed a large victim group at Hillsborough. It has
         been suggested (eg Van der Kolk 1985) that this group is particularly vulnerable to post­
         traum a distress on account o f the way in which disasters brutally undermine the idealism and
         omnipotence com m on in this age group and which accounts for their typically carefree and
         risk-taking behaviour.



6.4      Their often intermediate position between family and independent living and conflict which
         this can generate, may leave them with little support whilst still emotionally immature; many
         seeking counselling after Hillsborough were unable to confide in their parents, but lacked the
         support o f a partner. T he paradox o f being neither a dependent child nor mature adult can
         hinder the expression of feeling which in this instance was for many, further confused by strong
         male stereotyping.



         Bessel A Van der Kolk (1985) ‘Adolescent Vulnerability to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder’
         Psychiatry. The psychological traum a generated by the Hillsborough Disaster are well
         recognised. A detail review o f the issues and responses is to be found in Annex A ' - on this
         aspect of the response.



6.5     This latter feature o f the Hillsborough disaster in particular (ie. machismo football ethos), in
        conjunction with high risk-taking and impulsiveness and relative agility, most probably played
        some part in the willingness o f victims to participate in the rescue operation. For some this
        was subsequently experienced as a secondary trauma, being unprepared for the sights of
        suffering and death which they then encountered. A major lesson to be learned from this is
        the need to protect. Particularly this high-risk group from their own heroicism, both directly
        through a pre-planned approach to enlisting ‘by-stander’ assistance and indirectly through the
        thorough training of official personnel.




                                                   13
6.6     Finally, in relation to this age-group, who are largely unaccustomed to seeking help
        particularly o f a psychological nature, the credibility and acceptability o f services is paramount.
        This was achieved successfully in Liverpool by the provision by Social Services o f a centre
        linked ostensibly more closely to Liverpool Football Club than to psychiatric services.




                             PSYCHOLOGY SERVICES

6.7     Following the Hillsborough Disaster, Clinical Psychology Services within the two Health
        Regions offered staff debriefing for Health and Social Services and other staff involved. The
        model adopted in the Mersey Region was that psychological sequelae in victims would be dealt
        with by the Health Service as part of the general services provided to the population. M ost
        of the specific post-disaster work with survivors and their families was undertaken by Social
        Workers. In Liverpool, a Health Service Clinical Psychologist was seconded, on a part-time
        basis, to the Social Services Hillsborough Centre to act as a resource for staff and clients in a
        consultative role.




                        THE RESPONSE IN TRENT

Initial Involvement

6.8      Clinical psychologists, hearing of the disaster, volunteered their services at N orthern General
         and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals on the evening o f the disaster, with a view to being generally
         helpful to the relatives and friends o f victims.




                      N o r t h e r n G e n e r a l H o s p it a l


6.9     The description given by a member o f staff o f the emergency work carried out in the Accident
        and Emergency Departm ent raised psychologists’ awareness o f the stresses experienced by
        staff. Further observations of staff stress were made in the relatives’ room seeing staff dealing
        w ith the giving and receiving o f information about casualties. Given a surfeit o f helpers to
        support relatives, psychologists decided to put up a notice offering support to hospital staff.



6.10    O n Sunday morning senior nursing staff at N orthern General Hospital requested psychologists
        to return to the hospital to counsel staff, in the first instance some who had worked through
        the night with victims and their relatives. The hospital O u t Patient Departm ent was made
        available for this work. Visits were also made to involved units and wards to talk with groups
        of staff about their experiences.



6.11    Psychologists offered to attem pt to provide psychological debriefing for affected staff as soon
         as possible, and this offer was accepted by senior staff.




                                                    14
6.12   D uring the succeeding days clinical psychologists at N orthern General Hospital were
       inundated with requests for help. These included individuals seeking counselling, requests for
       help from senior staff and managers and for liaison with other agencies.



6.13   A strategy was devised for offering psychological debriefing to as many affected staff as possible.
       Mental health staff o f all professions within the N orthern General Psychiatric U nit were asked
       to volunteer a small am ount o f time to help run a group or see an individual in need. The
       volunteers attended a briefing meeting at which experiences o f staff who had already been
       involved were reviewed, an information package was distributed about the psychological
       debriefing process and the features o f Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and a timetable
       established o f volunteers availability for help.



6.14   Information was collated at a follow-up meeting for group facilitators two weeks later.
        Recorded contacts show that 32 psychological debriefing groups took place with a wide range
        o f staff (eg telephonists, doctors, catering staff, nurses, etc.) and, in addition, approximately
        40 individuals received counselling at N orthern General Hospital over the following two
        weeks. Some additional groups and individual contacts were not recorded because of
        confidentiality.



6.15   Information feedback from staff about the groups received at the time was generally positive,
        focussing on the relief experienced in the sharing o f reactions, and the overcoming o f feelings
        o f helplessness through recognition o f the value o f the work done.



6.16   Little is known about staff who sought individual counselling, and it is not possible to estimate
       the numbers who may have felt some distress. Therefore a decision was taken to distribute a
       leaflet widely in the hospital informing people o f the possible and natural reactions to the
       disaster and where they could seek help.




                    R o y a l H a l l a m s h ir e H o s p it a l


6.17   Support was offered to staff at the R H H , but only two groups o f staff and three individuals
       requested support from the psychologists. In addition support was provided for staff and
       families o f victims on the Intensive Therapy Unit, and for medical students by psychologists
       in the University D epartm ent o f Psychiatry who had prior involvements with these groups.




                                                  15

6.18   Psychologists quickly began to receive referrals for help for individuals outside the hospital,
       and Sheffield Family and C om m unity Services requested psychological input to a specially
       convened Task Team established at Hillsborough Public Library. Consequently, Sheffield
       Health Authority funded a seven m onth full-time temporary post to work with the longer term
       aftermath o f the disaster. Three areas of work were undertaken:



       6.18.1    W ork carried out in liasion with the task team. This included contributions to the
                 planning of com m unity outreach work, psychological debriefing for council staff
                 involved in the official inquiry, and attendence at two football matches involving
                 affected teams to offer support to staff and the public.



       6.18.2    A follow-up survey to identify the longer term effects on hospital staff o f work arising
                 from the disaster.



       6.18.3    A share o f the individual clinical work arising as a result o f the disaster, undertaken
                 by clinical psychologists as part o f the general adult psychology service.



6.19   A full account of the staff support work, the survey and the Sheffield Family and Com m unity
       Services liasion work is contained in a report available from The Departm ent o f Clinical
       Psychology, N orthern General Hospital, Herries Road, Sheffield, S5 7AU.




                     THE RESPONSE IN MERSEY

6.20   Immediately following the Disaster on 15 April, 1989, networks were established between
        local services and N H S General Managers in Sheffield and Liverpool.



6.21   By the 16 April, the outline co-ordinated plan o f response had been agreed and activated as
       follows:-


       6.21.1    The response would be pan-Merseyside;



       6.21.2    Liverpool Social Services would co-ordinate action across social and voluntary
                 services;



       6.21.3    An inter-agency co-ordinated approach would be used.




                                                  16
6.22   The plan was aimed at structuring and organising all services to ensure that resources were
       channelled to respond effectively and appropriately to people needing help. Key elements of
       this were:-


                  6.22.1     Providing rapid and adequate briefing information o f the problem to all
                             concerned;



                  6.22.2     Raising awareness of staff and agencies, and sensitising them to the
                             problems o f post-Disaster impact;



                  6.22.3     Identification and use o f available resources to cope with the problem;



                  6.22.4     Laying the foundation for a sustained level of intervention.



6.23   Organisation o f Services

       Mersey Regional Health Authority established a co-ordinating group comprising Unit
       General Managers, Family Practitioner Committee Administrators, Psychologists and Medical
       Staff. The co-ordinators o f this group linked into the wider Merseyside Social Services Group.



6.24   Briefing and Information:

       Briefing systems were immediately established both within the N H S and between local health
       and Social Services. An information network was established through Mersey Regional
       Headquarters to disseminate information to both Social and Health Service respondents, in
       the first instance, to ascertain and transmit information on Sheffield in-patient casualties, their
       health status, and likely return to Mersey, and information on those treated in A & E
       Departments and later discharged. All such information was logged on a database and
       transmitted to relevant General Practitioners, local Hospitals and Social Services. The number
       o f affected spectators was not known, but was likely to be at least 3,000.


6.25   Raising Awareness:

       All co-ordinators from District Health Authorities and Family Practitioner Committees were
       given awareness sessions, General Practitioner Services were targeted as a priority and training
       sessions on post-traumatic stress disorder were offered to supplement the written briefing and
       advisory notes distributed earlier to General Practitioners, as well as information on special
       services that had been established to help people cope after Hillsborough.


6.26   Harnessing Resources:

       Funds were secured for training and used not only to raise awareness, but to supplement
       existing knowledge and skills. The key resource of psychology services were used in particular
       to:-


       6.26.1    Support Health and Social Services, and voluntary workers involved in counselling
                 victims;



                                                 17
       6.26.2    Provide skilled intervention to victims;



       6.26.3    Assess ongoing psychological needs and develop strategies for longer-term
                 psychological intervention.



6.27   The Outcome:

       In the past, national and regional disaster plans have not taken sufficient account o f the special
       needs of psychological first aid of this magnitude. The stated aim of Mersey’s Health Service
       was to ensure that resources were channelled to respond effectively and appropriately to people
       needing help. It is too early to say how well this was achieved, but it is hoped that the longer-
       term outcome studies will demonstrate this.



6.28   In the event action was taken very quickly by a team of officers.Similar actions to those
        described below will be required in response to any similar disasters in the future:-


       6.28.1    A debriefing team o f counsellors to debrief staff who had treated victims was
                 established.

       6.28.2    Staff who were the victims o f the disaster identified and offered help.

       6.28.3    Arrangements were made to facilitate liaison with other organisations.

       6.28.4    Norm al services were sensitized in relation to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

       6.28.5    Officers with lead responsibility at Regional/District/Unit level were identified.

       6.28.6    Inter-Health Authority communications were established.

       6.28.7    The expertise o f the Clinical Psychologists was utilised particularly in the training
                 of staff in relation to Post-Traum a Stress Disorder.




                                 S o c ia l S e r v ic e s
6.29   Num bers o f Staff Involved

       O n the day after the disaster 70 Social Workers from Liverpool Social Services made
       themselves available either in response to a direct approach or having heard the news. M ost
       o f them were in fact not immediately employed as the infrastructure to provide a service was
       not in place.

6.30   The main thrust in the immediate aftermath was to set up an administration which then
       enabled all the other aspects o f work to come together. In this sense Liverpool Social Services
       set about establishing:


        6.30.1   Helpline with invaluable assistance from Liverpool Inform ation Technology
                 D epartm ent and British Telecom.




                                                  18
       6.30.2   Finance - cash availability to enable relatives etc. to travel to Sheffield and back;

       6.30.3   Inform ation - a system for obtaining information and recording it in logical, usable
                 form;

       6.30.4    Public Relations - dealing with the mass o f enquiries and requests for statements;

       6.30.5   Accommodation - for Helpline, Drop-in-Centres;

       6.30.6   Transport - laying on facilities for travel to and from Sheffield on a daily basis for
                weeks after the disaster;

       6.30.7   Volunteers - 1500 offers ofhelp received during first 7-10 days - these needed to be
                logged and assessed;

       6.30.8   Training - the need was to provide specialist training to large numbers o f staff o f local
                authority and other agencies.


6.31   Experience showed that during the emergency the victims, their families and observers
       suffered traum a which lasted beyond the immediate time limits of the incident. Lessons
       learned show that it is essential that at the earliest opportunity contact is made with the Social
       Services D epartm ent with a view to experienced staff.



       6.31.1   providing immediate practical assistance at the scene of the incident eg food, shelter,
                clothing, transport etc.

       6.31.2    providing counselling and support services to victims, relatives and others both at
                the scene and at the hospital;

       6.31.3    arranging for more long term support to victims and others to assist them to work
                through the effects o f the incident;

       6.31.4   receiving and organising the many offers of assistance from individuals, voluntary
                organisations, clergy, etc. which will be immediately forthcoming but which will
                need to be organised and structured.




            O t h e r L o c a l A u t h o r it ie s /A g e n c ie s


6.32   It was realised almost immediately that this was more than a Liverpool Social Services problem
       and consequently a Steering G roup (later known as the Hillsborough Inter Agency Group)
       comprising the 5 local authorities on Merseyside, plus Lancashire, Cheshire, and later
       Sheffield and N ottingham came together to co-ordinate activities. This group included the
       Regional Health Authority and representatives o f the Probation Service and Voluntary
       Organisations. This group collectively took decisions on the larger issues and in turn kept
       their own organisations informed.




                                                 19

6.33    Helpline was established within 24 hours o f the disaster and staffed initially by Liverpool
       Social Services Staff. Later other authorities/agencies became involved - some from agencies
       who were not directly affected by Hillsborough. A shift comprised a Team Leader, a C o­
       ordinator and 9 Social Workers. The shifts covered 24 hours/7 days a week and this continued
       for up to 6 months, after which the teams were scaled down.



6.34   Later the Helpline was transferred to the W alton Family Support G roup based at W alton
       Hospital, Liverpool. It still operates 24 hours/7 days but with a vastly reduced staffing input.



6.35   The incidence of calls in the first 3-4 m onths was extremely high but even 6 months after the
       tragedy 1,533 calls were received between 1.10.89 and 31.3.90 - an indication o f the degree
       of assistance still required.



6.36   The numbers o f personnel who were necessary to m aintain Helpline in the early months ran
       into many hundreds.




                                         T r a in in g

6.37   The m orning after the tragedy the Director o f Social Services contacted the Crisis Intervention
       Centre to enlist specialist assistance in the task o f coping with a large-scale disaster.



6.38   The initial informal advice was invaluable but arising from those discussions training sessions
       were established for large groups of staff/volunteers on how to cope with counselling victims
        and relatives. From 20th April to 24th May, 1989, in the local authority and voluntary sector
       485 people were given some form of training - some awareness and some intensive. A video
       was also produced which is now being used as a training tool in many of the local authority
       in-service training schemes.




                                 D r o p - in C e n t r e s


6.39   Arising from the fact that victims and relatives needed some physical contact with others
       involved in the tragedy, Drop-in Centres were established in Liverpool, Wirral, Sefton and
       Knowsley. Here people could obtain psychological and physical assistance. These were staffed
       by local authority and voluntary agency staff and financial assistance was made available on
       the basis o f assessed needs. T ransport to and from Sheffield was also centred on these locations.




                                                 2 0
                                         Funerals

6.40   Liverpool City Council decided early in the proceedings to ensure that funerals were not to
       be affected by financial consideration, so relatives and Funeral Directors were informed on a
       national basis to pass all accounts to Liverpool for payment. In the event the Trust Fund
       accepted responsibility for payment upon certification by Liverpool City Council.




                                       Trust Fund

6.41   W ith the establishment o f the Trust Fund came the decision of how much involvement the
       local authorities would have with that organisation. Eventually it was agreed that social
       services would not be involved on an advocacy basis but would act in a liaison role and would
       help in whatever way possible that did not require the determ ination of individual priorities.




                                        T ransport


6.42   This became a major logistics exercise because o f the numbers who wished to (a) visit relatives
       still in hospital and (b) needed to go to the scene o f the disaster to help work out their feelings.
       All requests were filtered through the Helpline who co-ordinated the buses provided by
       Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive and other transport provided by volunteers.




                                           F in a n c e

6.43   A consequence o f the meeting o f all local authorities and Agencies early in the proceedings was
       a decision that finance was a matter to be picked up later. All those involved in responding
       to the disaster were given full authority to incur whatever expenditure was necessary. This
       was an invaluable decision.




                                        LITERATURE

6.44   Brochures and information literature was designed in conjunction with the Crisis Intervention
       Centre (largely based on the Bradford Fire incident) and these were produced and distributed
       through the Inter Agency G roup within 2-3 weeks o f the event. Some 100,000 copies were
       produced.




                                                 21
                                   I n t e r l in k
Again on advice from the Crisis Intervention Centre, a booklet entitled ‘Interlink’ was
produced containing general information about the tragedy for circulation to families and
others affected by the tragedy. Liverpool City Council produced the first two editions o f about
500 copies. Later editions involved 3,000 being published and the Anniversary Edition was
35,000 copies. Financial support has been given by the Trust Fund and the magazine (which
is still well used by victims and relatives), is produced by an Editorial Board representing
survivors and bereaved families.



                     HILLSBOROUGH CENTRE
T he need for more permanent arrangements for victims and relatives was recognised quite
early and in Liverpool the City Council refurbished a building in Anfield and opened it as the
Hillsborough Centre. Here there are teams o f social workers and administrators who are
specifically dedicated to Hillsborough issues. O ther centres in the area have closed or are in
the process o f closing and Liverpool’s Centre has become the focus for the activities o f the
Family Support Group, ‘Interlink’ and other associated groups. From July, 1989, when it
opened, up to 25 th May, 1990,358 formal referrals for assistance were received. It is envisaged
that there will be a need for this type o f facility well into the future, however, in the near future
the formal social work input will be reduced to one team o f 9 staff.



                                       N.H.S
T he main link with the N .H .S was at the early stages o f the disaster and mainly related to policy
issues. There was a clear link in terms o f disseminating information; clarifying issues relating
to the casualties; and training o f staff. Following the initial stages the N .H .S made a direct
contact with the Crisis Intervention Centre for training sessions for N .H .S personnel.




                                      POLICE
From the m orning after the disaster police officers were located 24 hours a day in Liverpool
Social Services Departm ent. Their role was to assist in obtaining information on casualties and
to cut through the formal barriers which can be encountered in dealing with disasters. They
remained with the Social Services for about 4 weeks.



                                   STAFFLINE

From September, 1989, a facility has been available to staff who have felt the need for
counselling. In retrospect the facility would have been valuable m uch earlier but with the
support of the British Association o f Social Workers a Counsellor has been available who has
fulfilled the needs o f staff and those in other local authorities and agencies. This worker in
addition to her role in connection with Hillsborough has visited Towyn to advise on their
problems and has dealt with some unrelated work associated with violent incidents at the
normal workplaces.
                             7 .M e d ia

Hillsborough - Dealing W ith the News Media

News media attention largely focused on Sheffield, the scene o f the disaster. The television
pictures outraged the world. H ow could it happen? W hy did it happen? Were there enough
ambulances and did they have proper access? W hat about the role o f the police and match
stewards? The state o f the stadium? Indeed, the involvement o f the fans ?



The press made their own immediate inquiries and snap-judgements, in the process canvassing
the opinions o f barstaff, newsagents and shopkeepers in the vicinity o f Hillsborough.
Although most reporting was sober and sensible, and genuinely investigative, one national
tabloid in particular caused great offence on Merseyside with reports which implied that the
fans themselves were largely to blame.



The more seriously injured victims were detained in Sheffield hospitals, although a small
num ber were transferred to W alton Hospital in Liverpool when able to travel. Local media
interest focused on bereaved relatives, returning fans who were eye-witnesses and the support
services, including hospital, Social Services and other voluntary and professional agencies.
There were also numerous enquiries about the injured.



In Sheffield the media response was organised by the Regional Public Relations Officer at the
R H H and by the deputy Regional RPO at the N G H . The importance o f managing the press,
and assigning appropriate people to deal with them has been acknowledged as a priority issue.
O n this occasion because o f the regional input it did not tie up senior hospital manpower.



As with the Kegworth air disaster, also in 1989, the impact o f the press on the operation of the
hospitals was under-estimated and also the work needed to prepare for the visits o f VIPs both
ofwhich took up much management time. Large numbers o f local, national and international
media arrived at the hospital and remained for about 48 hours.



Journalists arrived at the hospitals very quickly and were conducted to ‘press rooms’, they were
informed that if they were patient they would be given information as quickly as it became
known. They were provided with telephones and refreshments and no great difficulties were
experienced, however foreign journalists sometimes had difficulty in understanding certain
instructions.



In Liverpool, in addition to dealing with press enquiries, both the Mersey Regional Health
Authority (MRHA) and Liverpool’s Social Services Departm ent had a com m itm ent to
promote and publicise the support and other facilities available to the returning injured,
bereaved relatives and others affected by the experience.
7.8    Social Services set up a small PR U nit and the Director acted as spokesman. The Regional
        Public Relations D epartm ent represented Mersey Regional Health Authority, dealing with a
        range of press enquiries, representing W alton Hospital, protecting the relatives and arranging
        newspaper and radio publicity for the support services which were on offer, largely through
        the GPs.



7.9    As Liverpool became the centre o f attention regarding the disaster, the Director o f Social
       Services was deputed to be the only spokesperson in relation to press and media enquiries. A
       time was established each day for a press conference and with the support o f Liverpool City
       Council’s Press Officer he disseminated all the information.



7.10   The M R H A PR D epartm ent also helped arrange and participated in presentations for Family
       Practitioner Committee, General Managers and GPs on the response family doctors should
       take, encouraging doctors to be proactive but sensitive in checking on the needs o f families.
       Press releases were sent out encouraging people who were distressed by Hillsborough, even as
       a result o f watching the television coverage, to contact their local GPs.



7.11   The M R H A PR D epartm ent liaised closely with the Social Services Unit, exchanging
       information and reporting press releases. The Skipton-based Centre for Crisis Management
       was ‘hired’, to advise health and Social Service professionals and voluntary agencies on the
        most effective way of responding to the needs o f victims.



7.12   The M R H A PR Departm ent also assisted doctors present at the tragedy when making
       recommendations to the subsequent Taylor Inquiry




                              8.VIP VISITS

8.1    The general consensus was that VIP visits contributed significantly to the morale o f staff,       ■,
       patients and relatives although they took up much senior management time.

                                                                                                          4

8.2    The timetable o f visitors is given at Annex ‘B’.

9.1   From every major accident there are lessons to be learnt, this is not a criticism o f staff or
      procedures, but a fact o f life. There have now been two football ground disasters in recent
      years. ‘Bradford’ and ‘Hillsborough’ each provided a quite different challenge to N H S
      personnel. The mass burns traum a o f Bradford, which swamped hospital clinical resources,
      conflicted sharply with the type o f injury at Hillsborough where only one casualty needed to
      be taken to the Operating Theatre. ‘Bradford’ developed quickly and was immediately
      perceived to be serious. ‘Hillsborough’ developed slowly and in circumstances which masked
      the seriousness o f the situation. The recommendations contained in Lord Justice Taylor’s
      report regarding co-ordination o f emergency services, First Aid, Medical Facilities and
      Ambulances have all been implemented and do not form part o f these recommendations.




                          A l e r t in g P r o c e d u r e s
9.2   There should be a designated telephone in hospitals through which the Ambulance Service
      notify a M ajor Accident. In large Accident and Emergency Departm ents these telephones
      should be sited in the A & E D epartm ent where Senior Nursing or Reception Staff are
      experienced in receiving urgent ‘blue light’ calls from the Ambulance Service and initiating
      appropriate action. However it is accepted that at some hospitals local experience may
      consider that it is more appropriate to site these telephones in the switchboard. In this event
      local procedures should ensure that the A & E department is informed immediately to provide
      information on the basis o f which the hospital Major Accident procedures will be activated.



                             A l e r t in g M e s s a g e
9-3   The phraseology used to declare a major accident and activate the N H S response should be
      simple and made clear to everyone concerned.



9.4   There should be an agreed alerting message which is used consistently by all Ambulance
      Officers, which is simple, direct and avoids jargon.




                                              25
9.5   The following terms are recommended:

                                                       Full response required o f hospital

                                                       response by hospital may be FULL or
                                                       PRELIMINARY and PARTIAL according
                                                       to local procedure.

                                                  :    no further casualties expected

      O T H E R TERM S - RED ALERT, YELLOW ALERT, STANDBY ETC S H O U LD BE
      A B A N D O N ED .


      From the above it follows that the Police and Fire services should alert the Ambulance Service
      C ontrol and not the hospitals direct.


9.6   If appropriate, the Ambulance Service will deploy a Mobile Communications Support U nit
      (MCSU) to the scene to provide the necessary communications links for support and
      management. This should include the availability o f hand held communications equipment
      for key ambulance officers (Ambulance Incident Officer etc) to cope with the situation where
      the site is required to be reconnoitred or controlled away from the M CSU.



                            S it e M e d ic a l O f f ic e r

9.7   The Hospital M ajor Incident Plan will designate who should act as Site Medical Officer
       (SM O ). Senior clinicians with appropriate experience and training should undertake this role.
       They should be transported to the site by the Ambulance Service. The SM O will have overall
       responsibility for deployment o f medical and nursing personnel at the site.



9.8   In collaboration with the Ambulance Incident Officer the Site Medical Officer should be
       responsible for:


       9.8.1    Triage and formulating a casualty evacuation plan.

       9.8.2    Arranging for the attendance o f further medical and nursing teams if required eg to
                deal with trapped casualties etc.

       9.8.3    Organising treatment and co-ordinating medical teams.

       9.8.4    Ensuring that the receiving hospital(s) is regularly updated on numbers and type o f
                casualties they can expect.

       9.8.5    M onitoring the status o f the hospitals to continue to receive casualties.

       9.8.6    Initiating ‘stand-down’ once the functions o f mobile medical teams are no longer
                 required at the site.

       9.8.7    Liaison with Police and Fire to provide ny medical advice required.



9.9   Site Medical Officer - Mobile Medical Teams. W here transport is to be provided by the
       Ambulance Service, the arrangements must be agreed between the hospital and the Ambulance
       Service and clearly identified in both Ambulance Service and Hospital plans.



                                                26
                 H o s p it a l O p e r a t io n a l C o n t r o l
9.10   A hospital operational control room should be identified for use in a major accident. It should
       have appropriate internal and external communication facilities, under the direction o f a
       senior manager, senior nurse and a medical controller (as appropriate locally). Together they
       should have the authority to:

       9.10.1    authorise the evacuation o f wards

       9.10.2    implement action, both planned and unplanned

       9.10.3    involve other hospitals/agencies as necessary

       9.10.4     take charge o f all the beds in the hospital


       9.10.5    direct the cancellation o f outpatient appointments

       9.10.6    direct the cancellation/postponement o f booked admissions

       9.10.7     request additional assistance from the Police

       9.10.8    liaise regularly with the Senior Ambulance Officer and Ambulance Control

       9.10.9     issue press statements

       9.10.10 permit the progressive stand-down o f the plan


9.11   Ex-directory lines must be available in A & E and Hospital Operational Control for priority
       and emergency use o f staff seeking advice or information during a major accident, particularly
       for communication between key staff where more than one hospital is involved. It is strongly
       recommended that all hospital controls and A & E departments should have an appropriate
       num ber o f ex-directory lines which should be known to other hospital controls, A & E
       departments and other N H S key staff for use in emergency.



9.12   Precise instructions for staff reporting for duty or volunteering in response to media coverage
       should be contained in all hospital and Ambulance Service plans. This should include the need
       for key staff, particularly those reporting out o f uniform to wear identification (arm bands or
       other means) in view o f the larger numbers o f staff, media and others in the hospital on these
       occasions. It is also im portant to retain some staff in reserve to cope with activity 12 - 36 hours
       following the incident.



9.13   GPs need to be aware that there could be an immediate need for them to provide counselling
       to their patients.



9.14   Police Docum entation Team. The accommodation earmarked for the use o f the police
       docum entation team should be equipped with both telephones (up to 4) and a facsimile
       machine to facilitate the transmission o f information to the central Police Casualty Bureau.
       The police may, if requested, provide their own facsimile machine, but the telephone socket
       and telephone num ber for its use in emergency should be identified at the planning stage.



                                                 27
9.15   Relatives Information Service. Recent experience has proved the need to establish a room with
       up to four telephones which could be staffed by hospital social workers or volunteers to answer
       inquiries from relatives and friends. This room should be near to the room provided for the
       Police docum entation team since there may be a need to exchange information particularly
       if identification o f casualties is a problem. Standard inquiry forms which closely follow the
       format o f the police casualty bureau forms should be used to record details provided by callers.



9.16   Hospitals should ensure that local plans identify the Principal or Senior Social W orker to be
       contacted in the initial stages o f a M ajor Accident. The decision regarding follow-up action
       would rest with this individual and take account o f locally agreed policy, liaison with other
       organisations and planning arrangements.



9.17   Local arrangements should ensure that the duty Hospital Chaplain is identified and included
       in the first stage call out o f Key Officers to be notified. The role o f the duty Hospital chaplain
       will be to assess the requirements and to co-ordinate the clergy o f all religions. The chaplain
       should act as the point o f contact between the many clergy who will undoubtedly offer their
       services and if required will call out other clergy as necessary.


                                          GENERAL

9.18   Paramedics. Use o f Fast Response Vehicles; national policy is aimed at eventually providing
       one paramedic trained ambulance person on each front line ambulance vehicle but present
       estimates indicate that this will take about five years to achieve. This goal should be viewed
       as a high priority, but in the interim the introduction o f paramedics transported to the scene
       in ‘Fast Response Vehicles’ should be considered. (This concept was activated on 2 July 1990
       by SYMAS.)



9.19   Coma Lane. Followinginterservice discussions Mersey Ambulance Service have recommended
       the concept o f a ‘Com a Lane’. This involves connecting tape between the opposing goal posts
       at sports grounds and protecting the lane thus created, by a police cordon. W ithin this lane
       casualties would be triaged and treated before being transported to hospital.



9.20   Emergency Planning Liaison Group. There would be distinct advantage in convening (where
       one does not already exist) an Emergency Planning Liaison Group in each County with a core
       membership o f Police, Fire, Ambulance, Local Authority and Health Emergency Planning
       Officers, and District Health Authority (including Hospital) to ‘provide a forum for the
       establishment o f liaison and good practice between the various services and organisations.


                               A f t e r m a t h (A c u t e )
9.21   A bank should be created o f staff skilled in dealing with Post-T rauma Stress Disorder (PTSD ).

9.22   A video should be made (15-20 minutes) as a training medium on PTSD to be available and
       up-dated as necessary for all appropriate staff.

9.23   A Team of Counsellors should be established at an appropriate level to debrief staff who have
       treated victims.



                                                  28
    9.24   It should be made clear to staff suffering as a result o f a disaster that help is available if required.



    9.25   Rapid information on people receiving treatm ent as a result o f a major disaster, should be sent
           promptly by a faster system to patients’ GPs than the relatively slow normal discharge letter.



    9.26   Health Authoritites and Police Authorities together should establish a system o f collecting and
           disseminating names and addresses ofvictim s/patients quickly and accurately.



    9.27   Suitable inter-health authority communication systems should be identified as there is a need
            to constantly and consistently collect and send information back to a patient’s hom e Health
           Authority.



    9.28   Hospital departments should include plans for coping with the aftermath o f the accident with
           particular emphasis on:


                       9.28.1     Continuing demands on staff with special expertise;

                       9.28.2    Requirements for specialised equipm ent and consumables;

                       9.28.3    Ability to maintain routine services eg. possible postponem ent o f list
                                 surgery, some clinics and other planned activity;

                       9.28.4    Debriefing o f staff, patients and relatives who may be suffering stress and
                                 be in need o f specific support.

    9.29   Disasters leave a legacy o f psychological morbidity. The size and scope of the problem cannot
           be fully defined. The range o f potential victims is wide and includes the rescue services who
           respond. Affected individuals may suffer from profoundly disabling social and mental health
*          problems. Support and treatment for such people has frequently been patchy, ineffectual and
           offered late and for too short a time. In order to minimise morbidity and mortality, services
           appropriate to the problems need to be available. This task requires co-ordination o f the
           resources o f health services, local authorities and voluntary bodies. Contingency planning is
           essential. The fundamental issues are the definition o f roles, co-ordination and decision­
           making between agencies, training, and research to evaluate the impact and improve the design
           o f services offered.




                                                        29
9.30   The formation o f multi-agency teams able to develop expertise and form a basis for the
       provision o f a response, and the development o f plans, is recommended. Consideration should
       be given to establishing a Regional Team, with the prime functions o f training, promoting
       the development o f a network o f more local teams, and monitoring the effects o f psychological
       work in the aftermath of disaster. A further function o f the Regional team would be to establish
       networks with other Regions for mutual support in the event of disaster. Any Regional team
       should be multi-disciplinary and multi-agency, and should include professionals and
       representatives ofvoluntary agencies; wherever possible, members should have direct experience
       o f disaster work.



9.31   Local teams based on District Health Authority or Social Service areas should form a network
        co-ordinated and supported by the Regional team. Local teams on the psychological aspects
        o f major disasters should include a clinical psychologist, a general practitioner, a psychiatrist
        (preferably a liaison psychiatrist), a representative from the voluntary sector, and a social
        worker. These members should have a particular interest in this field. The committee should
        also include a representative o f the local education authority (preferably from the primary
        school division) and a specialist in the psychological treatment of children and families (a child
        clinical psychologist or child psychiatrist).



9.32   Any Regional team could then be convened within 48 hours o f any major disaster whether it
        occurred within the Region or elsewhere in Britain, to consider whether it was appropriate to
        mobilise a response from Districts within the Region.



9.33   The provision o f‘Helplines’, ‘D rop in Centres’ etc should be as informal as possible and should
        not require the completion o f forms etc. Experience has shown that some individuals suffering
        the after effects o f the disaster, take 3 or 4 months to pluck up the courage to take the initial
        step. A relatively simple organisation is all that is required, ie. buildings, volunteers,
        refreshments, lines o f communication to other organisations. The distribution o f a small
        magazine or pamphlet is essential. These facilities should also be available to others in the
        wider com m unity eg. Road Traffic Accident victims etc. Directories should be maintained by
        Citizens Advice Bureau from other parts o f the United Kingdom.



9.34   GPs who respond to patients seeking help should be encouraged to keep records; many who
        presented to their GPs subsequently did not return and could not be followed up.

                               after a            D is a s t e r


1.   This can be summarised as:

     •      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder

     •      Survivor Syndromes

     •      Bereavement Syndromes

     •      O ther Disorders



2.   Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a term given to a range o f problems following
      exposure to a traumatic event. There are two groups o f symptoms: ‘denial/num bing’ with
      withdrawal, repression o f memory and depression, and ‘intrusive/repetitive’ with flashbacks
      and nightmares. Concom itant symptoms include anxiety, anger, aggression and psychosomatic
      symptoms.



3.   Survivor syndromes are psychological problems relating to the individual’s survival in the face
      o f death and destruction. The perceived loss of control is an im portant determinant. Feelings
      o f alienation and guilt, withdrawal and damage to interpersonal relationships are prom inent
      features.



4.   Normal bereavement reactions include initial shock, denial, anger and depression. In
     particular reactions the individual does not progress on to a new psychological adjustment.
     Several features o f disasters make pathological reaction more likely.



5.   ‘O ther disorders’ includes m uch o f psychology and psychiatry. Vulnerable individuals may
      be precipitated into anxiety or depression.



6.   The degree and type of m orbidity experienced can be related to the nature of the disaster and
      the individual’s personal experience o f it. Each o f these types o f m orbidity may severely disrupt
      a person’s life and have sequelae such as family breakdown, career failure, frank psychiatric
      disease and suicide.




                                                31
7.   Reactions to a disaster are best understood in terms o f successive phases over time. Immediately,
     effects are widespread and intense amongst those involved; as time goes on, most people
     recover but a minority continue to experience marked difficulties, such as :-



     7.1      Immediate post-impact phase (5-7 days). Although the degree o f distress experienced
               will vary, most survivors and helpers go through similar patterns o f acute response.
               Intense feelings such as shock, fear, grief, anger, guilt, helplessness and sadness are
               to be expected in almost everyone, together with bad dreams, tiredness, sleeplessness,
               headaches and anxiety reactions. These reactions are entirely normal and do not
               constitute PTSD.



     7.2      Intermediate phase (6-9 weeks). For the majority, psychological reactions will have
               begun to settle by 4 - 8 weeks following. An estimated 5% (varying with nature of
               disaster and exposure) will show evidence o f more entrenched reactions. In addition,
               others will develop phobias, panic disorders, depression, psychosomatic disorders
               and PTSD , or combinations o f these.



     7-3      Long term reactions. Some individuals who show distress in the intermediate phase
               will require long term care and support. Others will only begin to show signs of
               disturbance several months after the event, or on the anniversary o f the event. There
               is some evidence that the most severe reactions may be those that first become
               manifest 6 m onths or more after the event. Long term reactions may be prolonged
               (up to 3 years after the event). They may be intensified by legal battles for

8.   Disasters vary widely in the experiences to which they subject individuals and in the
     proportions o f dead and injured. A broad distinction can be drawn between ‘man-m ade’ and
     ‘natural’ disasters although these factors may combine. Features o f disasters associated with
     greater psychological problems include:



                •         the intensity o f the event

                •         absence o f warning

                •         ignored warnings

                •         having preventable features

                •         being unfamiliar types o f risk

                 •        publicity attached to the event




                                                32
9.    Individuals are more likely to suffer psychological problems if they experience:


      •        shock

      •        periods o f uncertainty about their own survival or the survival o f significant others

      •        concurrent injury

      •        multiple bereavement



10.   Self perception o f behaviour during the event, legal issues which may follow, and the behaviour
      o f others towards them, including that o f members o f the emergency and other services are also
      determining factors.

11.   The range o f individuals at risk can be categorised as follows. Individuals may be in more than
      one category.


      Primary victims           Survivors, exposed to the event

      Second level victims       Bereaved relatives, friends, workmates etc

      T hird level victims      People involved in rescue, recovery and caring for primary victims.
                                Also known as ‘helpers’ and, when affected, ‘hidden victims’.

      Fourth level victims      People in the com m unity involved in the disaster - includes those
                                affected by the breakdown o f normal services.

      Fifth level victims       People in whom emotional problems are precipitated by knowledge
                                o f the disaster even though not otherwise affected. Also known as
                                ‘media victims’.

      Sixth level victims       Those who but for chance would have been primary victims
                                themselves.

                                Those who persuaded others to the course that made them victims.

                                Those in some way responsible.



12.   A ‘ripple effect’ has also been described. This is the spread o f psychological problems through
      the com m unity by the effects o f altered behaviour o f individuals. The size o f this effect is
      difficult to measure. As an indication, 10,000 people (from all categories) contacted the
      Herald Assistance U nit after that ferry disaster.




                                               33
                            Levels           of    M o r b id it y

13.   Recent studies have used a standardised approach which has allowed levels o f morbidity
      between disaster to be compared. Measures used include psychological and mental health
      scales, mortality, drug use, physical symptoms and health care utilisation.



14.   Reported levels o f psychological morbidity vary according to the nature o f disasters; in a review
      of the world literature - Raphael concludes that about 40% o f primary victims experience
      serious psychological morbidity, with a range o f 20% to 80% for the research reviewed. (B.
      RAPHAEL (1986) W hen Disaster Strikes, London; U N W IN HYMAN.)



15-   M any studies have reported falls in m orbidity after the first year. However some recent
      research has suggested that though some individuals recover by two years, others suffer a
      delayed onset o f problems. The duration o f illness caused remains uncertain, but there will
      be some individuals for whom it is lifelong.




                                        CHILDREN


16.   Children are an overlooked and yet particularly vulnerable group. They are susceptible to the
      same range o f symptomatology as adults but their communication o f distress may differ
      markedly in being expressed in a m anner which relates to their age and stage o f development.
      An unfortunate consequence o f this is that their behaviour is labelled as ‘naughty’ rather than
      distressed. This perception is com pounded by many adults’ view that one shouldn’t talk to
      children about traumatic events.



      16.1      Children’s patterns o f response to major traum a may follow a similar process to that
                described for adults; in particular distress may not be obviously apparent in the early
                stages. The tendency o f many adults in this situation, whether parent or professional
                may be to assume that the child did not comprehend the experience and/or was
                unaffected. This assumption is likely to be quite erroneous and unhelpful: recovery
                for children is m uch more likely to proceed if their experience is acknowledged and
                openly addressed.



       16.2     Children, especially those in the preschool and primary school age range, are likely
                to respond to traum a in a behavioural manner, some o f it regressive. Such behaviour
                is susceptible to mislabelling as ‘naughty’, which is likely to lead to inappropriate
                punishment. The behaviour will need to be contained while the underlying distress
                 is addressed.



       16.3     In addition to the levels o f impact described for adults, children may be particularly
                vulnerable as secondary victims through their parents’ - disorganisation and
                responses to traum a as well as through bereavement etc.




                                                 34
16.4   Vulnerable children are likely to be those who:


       16.4.1    physical or psychological destruction o f their parents or immediate environment;

       16.4.2   experience prolonged separation from parents or significant others (including fellow
                victims);

       16.4.3    are subject to a disorganised rather than structured system o f care following the
                disaster;

       16.4.4    have experienced previous psychological problems.

       16.4.5    D uring the aftermath of a major accident it is extremely im portant that family
                groups are kept together or reunited as rapidly as possible. This should also apply
                to medical treatment; as far as is possible children and parents should be treated
                within the same hospital.




17.    The guiding principle for children must be that their experiences are often underestimated yet
       they require equivalent interventions to those needed for adults but which are age appropriate
       and recognise their needs for family support.



       17.1     In the post impact phase children will require psychological first aid, information
                 and debriefing at an age appropriate level. Parents should be used as m uch as possible
                 to provide this but they themselves have a great need for information, advice and
                 support. W ritten guidance should be available for parents.



       17.2     The role o f parents and caretakers should be supplemented where necessary, more
                especially where teenagers are concerned, by the direct involvement o f experienced
                child care professionals.



       17-3     Although children have a primary, need for the support o f parents or significant
                caretakers they, like adults, may require peer-group support both with fellow victims
                and also in their schools irrespective o f the presence or not o f other victims in their
                class. Extra staffing may be required in schools if significant numbers o f children are
                involved.



       17.4     Research suggests that whereas children will be substantially helped by immediate
                and short-term psychological assistance there will remain a further substantial
                minority who may only exhibit their distress symptomatically at a later stage. Some
                of these and the children who are not sufficiently helped by first aid measures will
                benefit from specialised treatment from clinical psychologists specialising in child
                and family work or from similar professionals such as child psychiatrists, specialist
                social workers etc.




                                                35

18.    Different interventions are appropriate at different phases after the disaster. Some are
       primarily preventive, others aim to ameliorate sustained reactions revealed over time.



18.1   In the immediate post-impact phase, three levels o f preventive work can be distinguished;

       18.1.1   Psychological first aid, involving informal support offered by all helpers in contact
                with victims. This includes supportive listening, the immediate opportunity to talk
                over what has happened, the recognition o f suffering, minimising the feeling o f loss
                o f control, providing useful activity, and the sensitive handling o f the bereaved.
                Expressing feelings and experiences at this stage can prevent more severe reactions
                developing later.

       18.1.2   Providing information. This reduces feelings o f loss o f control and reduces the
                am ount o f uncertainty, and is o f benefit both during the event/rescue and in the
                aftermath. A leaflet describing the range o f disaster reactions commonly experienced
                should be made available within a day or so to those directly and indirectly affected
                by the disaster.

       18.1.3   Psychological debriefing, deliberately bringing together groups o f victims with a
                skilled facilitator to review their experiences. This is most useful within the first week
                after the event, but failing that may be implemented up to 6 weeks afterwards.
                Debriefing emphasises the normality o f people’s emotional reactions through
                sharing and structuring feelings and mobilising resources and social supports.
                Instead o f opening up areas o f personal sensitivity, as in counselling, it encourages
                simple acknowledgement o f the existence o f personal issues and helps people use
                existing coping resources to move on. For workers and helpers this also promotes
                a necessary disengagement from the disaster role.


18.2   In the intermediate phase, individuals who have not recovered within a few weeks require a
       skilled professional assessment to determine the most appropriate type o f intervention. :


       18.2.1   A small proportion o f those involved (approximately 5%) will show evidence at this
                stage o f entrenched psychological reactions, while others will develop (either now or
                in the long term) specific disorders including PTSD, phobia, panic disorder,
                depression or psychosomatic disorders. These require specialised psychological
                treatm ent carried out by clinical psychologists with appropriate post-graduate
                training. These include (a) behavioural treatments such as de-sensitisation or anxiety
                management; (b) cognitive approaches to dealing with excessive irritability,
                inappropriate attributions (eg self-blame) and inability to accept that the past cannot
                be changed; and (c) dynamic psychotherapy where the disaster has brought out
                unresolved conflicts and issues that may have little surface connection with the
                disaster events.

       18.2.2   In addition, others will require follow-up debriefing group sessions to help review
                progress and air ongoing difficulties; or counselling for bereavement or other grief
                reactions, which are often related to unfinished m ourning for an earlier loss which
                have been reactivated by experience o f the disaster.



                                                36
      18.3      Long-term care includes continuingworkwith those identified duringthe intermediate
                phase as suffering specific psychological disorders, together with assessment and
                treatment o f those presenting with such disorders several months or more after the
                disaster. Intense reactions, including the emergency o f such disorders, are particularly
                likely at the anniversary o f the disaster. Psychiatric treatment may also be appropriate.




        PLANNING TO DEAL WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL
             PROBLEMS AFTER A DISASTER

19.   Recent UK disasters have highlighted difficulties in providing a response. In some cases no
      response has occurred, or responses have been delayed, o f inadequate duration, insufficiently
      resourced and uncoordinated, while failing to make use o f all available resources. Routine
      services are not appropriate for many affected victims, nor available on sufficient scale. These
      problems, together with the numbers affected, suggest the need for contingency plans.
      Planning must take account o f the time course of psychological reactions and of the required
      responses to these at each stage.



20.   Plans to respond efficiently and effectively to the different phases o f psychological reactions
      must include the following objectives:



      20.1      Developing awareness and educating rescue and relief workers in psychological first
                aid in order that these functions are not carried out in ways which add to distress and
                inhibit psychological responses.

      20.2      Educating workers about their own possible psychological reactions to their experiences
                and the process o f psychological debriefing.

      20.3      Securing the availability o f resources, including professionals from appropriate
                disciplines and relevant voluntary agencies, and providing them with specific
                training in disaster work.

      20.4      Setting up a specific organisational structure to co-ordinate involved organisations
                from the health and social services and from the voluntary sector, to enable the
                necessary communication and co-operation.

      20.5      Devising multi-agency arrangements and methods o f operation, appropriate to the
                individual features o f the disaster, enabling identification, assessment, monitoring
                and treatment o f those individuals in need o f psychological therapy.




21.   A check list o f the issues for plans is included in Appendix 1, and in Appendix 2 a list o f activities
      is given as an aid to visualising a possible response.

22.   The required skills to plan or m ount a response are in short supply, and there is a need to co­
      ordinate several agencies with non-parallel structures. The identification o f personnel and
      their further training is therefore paramount. The formation o f multi-agency teams consisting
      of professionals, voluntary sector workers, planners and managers is suggested. O f Health
      Service professionals, clinical psychologists are well equipped for a lead role. Such teams
      should receive training in the management o f psychological problems and providing a
      response. Their responsibilities would include both leading the response to a disaster and
      developing the type o f plans discussed.



23.   The need to have sufficient skills available suggests that initially such teams might be set up
      at regional level, although the advantages o f having local responses might later lead to planning
      being based around smaller units possibly with outside support. Social Services departments
      will have a major role and local authorities may be an appropriate level. The N H S must also
      consider the needs o f its own staff as potential third level victims.



24.   There is a need for an academic input both for further study o f the psychological morbidity
      and its epidemiology, and in the development and evaluation o f appropriate responses.

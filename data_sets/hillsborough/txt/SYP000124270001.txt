          FORWARD WITH THE PRESSURE OF PEOPLE BEHIND US.

 BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS OR INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 JUST THE NUMBERS OF FANS WHO WERE PUT INTO THE ENCLOSED PENS. THE

 SIDE FENCING PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM MOVING SIDEWAYS AWAY FROM THE

 cflfchhi.

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 BETWEEN 4PM (1600) AND 4.30PM (1630)   INITIALLY BUT I WENT BACK IN AT 5PM

ABOUT 5.30PM (1730)


Q15

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

 sftlARD, A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN

 FOUND!       |WE STAYED UNTIL WE WERE INFORMED BY LOUD SPEAKER

 ANNOUNCEMENT TO LEAVE THE GROUND.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A     CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE
 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH     WAS STOPPED?

 WE LEFT PEN 3 BY MAKING OUR WAY BACK TO THE TUNNEL. WE DID NOT SEE

 WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE ON THE PITCH. ALL I COULD SEE IN FRONT OF ME

 WAS FANS CLIMBING OVER THE FENCING AND AFTER A WHILE THE POLICE


Q16

 WERE HELPING THEM.   THE POLICE OUTSIDE THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE, ALONG

 WITH MANY OF THE SUPPORTERS THEMSELVES WERE ATTENDING TO THE

 INJURED BY GIVING 'MOUTH TO MOUTH’ ETC.

 I DID THINK AT THE TIME THAT MEDICAL FACILITIES WERE VERY INADEQUATE

 Q54

 ift-HERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT CONTROL OF THE SUPPORTERS INSIDE

 THE GROUND. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN STEWARDS AT THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE

 WHO SHOULD HAVE CLOSED THE GATES WHEN PENS 3 AND 4 HAD SECOME FULL.

 THIS WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE CRUSHING IN THAT AREA.

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 I BELIEVE THAT IT WAS DUE TO THE LARGE fs        f OF FANS OUTSIDE LEPPINGS LANE,

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OF MY OWN ACCORD.

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

Q53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WjOfS HANDLED,

fpTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

IT APPEARED THAT THE POLICE WERE THERE TO LOOK AFTER ANY DISORDER, AND MAY NOT
                                      /
HAVE APPRECIATED THE GRAVITY OF THE ff^TUATION AS IT DEVELOPED. THERE WAS NO

CO-ORDINATED RESPONSE TO THE REQU03TS FROM THE FANS THAT HELP WAS NEEDED TO
                                    J               .....
GET THEM OUT OF THE TERRACES.    4IVEN WHEN THE GATES WERE OPEN,    IT APPEARED

THAT IT WAS THE FANS WHO Dli/ MORE TO HELP THE FANS OUT,

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHJ-CH YOU FEEL IS VITAL. TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

       FACT THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY FAN 5 OUTSIDE THE GATES JUST PRIOR TO THE

 KICK OFF MADE IT IMPERATIVE THAT THE CRUSH WAS STOPPED & I AGREE THAT TO DO


Q19

 THIS THE GATES HAD TO BE OPENED.       HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT BEFORE IT WAS DONE

 SUFFICIENT POLICE AND STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN POSTED BETWEEN THE TURNSTILES

 & THE TUNNEL IN ORDER THAT THE SUDDEN INFLUX OF FANS COULD BE DIRECTED TO THE

 RIGHT & LEFT, AND AWAY FROM THE PENS THAT WERE OBVIOUSLY FULL.

 CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY IT WASN'T APPARENT OBVIOUS THAT PEOPLE NEEDED HELP.

 THE POLICE ARE A PROFESSIONAL BODY OF MEN I UNDERSTOOD THEM TO BE TRAINED

 IN THINGS LIKE THIS.               YOU TEND TO RELY ON THEM TO KNOW WHAT THEY .ARE DOING,

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.     IT STAR TIED BEFORE THE MATCH,               WHEN HILLSBOROUGH WAS CHOSEN WE KNEW                  IH.A1
                                                                                          PAGE    9

IT WAS THE WRONG G R O U N D .    WE HAD THAT EMD OF THE GROUND LAST YEAR AND

THE CRUSH WAS TERRIBLE, PEOPLE WERE POLLED FROM THE TERRACES TO THE S TA N D

LAST YEAR.      IT HAD BEEN VOICED TO /THE FA THAT THIS GROUND WAS NOT SUITABLE.

THE CROWD NEEDS CONTROLLING IT NEEpED SOMEWHERE LIKE OLD TRAFFORD.                     THE

CROWD ALSO NEEDS ROOM WITH SUCH A LARGE FOLLOWING.               I FEEL THE FANS WERE

IGNORED.      PEOPLE D O N ’T THINK WE HAVE OPINIONS,     THE FANS ARE THE EXPERTS

ON GROUNDS BUT NO ONE ASKS US.

1.   I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BODY OF FOOTBALL         SUPPORTERS INCLUDED IN

DISCUSSIONS ON GROUNDS,       SAFETY ETC.

2.   THE GAP IN THE FENCE IN THE PEN WHERE I WAS, WAS NOT OBVIOUS.                 I

CANNOT REMEMBER       IF IT WAS A GATE,,    THERE WERE NO POLICE OR STEWARDS

TOPOINT     IT OUT,   WE ONLY FOUND IT BY CHANCE AND NOT MANY PEOPLE

CAME THROUGH WITH US         THERE WERE NO SIGNS POINTING IT OUT.           ONCE

PEOPLE WERE IN THAT MASS THEY JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO IF IT

W A S N ’T POINTED OUT TO THEM.

IT MUST HAVE BEEN APPARENT THAT THE END TERRACES WERE EMPTY,               SOMEONE

SHOULD HAVE MADE THE DECISION TO BLOCK OFF          THE TUNNEL AND DIRECT PEOPLE

AROUND THE SIDES.         THERE APPEARED TO BE A    LACK OF COMMUNICATION IN THE

GROUND,    TELLING PEOPLE WHERE TO GO OR NOT TO GO.           IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SO

EASY TO DIRECT SUPPORTERS ROUND THE SIDES.

I^feEEMS A BIG DECISION TO OPEN A GATE, LETTING A FLOOD OF PEOPLE IN.

THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHOUGHT AS TO DIRECTING THEM WHERE TO GO ■■■■■

THAT TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED OFF.

I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN DEATHS OUTSIDE THE GROUND

IF THE GATE HA D N ’T HAVE BEEN OPENED,       BUT I D O N ’T/fHINK THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN

THAT MANY, ALTHOUGH THAT IS NO CONSOLATION.          ^ S U P P O R T E R S SHOULD HAVE BEEN

DIRECTED ONCE THROUGH THE GATES.                                            ,       *7^

THE FIRST THING YOU SEE ONCE THROUGH THE TURNSTILE IS THE TUNNEL AND THE

MAJORITY OF PEOPLE GO FOR THAT.            I LpiRNED MY LESSON FROM LAST YEAR.               THERE

WAS A CRUSH,    THERE WAS A DANGEROUS SITUATION LAST YEAR.             THIS YEAR WE
                                                                          page.   10

 DECIDED NOT TO USE THE TUNNEL/STAND BEHIND THE GOAL BUT WE COULD FIND NO OTHER

 WAY INTO THE TERRACES SO WE HAD NO CHOICE,,

 I WENT TO THE REPLAY YESTERDAY AND I WANT TO COMMENT ON HOW EASY   IT WAS TO

 PUT THE KICK OFF BACK -••• IT WAS NO MAJOR PROBLEM,,

 046

 NO

 Q47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 THERE WAS A GIRL DIRECTLY BEHIND WHO WAS SCREAMING NY BROTHER PULLED HE UP

 OUT OF THE CROWD IN PEN FOUR     INTO PEN THREE,       I LOOKED BACK   IMMEDIATELY

 TO GET HER OUT BUT SHE WAS GONE I PRESUME S H E ’D FALLEN TO THE FLOOR              I SAW

 THE FACE OF A YOUNG BOY 10-12 YRS HE WAS LYING ON THE FLOOR WHERE               I HAD BEEN

J B A N D I N G HE WAS DEAD BUT I DIDN'T SEE HIM DIE.                                       0   J

 Q48                              au^vo                                              ,

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,          IF S O , BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 TOGETHER WITH NY BROTHER I      I I LIFTED PEOPLE OVER THE FENCE FROM PEN FOUR TO

 PEN THREE .   WE HAD TO DRAG THEN O U T , THE PRESSURE WAS SO GREAT THAT THEY

 WERE LOSING CLOTHING AS THEY WERE DRAGGED OUT I COULDN'T SAY WHAT CONDITION

 THEY WERE IN I WAS JUST BUSY GETTING THEM OUT AND PASSING THEM ON.


Q 17

 Q49

       YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR         IN THE D E A T H S ,

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 OBVIOUSLY THE CRUSH IT WAS SO BAD PEOPLE COULDN'T BREATHE,             ALSO IF THE

 SEGREGATING FENCING ON THE TERRACES HADN'T BEEN THERE.           THE CROWD WOULD

 HAVE FANNED OUT TO THE WINGS AND AVOIDED A CRUSH.

 Q50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 1343 HOURS

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 LEFT ON OWN ACCORD,


(MS

 Q5£

 DID YOU WINTESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO 8£\A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 I SAW THREE YOUTHS MHO WERE PICKING THINGS UP OFF THE FLOOR AND I ASSUMED

 THEY WERE STEALING:,          THEY WEREN'T ALL TOGETHER BUT THREE SEPARATE INCIDENTS,

 IN THE END I WAS THAT UPSET BY WHAT THEY WERE DOING I COLLECTED

BELONGINGS WITH A GROUP OF OTHERS AND PUT THEM IN A HEAP BEHIND THE GOA1.

Q53

^ ^ O U   HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

WHEN THE POLICE FINALLY REALISED HOW SERIOUS THE INCIDENT WAS THEY WERE JUST

RUNNING ROUND LIKE HEADLESS CHrS&ENS THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BY ANY PURPOSE

OR CO-ORDINATION AS TO WHAT THEY WERE DOSlsiG^rr WAS LEFT TO THE FANS TO GET

STUCK     IN AND HELP THE DEAD AND INJURED.       MO ONE TOOK CHARGE ALL IT NEEDED

WAS SOMEONE WITH A MEGAPHONE TO ORGANISE THE OPERATION.

Q34

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL           IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

1.     ON ARRIVAL AT SHEFFIELD THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF POLICE DEPLOYED

AS IF JUST WAITING FOR TROUBLE.           THEY WERE JUST STANDING ABOUT DOING NOTHING

AND W E R E N ’T HELlKFUL ,,

2.     OUTSIDE THE GRbjiND THERE WERE A LOT OF POLICE BUT THEY WEREN'T CHECKING

THE FANS FOR TICKETS ORJDRGANISING ORDERLY QUEUES.            I ’VE NEVER EXPERIENCED

SO MUCH LACK OF ORGANISATION AND I ’VE BEEN GOING TO MATCHES FOR 20 YEARS

OR MORE.

3.     THERE W E R E N ’T ENOUGH TURNSTILES TO TAKE THE VOLUME OF FANS TRYING TO

GET IN THE GROUND BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF TURNSTILES THE CROWD WAS JUST MASSED

INTO THE BOTTLE NECK BY THE TURNSTILES,,
                                                                                        PAGE    9
                                                                                        QSL1492

                                                                                         THEY



 3.         THERE WAS TOTAL
                       TOTAL LACK        DIRECTION INSIDE
                              LACK OFOF DIRECTION           THE GROUND IE NO SIGNS OR P O L IC£
                                                    INSIDE THE

 OR STEWARDS,         SO EVERYONE JUST WENT DOWN THE TUNNEL THINKING THAT YOU WOULD BE

 ABLE TO GET TO ANY PART OF THE TERRACING AND NOT REALISING THAT THE TERRACE

 WAS FENCED OFF        INTO PENS,    I DON'T KNOW WHY THE TERRACING WAS SEGREGATED

 THAT WAS OBVIOUSLY        THE MAIN FACTOR     IN THE CAUSE OF THE CRUSH,

 6.    THE POLICE FAILED TO RECOGNISE AND REACT TO THE I NC I D E N T ,      A FASTER AND

 MORE POSITIVE RESPONSE WOULD MOST CERTAINLY HAVE SAVED LIFES.

 7.    THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH FIRST AID GIVEN TO CASUALTIES,

 3,    THE FANS DID ALL THEY COULD BUT IT NEEDED ORGANISING,

       THE      F .A ,ALLOCATED LIVERPOOL FANS THE WRONG END OF THE GROUND       THEY SHOULD

 HAVE HAD THE SPION HOP.

 10.   THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED AND          ANNOUNCED AS BEING DELAYED,

 11.    THE CHOICE OF GROUND FOR THE VENUE WAS W R O N G .

 CRUSH THAT BUILDS UP USUALLY.

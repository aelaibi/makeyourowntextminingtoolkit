                 Public         House       on H a l i f a x      Road,         Many    supporters               had    to    be    stopped           and

                 told     to      finish        off     the      cans    or     bottles         of a l c o h o l       they were

supporters              away          from     the      premises.                 Apparently             a disturbance                      ha d

occurred           in    the          pub    between             locals          and     the      Liverpool             lads          who    were

the    worse        for       drink.              No    complaints                from       the    landlord                or    other

was    asked        to       close          the    bar.          This       he    did       and    the       pub       was       closed

without       further                 incident.             Resumed          static          points          on    Halifax             Roa d ,

there       seemed           to       be    a last          minute          rush       of    supporters                many       running

just    prior           to    3 pm          ( 1 5 0 0 ).

3.05pm       (1 50 5 )        still          in    position             Halifax             Road    junction                Claywheels              Lane

3.20    pm     (1520)             PC       Goss    (A3)          informs          us     that      all       officers             directed              to

ground.            In    company             other          officers             to P e n i s t o n e        Road       entrance             an d

entered        ground.                 Radio       communications                      appeared          to       be    scrambled.

Insp.       Townend           directed             us       to    the       ramp       giving       access             to    Kop       end.        Tw o

male    bodies           were          laid       behind          the       metal        railings            at    side          of    Kop     and        PS

Cropley        (Al)          and       another          officer             were       dealing          with       them.

We    held    people              back       so    they          could       not       view       the    bodies             which       were        then

placed       into        an       ambulance.

Other       ambulances                 were       trying          to    enter          the     ground         bu t      had       difficulty

because       of        the       amount          of    people          milling             about       in    the       are a .         Insp.

Townend        then          directed             us    onto          the    pitch          where       a cordon             of       officers

stretched           from          one       side       to    the       other.            I could         see       hundreds             of

Liverpool           supporters                 milling            about          on    the     pitch.         A    lot       appeared

dazed       an d    many          were       in    tears,             anger       and       frustration                caused          them        to

direct       verbal           abuse          at    us.           We    joined          the     cordon         and       a fight             started

in    the    Cantilever                    stand       with       3 other             officers          a group             of    Liverpool

supporters              were          ushered          back       behind           the      cordon.

rear       of   the      stand.           W h e n we       got       there         I could            see     over       £0    bodies          laid

about        3!j y e a r s    old     and was             obviously              dead.           No    s i g n of        life,       his

4.05pm          (1603)        Returned            to      pitch        and       assisted             co r do n.         The       situation

still        appeared         chaotic.               No    tannoy           announcement                   wa s    made       to    the

explaining            th e    gravity           of     the      situation,                 the     Liverpool             supporters              may

nave       cleared        tne       pitch and             given        tne       emergency             services           a    clear        run.

Finally          an an no un ce me nt             was m ad e           to    the        effect         tnat        the    match        had

been a b a n d o n e d .            Then Kenny             Dalglisn              appealed             to    the     fans       to    co­

I waited           for    a Police           announcement                   bu t      it    never          came.

4 . 2 0 pm      (1620)        Insp.        Townend             ordered           us     back       to C'iaywheels L a n e                   to

It w as         however       interesting                 to    note        that        many       Liverpool             fans       returning

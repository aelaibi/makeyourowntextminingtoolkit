                WE ARRIVED AT A PARKING PLACE ABOUT HALF PAST ONE. FROM THERE IT
                WAS ABOUT A FIFTEEN MINUTE STROLL TO THE GROUND. AS WE APPROACHED
                THE GROUND, WE WENT THROUGH THE GATES TO THE TURNSTILE AREA. AT
                THAT TIME THERE WAS ALREADY A LARGE QUEUE ABOUT TEN OR FIFTEEN
                PEOPLE DEEP - THIS WAS ABOUT A QUARTER PAST TWO. THERE WAS ONLY
                ONE POLICEMAN ON HORSEBACK WHEN WE ARRIVED. HE TOLD US HE WOULD

THE CROWD TO TRY TO RELEIVE THE PRESSURE AT THE TURNSTILES AND HE DID THIS
WITH ANOTHER MOUNTED POLICE OFFICER. IF HE HAD STAYED WHERE HE WAS HE WOULD
HAVE BEEN BETTER ABLE TO FORM PEOPLE INTO SOME SORT OF QUEUE, BUT AS SOON AS
THEY MOVED THEY WERE SWALLOWED UP BY THE CROWD AND ANY EFFECT HE MAY HAVE HAD
WAS LOST. THERE WAS A BIG CROWD BUILDING UP BEHIND US. WE PROCEEDED INTO TO
THE GROUND, BUT NO-ONE DIRECTED US OR TOLD US THAT THE TERRACING WAS BECOMING
FULL ALREADY, AND WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE SIDE PENS WERE EMPTY. THERE WAS A
LOT OF PUSHING AND SHOVING - THAT WAS AT 1438 BY THE STADIUM CLOCK. I HELPED
PICK UP A GIRL WHO FELL OVER, AND A MAN NEAR MAN HAD HIS ARM BROKEN AND HAD
DIjBttCULTY GETTING OUT THROUGH THE BACK. I DON'T THINK I WAS IN THE WORST OF
TEWPUSHING - I COULD SEE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE TO THE SIDE, THEN A
LITTLE LATER I COULD SEE PEOPLE ON THE PITCH, ONE HAVING HIS HEART MASSAGED.
IT APPEARED TO BE LIVERPOOL FANS DOING ALL THE WORK - GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF
THE CRUSH, OUT OF THE GROUND, AND DOING FIRST AID, AND LIFTING PEOPLE OUT.
THE WIRE FENCING WAS BEING PULLED OFF BY POLICE OFFICERS BEFORE THE POLICE
DECIDED TO TRY TO HELP BY TRYING TO REMOVE THE GRILLES.

I WAS WITH FRIENDS;

DAVID RIMMER (FRIEND) WHO DIED ON THE TERRACES - HE WAS SEPARATED FROM US.

WE ALL GOT SPLIT UP WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF GETTING INTO THE PEN. I WAS
PUSHED OVER TO THE LEFT OF THE PEN WHERE THERE WAS MORE ROOM. LATER, WHEN
PEOPLE HAD MOVED I COULD SEE THAT THE CRASH BARRIER HAD BEEN F L A T T E N E D

OF THE PITCH ABOVE PEOPLES HEADS. I WAS READING MY PROGRAMME, THEN I NOTICED
AT ABOUT 2.55 I REALISED THAT I WAS GETTING QUITE SQUASHED. I DON'T REMEMBER
THE MATCH STARTING, BUT PEOPLE AROUND ME WERE DISTRESSED BECAUSE WE WERE
BEING SQUASHED. PEOPLE SHOUTED TO THE POLICE WALKING PAST TO OPEN THE GATE
AND LET US OUT. I KNEW IT WAS SQUASHED WHERE I WAS, BUT I HAD NO IDEA HOW BAD
IT WAS AT THE FRONT. THEN I SAW A POLICEMAN WITH A RADIO, AND THEN PEOPLE
STARTED TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCES AT THE FRONT. I COULDN'T MOVE BACKWARDS AND
MORE PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO COME IN, SO WE WERE MOVING TO THE SIDES. THE MAN
ATjKHE SIDE OF ME SAID I WAS ON HIS LEG, AND I TRIED TO MOVE AWAY FROM HIM. I
REIFIED A CRASH BARRIER AND PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CRAWL UNDERNEATH TO GET
FURTHER FORWARD OUT OF THE CRUSH, BUT WE HAD NO IDEA HOW FULL IT WAS AT THE
FRONT. AT THE SIDE OF ME THERE WAS A KIND OF DOUBLE FENCE, AND I SAW A CHANCE
TO GET OUT AND STARTED TO CLIMB OVER. A MAN THE OTHER SIDE HELPED ME OVER.
THERE WAS A GATE FROM THERE ONTO THE PITCH SO I WENT THROUGH IT ONTO THE
PITCH AND THE POLICE SENT ME TO THE SIDE TERRACING. I HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING
HOW BAD IT WAS. I WAS SWEATING, AND WAS RELEIVED TO GET OUT. I DIDN'T NOTICE
ANY STEWARDS AT ALL TO DIRECT ANYONE. THE MOOD BEFORE THE GAME WAS HAPPY,
NORMAL SEMI-FINAL ATMOSPHERE BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT MORE PEOPLE THAN
LAST YEAR.                                                     ------------

               WHEN I WENT IN AT ABOUT 1430HRS THERE WAS A LOT OF PUSHING AT THE
               TURNSTILES, THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION OR CONTROL OF THE CROWDS BY
               THE POLICE. I FEEL THEY SHOULD HAVE SHUT OFF THE GATE TO THE
               TURNSTILES AND LET PEOPLE THROUGH GRADUALLY. THERE WERE SOME LADS
               CLIMBING OVER THE TURNSTILES INTO THE GROUNDS AND NOBODY WAS
               CHECKING THEIR TICKETS OR STOPPING THEM GOING IN. ONCE IN THE

SURPRISED THAT THERE WERE NO POLICE OR STEWARDS DIRECTING PEOLPE WHERE NTO
GO, AND I FOUND THAT I WAS ABLE TO GO THROUGH THE TUNNEL INTO THE ALREADY
PACKED MIDDLE TERRACE AS LATE AS 1450HRS, WHEREAS LAST YEAR YOU WOULD NOT
HAVE GOT IN THAT LATE. I GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE CROWD AND WAS PUSHED FORWARDS
AND CRUSHED AGAINST THE CRASH BARRIERS, HOWEVER I MANAGED TO GET UNDER THE
BARRIER AND OUT VIA THE TUNNEL AT ABOUT 1540HRS.
I WAS WITH MY FRIENDf               (NO DETAILS).

GOING ONTO THE PITCH. THE POLICE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING FOR ABOUT 5

POLICE CORDEND IT OFF.

INFO         » WE GOT TO THE GROUND AT 2.40, AND WENT IN THROUGH THE LEPPING
                 LANE ENTRANCE THROUGH THE GATE THAT HAD BEEN OPENED, RATHER THAN
                 THROUGH THE TURNSTILES. THERE WAS A CROWD OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE,
                 THERE WAS NO QUEUE. THERE WAS A SET OF WROUGHT IRON GATES AND I
                 GOT THROUGH THEM. THEN THE GATES OPENED AGAIN AND 20 PEOPLE GOT
                 THROUGH. THE GATES SHUT AGAIN,

«   WHO_WITH     »

THE MOUNTED OFFICERS CLOSED THE GATE AFTER IT HAD BEEN OPENED THE FIRST TIME,
THEN A POLICE OFFICER ON FOOT HAD IT OPENED AGAIN BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE GETTING
CRUSHED AGAINST THE CRUSH BARRIERS, THERE WERE A COUPLE OF THOUSAND PEOPLE
OUTSIDE THE GATES.

I WENT THROUGH THE TUNNEL WITH A FRIEND, THERE WERE ONLY 50 OR SO PEOPLE
FOLLOWING US IN AT THAT TIME, AND SOMEONE SAID IT WAS PACKED. WE TRIED TO GET
TO THE SIDE, BUT THERE WERE THEN LOTS OF PEOPLE BEHIND US AND WE COULDN'T GET
OUT OR MOVE OUT. THEN, AS A WHISTLE WENT, I THINK IT WAS THE START OF THE
MAaCH, THERE WAS A ROAR, AND WE GOT CARRIED DOWN.  I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING,
A N W W E WERE TRYING TO KEEP OUR FEET.

THEN I WENT DOWN, I LOST ME SHOES, MY FRIEND DISAPPEARED IN THE CRUSH.     THIS
WAS ABOUT 5 PAST 3.

I WAS NEAR WHERE THE BARRIER COLLAPSED, I DON'T KNOW MUCH MORE, I WAS HANGING
ONTO A LAD UNDER ME, AND IN THE END WE WAS STANDING ON TOP OF HIM AND
COULDN'T GET OFF.  THEN THE CRUSH STARTED TO EASE OFF, SOMEBODY PULLED ME
OFF, I WAS TRYING TO GET THIS FELLA UP BUT SOMEONE SAID, LEAVE HIM, SO I DID,
I JUST LEFT THE GROUND.  I WENT BACKWARDS OUT THROUGH THE TUNNEL.  I MUST
HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST OUT. THERE WERE LOADS OF POLICE, I WENT UP TO ONE
AND SAID CAN YOU GO AND GET SOME PEOPLE OUT AND THEN HE CALLED HIS MEN AND
THEY WENT INTO THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACES.
WHEN THE WROUGHT IRON GATES WERE CLOSED OUTSIDE, I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE TIME
TO GET THE PEOPLE TO QUEUE UP. THE POLICE DONE THE RIGHT THING IN GETTING
THE GATES CLOSED, AND THEY DID THE RIGHT THING TO OPEN THE GATES BECAUSE
THERE WERE 2000 PEOPLE OUTSIDE. THE POLICE INSIDE THE TURNSTILE COULDN'T
CONTACT THE POLICE OUTSIDE.

I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH:

I WAS WITH MY BROTHER WHO SUPPORTS NOTTM FOREST. HE IS
                       } NOTTINGHAM. NO PHONE.  I WAS ALSO WITH ANOTHER
LIVERPOOL SUPPORTER CALLED         I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT HIM, MY
BROTHER MAY.

WHEN THE SURGE FORWARD CAME THE POLICE DIDN'T SEEM TO REALISE WHAT WAS GOING
ON, THEY LOOKED BEMUSED.   THEN THEY STARTED TO PANIC AND DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO
DC W ONE PUT HIS     LEG THROUGH FOR PEOPLE TO STAND ON HIS KNEE TO CLIMB OVER.I
C 1 ® K E D OVER THE FENCE ONTO THE PITCH, THIS WAS     ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER THE
GAME HAD STARTED AND I WAS OUT OF BREATH.   I SAT DOWN ON THE PITCH, MY VISION
WAS BLURRED AND PEOPLE THREW WATER OVER MY HEAD. THEN I SAW A LONG ROW OF
BODIES LINED UP. A GROUP OF PEOPLE AND I BROKE DOWN THE ADVERTISING HOARDING
TO TRY TO CARRY PEOPLE OUT, BUT A POLICEMAN STOPPED US. THEN WE TOOK A BLOKE
WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD ON THE BOARD INTO THE GYM. WHEN WE GOT BACK ONTO THE
PITCH THERE WAS TOTAL CONFUSION, AND WE SAW A STEWARD HIT A FAN.

A SMALL GATE ONTO THE PITCH WAS OPENED AT LEAST TEN MINUTES AFTER THE MAIN
SURGE, BUT THERE WAS NO WAY OF GETTING TO IT.

WHEN WE WERE IN THERE THE POLICE DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING, IT
WAS THE FANS WHO     DID ALL THE CARRYING OF BODIES    AND INJURED.

NOWHERE TO GO AND YET THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STILL COMING DOWN THE
TUNNEL. THERE WERE POEPLE FAINTING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND PEOPLE WERE
SCREAMING .NO ONE COULD GO BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL. THE POLICE WERE SHOUTING
FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE BACKWARDS. CALLER GOT FORCED TO THEFRONT OF THE CROWD HE
VIRTUALLY WALKING OVER PEOPLE WHO HAD COLLAPSED ON THE FLOOR. THE POLICE WERE
DOING NOTHING TO HELP THEY JUST TRIED TO KEEP EVERYONE IN THE TERRACES AND
OFF THE PITCH. THE FANS THEN STARTED SHOUTING AT THE OFFICERS ON THE HALF WAY
LINE TO HELP.
TQ£L CALLER WAS VERY UPSET.

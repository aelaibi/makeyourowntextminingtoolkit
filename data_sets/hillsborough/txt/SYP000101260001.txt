              On     Saturday        ,    15th April             1989,       I came          on d u t y at        0800     am at       Bentley

               Police         Station          and arrived             at    Hillsborough              ground         in t i m e      for    the

               commencement               for    the       briefing.

               I was       responsible               to    P S t_i n d u p       and    Inspector           T owne n d .

               At    the      conclusion             of    the       briefing,          my     serial       went      to C l a y w h e e l s    Lane

               to    assist         in    the    de       basing       of    f a ns     from     their         coaches.          1 encountered

               no    problems            with    any       of    the       arriving          fans.         There were           possibly         up to

               £0    fans      that       had    got       off       the    buses       who     a p p e a r e d .to      have    not       got a

               ticket         for    the       match       and       they were          asking        f an s     from     subesequent            buses

               if    they      had       any    tickets          to    sell,       but       it was        cone    in a n       o r d e r l y manner,

               Ail      the    buses       to    be       p a r k e d at     t his      location           naa    been     parked          by a b o ut

               I then         went       along       to Ha l i fax          R o a a wi tn Per.is-tone R o a d                ana      there

               supervised            fans,       mainly          Liverpool             fans,      coming         clown    from     parkea        Duses

               large       number         obviously             under       trie i n f l u e n c e     of a l c o h o l ,       many       carrying

               of    alcohol         were       shephtrded             to    one       side     ana    they       either        drank       what

               they      had    or       left    the       residue          at    t his      location.

Out    of     all      those       that          came      my     wa y     I saw        only        5 or       6 who       showed

obvious          signs       of    likelihood                  that       t he y     could      be       troublesome.

By a b o u t      3-05       pm    (1505 ) it              appeared             that,       apart         from       the     possible            odd

s t r a g g l e r ,a l 1 the           Liverpool               fans       had      passed       by.        As    it       was    at    this

time       now    quiet          and    the        instruction               had      been      for       us    to    go     for      a m e al

at    Claywheels             garage          when         the     game        started          my    serial          made       towards

Claywheels             Lane       Garage.

As    my    serial          approached               the       junction            of C l a y w h e e l s       Lane       with

Penistone             Roa d ,     I heard            over        the      radio       conversation               that        said      there

was    going          to    be    a catastrophe                   at      the      gat e s .    A    few       minutes          later       it

sounded          as    though          it    had        happened           although            I ha d      not       been       able    to

make       out    just       wha t ,        so     by     common          consent         my    serial          redirected             our

path       to g a t e s      77-88          on     Penistone              Roa d,      arriving            about       3-15       pm    (1515)-

On    entering             through          the      gateway           77-88         I saw      several          ambulances             with

injured          persons          nearby.

I gained          access          to    the        pitch        by     going         between         the       North       an d W e s t

Stand       and       could       see       the      problem           was      on    the      other       side       of     the      pitch       at

the    Leppings             Lane        end.          Im a d e    my      way        over      to        that    end       and a s s i s t e d     in

the    resuscitation                    of       s o me i n j u r e d     and        assisted             in    carrying 2

obviously             dead       fans,       on      make       shift        board        stretchers,                assisted          by

people       who       a few       minutes              earlier           had      been     spectators,               to     the      Gymnasium.

Some       other       officers             stayed         with         those        dead.

There       were       many       fans       on      the       pitch       going        berserk,           invariably              they      were

under       the       influence             of     alcohol.               I saw       a lot         of    fights          break       out,

some       with       Police       Officers               as    they       vented         their          anger       on    them,       blaming

them       for    the       occurrence.                 I also          had     to     assist         to       restrain          several

fans       fighting          one        another - over                  what         I still         don't       know.

After       taking          the    two       dead         fans       to    the       Gymnasium,            I then          assisted          in

crowd       control          until          the      ground          was      later       cleared.

I did       not       see    the       build         up    of     the      problem          outside            the    gates,          nor    did

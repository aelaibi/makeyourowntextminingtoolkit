              I am a Po l i c e             I ns pe c t o r     of the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e Police,           currently

              s ta ti o n e d at Maltby.

              On Saturday,               9 t h April,           1988     (090488)        I was on duty at H i l l s b o r o u g h

              Football           Ground         in c o n n e ct io n w i th the FA Semi- F i n a l                 between

              L i verpool          and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.                My     duties      involved the       supervision

              of officers               who were m an ni ng            the    b a r r i e r s w h i c h had been        set up at the

              mo u t h s       of the       j u n c t i on s    of side      roads w h i c h formed a T j u n c t i o n with

              Le p p in gs Lane.                Barriers          had also        been set up at the               other    end of

              these minor               roads w here            they formed a T j u n c t i o n w i t h P e n i s t o n e           Road.

              Two     or three              officers       m a nn ed     each barrier,            and     it was their       duty to

              prevent            non    r e sidents           from going          into    these m inor a n d        residential

              roads t he r e b y              p r e v e nt in g any n u i sance           to    residents.

              Most       of my time             was     spent       p atrolling          round the        block,    visit i n g    the

              officers             on   -these      barriers..           At no time            did    I see a n y barriers

               e r e c t e d     ac r o s s t e p p i n g s      Lane,      nor    did    I see any form o f . c o r d o n used

               to filter             non ti c k e t       holders,          prior      to them        reaching the      t u rnstiles

               at the L e p p in gs              Lane     end of the          ground.

               Groups          of o f f ic er s were             d e p l o y e d a long    the       length of L e p p i n g s     Lane

               and     I often saw them                   sea r c h i n g    fans      for w e a p o n s and alcohol.

               As kick           off time          drew        near,   I was       not aware          of any    build      up of    late
                                                                                                              P AGE
                                                                                                              R456

  ar r i vi ng       fans.      In fact at 3 . 0 0 p m       (1500)         that   day,    Leppings     Lane was

  very quiet,              a n d some   10 minu t e s a f t e r     kick      off,    I was able       to    release

   officers          to go to C la yw h e e l s      Lane    ga r a g e     for a meal.

   I returned          to L ep p i n g s   Lane     prior    to the         f i n i s h of the match,        where    I

   remained w i t h the              officers     on the     barriers,          watching      the    crowds as

   they       left the       ground.

   My m a i n     r e c o l l e c t i o n of that    day w^s       the      good be h a v i o u r   of the    fans,

   both before a n d a ft e r              the match,       an d there was           c e r t a i n l y no trouble

   on the se c t o r          that    I was given to supervise.

   The       o f f icers    on the      barriers     that     day were         from A Division,         and    I am

   unable        to sa y who         they were.

   I was       not    on duty at         the   1989 S e m i - F i n a l .

TH E PRIM E M INISTER                                          21 April 1989




          Thank you for your letter of 17 April.                   As you say
  Hillsborough was a tragedy for the nation as a whole and I
   can readily understand the terrible poignancy of it for you
   and others brought up in Sheffield.


          You suggest that party politics entered into who
   accompanied me.           This is simply not so.            I was pleased,
   though had not expected, to see Irvine Patnick there, as I
   would have been to see you and other Sheffield MPs.                     I am
   only sorry that the sad and unusual circumstances of my visit
   last Sunday prevented constituency MPs being notified in the
   normal way.


           I welcome your view that party politics should not
                        â€¢4                         im jhi mu                   .. .


   colour what needs to be done next and I share with all my
   heart your hope that we can prevent a n y occurrence such as
   Hillsborough ever happening again.

                Duties at Hillsborough Semi Final Saturday 15 April 1989.

                I was Serial 1 Sergeant that is in charge of all Constables on the

                perimeter track around the ground.            My specific duty was to stay in

<2yi>           the vicinity of the players tunnel and to indicate to my officers

        (       when to stand and face the crowd once play had commenced.

                I took up my position as did the rest of the serial at 11.00am and

                nothing untoward occurred.            Went with serial for hot meal at 1.00pm

                and all returned to duties at 1,20pm.

                AT 2.41pm PC 814 Finnegan walked up to me and made a comment "Where

                are all the scousers".           I looked around the ground and noticed that

                the Spion Kop and south Stand appeared to be full of Notts. Forest

                supporters.         The North Stand opposite me and the Leppings Lane end

                were not full although of course there were plenty in.              In particular

                there appeared to be lots of room on the ’wing terraces’ of Leppings

                La n e .   I think I recall seeing spaces in both the Leppings Lane and

                North Stands.

                The game commenced on time and shortly after I noticed that

                supporters at the Leppings Lane were what I thought to be spilling

                onto the track at the back of the goal.            Peter Bearsley had just hit
                                                                                n
the bar and I thought that it was just a surge forward of supporters.

I then saw Superintendent Greenwood run onto the pitch and speak to

the referee and it was when this happened that I began to think that

it was more than an overspill.     Normal policy is that if the referee

needs to be contacted a message is relayed to me through police

control and I in turn would contact the linesman nearest to me to

attract the referee’s attention.

At this point the referee brought the players off but he with his

1inesmen stayed with me at the bottom of the tunnel.       In the next few

moments all hell seemed to break loose.       Hundreds of Liverpool

supporters had spilled onto the pitch and were around the players

tunne1.   Many were berating everything and everybody and had

obviously been drinking.

I told the referee Mr. Lewis to go to his dressing room and that I

would give him any news as I got It and this he did.       I was then

engaged on keeping Liverpool supporters from going up the players

tunnel.

I was then instructed (I don't know whether this was verbally or by

radio) to take Mr. Clough and M r . Dalglelsh to the police control

point which I did.   There Chief Superintendent Duckenfield explained

to them the seriousness of the situation but that he could not make

an anouncement to the crowd because he did not want the rescue

services to be hampered in their approach to the ground.

I returned the Managers to the dressing rooms and then stayed near the

players tunnel.   At this time the office staff directly at the top of

the tunnel were allowing people to ’phone home from the office and I

was engaged in keeping them orderly e t c ,   Many of the supporters were

shouting obscenities.   At one point BBC TV were going to do an

Interview with Graham Kelly in the tunnel but abandoned It because of

the unruly behaviour of the Liverpool supporters near the tunnel.

         I then went to the North Stand at about 5.40pm for de-brief and left

         the ground at about 7.00pm.

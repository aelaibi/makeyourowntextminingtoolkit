               We     commenced             our     patrol       at     about          1000    hours       and    I spent             th e    first

The    first       couple         of       hours        of    patrol          went          very    quietly,           no       trouble,

About      midday          there       was        a steady          flow          of    Liverpool           fans,          mainly          older

men    with     wives        and       children who                 have          arrived          early     by       car a n d well

organised          c o ache s, making                   their       way       along          Leppings        Lane          to    the

turnstiles.                All    very        pleasant,             cheerfull                and    queueing           orderly             at    the

 turnstiles           to    get       into        the    ground.              If       they're        all     like         this       t h e n we

will     have      an      easy       da y    I thought.

At    about     1300        hours          the     majority             of    the       Liverpool           coaches             began       to

arrive      and were             sent        i nt o C l a y w h e e 1 s L a n e              for    parking           and       to

discharge          their         passengers.                  We    parked             on    the    forecourt              of L a w B r o s .

Coaches.           As      the    buses           emptied          the       number          of    fans     increased                greatly

and    they were            the       younger           fans       in    large          groups        and    gangs.             Many       of

them were          drinking            or     carrying             ’f o u r       p a c k s ’ or      plastic          2    l i tre

bottles       of      beer       and       lager.            Most       of    them appeared                 to     have         been

drinking        to      some      extent           and       some we r e           so       drunk     they       could          hardly walk

without       help         from       their        mates.           As       they       got       nearer     to       the       ground          they

began      chanting          and       singing           etc.,          some       were       starting           to    get       abusive

and    their       behaviour               slowly        became          worse.

About      1400      hours        we       moved        from Leppings                   Lane       into F e n i s t o n e            Road       to

escort      the       fans       to    the        ground who             had       arrived          by th e        Special            T r a i n at

Wadsley       Bridge.             Generally              they were                good       humoured        and      we l l         behaved

a n d we    got       them       to    the L e p p i n g s          Lane          turnstiles             without           any       trouble

and    in g o o d          time     to      get    into       the       ground          before          k i ck    off.

By    this       t i m e , due         to    the       volume          of    people          in L e p p i n g s        Lane,        it wa s

almost         impossible              to    drive       the       van       safely          along       the      road a n d         it

was    closed             to al l      traffic.

We    parked          in L e p p i n g s      Lane,          in the          entrance             to    the      Used       Tyre     firm,

(m a r k e d     A    on m a p s > a n d          kept       observations                   on the       turnstile             area.          At

this       t i me     the       area     in f r o n t        of    the       turnstiles                was    packed with

supporters                but    there       appeared             to    be    no       t r o u b l e , they were               queueing,                    j

sort       of,       and    they       were       getting          into       the       ground,          albeit         slowly,           without           j
any    problems.                                                                                                                                            j
There       we r e h o w e v e r         large         numbers          of    fans          just       hanging         about,        sat      on            j
the    parapet             walls       of    the       river       bridge,             sat    on       the    footpaths,             stood                  j
outside          the       chip     shop      and       the       other       shops          in the          immediate             area and

they were             making        no      attempt          to    join any             of    the       queues         at     the

turnstiles                which     were      now       relatively                quiet       to w h a t         they       had     been.          A

lot    of      these        fans       were       still       drinking                their       stocks         of    beer        etc.

The    flow          of    fans     along         Leppings             Lane       had       now almost            stopped.               It w a s

about       1 450 h o u r s .            I decided            to       take       a    last       look       along      Leppings           Lane             I

moving         off        from    the       tyre       firm       the       Mounted          officers            began        to    round      up           j

the    f a ns        who    were       hanging          about          and    direct          them        towards           the     turnstiles. (

I went         along        Leppings          Lane       to P e n i s t o n e           Road       around         the       roundabout                      |

and went             back       towards       the       g round.             The       road was           virtually            empty       and              |

traffic          officers           were      again          allowing             vehicles             along      Leppings           Lane.                  j

e ye s .       There        was     a mob         of    fans,          perhaps          1 500      plus,         all    jammed           in the

area       immediately              in f r o n t        of    the       turnstiles.                    They were            shouting          and           1

pushing          towards          the       turnstiles             attempting                to    get       into      th e    ground.

I parked             up    in L e p p i n g s      Lane       facing          th e      turnstiles               (marked           * 6 ’ on

maps).           There          appeared          to    be    very          few       police       officers            there        and    from

what    I could             hear       on    the       r a d i o , what         officers             there      were        in the a r e a

were    having          difficulty                controlling              these          fans       who    were       no w      pushing

from    the       back       of       this    crowd and              people          at    the       front      were        in     g r e at

difficulty.

A    number       of M o u n t e d          officers           were    trying             to    force       this       mob       away      from

the    gates       bu t      were       having          no     success.

A    police       landrover             then arrived with a PA                             system and an                   Inspector,            I

d o n ’t k n o w w h o           he    was,       climbed        onto       the       r oo f     of    the       vehicle           and     began

trying       to    stop          these       fans       pushing        by a p p e a l i n g           to    them       through           the PA.

He    shouted          at    them       for       several        minutes             and       tried       to    get       them around

the    side       of    the       ground          to a n o t h e r     turnstile                but    they       just        ignored

repeated attempts                      to    get       them     to    stop        pushing.

A Superintendent                      then     began speaking                   on th e         radio,          I d o n ’t k n o w w h o

he w a s     or w h e r e         he w a s        in    relation           to     the      turnstiles,                he    informed            the

control       that          the       situation           at    the L e p p i n g s            Lane    turnstiles                was

getting       out       of       control          and     there       were        several            hundred          supporters

still      outside           the       ground who              would miss             a goad          deal       of    the       first         half

of    the m a t c h         as    they       would        not    get       through             the    turnstiles              before           the

kick     off,      w hi ch was              now    due a n y         second.

He    then    suggested                that       the     kick       off    was       delayed          until          they       were      all

inside       the       ground.              Control          replied        that          they would             enquire           whether

this     could         be    d o ne.         I never           heard       th e      reply       to    his       request.

There      was     then a             loud     cheer         from     inside          the       ground,          possibly            the

players       coming             onto       the    field        or    even        the      kick       off       itself        as    my w a t c h

was    now    showing             1501       h ou r s .

The    result          of    this       was       that       this     mob       of    fans       outside          the       turnstiles

became       even more                frenzied          and     began       surging            and     pushing             forward         even

more.        The       Mounted          officers             and any        remaining                foot       officers           had

withdrawn          from          the m e l e e         for     their       own       safety.           It w a s        obvious           that

no m a t t e r         what              was     to       get      inside            that       ground.

To    ge t      out     of           the       c r u s h at         the         front        several           of    t h e m we re        now     scaling

the    perimeter                     walls           to    get      into         the       ground.             1 could        see        police

officers             who        were           inside           the      ground            reaching            over     the       walls       to a s s i s t

people          to     get           over        out       of      the     crush.

The Superintendent                               then        told Control                    that     he w a s         considering               opening

one    of       the     gates                 to a l l o w         these         supporters               into       th e    ground        as     in his

opinion           there              was       serious             risk         of    people        being            injured        or    even      killed

if the          pressure                  on     the       people         at         the     front        of    this        mob was        not

re 1 e a s e d .

As    I r e c a ll ,             control               replied           that         if     he    thought           the     si tut ion          needed

such       action,               then          they        were       in a g r e e m e n t          with        him.

A    few     seconds                 later           the S u p e r i n t e n d e n t              ordered           anyone        near     A Gate        to

OK    and    there        seemed       to    be    some       sort     of       problem          now     developing              inside

the     ground.           From    the       radio       traffic        I thought              there          was    a n attempt,

being       made by L i v e r p o o l            supporters           to    invade          the        pitch.         I thought

that     the       dogs    might       be    requested          to a s s i s t          with       clearing           fans       off        the

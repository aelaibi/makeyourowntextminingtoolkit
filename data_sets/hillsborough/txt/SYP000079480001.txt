           I am a single man living at the above address with my perents.

           I have been a Liverpool   supporter for most of my life and attend every

           game I possibly can.

           At the beginning of April   this year I managed to obtain two tickets

           for the FA Cup Semi Final, Liverpool v Notts Forest at Hillsborough I

           paid face value for the p i c k e t s a cost of six pounds per ticket.

           On the norning of Sat>d(rday 15th April    1989 together wit h/1 h r e e friend,
                             -      .                                   y

                                                 from

                            set off for Hillsborough in a^c4r driven by

           this would £e about 9.30am, as we got to South Yorkshire on the M1 the

           traffic slowed down and we were held up for a short time in traffic

           and arrived in Sheffield at about    12.00 O ’ Clock and parked our car on
                                                                                                PAGE      2
                                                                                                S2374

                     a pub car park just off Leppings Lane the car park was full but we

                     managed to get the car on.      We left the car and obtained chips from a

                     shop on Leppings Lane and we all sat on a grass bank eating them at

                     this time there were a lot of fans,         bot^V'L'i verpool and Notts Forest

                     milling about on Leppings Lane arv^on the grass bank where we were

                     about 300-400 fans sitting ajcrti drinking from cans they were singing

                    and shouted it was all very good humoured at this time.             The grass

                     bank was by the river don and close to Leppings Lane.           At about    1.00pm

                     I went back into Leppings Lane and stood by the gates the ground on

                     the corner of Leppings Lane a young policeman came and pulled me away

                     from my mates put me against a wall and searched me, he took my

                     wallet,    1 by this time were getting quite irate about this and they

                     threatened to arrest me at one stage but eventually after about 15

                    minutes he gave me my wallet back and told me to either go in or leave

                     the ground.     So I went through the turnstile      in the larger of the

                     two lots of turnstiles and into the ground I had surrendered my

                     ticket,    behind me there were about   10-15 men ,who obviously h a d n ’t got

             ^      'tickets and I saw the one immediately behind me pay to get in.              I
A          ^                                               /
^          '' ~      believe he gave the man on the turnstiles a ten pound note and walked

             ^       through as I had got through jthe tyrnstiles.          I sat and waited for
             <_3-
                    about     10 minutes this would bfe_^d>out 1.30pm.     There had been quite a
<2rf
                     few people waiting to get in there were orderly queues and it had

                     taken about 5-10 minutes to get in.          Once I had rested I made my way

                     towards the tunnel of the West Stand, as I approached the tunnel                I
           0*
                     could see it was quite     congested in the tunnelr^dfnd as I entered the

                     t unne 1 it be came tightly cramped and I feJ/E I had to move with the

                     crowd and was unable tocontro1 where/if want and I          emerged from the

                     tunnel    into Pen 4 and it seemed      te    free to move at that time I

                     could not find my mantes     in Pe^f 4 so I made my way back into the

                     mouth of the tunne1 and      tforen into Pen 3.    I had to push through to

                                                                        S2374
achieve this as the terraces became m o r je y crowded,   I found my mates

in Pen 3, and we stood together th/ j ^ was about  1.50pm the conditions
                                            -------------
were very cramped and I saw one y£hap, an old bioke 50 ish who had

passed out behind us and he w&s carried or pushed overhead to the

front and onto the pitch.       /There seemed to be a strong atmosphere
                            /
everyone seemed subdued for a few minutes and the pressure of people

coming in behind continued to build up,       I looked behind me to the

tunnel and it was literally heaving with people.          On looking around

I could see that it was virtually empty in Pen 2 or that there it was

a lot more room in there.       By about 2.45pm I could see a lot of

people all around me passing/out and fainting and it seemed that

people were beginning to pjjni c there was a lot of pushing going on,

and I was pushed onto a ^rush barrier and there w a s another        lad next

to m e , he was about 6 ’(/' tall m ousy brown hair shaved at the back,

wearing a Liverpool   sjCirt.     I was crying and screaming   in pain as the

barrier pushed into m y   ribs and each time I breathed there came more

pressure it was un be ar ab le , I looked to my left and saw the lad I had

described his head was forced onto the bar

                                               he appeared lifeless his body

was convulsing and his complexion was turning bluer.           I heard someone

shout to get him up, and as people tried,       they just fell on top of

him.   At this point my head was forced onto the barrier and I was

paverless to do anything to prevent myself going and I remember

colias ping onto someone.       My next recollection is of being on the

pitch or on the gravel at the side of the pitch and I was trying to

get my breath but felt as though I was choking I can recall being

carried around the pitch and sat on a hoarding boards by the North

Stand and I was attended by a Policeman who assisted me to get my

breath back, when I had recovered enough I walked back round to the

Leppings Lane end and I was screaming out for my mates and they jumped
                                                                                         PAGE      4

               over the fence to me two of them tried to help get others out.

               As I had been looking for my mates        I recall seeij^g^a yound lad

                                           he was wearing a Liverpool      top and jeans he
    '-'S   '
               appeared to be impaled on the spikes j i n     the perimeter f e n c e , he was

               shaking                 and he appealed dead,     as I continued to walk I

^              saw another   lad trying toVgeJL^over the fence he would be about 20 yrs

       Ao few- old and I saw a Policeman push him back into Pen off the fence.             After

               1 found my mates we continued to walk round the ground and around by
yJ%cL9-0
 ^    , .'a,the South Stand I saw a Policeman sitting on the advertising hoarding
(.0 _ Do#u •
           v   drinking from plastic cup,      I saw a bloke go up to him and scream at

               the Policeman to help and do something and he knocked the cup out of

               his hand a heated argument ensured ending up wi.th the Police putting

               the mans arm up his back and escorting hifR^off towards the players

               tunnel, as we followed up towards thp/players tunnel          I could see a

               line of about 300 Policeman in aydordon across the pitch and there

               were only about 20-30 h e ^ ^ n ^ a t   the Leppings Lane end.     It seemed to

               take ages for the ambulances to get through the Police should have

               helped get them through easier.




               As a result of the incident        had siight bruising to my chest

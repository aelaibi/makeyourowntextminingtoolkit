       Dear Sir

       Re: Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

       We act on behalf of Messrs Eastwood & Partners, Consulting
       Engineers  to Shef field - Wednesday F. C..     Our clients and
       Sheffield Wednesday Football     Club are involved in legal
       proceedings brought by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
       Police, trial of which is due to start in the High Court in
       Manchester on Tuesday 2nd October at 10. 30 a. m.

       You gave a Statement to the West Midlands Police last year and
       subsequently gave evidence to the Public Inquiry conducted by
       Lord Justice Taylor.    It was originally agreed between the
       parties to the present proceedings (and subsequently embodied
       in a Court Order) that the Statements and Evidence of witnesses
       like yourself to the Taylor Inquiry could be relied upon by any
       party to these proceedings.    The intention was that it would
       not be necessary for such witnesses to be called to give oral
       evidence at trial.

        However, the solicitors for the Chief Constable of South
        Yorkshire Police have just indicated that all the witnesses
        from the Taylor Inquiry relied upon by our clients and
        Sheffield Wednesday F. C. will not be accepted by the Chief
        Constable without those witnesses giving oral evidence at the
        trial commencing on 2nd October 1990.      You are one of the
        witnesses upon whose evidence to the Taylor Inquiry our clients
        wished to rely.

        We understand that the solicitors for the Chief Constable are
        not at the moment indicating categorically that you must attend
        to give oral evidence.  It appears that they have yet to decide
        finally which witnesses they will require to do so.      We are

                                                                                            1

required, however, to put    all      such   potential   witnesses   on,
notice including yourself.

We must therefore notify you that you may be called upon to
attend the trial at Manchester, the Courts of Justice, Crown
Square, to give evidence.    We are unable yet to indicate as a
certainty whether you will be called and, if so, upon what
date.   The trial is listed for six weeks from 2nd October 1990.
However,   we understand that the solicitors for the Chief
Constable hope to be able to let us know their final decision
shortly after the commencement of trial next week.      We shall
write further as soon as we have more information.

D ear Sir

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

I refer to your letter dated 27 April 1990 and thank you for forwarding the
correspondence received from an un-named source in Belgium.

I have forwarded the letter to Mr L Sharp who is currently in charge of the West
Midlands Police Enquiry Team who are dealing with all aspects of the events at
Hillsborough in the course of their current enquiry. Should they be able to identify the
writer, I am sure that you will be informed as requested.

Yours faithfully




Chief Superintendent
for Chief Constable

(b)          Ground Design

The football authorities should estaelish an advisory design council to
research and provide infcrmaticn cn stadium ceeien.

C o n te n t      .
C.ne of the major problens face a 'ey local authority officers is the fact
that grounds differ considerably. Safety is affected by design faults and
anything which can help to improve ground design is to be welcomed.
However, the football authorities do net-have ail the knowledge or
perspectives to carry cut this task single ha.nc.ec and a local authority
input would be of value.

(c )         Matlonal Inspectorate

Taylor proposes a National Inspectorate and ar. Authority to oversee the
certification of grounds.

Comment.

It would be far better to sake the provisions of-tne Greer. Guide mandatory.
At present, decisions about certification rest or. local Judgements based on
individual interpretations cf tne minimum standards which are set out in the
Green Guide. An Inspectorate would simply add ar.etner layer of cecision-
making cn top cf the present system. With statutory standards, an
Inspectorate would be superfluous.  If it is decided to maintain the
present unsatisfactory status cf the Green Guide er.d to create an
Authority, the Authority should have appropriate representation by local
government.

(d )         Terraces

The Report recommends:                                     "                    .   -

           (i)' . a written agreement between the police and the club setting cut
                  functions and restcnsicil ties;

           (ii)               crowd limits should be specified for each area cf the ground on
                              the safety certificate:
     /
     /                                                            .

                (iii)     a turnstile rate cf no more chan 660 per hour;

                (v)       gangways to be kept clean and conspicuously narked.

         Connects

         These specifications v;ill be suoject to technical consideration by
         advisers.

         (e)     Fences. Gates and Cru.

         The Recort re corients that fences should be no oigher than 2.2 rr.etrea an:
         should not be spiked. There should be enough gates 1.1 metres vide to
         allow evacuation cn to the ::itch in emergency, ~hey should be painted a

         advisers.

         ’f)      Stewards

         Should be trained at the clubs expense to high standards.

         Comment

         Tnis is AHA policy. •*-

         :g)       Tickets

         •lo supporter without a ticket should be allowed to gain access to a
         stadiun.

           C!T m-STk'tr


         This is AMA policy.- Consideration needs to be given to the question of
         whether match day sales of tickets should be permitted.

          ’h)      Mew Criminal Offences

         Trere should be new cffences cf:

                 'i!      invading the playing area,

                 ;ii)     throwing missiles,

                 {iii)’obscene or racial abuse,

                 (iv)     ticket touting.

         These should be backed- up by exclusion orders, attendance orders and
         electronic tagging.


                                                       3
C c. unent

Lesal and police advisers have not yet commented cn this issue-, but in
previous discussions there has- been a view that there are sufficient laws
available for the police to use in rest cases of rrc;:blo at sporting
events.

 (i)     Alcohol

The report regards alcohol as an important contributory factor in crovn
disturbances. The current ban on alcohol at matches has tended to drive
the fans into public nouses before matches. Taylor suggests that this
could be counters; by earlier kick offs - i.e. before public house opc-r.ir.j
hours, and good pre-r.asoh entortainnr-nt.

 Comment

Ct-inion in the Association is divided on the questitn of the degree to
which alcohol is a factor .in crowd trouble. However, AHA has' advocated
good tre-match entertainment as part of sr. improved family package at
 m a tc h e s .

 (j )    Identity Cards

 The Retort rejects identity cards as being impractical and a possible
 contributor to ground disturbance by virtue of their ur.realiabiiity.

 Comment

 The AMA has been opposed to Identity Cards from the beginning. The AMA has
 always supported the development of voluntary membership schemes by which
 good* supporters can be brought into closer association with clubs and can
 be offered appropriate benefits and rewards.

 Future Action

 A joint meeting of the Police and Fire and Emergency Planning Committees
 with the Football Development Working Party (ART Committee) is expected as
 soon as practicable. This will enable advisers to comment fully on
 the Taylor Report ar.d to maxe recommendations to tee Policy Committee.

 The Football Development Working Party (ART) is committed tc calling a
 conference cf local authority, fcctbal- authority ar.d other relevant
 interests by invitation at AMA as seen as practicable (lateMarch/early   *
 April'. This conference would be jointly nested cy AMA ar.cFootballs
 Family Forum and there are early indications cf possible Football Trust
 assistance to cover costs. It is essential that such a conference take
 place as soon as possible to demonstrate the willingness of local
 authorities and the. football authorities to put the issues raised by
 Taylor into effect. Any delay will probably trigger adverse governmental
 action.

Dear Mr. Webster,

THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

We are a small research/policy body based in local government,
working towards developing, and promoting, more effective emergency
planning in the Capital.

At present I am carrying out the research for a detailed
investigation into the nature of major accidents and disasters, and
the local emergency response to such events. We hope to publish this
work early next year.

I appreciate the sensitivity of this matter, however, if possible,   I
would be most grateful if you could provide me with copies of any
material produced by the Council about the tragic events at
Hillsborough, in particular committee reports and similar sources.   I
am interested in all aspects of the Council's involvement, including
emergency planning, lines of communication, and support work. I would
appreciate any suggestions you may have about other sources.

Thank you for your help.

Yours sincerely




                                                                                                       7

Dear Frances

Further to our telephone conversation this morning I enclose an outline
of the work we are currently undertaking at the Centre.

I would very much appreciate you sending me a copy of the Minutes of
the relevant meeting which are apparently for publication.

I look forward to hearing from you and I thank you for your co-operation.

HILLSBOROUGH AND AFTER;   THE LIVERPOOL EXPERIENCE

Edge Hill's Centre for Studies in Crime and Social Justice has been
commissioned to carry out a one year research project into the aftermath
of the Hillsborough Disaster. The project is under the direction of
Dr Phil Scraton and currently employs 3 researchers - Sheila Coleman,
Ann Jemphrey and Paula Skidmore - who are based at the Centre.

Apart from taking in-depth accounts of the post-Hillsborough progression
of events within the city (including the views of local politicians and
social workers) the main objectives of the project are:-

  (i)   to consider the background and impact of 'hooligan hysteria' and
        the emphasis on controlling football supporters on police policies
        and practices;

 (ii)   to examine the significance of prejudiced attitudes, held by central
        government and the authorities, concerning Merseyside's negative
        reputation in the control of Merseyside supporters;

(iii)   to monitor all three inquiries into Hillsborough providing a full
         evaluation of the adequacy of the inquiries, and their selective
        use of evidence;

 (iv)   to inquire into events related to Hillsborough which will not be
        covered by the official investigations (treatment of relatives by
        the authorities; intrusive journalism; impact of the social
        services; etc.).

The research project works with the Hillsborough Working Party of the City
Council with the aim of placing this full range of material within the longer
term historical, political and economic developments of soccer and its
recent emphasis on control and regulation - both from official bodies
within the sport and from those with responsibility for policing it. To
realise these objectives and to investigate fully the issues raised above,
the project aims to achieve a unique combination of critical research,
knowledge of the criminal justice/official inquiry procedures, media research,
a grasp of the debates concerning police powers and accountability and
familiarity with soccer in Liverpool.

    Dear Sheila,

    Thank you for* your letter of the 20th October, 1989. I apologise for the
    delay in sending you the material that you requested. It is not for any
    unwillingness to co-operate with the project but more from the sheer
    pressure of work at the current time.

    I attach for your information various pieces of public reports and minutes
    which 1 hope will be of use to you. These include minutes of the special
    meeting of the South Yorkshire Police Authority on the i H h August, minutes
    of the Police and Community Safety Panel of the City Counoil referring to
    Hillsborough and the report presented to the Police Authority on Friday last
    the 17th November about Lord Justice Taylor’s interim report.

    You may be interested to note that oontaot was aade last Friday between the
    City Council and the Hillsborough Disaster Families Group, and same liaison
    is taking place now with them. If you would like any further information
    that I can supply, do contact me.

    Yours sincerely,

Notes on Sheffield Trades Union Council

Submission to the Hillsborough Inquiry


PARAGRAPH 3

Recommendations 26 to 43 of the report relate to:- Police Planning,
Communications, Co-ordination of Emergency Services and First Aid, Medical
Facilities and Ambulances. They do not relate specifically to the "major
disaster plan*.'. As far as I am aware, there has been no specific criticism of
the "major disaster plan" although West Midlands Police are investigating how
the plan was put into operation and there may be criticism or recommendations in
the final report. West Midlands Police have assured Sheffield City Council so
far that there has been no criticism of the way Sheffield City Council operated
its emergency plan.


PARAGRAPH '4/5

It may be the recommendation of Lord Justice Taylor that there is an emergency
pLan specifically relating to football stadia. It is difficult to plan for
every type of emergency in great detail e.g. a rail crash, air crash, motorway
pile up, or a combination, all with varying detail. The generally preferred
course appears to be to have a general enabling plan so that you are able to be
flexible and respond to a particular problem.

The Green Guide is advisory and flexible. Lord Justice Taylor is looking at
this and our recommendation 10 suggests that the status and content of the Green
Guide is reconsidered to look at the alternative of regulations and statutory
codes of practice.

PARAGRAPH 6

See recommendation 42 and 43 of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report. The
condition in Sheffield City Council's licence is that the club has to arrange
for the attendance of at least one ambulance on relevant occasions with South
Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

PARAGRAPH 7

This is broadly in line with our recommendation 12.


PARAGRAPH 8

It is clear that Lord Justice Taylor intends that football supporters should
have an opportunity to comment on proposals and put forward proposals in
relation to football grounds. It is intended that representatives of football
supporters will be included in the Advisory Forumby Sheffield City Council.


PARAGRAPH 9

The Health and Safety Executive role in Safety of Sports Grounds passes to the
L ocalAuthority on 1st April 1990. The powers set out in the paragraph have
been suggested in our recommendations in particular points 2 and 10.



PB/28/EB2212
SUBMISSION.

Introduction.

1. Sheffield TUC wrote to Lord Justice Taylor on 17.5.89 asking that two
   specific issues be addressed by the Inquiry, namely:

    (i) the adequacy or otherwise of the emergency plans which were
        in place at the time of the Disaster:

   <ii) the need for football clubs to establish consultative
        machinery via which the knowledge and experience of football
        spectators can influence arrangements at football grounds.

2. Sheffield TUC was subsequently asked to produce a written submission.

Emergency Plans.

3. Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report makes little direct reference
   to implementation of emergency plans. Paragraphs 96, 107, and 252
   refer to the Police activation of the Major Disaster Plan CMDP),
   which is presumably a "general" Disaster Plan, rather than an
 - emergency plan tailored to the specific circumstances of a major
   football match at the Hillsborough Stadium. It would appear from
   the Report's recommendations 26 - 43 (which the STUC welcomes) that
   the MDP was assessed by the Inquiry and found to be lacking in.
   relation to events at Hillsborough but this is not specifically
   stated in the body of the Report. If the ,Kajor Disaster Plan proved
   defective in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster, what confidence
   can the public place in it's effectiveness in the event of other
   disasters ?

4. Sheffield TUC believes that there are close parallels between the
   emergency planning requirements of major industrial hazard sites
   and those of major sporting arenas. The Control of Industrial Major
   Accident Hazard Regulations (CIKAH) require in relation to designated
   "Major Hazard Sites" that (inter alia) the site operator draws up an
   on-site emergency plan and that the Fire and Civil Defence Authority/
   County Council draws up and keeps up-to-date a site-specific off-site
   emergency plan which should "dovetail" together, and whose key
   purpose should be to enable the emergency services and other relevant
   parties (viz. Health and Local Authorities) to respond in an
   appropriate'and'integrated way in the event of a serious problem at
   the site. The Health and Safety Executive is the enforcing authority
   for^the CIMAH Regulations, and has the power to ensure that plans
   are adequate.

5. Sheffield TUC urges Lord Justice Taylor to examine the relevant
   Sections of the Cl MAH Regulations, and to recommend that
   comparable statutory requirements are Imposed in relation to
   Football Stadiums. The need for statutory requirements rather than
      l  i   l  t  I   a            6 13 emPhasised: ^ a major club
      like Sheffield Wednesday failed to comply with the "Green Guide" on
      capacity access, etc.,there is little hope for the smaller club
      without adequately enforced statutory regulations.

 6'                       deP1°y®ent of ambulances, the Sheffield TUC
         ieves that there should be a statutory requirement for Health
              + hk^ Ul*nles ta be ^Ployed at major sporting events and
      that^Football Clubs should in general be prevented from relying
      on the voluntary sector for the provision of ambulances.

Stewarding Arrangements.


                               th a t th 0 re should be ^ t a i l e d requirem ents imposed on
      f o o t b a l l c lu b s to a d eq u a tely t r a i n Stewards in the h an d lin g o f
      subi'eotCf0S' rain^n° standards should be specified in detail and
      subject to external scrutiny.

Consultative Machinery.

8. Sheffield TUC strongly welcomes Lord Justice Taylor's Interim
   Recommendation 17, in particular the inclusion of r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s
      a recognised supporters' club on each Advisory Group. It would
   help the establishment and operation of such Advisory Groups if th-
   bactin°nS^ D1
               T ? ! ! iP’ ^ termS °f reference GOuld be give^ statutory
   backing and if the number ol representatives from the recognised
   supporters club is sufficient to give such representatives r»al
              Th0 fdIiSOr7 GrouP should delude Trade Union appointed
   Safety Representatives where Unions are recognised bv the Club
   concerned.

General.

  Many of the recommendations contained in the Interim Report will be
   implemented more effectively if there is an effective method of
  en orcement. Sheffield TUC believes that, with an adequate increase
      the ref urcm S °f the Health and Safety Executive, it would be
  appropriate for "Football Safety Legislation" to be enforced by the
  HSE, and for such legislation to be made as R e g u l a t i o n s . Approved
    odes ol Practice, etc., under the Health and Safety at Vork Act.
     e existing powers of HSE Inspectors, especially the power to issue
  Improvement and Prohibition notices, are »eli suited to the
  enforcement of measures such as those in the Interim Report.

  10. I' 89.
        Be fore Ch r is tma s the police put forward proposals to make payments,
        in certain cases and subject to certain conditions, to victims of €
        H i l ls b or ou g h Disaster.  Sh ef fie ld City Council, together with
        the other parties to the litigation were invited to contribute
        to those payments.          The Council, on advice from the solicitors
        acting for the insurers in the civil litigation declined to
        contribute.

     Dear Mr, Webster,

    On Thursday last I spoke to Frances woodhead of your Department regarding a
    meeting of the Officer Working party which is to be held this coming Thursday,
    19th October 1989.

    At that time I. emphasised that in view of the important matters being                                       discussed
    the presence of representatives from the Club would be of great value                                        and
    considerable importance. As yet I haVO not received an invitation to                                         attend and
    should be grateful therefore if this matter could be given your early                                        attention.

     Yours sincerely,

INTRODUCTION


The information contained in the following pages has been summarised
from the Inquest Training Day held at Lodge Moor Hospital, Sheffield
on the 6 th October, 1989-

The day was chaired by John Pilling, Assistant Director, Sheffield
Family & Community Services Department.    In his opening address, he
acknowledged the reason for our need .to come together on-such-a’Training
Day and therefore asked for one minute's silence as a mark of respect to
all those who died at Hillsborough on the 15th April, 1989.

The talks of each of the main contributors have been reproduced and
therefore some duplication of facts and points will be found. The major
recommendations however have been summarised at the end of this document.

It must also be noted that some of the information is general to
disasters and some specific to particular ones, e.g. Zeebrugge and King's
Cross. The information on inquests is also general, as at this stage it
is not possible to say exactly what the scenario will be for the
Hillsborough Inquests. It is, however, hoped to run a further Training
Day once the date and details of the Inquests are known.

February, 1990
                                     2

MR. K. D. POTTER - Coroner, South Yorkshire East District

Mr Potter began by indicating that he would be unable to comment
Specifically on the Hillsborough disaster. He stressed that he had
no connection with the incident and that as such his knowledge of
what had happened on the day of the disaster was the same as (no greater
than) any intelligent individual who read newspapers and watched television.

Mr Potter then talked about the history of the Coroner's Court and how
it has evolvedinto its present form with specific reference to the
inquisitorial, as opposed to accusatorial, nature of the Court. For
the purpose of this paper, it is not necessary to go into detail
about the the history of the Coroner's Court. Suffice it to say that
over the years, many of the previous responsibilities of the Coroner
have been shed, until the Coroner of the present day is involved almost
totally with the investigation of death, though some vestigial
interests such as treasure trove stili remain.

The Coroner today is an independent officer appointed by the Local
Authority. He/she is independent of Central or Local Government and
must be qualified either medically and/or legally. The Home Secretary
offers support and advice to the Coroner but he has no control over
him/her. A Coroner is appointed for life or until voluntary retirement
and cannot be dismissed, except for a grave breech of behaviour.

Circumstances requiring an Inquest

Certain types of death cannot be disposed of without an inquest.
These comprise criminal cases (murder, manslaughter and infanticide);
suicides; road, rail, aviation, domestic and other accidents;
industrial accidents and diseases; deaths in prison or police custody;
deaths where negligent medical treatment is alleged; deaths from
neglect and any other case where the Coroner feels that a public
hearing would be beneficial.

Certain of these cases must be held with a Jury (see Section on Jury).

Adjournment of Inquests

In some cases , it is necessary for a Coroner to open an inquest and
then adjourn it. This would be the case if the death was an obvious
criminal one, in order to allow time for criminal proceedings to take
place. An adjournment also is necessary if the Director of Public
Prosecutions is asked to examine the circumstances surrounding a
death in order to make a decision whether or not to prosecute. This
has been the case with the Hillsborough disaster.

Functions of the Coroner's Court

The Court has two functions in relation to a death:

(1)    To establish the medical cause of death;
(2)    To enquire into the circumstances and cause of a death if the
       death is violent or unnatural.

The Coroner has the power to order a post mortem if he feels it
necessary. As all accidents are reportable to the Coroner, a major
incident involving a number of deaths, as in the case of Hillsborough,
would be referred to a Coroner, and post mortems would be required to
establish the cause of death in each case.
                                    3


Reporting of Deaths

The majority of reports of a death are made by the Police, but in
some cases, a doctor or the Registrar will notify the Coroner of a
death in his/her jurisdiction.

Jurisdiction

The Coroner to whom an inquest would be referred depends on where the
body of the deceased is found. In the case of the 95 people who died
at Hillsborough, it will be necessary for the Inquest to be held in
Sheffield under the jurisdiction of the Sheffield Coroner.

The Jury at an Inquest

There are four circumstances where a Coroner must summon a jury.
These are:-

(a)       that the death occurred in prison.
(b)        that the death occurred while the deceased was in Police
          custody.
(c)       that the death was caused by an accident, poisoning, or
          disease, notice of which is required to be given under any
          act to a Government department.
(d)        that the death occurred in circumstances where the continuance
          or possible recurrence of which is prejudicial to the health
          and safety of the public or any section of the public.

Under category (d) therefore the Hillsborough Inquests will have a Jury.

Qualifications of Jurors

The same rules and qualifications apply to Jurors summoned to attend a
Coroner's Inquest as those who might be summoned to attend a Crown Court.

Number of Jurors

The Coroner shall summon no less than seven and no more than eleven
Jurors.

¥erdict

A unanimous verdict must be sought; the majority can be accepted
with no greater minority than two, but the Coroner is only obliged
to accept a unanimous verdict. If the minority is greater than two
then the Jury is discharged and a further Inquest must follow with
a fresh Jury,. In order to reach the verdict, the Jury must retire
from the Court and consider their verdict in private, without either
Coroner or anyone else present.

The Jury can visit the scene of an incident where the death occured
if it helps them to reach a verdict. Dr Popper may decide to take
the Jury to Hillsborough to look over the scene of the incident.

After summing up, the Coroner or Jury must consider what verdict is
to be returned.
                                       4


The List of possible verdicts includes:

             Natural causes
             Industrial disease
             Dependence on drugs/non/dependent abuse of drugs
             Suicide
             Accident/Misadventure
            •Sentence of death
             Lawful killing
             Open verdict
             Unlawful killing
             Stillbirth
             Want of attention at birth
             Attempted/Self induced abortion

Further explanations of these verdicts can be found in Jervis - Book
on Coroner's 16.12.

Mr Potter gave further details on an unlawful killing verdict and
noted that it covers murder, manslaughter, infanticide, and causing
death by reckless driving. A gross negligence manslaughter verdict
requires proof beyond reasonable doubt of gross negligence - going
beyond a mere matter of compensation and showing such disregard for
the life and safety of others as to amount to a Crime against the
State and conduct deserving punishment.

Witnesses

All witnesses at an Inquest are under oath, but the rules of evidence
are not applied as strictly as they are in other Courts. For example,
witnesses in a Coroner's Court have three privileges:

(1)         Against Self incrimination
<2)         Privacy between their lawyer and themselves
(3)         Public interest immunity.

Any person who satisfies the Coroner that he falls within one of the
following categories of person is entitled to examine witnesses at an
Inquest, either in person, by counsel or a solicitor:

(a)      Parent, child, spouse and any personal representative of
          the deceased;
(b)      any beneficiary under a policy of insurance issued on the
          life of the deceased;
(c)      the insurer who issued such a policy of insurance;
(d)      any person whose act or omission or that of his agent or servant
          may in the opinion of the Coroner have caused, or contributed
          to, the death of the deceased;
(e)     . any person appointed by a trades union to which the deceased
          at the time of his death belonged, if the death of the deceased
          may have been caused by an injury received in the course of
          his employment or by an industrial disease;
(f)      an inspector appointed by, or a representative of,   an enforcing
          authority, or any person appointed by a government department
          to attend the Inquest;
(g)      the chief officer of police:
(h)      any other person who in the opinion of the Coroner is a properly
          interested person.
          Jervis 13.2
                                   5


The evidence given by witnesses at an Inquest is usually oral, but
documentary evidence can also be used, including photographs. Written
statements made earlier by witnesses can also be used.

A witness must first be examined by a Coroner, after the conclusion
of which any properly interested party may examine the witness. The
witnesses' own representatives should examine him/her last of all.
An important point to note here is that Legal Aid is not yet available
for representation in Coroner's Court.

Joinder of Inquests

Where an incident involving many deaths occurs it is common for the
Inquests to be held concurrently. It is the right of each person to
have his/her own seperate inquest even where as at a multiple inquest
the cause of death may be the same in many cases.

The Hillsborough Inquests

If the Director of Public Prosecutions decides not to bring charges
the Coroner's Court can commence and will take place with a Jury and
witnesses.

IF however the D.P.P. decides to bring a charge of manslaughter then
Section 16 of the Coroner's Act 1988 requires the Coroner to adjourn
the Inquest until after the conclusion of the relevant criminal
proceedings.

The findings of the Inquest as to the cause of death must not be
inconsistent with the outcome of any relevant criminal proceedings,
i.e. IF the ensuing verdict is a conviction of manslaughter then the
Inquest Jury must return a verdict of unlawful killing, but if there
had been an aquittal then presumably only a verdict of Accidental
Death or Misadventure or an Open Verdict would be allowed.

IF no charges are preferred, then in due course the Coroner's Inquest
will be resumed and verdicts returned. Should there be a verdict of
Unlawful Killing the Coroner could refer all the papers to the D.P.P.
for further consideration.

Optional Legal Strategies

Doug Fraser - Solicitor from Liverpool Steering Committee


Mr Doug Fraser is a partner in the Liverpool firm of Silverman and
Livermore, which was contacted within the first week of the disaster.
He is also a member of the Liverpool Steering Committee. Within that
first week, Liverpool's local Law Society thought about forming a
Steering Committee. This Committee was duly elected at an open meeting
at the Law Society in Liverpool. Six lawyers were elected and they
have gone on to represent over 130 firms of solicitors around the
country who are acting for the bereaved and injured. They call them­
selves the Hillsborough Solicitors Group. The Steering Committee see
their priorities as falling into five main areas. These are:-

(i)      The Inquiry. To represent relatives en bloc. The Home
          Office had given approval for this to happen and paid for
          this representation.

(ii)     Inquests. To represent relatives en bloc once again. This
          had worked well at the Inquiry and seems an appropriate way
          of handling the Inquests.

(iii)     Trust Fund. To have some legal input to the Fund.

(iv)      Civil claims. To represent families in any claims they
          might wish to make for compensation.

(v)      Information. The Committee publishes regular bulletins
          which are sent out to various firms of solicitors which
          make up the Hillsborough Solicitors Group. These solicitors
          are then able to take from the Bulletins relevant information
          to pass on to their clients.

Having given a background description about the Steering Committee, Mr
Fraser went on to describe how his talk would give a flavour of other
legal matters, including the Inquests themselves, and he divided this
part of his talk into eight sections

1   .     Effects of the Disaster on families.
2.        Timetable of events.
3.        Criminal Proceedings.
4.        Public Inquiry.
5.        Civil Claims for damages.
6   .     Distribution of Trust Funds.
7.        Inquests.
8.        Questions and Answers.


Effects of the Disaster

It is recognised that the physical damage incurred as a result of an
accident or disaster is easier to see and assess then emotional and
psychological damage. The lawyers have to try and assess the emotional
damage in financial terms for compensation. This, by necessity, will
take some time,as it needs to be at least a year after the event before
the full extent of the damage is known, i.e. is it permanent; has it
passed and if so how long did it last for? One area that the Steering
                                        7



     Committee is looking at is the Press and the effect it had in terms
     of psychological damage.

2.   Timetable of Legal Events

     (i)     .The    original timetable of events would have been as follows:-

               (a)     Public Inquiry and the publication of its findings in
                      two parts.

               (b)    Inquests. They had been due to start in January, 1990
                      and would have had a very high profile.

               (c)    Civil Claims.

               (d)    Steering Committee would then have invited the Director
                      of Public Prosecutions to look at all the papers and
                      evidence available with a view to a question of criminal
                      proceedings.

     However, asPeter Wright, Chief Constable    of South Yorkshire Police, sent
     a copy ofLord    Justice Taylor's report to D.P.P., the timetable of events
     has had to be revised.

     (ii)      The revised timetable is as follows:-

               (a)    Public Inquiry.

               (b)     D.P.P. must now consider Lord Justice Taylor's Report
                      and evidence being gathered by West Midlands Police.
                      If no charges or minor charges are brought then the
                      original timetable would come back into effect, with
                      either the Inquests or the Civil Cases coming first.
                      However, if the D.P.P. recommends Prosecution then
                      those charges must be heard before either the Inquests
                      or the Civil Cases.

     If there are serious prosecutions, i.e. manslaughter, then solicitors
     would expect every procedural opportunity and device to be used that
     would prolong and delay the event. Those prosecuted will almost
     certainly seek an oral committal before Magistrates, and seek to have
     it thrown out. Then there would be a full blown Crown Court trial. All
     this would extend the timescale by some months, meaning that the Inquests
     would be severely delayed.

3.   Criminal Proceedings

     Since the Zeebrugge disaster, it has been possible to charge a corporate
     body with manslaughter. This is because manslaughter can carry a fine as
     a sentence, whereas the sentence for murder is life imprisonment.
     Currently, the West Midlands PoH'ce are investigating various agencies
     and bodies in a corporate sense, and individuals within these organisations.
     These include the South Yorkshire Police; Sheffield Wednesday Football
     Club and the Football Association; Sheffield City Council; the
     engineeering company who designed the barriers in the pens, and the fans
     in their broadest sense are under consideration. There may also be others
     who are being investigated. The charges that could be brought range
     from manslaughter to minor breaches of rules and regulations.
                                      8



4•   Public Inquiry

     The injured and bereaved were represented at the Public Inquiry by way
     of bloc representation. The Liverpool Steering Committee therefore had
     a team of lawyers at the Inquiry. This bloc representation took the
     form of:.-

     (a)        A Q.C.
     (b)        A junior barrister.
     (c)       Input from the six lawyers representing the Steering Committee.

     At the Inquiry, the various solicitors in the Hillsborough Solicitors
     Group gave information obtained from their clients to the six lawyers
     representing the Steering Committee. They then acted as filters of this
     information, i.e. as information came in, it was sifted and then
     presented to the barristers.

     There was a massive amount ofevidence    to be dealtwith at  the Public
     Inquiry and it made sense to have bloc representationin order to avoid
     a situation whereby over 1 5 0 solicitors were acting on behalf of
     individual clients.

     The Steering Committee believe that bloc representation should also be
     used at the Inquest. Doug Fraser has already discussed this with the
     Coroner, Dr Popper, who also agrees that it is an appropriate way to
     represent the bereaved at the Inquest.

5•   Civil Claims

     In Doug Fraser's opinion, the system of compensating the victims of
     disaster in this country is woefully inadequate, but it can only be
     changed by Parliament.

     In relation to civil claims, the Liverpool Steering Committee met the
     insurers of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the Police in
     July, 1989. The insurers denied liability so writs were issued by the
     Committee and statements of claims served.

     Since this time, the Police insurers have in fact agreed to pay in full
     claims for killed, injured or those suffering from shock as a result
     of their experience at the match. Seven hundred (700) claims have been
     dealt with. Liability has not however been accepted and the insurers
     have not agreed to compensate any other category of people affected by the
     disaster. The Steering Committee are seeking to extend the category of
     compensation to include those who saw the events unfold on the television
     and were severely affected by what they saw. Test cases have been selected
     from this group of people, including relatives of the deceased and
     injured, and will be put before the insurers in June, 1990.

     The Steering Committee believe that the victims of disaster who suffer
     from post traumatic stress disorder should be adequately compensated
     and they are seeking to push back the barriers of compensation to include
     this group of people.

     It is also the opinion of the Steering Committee that someone was
     responsible for the disaster at Hillsborough, that it was not "just one
     of those things”, which the denial of liability might suggest.
                                         9




     In relation to payments made to individuals from the Trust Fund, it is
     important to note that civil claims are not affected by Trust Fund
     payments. It is therefore possible for people to be given money by the
     Trust Fund and claim against insurers. The main difference to note is
     that money paid to children in Civil Claims will be invested by the
     Court who have absolute authority to do this.

6.   The Trust Fund

     The Trust Fund was set up with the intention of making financial payments
     to people affected by the disaster from donations given by the general
     public as an expression of sympathy.

     At the present time (January, 1990) the total amount of money received
     into the Trust Fund is £11.5 million.     The Trustees have paid out
     approximately £ 6 million to the bereav'ed and £ 2 million to the seriously
     injured. Seven hundred and fifty (750) claims have been received and
     four hundred (400) have been dealt with.

     The Fund is administered by a group of Trustees who are experienced
     lawyers and accountants. Individual levels of need have been, and
     continue to be, assessed by a group of doctors and lawyers who contribute
     to the decision as to who should get what.

     The Liverpool Steering Committee have no active part in the decisions of
     the Trust Fund, but they are in a position to offer financial advice to
     families, many of whom will receive substantial amounts of money. Never
     having had vast amounts of money before, they will benefit from professional
     advice on investing the money for their children, etc.

7.   The Inquest

     At the time of writing (January, 19Q0), the date of the Inquest remains
     unknown.

     (1 )      Where the Inquest comes in the. timetable of events.
     (2 )      What the "opposition" are going to do.

     Both of these will influence the type of profile that the Inquest has and
     therefore the nature of the Inquest.

     Listed below are possible scenarios that will dictate the nature of the
     Inquest.

     HIGH PROFILE                                LOW PROFILE

     IF the D.P.P. decides not to make           IF the D.P.P. decides to prosecute
     criminal charges the Inquest will           and brings minor charges, the
     be used to try to bring a verdict           Coroner may decide to defer the
     of unlawful killing and will                Inquest, in which case the
     therefore be high profile,                  Inquest will not be held until
     involving many witnesses and                after the Criminal proceedings
     substantial representation from             and will therefore be low
     Solicitors.                                 profile.
                                  10




HIGH PROFILE                               LOW PROFILE

IF the D.P.P. decides to make              IF the D.P.P. decides to bring
minor criminal charges, the                major charges, e.g. manslaughter,
Coroner may decide to go ahead             the Coroner must defer the
with the Inquest. A verdict of             Inquests until after the
unlawful‘killing by the Inquest            criminal proceedings and again
jury could still be sought and             the Inquest will be low profile.
the Police and the Club decide
to have representation at the
Inquest, thus making it high
profile.

It is the Coroner's reponsibility to each individual family to investigate
into the cause of death of a relative; the main questions being where,
when and how the person met his/her death.  Every family is entitled to
have representation at the Inquest. The majority of families will be
legally represented by the Steering Committee Solicitors.

Doug Fraser has had a number of discussions with the Coroner, Dr Popper,
and will remain in contact with him to discuss issues arising regarding
the Inquest.

Dr Popper is likely to hold the Inquest in two parts. The first part will
be a generic inquiry into the events of 15th April, 1989. This may be
done in a relatively short time because Dr Popper will have the information
from the public inquiry available to him.

The second part will be the actual Inquests. Dr Popper is keen to have
95 separate inquests, one for each bereaved family, to give them as much
information as possible about the way in which the relative met his/her
death.

In fact, many of the families have already had access to post-mortem
reports, because the Coroner has released them to solicitors if the families
have requested them.

At Dr Popper's request, the West Midlands Police are currently preparing
95 files, one on each of the deceased. Solicitors so far do not have
access to these files.  (See question iv).

Timetable of Inquest

In Doug Fraser's opinion, Dr Popper is likely to structure the order of
the inquests around the Pathologists who examined the bodies. This means
that the order may appear to be random.

Logistics of the Inquest

According to the Steering Committee, the Medico Legal Centre is not big
enough to hold the Hillsborough Inquests even if they are low profile.

The bereaved families have already told their solicitors that they would
like certain facilities made available to them, and these include:-

(1)       A private room to get away from the attention of the media and
          where they can sit quietly if things get too difficult.
                                   11



(2)         Separate facilities for the client to talk to the lawyer in
            private, should they so wish.

Finally, Doug Fraser stressed that individual families should make sure
that their lawyers spend sufficient time with them before and throughout
the Inquest.

              Questions & Answers - Doug Fraser


Q.'   (i)     Robert Quinn of Knowsley Borough Council asked if T.V. companies
              were being considered for liability, as some people had suffered
              shock through watching the event on T.V.

A.            "The Steering Committee looked at T.V. companies and newspapers*'
              but you have the option to turn off your T.V. set. The Steering
              Committee decided to concentrate on one or two people to blame.
              If we receive specific instructions from clients, as individual
              solicitors, to look at other issues like T.V. we will do so."

Q.    (ii)    Mary Gaylor of Gloucestershire Social Ser'VIceg commented that
              as the Steering Committee had said they were not going to have
              anything to do with the national press, could some sort of
              statement be made that would help to deflect some of the press
              interest.

A.            "The Steering Committee have a press officer. We are not
              prepared to give lertgthy interviews to the media. We would be
              prepared to give a press statement, but these are often not
              published. Television is different; it has an air of
              respectability. We will talk to the T.V. if our clients want
              it, but not to the press."

Q.    (iii)   David Alexander of Sefton wondered how clients would get on
              at the Inquests if the Inquests were managed in an adversarial
              fashion and those clients were represented by solicitors who
              were outside the umbrella of the Steering Committee.

A.            "The Steering Committee would like to think that those
              solicitors who had the best interests of their client at least
              would come under the Steering Committee umbrella, but if a
              particular solicitor did not want to be represented under the
              Steering Committee then Dr Popper would be informed of this;"

              David Wilkins replied "One family at the Zeebrugge inquest
              was represented by a very eminent Q.C. outside the bloc
              representation. He did a lot to probe into the area of
              corporate responsibility. A solicitor working on his own
              can do some good work."

Q.    (iv)    Anne Harvey of Sefton commented that in relation to files
              held by the West Midlands Police on the 95 deceased, social
              workers had already had access to these files and been able
              to pass on relevant information to the families.

A.            "I know that social workers have seen the files, but lawyers
              haven't. With respect it's not the same as a lawyer seeing it
              and explaining the legal implications. The main thing is that
              families are entitled to the information and should get it."

Q.    (v)     Phil Hynes of Warrington asked if it was still possible for
              people to make claims to the Trust Fund.

A.            "The Steering Committee can only deal with those people who
              come forward. People should be encouraged to come forward.
              People see the Trust Fund for people who were bereaved or
              seriously injured and would rather claim against Insurers.
              The Trustees decide who gets paid, not lawyers."

THE PROVISION OF THE DECEASED'S PERSONAL DETAILS TO THE BEREAVED

Sophie Tarassenko - Chairman, Kings Cross Action Group

Aileen Walker-Smith - Team Leader, Kings Cross Support Group


Following a disaster, a significant number of bereaved want, need,
detailed information concerning - in the words of one of the bereaved
following King's Cross - "exactly what happened to the person they
loved: how, where, how quickly they died."

Following King's Cross this was done in private consultations with^
Public Inquiry lawyers representing victims. These took place during
the Inquest.

Following Clapham Junction this was done by Individual Inquest for each
family.

This information, and the manner of its transmission, can be of very
great importance in the process of coming to terms with grief. The
following points have emerged.

1.       It must be remembered that not every bereaved wants this
          information, but every bereaved person should be offered it
          without having to request it. Naturally, if the bereaved
          person does not want the information it does not have to be
          given.

2.       The- information when given should be both full and frank
          and not edited (much less distorted) with kindly intent to
          be less hurtful to the feelings of the bereaved.

3.       Timing is important. Experience indicates that the need to
          know arises after months rather than weeks (with one exception,
          see para. 4 below). It is often prompted by the media coverage
          of the public inquiry. In some cases, the need to know arises
          after a year or more has elapsed. Therefore, the bereaved
          should be told both that they can have access to the information
          at an Individual Inquest (see para. 5 below) and that a proper
          documentary record of that Inquest will be available to them.

4.       The exception is seeing the body. Whereas the great majority
          will not be strong enough to want or need the detailed information
          with which we are here concerned for at least several weeks it
          appears that the strongest member of a family has often wanted
          to see the body in the immediate aftermath. Out of a wish to
          avoid injury to feelings such a request has on occasions been
          discouraged or refused. This has sometimes given rise to long-
          lasting anger. Every deceased should be offered the opportunity
          to see the body without having to request it. This should be
          done with skilled support before, during and after the viewing.
          The bereaved should also be told that they can have access to
          any photographs taken of the body. Even where these offers are
          not taken up the fact of their having been made is important.

5.          Returning to the provision of detailed information, the best
             approach seems to be by individual Coroner's Inquests
             expressly focused on these details, held several months
             after the disaster, and where the bereaved are represented
             by one of the team representing the victims in the public
             inquiry if there is one.

6.          This approach leans heavily on the Clapham Junction experience,
            which appeared to work very well. Apart from ensuring that
             there is formal structure for addressing the question this
             approach has the following advantages

            (a)    it treats each deceased individually.

            (b)    where both Coroner and public inquiry lawyer are involved
                    it doubly ensures that all information will be brought
                    out.

            (c)    since the inquests will be consecutive, bereaved will be
                    brought together in a way which affords a natural
                    (rather than contrived) opportunity for sharing their
                    grief, which can, for some, be valuable.

            (d)    there is, or should be, transcripted record so that where
                    bereaved do not attend, given that the detailed information
                    will be elicited in just as exacting a way, there will be
                    a proper record in case they should one day feel the need
                    to know (see para. 3 above).

7.          Some further matters should be noted.

8.          Where there is no public inquiry, the bereaved should still have
             legal representation for the Inquest. Experience indicates a
            compelling case for a lawyer to be at their side to de-mystify
             the procedure and explain everything in layman's terms.

9.          It should be emphasised that the Individual Inquests would be
             limited to this purpose. In the usual case they would all then
             be adjourned to deal with the other statutory obligations of an
             Inquest in such form as the Coroner deems appropriate.

10.         At the Individual Inquest a room should be set aside for private
             consultation. Sometimes, this detailed information is best
             transmitted initially in private.

11.         If Recommendation 151 of the Fennel Report becomes law (the
             duplication involved in holding both a public inquiry and a
             coroner's inquest should be avoided), the Inquiry Inspector
             should hold Individual Inquiries.

Questions and Answers
- Aileen Walker-Smith and Sophie Tarasenko


 Bill Pemberton, a member of the H.F.S.G., asked whether or not
'the claims for liability were settled before the Inquest or
 afterwards.

Sophie Tarasenko replied that most of them were not settled
yet. Writs had not been issued before the Inquest and liability
had not been admitted to date (6 .1 0 .8 9 ).

Bill Pemberton then queried whether or not the Inquest result
would have any bearing on liability claims.

Sophie Tarasenko said that the Inquest result would only have
a bearing on Criminal proceedings, not civil liability.

Doug Fraser said that although in theory it doesn't, the
result of the Inquest does have a bearing on civil liability.

Tony Rothweir, social worker, Sefton, asked whether there were
any families at King's Cross who were not represented or did
not want to attend the Inquest.

Aileen Walker-Smith - Yes. Several families were not present
initially, because some members of families had tried to
dissuade those who wanted to attend the Inquest from doing so.
Not all families were represented initially, but by the second
day, all the families were represented because there was a lot
of anger about the way the families were being treated. Eventually,
one lawyer represented all the families.

David Wilkinson stressed the role of the caring profession,
which had to be to help people to do what they want to do.
This can be problematic because of conflict with other family
members. Social workers themselves will need strength and
support around the Inquest to support the families.

Julie Smith, Runcorn Social Services, asked whether families
had information about their relatives' death prior to the
Inquest.

Sophie Tarasenko - The King's Cross families had a death
certificate but had to wait ten months for this. They had
post mortem details indicating carbon monoxide levels prior
to the inquest, but no details of where their relative was
in the station and how long they may have survived for. At
King's Cross, this was important because where they were
affected how they died.

Bob Jones, Sefton, asked if the families do not want to attend
the Inquest, will it do them a disservice.

Doug fraser indicated it won't make any difference in legal
terms, but may in psychological terms.
                                        16




                Sophie Tarasenko recommended individual inquests with
                transcripts of the dialogue between the lawyer representing
                the family and the Coroner. Details of how, where, when
                their relative died are a necessity so that families can
                look at them if and when they are ready.

                David Wilkinson - At Zeebrugge, the individual lawyers got
                the transcripts to hold for families for the future. He
                indicated that it may be two years before a family might
                want to see the information and that it could be useful for
                social workers to have the information available to them
                for counselling purposes.

Q.   5.         Cynthia May, social worker, Alder Hey Unit, asked if the
                 individual time spent with the lawyers answered the questions
                 that the families wanted. '

A.              Sophie Tarasenko - Yes. With the Inquiry and Police reports,
                 it was possible to establish the whereabouts of people. The
                 lawyer showed them a map of where their relative was and also
                 showed them the fuller pathologist report, which answered
                 all their questions.

Q.   6.         Bill Pemberton asked whether the alcohol levels in blood were
                 taken into account.

A.              Sophie Tarasenko - No. The only blood levels measured were
                 carbon monoxide and cyanide and the general state of the body,
                 whether the person was fit and healthy, overweight or
                 whatever.

David Wilkinson - Area Manager, Swale Social Services

Involved in the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster at Zeebrugge


In the Herald of Free Enterprise disaster, 193 people died and there were
346 survivors. Potentially, every one of the survivors with relatives,
and bereaved relatives, could have attended the Inquest and been
represented. This could have an intimidating impact on 'carers' and as
much preparation as possible is important.

The Inquest was the first time the families came together again since
the tragedy as they were scattered around the country. The Inquiry
had had little impact on families, many of whom were still in a state of
shock. Therefore, the Inquest was their first opportunity to take in
what actually happened.

Preparing Families

It is very important to share as much information with families as early
as possible before the inquest. Some only heard the details of what
happened to. their loved ones for the first time in the Inquest. (This also
applies to survivors and their families). So, they need to have heard the
description of the body and the circumstances (e.g. where and when) of
death before they go to the Court. At Zeebrugge, a body's appearance had
been changed by chemicals in the water. The family had not known this and
the 'wrong' description they heard gave rise to false 'hope' and great
distress - an unforgivable mistake. Social workers therefore need to do
their homework on all the reports available - although you can never
eliminate all risks.

Survivors

Survivors will also be present at the Inquest in large numbers as
interested parties, or many may be called as witnesses. They and their
families must not be forgotten and considered to be the "lucky ones".
They too will need the offer of care and support.

The Inquest

Number of People

At Dover, in addition to the Coroner, his/her officers, and the jury,
there were lawyers for groups of families, individual families, survivors,
crew, company and Police. With all these groups and individuals and their
legal representatives, the Court fills up very easily. All of these are
potentially in need of some sort of support at some stage of the hearing.

The local Coroner's Court was inadequate, so the Inquest was held in
the ballroom of the Town Hall.

Scheduling of Individual Inquests

Families were told beforehand on which day they could expect to have their
individual inquest heard. There were problems however when (as can happen
in the case of a full-scale adversarial affair) arguments over points of
law arose causing adjournments for advice or rulings. If this happens, it
can mean delays of minutes, hours or days. There is no way of avoiding
                                    18




this and it does need to be anticipated by carere - what do you do when
families have travelled for their particular inquest and have to wait?

Needs of Families

Exhibits, such as models or drawings, can be valuable so that families
can identify precisely where their loved one died. At Dover, it was
important for carers to be with them as it was at this point that people
could put different pieces of stories together, perhaps for the first
time.

Some families may wish/need to sit through the complete hearing, which
at Dover lasted 3J weeks. Consideration needs to be given to how such
families may be provided for. Even families who are there throughout
will not hear and take in all of what is said, and may need to go back
over the information at a later date.- Social workers need to take this
into account.

Conflicting Needs

What lawyers need to do in order to establish blame, and what the families
need to hear can often be very   different. Ultimately, the end result may
come together, but the process  of gettingthere may involve conflicts of
needs.

Similarly, a very upsetting aspect of the inquest can be if bodies are
identified as numbers, e.g. during pathologists' evidence. This makes
things easier for the pathologists but it is extremely distressing for
relatives. Thought and attention need to be given to this before coming
to the hearing.

Some family members may be called to give evidence as well as to hear it,
which can be doubly difficult.Thought has to be given to   caring for
these people as witnesses and observers.

Private Rooms

In Dover, there was inadequate provision for rooms where people could
speak with their lawyers and carers in private or just take 'time out'
- protected from the public and press.   It is important for people to
have this. Families may also need a base in Sheffield, separate from the
hearing venue, where they can go.

The need for accommodation also has to be considered.

Role of Social Workers

David Wilkinson felt that the inquest was more difficult than the 'impact'
phase, with carers having to sit and listen, calmly and quietly, watching
what is happening in all quarters for long stretches of time. There was
therefore a need for adequate numbers of carers, but there has to be a
limit.

They always had present in Court three members of the Herald Assistance
Unit who were not connected with the individual family, as well as any
particular carer that a family may wish to have with them.
                                     19




In advance, they tried to establish what would be the role of the Herald
Assistance Unit during the Inquest. This included:

(i)       jo support families and individuals through the Inquest and
           afterwards.   (Families may not wish to leave immediately after
           the Inquest, but stay and talk to other families);  and to
         ' provide 'time out' facilities within or near Inquest setting.

          This involved negotiating with families and individual carers
          what support they required: This ranged from meeting people
          at the station and taking them to the Unit, to holding their
          hand and comforting them when giving or hearing evidence.^ It
          is about responding to what the individual needs - i n c l u di n g
          them not wanting you!  (But still being available just in case).

(ii)      xo respond to   requests of assistance form anyone in the Inquest
           setting.

           This means that social workers have conflicting roles working
           with bereaved families and survivors as well as with the
           'culprits' and 'villains'. In Dover, this particularly meant
           the crew (in Sheffield, it could mean Police, club employees,
           stewards, council emDloyees, etc.). Some of these may be
           facing charges. They will be under extreme pressure at the
           Inquest (Witnesses can refuse to answer questions which may
           incriminate them - in Dover, no-one refused to answer questions).
           They are people who made mistakes and who deserve care and
           support if they require it. A person needs to be allocated to
           this group.

           This can be hard for the vereaved relatives to understand, and
           carers may be subjected to their anger for helping the 'culprits'.

Other Participants

All witnesses should be offered support.

 Pathologists often appear blase and callous, but the one iri Dover was hurt
 by the experience and was changed as a result. Who cares for them.

 Who cares for the Coroner? They could not get near theirs in Dover, but
 he did write a lto about it and may have had some influence on others.
 (Although not ideal, the Zeebrugge inquest w a s rhandled sensitively).

 The jurors may require support after the Inquest.

 Press

 Another aspect of the social worker's role relates to the press. They will
 be there and will focus on the most distressed people. The job of the
 carers is to protect people when required. It is useful for local carers
 to know the building well - e.g. knowledge of rooms, corridors and exits,
 and making an ally of the janitor - in order to enable people to avoid
 the press as much as possible.
                                    20




 Visiting Ground

 David felt that many people will also want to visit the place where
 their loved ones died when they come for the Inquest. This may be
 difficult to organise, so that it is dealt with sympathetically, and
 have the press kept away. Negotiations would need to be made with the
 football club to discuss this.

 Caring for the carers

The Inquest will also be a very stressful experience for the carers.
Despite preparation they cannot predict what will happen, and will be
trying to support people they have never met in some cases, not knowing
how they will react or what   they will require of them.As has been said,
they nay be treated in a hostile manner when they try to help the 'villains'
Thought has to be given to caring for the carers.

Also, it is only natural that during the course of events there may be
some things which happen orare said which are funny.     Nobody can be
serious for weeks. This can   feel difficult and awkward in the circumstances,
but despite the pain around we are all human and have to laugh.

After the Inquest

Reports

Families should be able to have access to verbatim reports of the Inquest
hearing, al-though a family who does not wish to attend may want the social
worker to tell it to them in his/her own words. If a family is not in
attendance, the social worker needs to pay special attention to what is
being said, or make sure the lawyer knows that you want that information,
so that if at a later date the family ask you for it, you have it. This
service has to be made available for when the family feel they need it,
even if it means the social worker taking notes and storing them.

Jurors

In Dover, a de-briefing service for jurors was offered for after the
Inquest. The Coroner agreed to this and wrote to jurors but they did not
take it up.

         QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS - DAVID WILKINSON


Q.   .   Does the Inquest help the healing process?

A.       Getting the information is very important and can help some families
         move forward.

         Getting the death certificate, having identification positively proven,
         knowing how a person died, etc. are things that people may take away
         from an Inquest which may allow them to move on. For others, it is a
         resurrection of the feelings, particularly for survivors who have to
         re-live the events.

Q.       How'do you prepare people for the Inquest?

A.       In Dover, they were not in a good position to preparepeople.    They went
          into it cold - most had not previously been to an Inquest, or to a
          Training Day. They did not know what to expect, and in any case, it was
          not like an ordinary inquest - more 'theatrical' with large numbers of
          lawyers and press.

         When verdicts were given, the foreman of the jury had to readout 'Unlawful
         killing' 1 9 2 times, and three crew members had to listen to it -how do
         you prepare for that?

Q.       Number of workers in Court?

A.       This has to be gauged in accordance with what is reasonable for the
          families.  You must not swamp the Court with carers.

         In Dover, they had permission from        the Coroner to come and goas required.
         He would call on them if he felt a        witness needed assistance.

Q.       How did you liaise with other agencies?

A.       There weren't any other agencies as such. The largenumber of people
          scattered all over the country made it difficult to ensure that all had
          support agencies involved. For those people outside the immediate vicinity,
          it was very difficult as people forget very quickly and did-not understand
          the families' needs, leaving them extremely isolated.

         The Dover team visited 80% of the families 'away' from the area, used
         lawyers and contacted local branches of CRUSE and Social Services
         Departments.

Q.       (a)       Was there provision for accommodation for families wishing to
                    stay over?

         (b)       Is there a role for the clergy or medics at the Inquest?

A.       (a)       Families did wish to stay in Dover and Zeebrugge.       Whenever
                    this was needed Townsend Thoresen paid the bill.

         (b)       People should be allowed to have whatever support system they
                    require, so clergy should certainly be available for those who
                    wish to have them.

SUMMARY   AND R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S


These recommendations have been summarised from the text of the various
contributors to the day.

In the afternoon, the participants were divided into groups to look at
reactions to the day and to plan for the future. Their contribution is
also included in the following summary.


General Observations

1.        In all the build up of the Inquests, it is vital to remember
           that the most important people there are the families.

2.        The verdicts for the families are not just a formality to be
          gone through. The outcome for them will be important.

3.        It was thought important to note that Sheffield's feelings
           around the time of the Inquest may be quite different to
           those of Liverpool.

4.        The study day was useful as a way for people to meet; exchange
          views, ideas and information.

5.        A refresher study day to be held, once the date of the Inquests
           is known.

Social Workers

1.        Social workers need to help famililes be as informed and
           prepared as possible before the Inquest re circumstances of
          death and description of body. To do this, the social workers
          need to do their homework and be as well prepared as possible.

2.        Social workers could arrange locally to attend a Coroner's
          Court for a day to help them in their work with families.

3.        There may be conflicts within families about whether or not
           to attend the Inquest. The role of carers is to help people
           do what they want to do.

4.        Numbers of carers needs to be gauged carefully. Thereneed
          to be adequate numbers, but there has to be a limit - should
          not swamp the Court.

5.        Social workers should provide a rota cover for the Inquests.
           The role of the social worker at  the Inquest could  be
           discussed by all the authorities  who would provide  cover
           for this rota.

6 ..      The Inquest is not a place for counselling, but for support
           and clarification of what is going on.

7.        Social workers should negotiate their role/relationship with
          people, responding to what they want.
                                     23




8.         Survivors also need care and support. They are not the
           "lucky ones. "

9.         All those involved in the Inquests may need some support
            at some time. (Families, survivors, witnesses, jurors,
            Coroner, Sheffield Wednesday F.C. and council staff.)

10.        There would be a need to support the Police and other agencies
            during the Inquest. The question was raised as to whether the
            social work support for the various agencies should come from
            a different group of social workers than those working with
            the bereaved.

11.        Witnesses may be cross-examined very severely.   They will need
            support.

12.        Carers need to be supported and cared for during and after
            the Inquests, and need to prepare themselves for it.

13.        Sheffield Team should be kept informed of which social workers
            and families are likely to be attending the Inquest.

14.        Social workers from teams other than core teams often feel
            isolated and lacking in information. Could they be linked
            or adopted by core teams?

15.        Co-ordinators of core teams should take responsibility for
            disseminating information to isolated workers.

16.        As some teams may not be in existence at the time of the
            Inquests, it was considered necessary that managers needed to
            take this into account when closing teams, to ensure a
            continuation of a smooth flow of information and to help
            reduce administrative problems.

Families

1.         It was acknowledged that families need to be aware of what
            information is available to them and the importance of having
            access to this information before the Inquests. They should
            be offered the information without needing to request it.

2.         Post mortem reports are available from the Coroner.
            Families should be offered the opportunity to see these before
            the Inquest.

3.         West Midlands Police have files on each of the deceased.
            Social workers can contact the West Midlands Police for
            information contained in the files which can then be passed
            on to families.

4.         Information should not be edited or distorted in an attempt
            to protect the feelings of the bereaved.

5.         All bereaved should have legal representation and if possible
           someone to sit with them to de-mystify and explain the
           procedure.

6.          Families should make sure lawyers give them sufficient time
            before and during the Inquest. It is important for people
            to get to know their lawyer before the proceedings.

7.          There should be 95 separate inquests to give as much
            information as possible to bereaved families.

8   .       The Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre will not be big enough
            for the Inquests even if low profile.

9-          Whether or not the bereaved attend,a transcript record of
            the Inquest should be made and kept, so that information is
            not lost to the family and can be referred to at a later
            date.

10.         A schedule of individual inguests helps families. Carers
            need to try to be prepared for the delays in the schedule.

11      .   Families may wish to attend the whole Inquest.   They need to
            be catered for.

12      .   Provide a close-circuit T.V. for families or relatives if
            they feel unable to go into the Court itself.

13.         Telephones should be provided so that families can keep in
            touch with relatives to give information and receive support.

14.         It was stressed how necessary it would be for the deceased
            to be always referred to by name during the Inquest, and never
            by number.


15.         Accommodation may need to be provided for families who need
            or wish to stay in Sheffield.

16.         Private rooms should be provided for relatives to have
            'space' and privacy, and to be able to consult with lawyers.
            A separate room should also be provided for witnesses for
            the same reason.

17.         Families may also need a base, separate from the Inquests.

18.         Bereaved families may wish to visit the ground at the time
            of the Inquest. Negotiations need to be made in advance.

19.         People should be allowed the support they want, e.g. clergy,
            social workers, relatives, friends, etc.
20      .   Families will be assisted by the Coroner being prepared to
            listen to them, and direct information to them as well as to
            lawyers.

Press

1.          Press be excluded from the Coroner's Court itself - maybe
            watch the proceedings via closed-circuit T.V.
                                   25



            The families should be protected from the Press.

            Social workers to be given advice/training on dealing with
            the press and the media. It helps for them to know the
            building and the area.

            At the Kings Cross Inquest, the families got together and
            nominated a group of four to represent them with the press.
            These gave prepared statements to the press while the rest
            left by a back door.       •                '

    Fence G ates

    I refer to your letter dated 21 September 1989 under the above heading and
    acknowledge that the discussion which took place between the police and the
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club is clearly a matter for the Advisory Group.
                                                                                   lA«\
    That was always the intention as you will see from the copy letter - attached^     >v ' <
    - sent by Chief Superintendent Nesbit, F Division, to Eastwood and Partners.  'C o F W . )

    The discussions previously referred to were held with the best of intentions
    with the purpose of establishing some common ground before the matter was
    referred to the Advisory Group.  I am conscious of your wish for all matters
    involving the safety in sports grounds to be subject of consideration by the
    Advisory Group so that such matters can be referred to Members of the Council,
    and will bring those matters pertinent to that wish to your attention.

    Yours faithfully

SAFETY OF SPCRTS (SOUNDS ACT 1975
PITCH PERIMTTER FENCE GATES

1 acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 15 September 1989 and can
confirm that following mootings slth my senior officers we are agreed
that there is no requirement tc retain the perimeter gates at the
Hillsborough Stadium.  However, li>ce yourself, being unaware of what Part
2 of Lord Justice Taylor's Report may reconroend, I would suggest that
provisions are retained for gates to be fitted at some future time.

The present gates at the Hillsborough Stadium are too narrow and totally
inadequate, and by only opening through an angle of 90° give restricted
access both onto and from the terraced areas. Therefore, your proposal to
increase the width between the securing frames is, in my opinion,
essential in the interests of punlic safety.

In conclusion, as you will appreciate, the final decision regarding any
rocomnonded alterations to the perimeter gates will have to be considerd
and approved by the Advisory Group Ixj fore they are implemented.

Yours sincerely

     Dear Sir

     Safety of Sports Grounds - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club - Pitch Perimeter
     Fence Gates

     I refer to your letter dated 21 September 1989 under the above heading and
     acknowledge that the discussion which took place between the police and the
     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club is clearly a matter for the Advisory Group.
     That was always the intention as you will see from the copy letter - attached
     - sent by Chief Superintendent Nesbit, F Division, to Eastwood and Partners.

     The discussions previously referred to were held with the best of intentions
     with the purpose of establishing some common ground before the matter was
     referred to the Advisory Group.  I am conscious of your wish for all matters
     Involving the safety in sports grounds to be subject of consideration by the
     Advisory Group so that such matters can be referred to Members of the Council^
     and will bring those matters pertinent to that wish to your attention.

     Yours faithfully

                          1                             ,

For the attention of Mr. A. Page
                                                                                                               \U

Dear Mr. Page,
                                        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                                  Access Between North Stand and Spion Kop
              We have now studied your letter of 11 September and are sorry
to see that it is in such uncompromising terms. First, I should
perhaps begin by saying that there was clearly a misunderstanding
 in your office regarding the dismantling of the access ramp.                                                                                                  A
statement was made to the Press that this had been at the request
of the consulting engineers to the Club.                                                                        That was completely inaccurate
We agreed to the ramp being taken down because that could be done
 in a few hours whereas the design of new gates, their approval by the
working party, and their subsequent manufacture and erection would
clearly take several weeks.                                                             There was an insistence on the part of
your staff that they wished to have the ramp down before the first
 game of the season.                                     In the circumstances we considered it reasonable
 to agree as a temporary measure until access for ambulances could
 be sorted out.
      In the third paragraph of your letter you refer to our proposal
 to reconstruct the concrete landing at the end of the ramp in a
 different form. The original concrete landing at the base of the ramp
 was feathered out both along the access route and to the side.                                                                                                       As

 a result one of your ambulances coming in to the ground was
 tilted sideways when its wheels ran up onto the concrete.         In
 consequence it rubbed the gate post.     In reconstructing the
 landing to the ramp, the existing ramp handrail will be lengthened
 so that the concrete landing strip only needs to be feathered in
 one direction.     The gate width is being increased by 900mm, which
 means that there will be approximately 3ft. more space than there
 was on the day of the disaster and in addition, the mound of
 concrete which tilted the ambulance sideways will have been
 removed.   It seems to me that this is a perfectly reasonable
 proposal in the circumstances.     I am sure that your drivers are
 sufficiently skilled to manoeuvre through such an opening, driving
 slowly and carefully if necessary.     There may well be many
  spectators leaving the ground in an emergency on the northern
  side of the gates.    That is unfortunately inevitable so your
 ambulances will have to slow down, but there is unlikely to be
 very many people in the area between the North stand and the
 disabled toilets.     There were, of course, a number of people in
  that area on 15 April mainly because they had been carrying
 casualties across the pitch.      That will be unnecessary if
  ambulances have access but even if there were spectators, the use
  of the siren and reasonable care will mean that the ambulances can
  easily go through the 2810mm wide space which we are now providing.
  I do not believe that there will be more than a second or two of
  delay even if there are people standing round, and that delay
  will be small compared with the delays which will occur when the
  ambulances cross the main exit routes from the ground on to
  Penistone Road.
       I understand from John Strange that with the corner of the
  ramp marked out on the ground there was no difficulty whatever
  in swinging an ambulance round on to the pitch. If there is doubt
  about this I suggest that members of the advisory group should have
  a demonstration at the ground with an    ambulance so that they can
  form their own opinions before they next meet.    We will be pleased
  to be represented.

      Your final point about the possible use of a lift for
 the disabled does not take account of the need to evacuate the
 disabled quickly in the event of an emergency.     When using a
 ramp the 30 or so wheelchairs plus 'helpers' can proceed at a
 walking pace and be down the ramp in a short time.     If they had
 to queue to be placed on the lift, wait for it to descend, be
 offloaded, and then wait for it to rise again before the next
 person could be dealt with, the process would be far too slow.
 This was explained to Mr. Morley when he met John Strange on site.
      We are new submitting our proposals for consideration by the
 working party so as to avoid further delay.

            Thank you for your letter dated 21 September about the pitch
perimeter fence gates and also your letter dated 22 September,
enclosing the copy letter to South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance
Service.
            In conversing and writing to individual members of the Advisory
Group, we fully appreciate that the discussions and correspondence
with members of the Advisory Group are not in any way binding on the
City Council.                      The purpose is to try to avoid abortive work and also
to speed up the progress of our various submissions on behalf of the
Club.           With this background I trust you will understand that we
are not in any way intending to embarrass the City Council, but to
make their job easier when they have to rule on our various proposals.


                                                                                                       Yours sincerely,

    *NOTE
    Special post-mortem examinations
    The Home Secretary understands that some post-mortem examinations, which form a
    very small proportion of the total ordered by coroners, require special skills,
    additional work, and responsibility beyond that expected in a normal or
    "routine" case.  The cases requiring a post-mortem examination of this type are
    usually those involving suspected homicide, road or other accidents likely to
    lead to serious criminal charges, deaths during anaesthesia and deaths
    involving, or likely to involve, allegations against the meaicax profession or
    another third party.  Among the criteria that distinguish this type Oi.
    examination from that in a "routine" case are:
             (i) the added responsibility carried by the    pathologist, for
             example in relation to possible criminal proceedings arising ^.rom
             his findings;
             (ii) the frequent requirement for the pathologist to travel long
             distances at any time of the day or night at short notice to make a
             preliminary examination of the body and to wait while photograpns
             are taken before the body can be removed to the mortuary for the
             autopsy; and
             (iii) the need for special tests involving liaison with, for
             example, bacteriologists.  As a consequence of the protraction
             of the investigation the pathologist may suffer a loss of otner work.

    It is, however, difficult to define cases by reference to criteria of this kind,
    and any attempt to list the typeof case likely   to require  a specialpost-mortem
    examination would be unlikely to   be comprehensive. TheHome Secretary therefore
    concluded that the decision whether a particular case is potentially one
    requiring a   special post-mortem examination must be a matter for thecoroner   s
    discretion.    (It should be noted that where they are applicable, these rates a^e
    payable without reference to any fee the pathologist may be entitled to receive
    from other sources for assistance given to the police.)

           STATEMENT TO BE FORWARDED TO THE ACTING HEAD OF SHEFFIELD
              CITY COUNCIL'S ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT


              With reference to your letter dated 23rd August, 1989,
         regarding the Hillsborough disaster,] this Hillsborough
         Working Party has been requested, on behalf of Liverpool
         City council, to respond to the concerns, registered in your
         letter, of Members of your Authority and those Members who
         also serve on the South Yorkshire Police Authority.

              From our own enquiries into the Hillsborough tragedy,
         and from a full reading of the transcripts from the
         Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry, we fully agree with
         Lord Justice Taylor's unequivocal contention (para 286 of
         his Interim Report). "The poor performance by the City
         Council of its duties in regard to the Safety Certificate
         was inefficient and dilatory. The failure to revise or
         amend the Certificate over the period of three years
         preceding this disaster, despite important changes in the
         layout of the ground, was a serious breach of duty.' There
         was, as a result, no fixed capacities for the pens. The
         Certificate took no account of the 1981 and 1985 alterations
         to the ground."

              We contend that the comments of the Leader of this City
         Council are fully vindicated in respect of the 'poor
         performance' of your Authority in its duties and obligations
         to the Hillsborough Safety Certificate.

              Further to the issue of resignations, this Working
         Party, on behalf of the City Council, has continued, and
         will continue to call for the resignation of those officials
         within Sheffield City Council responsible for the
         Hillsborough Safety Certificate and the Chairman of the
         South Yorkshire Police Authority.

              Your Members concern at the comments of Mr. Norman Bush
         (Liverpool City Council's Chief Building Surveyor) is
         somewhat perplexing given the 'considerable offence' already
         caused to the families, relatives and friends of the
         bereaved and injured.

              Finally, your response to the Norman Bush article
         has added insult to an enormous injury and which we hope you
         will forgive us saying perhaps demonstrates a lack of
         sensitivity to the feelings of Merseyside people.  The fact
         is that your Authority's administration of the Safety
         Certificate up to the 19th April 1989 showed a dereliction
         of duty and responsibility which proved to be Ma recipe for
         disaster."

                                             Hillsborough Working Pa’f-ty.

                       Dear Sir,

                        SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS - ANNUAL INSPECTION - OFFICERS REPORT

                       With reference to your letter of 17 August, I would confirm
                       that many of the conments made therein have been dealt with
                       as part of our normal maintenance progranme.

                        Work is continuing on those Items which have not as yet been
                        dealt with and a progranme of work drawn up.

                        We anticipate that the majority of the necessary work will be
                        completed prior to ournext home game on Saturday, 9 September,

                        Yours faithfully.

Dear S i r s

I was s u r p r is e d and r a t h e r saddened t o read t h e a r t i c l e by Mr Horraan
Bush i n t h e M u n icip al J o u r n a l on t h e 1 8 th August 198 9 .                In comment incr

d i s p l a y s t h e f a c t t h a t Mr Bush h a s s im p ly n o t read t h e C i t y C o u n c i l ' s
e v id e n c e .       The m is ta k e i n t e r m in o lo g y was n o t a m is ta k e made by t h i s
C o u n c il.

The I n t e r im R eport recommends, i n t e r n a l i a , t h a t l o c a l a u t h o r i t i e s
sh o u ld e n su r e that an accountable a d m i n i s t r a t i v e s t r u c t u r e e x i s t s ,
"whereby the f u n c t i o n s o f t h e l o c a l a u t h o r i t y a r e r e g u l a r l y and
effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and
decisions are properly taken in accordance w i t h the local authority's
rules*. The general proposal made by Mr Bush seem s direotly contrary
to that recommendation.     The dangers of delegating the functions
involved to one party must surely be obvious. The Fire Service, t h e
Police, the Ambulance Service and the Environmental Health Officers
all have a part to play in what Mr Bush describes as "the real technical
task*.

                                                                            Mr Webster -
                                                                            734018
The Environmental Health Officers of this Authority are certainly
not responsible for meat pies as Mr Bush somewhat facetiously remarks.
They, together with the Building Surveyor's Department, the Police
and the Fire and Ambulance services join forces to make up the advisory
group.    The  administration   of   the     system rested within the
Administration and Legal Department under the auspices of the Chief
Licensing Officer.   To say that officers were not accountable is
erroneous.

The   tragedy   of . Hillsborough  didreveal   shortcomings   in     the
administrative system operated in Sheffield.      The City Council, no
doubt like many other Councils, has taken fully into account the
recommendations made in the Interim        Report.   Alreadychanges have
been made and this Council intends to build upon and improve its
existing administrative arrangements. Safety Management is, we believe,
a multi-disciplinary matter and no one profession has all the necessary
expertise. The Building Surveyor will continue to be one of several
experts whose views are taken into account but I would suggest that
the Council must use all the skills        available to it rather than
attempting the kind of delegation suggested by Mr Bush. I sincerely
hope that other authorities will exercise caution before considering
the adoption of the procedure suggested by Mr Bush. They are a recipe
for disaster.

Yours faithfully

    Re:   Annual Inspection - Officers Comments

    I am in receipt of your letter dated 17th August 1989.

    As you will appreciate the schedule provided is comprehensive and requires

    We have met the Fire Service and have arranged site meetings with the Local

    Once these meetings have taken place we will be in a position to report,
    hopefully within the next seven days.

     Certainly from the point of view of the victims’ relatives, the legal
process has been unsatisfactory in providing information on what really
happened and why the victims died. The insurance company acting on behalf of
South Yorkshire Police have paid out compensation to the bereaved and injured.
A contribution to that compensation has been made by Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club and Eastwood and Partners in an out of court settlement.

     Subsequently civil proceedings have been brought for damages for nervous
shock by relatives and friends who were at the ground or watching events on
television. In the first instance parents,spouses,brothers and sisters who
were eye-witnesses to the disaster or saw it live on television were held to
be entitled to sue for nervous shock. On appeal and cross-appeal,the relatives
and friends who had failed in the first instance lost their appeal. In
addition the relatives who succeeded in the first instance lost on appeal. It
was held that those who had watched the disaster live on television failed to
satisfy the test of proximity in time and space and the one person who had
been present at the ground was not a parent or a spouse but a brother and
there was no evidence of the closeness of the tie between him and his
brothers.

The m atch           was       being       telev ised ,             and        the     cam eras            kept     tu rn in g .                The

horror         of    the       d isaster           was     beamed          in to       p e o p le 's        liv in g         rooms* a n d

The     d isaster          could          not      have       been      m ore         p u b lic,     m ore         im m ediate           and

I was at home that afternoon,               p o t t e r i n g about in the garden.         My

Principal Press Officer was also at home,                    having just driven his

family back from lunch in the country.                    By 6.30 we were in the

Town Hall,      at the eme r g e n c y c o o r d i n a t i n g centre we ha d set up in

my office and the a d j oining one - c o m m a n d e e r e d from the Lor d

Mayor - acting as a c l e a r i n g house for i n f o r m a t i o n and offers             of

help,    deal i n g w i t h m e d i a enquiries,    and b e g i n n i n g to make

arrangements       for the launch of an appeal fund.



What h a p p e n e d was,   in two ways,      a b s o l u t e l y typical of disaster.

First,    there was no warning,           no b u i l d - u p — the H i l l s borough

disaster just happened,             all of a sudden.         Second,     many di f f e r e n t

groups of people and o r g a n i s a t i o n s were rapi d l y affected and

drawn into the disaster:             Sheffield Wednesday F C ;            w hose g r o u n d

was chosen as venue for the match;                  Liv e r p o o l FC whose    supporters

When      a    c risis          or        d isaster          happens,                the     natu ral           question           is     whose

Thank you for your letter of 6 May about additional financial
support for direct service provision and for the Regional unit you
propose to establish to provide and co-ordinate continuing care"in -
the aftermath of the Hillsborough-tragedy.    You also wrote to_
J<?hn Moore, Secretary of .state for Social Security and to
Nicholas Ridley Secretary of State for the*. Environment. Please .
accept this as a reply to all three letters.

The Department's Social Services Inspectorate have kept me informed
of the action taken by the local social services departments
together in the wake of the tragedy and I know that the Chief
Inspector has written personally to all the Social Services
Directors in appreciation of the remarkable efforts made by them and
their, staff.                              *

The precise-response to a tra^e^y of this sort needs to be decided
on the spot, on the basis of a careful examination of needs. Ky
Department has no power to make additional resources available to
local authorities for this purpose. However/ I understand from
Nicholas Ridley/ Secretary of State for Environment, that under a
model scheme designed to deal with extra-ordinary costs arising frorr.
emergencies (the Bellwin Scheme), the Government has provided
special financial assistance to local authorities in certain
circumstances.

The Bellwin Scheme was drawn up after discussions with the Local
Authority Associations and provide for assistance cowards the .
immediate and additional costs of dealing with an emergency once
expenditure exceeds a threshold beyond which local authorities would
normally be expected to budget for.  in the case of the last use of
the Scheme, following the Great Storm of 1987, that threshold was
(for Counties and Metropolitan Districts) set at the exclusive
product of a l.Op rats.

If you consider that you have a case for assistance of this kind,
Nicholas fiidley is prepared to consider a detailed ana Cully costed
application (though at first sight it looks as if the level of
expenditure needed would be substantially below the likely threshold
for- the authorities involved).  I know that he will keep me informed
of events if you do decide to pursue this possibility.

the Government has, of course, as you mention, already made a
contribution o£ £500,000 to the Disaster Fund to help those most
closely affected by the Disaster

Dear Sir,

Re:       Safety Certificate - Hillsborough

I am in receipt of your letter dated 11th August 1989.

With regard to the items in Appendix 2 where a responsehas                             been requested:

No. 3)          A copy of a report from Mayor TUrnstiles is enclosed. A replacement
                for TUrnstile 50 which is situated at PenistoneRoad is on order.

No. 4)           A copy of the                     Agreement is enclosed.

No. 7)           A copy of the                     necessary letter from Dr. Eastwood is      enclosed.

No. 8)          Amendments to the signposting of the ground andthe printing of the
                tickets have been undertaken to the satisfaction of the South
                Yorkshire Police and Fire Service.

I would point out the amended ground capacity figures are, in fact, incorrect.
The area of the Lower North West Terrace is in fact Pen 6, part of the West
Terrace which is excluded from use (Appendix 2 No. 10) The capacity for the
North West Terrace should therefore be 2,300.

Finally, I would refer to the penultimate paragraph of myletter dated 28th July
1989 to your Administration and Legal Department. Last week"the Working Party
approved the Police request that access to the North Stand should be via
Penistone Road using turnstiles 77-88. Our concern over this policy was
confirmed in the findings of the Interim Report (Para 290). I would therefore
confirm my request for a written ruling on this matter prior to Saturday's match.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                                                                  Hillsborough Stadium
                              Amendment of General Safety Certificate
              I understand that under Appendix 2, item 7, which contains
additional conditions to the Safety Certificate, there are
requirements under sub—paragraphs (a) and (b) regarding
inspection of crush barriers and a review of the layout.
I am pleased to report to you as follows


Condition 7 (a)
            Following Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations, Mr. John
Strange immediately carried out a visual inspection of all crush
barriers for signs of corrosion.                                                                 Indeed, the inspection was
much more thorough than required by Lord Justice Taylor's
report because it included scraping with a sharp instrument
immediately inside the ends of tubes so as to better reveal the
true extent of corrosion. As a result of Mr. Strange's inspection
I am able to report that none of the barriers was found to be
sufficiently affected by corrosion for it to be necessary for
it to be repaired or replaced by 16 August, 1989.

  Condition 7 (b)
       The layout of all barriers in the ground has been
  reviewed.   As you will know, variations from the Green
  Guide were reported and were accepted at the time when the
  original Safety Certificate was issued in 1979.   Since then,
  various other modifications have been requested by South
 Yorkshire County Council or Sheffield City Council.        There are
  further departures from the criteria contained in chapter 9
  of the Green Guide.   We are currently preparing scheme
 drawings for re-arrangement of the various barriers so as
  to satisfy the guidelines.   When tenders are invited for the
 necessary works, we will also include such alterations or
        NU

 strengthening as may be necessary to cure incipient corrosion
 or other defects.
       As soon as the scheme drawings and specification are
 complete, we shall, of course, be submitting them on your
 behalf to the Sheffield City Council as licensing authority
 for their approval.


                                 Yours sincerely,

                 Dear^Sir,

                 Safety of Sports Ground

                 The Hillsbrough Inquiry - Interim                   Report Recommendation

                 onr m f Hn , yhUr 1®'!sr ?ate? 3 Au8u s t ' 1 sst out below our concents
                 on the Hillsbrough Inquiry Interim Recommendations:-

                 1.   Terraces at Bramall Lane Stadium are divided into the following
                      areas;- Bramall Lane Terrace, John Street Terrace (East)
                      Joh" Street Terrace (West) and Spian Kop.      hum*   areas are
                      not divided into pens and already have their own capacities.
                2,     {a) Eastwood and Partners arB currently assessing maximum
                           capacity figures in accordance with the recoirmendations.

                       (b) Assuming that the current maximum capacities fall within
                           the guidelines specified in the Green Guide, the respective
                           15% reductions in capacity would be as follows:-

                                                        E xlsting Capacity             Revised C apacity

                3.
                      (a) The number of spectators entering each terrace area above
                             already controlled by a computerised counting system.

    (b) When the number of spectators admitted to any of the terrace
        areas reaches within 10% of the capacity figure the computer
        monitor operator will inform Police Control who will take
        the appropriate action to close down the necessary turnstiles


4. Sheffield United Football Club accepts that it is responsible
    for the filling of self-contained pens and terraced areas.
   The monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid
   overcrowding will be undertaken by stewards employed by the
   Club.

   A written agreement between the Club and the Police is currently
   being prepared.

5. Sheffield United Football Club will provide an adequate number
   of stewards to be solely responsible for monitoring the crowd
    for overcrowding or distress from the perimeter track. Police
   Officers will also be deployed on the perimeter track to comply
   with the requirement of Reconmendation 9.     Such officers will
   be in possession of a police radio and will use this to corrmunicate
   with the police control room, any matter brought to their
   attention by the perimeter track stewards.

   The perimeter track stewards will be clearly identifiable
   by the wearing of bibs of a different colour to that of the
   normal s.tswards.

7. As you are aware the gates in the perimeter fences have been
   removed.   We are, however, painting the frame of the gate
    in a different colour to the perimter fence and erecting
   Emergency Exit signs above every such gats.

8. As referred to above, all gates to the pitch have been removed.

9. South Yorkshire Police will provide officers as required and
   ensure that their identities are known to the stewards and
    other officers in the vicinity. ThBse officers will in possession
    of radios.

Hi. Sheffield United Football Club will provide sufficient cutting
    gear as required.     We would welcome advice on what can be
    considered suitable cutting equipment.       At present we are
    considering the use of Bolt Croppers which could be stored
    in our Groundsman's office in the corner of the New South
    Stand/Bramall Lane and easily accessible.     We would suggest
    our' three groundsmen and maintenance engineer would be suitable
    to use this equipment but would welcome any other suggestions.

11, All barriers have been visually inspected by Eastwood & Partners
    and we are awaiting their report.
19        tivpwIap   Eastwood 6 Partners are reviewing the layout of
          barriers’to ensure that it complies with the criteria contained
          in a chapter of the Green Guide.

1q        An  indpnendent Turnstile Servicing Company, Mayor Turnstiles
          Ts inspec ting our turns tiles early next week and will measure
          the potential rate of flow. Regular inspections will be organised
          thereafter.

19        Once the potential flow rate has been measured we will tie able
          to accurately assess whether all spectators intended to be admitted
          to a particular viewing area can pass through the Turnstiles
          serving that area within one hour.    If this cannot be achieved
          in any particular area the capacity will he reduced accordingly.

20        As already indicated in 3(b) arrangements have been mads'with
           the Police to close down turnstiles when the number of bpectato
          admitted tothat particular area approaches the capacity.

 22, Signposting      outside and inside the ground is currently being
      reviewed and will comply with the requirements of this
      rec oirmenda tion.

 23. We believe that the information currently printed on our match
     tickets complies with this recommendation.

 34. We do not. at present, request supporters through information
     on tickets, to take their places by a specified time.     The
     police agree that it would be unwise to do this.

     39    Arrangements have been made with the St. John's Ambulance
           Brigads to ensure that at least one trained first aider per
           1000 spectators is in attendance.

     41. Sheffield United Football Club already employ a m e d i c a l practitioner
         to be present at each match.     In addition, we actually have
         at least one, and sometimes, two other medical practitioners
         in attendance. We note the requirement to arrive at least
         one hour before the appointed kick off time and remain until
         at least half an hour after the end of the game.     His whereabouts
         will be made known to those in the police room.

     42. Arrangements have been made with the South Yorkshire Me^opolitan
         Ambulance service to provide the necessary ambulance
         in addition to that already provided by St. John s Ambulance.

     Numbers and Duties of Stewards

     We anticipate that the number of stewards used at Bramall Lane
     will be approximately 80.  These will be used for the following
     duties:-

               1.. Manning of each exit.

               2.: Control and direction of spectators entering and leaving
                   the stadium.
    3.   Sector  Stewards who will patrol t h e Stadium and deal with
         any emergency including raising alarm and extinguishing
         any fire.

    4.   Perimeter track stewards to monitor the crowd for overcrov/ding
         or distress.

    5.   Manning of internal gates which constitute part        of   the
         means to escape from the ground.


We are currently preparing Steward Deployment Sheets which will
specify each area of the ground to be covered by a steward. Each
area will correspond to a numbered stewards bib to identify easily
whether or not that steward's duties are being performed correctly.

Copies of these deployment sheets will be forwarded to you early
next week.

If you require       any   further   information please do not hesitate
to contact me.

Yours sincerely.

      The Hillsborough Task Team has been established to offer professional services
      to those involved with the Hillsborough disaster and inquiry. Staff in several
      council departments were directly and indirectly involved in the* subsequent
      inquiry. It is generally recognised that professional staff connected with
      such events need to be given the opportunity to describe the tasks they undertook
      and share their experience.

     Emergency services workers have already had such de-briefing sessions. Undertaking
     this process within one's own department can be difficult, so it has been agreed

  Dear Mr. Webster,

  Re:       Safety Certificate

 At a meeting I had with the South Yorkshire Police earlier this week it was
 noticed that the wording of the Emergency Evacuation Procedure in the Safety
 Certificate is different to that which is in effective use.

 The revised wording was drawn up by the South Yorkshire Police and South
 Yorkshire Fire Service, and I understand is in use at all five South Yorkshire
 Football League Clubs.

  I have no record of whether the Local Authority have ever been notified and
  therefore I enclose a copy in order for you to amend your records.

 Yours sincerely,

EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE

All Match Day Staff must be aware of the following procedure:

In the event of an emergency situation arising in the ground (ie. fire or bomb
call) which require evacuation of all or part of the ground, the following
procedure will be followed:-

    a) Police Control Roan will pass the following message "The attendance of
    Mr. Meadows is urgently required at Police Control". This will be over
    the P.A. System and will indicate to Police Officers and Stewards that
    emergency evacuation procedures are in force. Stewards will take up
    positions at their exits and gates, and the gates will be opened.

   b) In the event of an emergency evacuation being necessary, an oral
   message will be passed by the Police Officer in charge giving specific
   instructions as to action to be taken by the public.

    c) In the event of an all clear situation the following message will be
    passed "Mr. Meadows is no longer required at police control".

Be on the alert to recognise potential fire hazards and suspect packages.
Such findings to be reported to the nearest Police Officer or in his absence
the Chief Steward or designated Club Official.

paragraph 19 would seem to r e l a t e only to th o se grounds where

be aware, t h i s s i t u a t i o n does not e x i s t a t BramSll Lane and I

5®     ^ o w' the Inquiry            has now completed its oral hearings in
Sheffield.   I am writing            on Lord Justice Taylor's behalf to
express his appreciation             to you and your colleagues for so kindly
placing the Town Hall at             his disposal for the oral hearings.

    excellent arrangements made to accommodate the Inquiry team
and the wholehearted commitment and support of Town Hall staff
over recent weeks, who responded to the demands imposed on them
with unfailing patience, versatility and humour, have been of
immense assistance. As you know, Lord Justice Taylor and his
Assessors personally thanked many of the staff concerned at a
short gathering in the Mandela Room towards the end of the
hearings.  Lord Justice Taylor has asked that Mr O'Neill, in
particular, be thanked for his invaluable help and practical
a«.Ql ef a n n a                                                        c

I should be grateful if you would pass on Lord Justice Taylor's
thanks to all concerned.

Dear Mr Richman,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS

I thank you for your letter of 20 June on the above topic which I have now had the
opportunity of discussing with the relevant members of the Council's staff dealing with
this topic.

As a result of such discussion I can now point out, that so far as the letter of the 5 June
is concerned it was felt that any changes in the Council's policies in relation to the
safety of sports grounds would be notified to you directly either by the Council's staff
or the Police.

The reasoning behind such a reponse was that, as I am sure you will appreciate, much
of the safety of sports grounds system is unlikely to affect the Magistrates Court relating
as it does to the structure of buildings, spacing of crush barriers etc and that whilst
responsible officers will endeavour to-inform you of any matters which occur to them
as affecting the Court's role, it is anticipated that the Chief Constable (who has a very
significant input through his officers to the safety of sports grounds) would be the person
best placed to advise you on any matters which may affect the Magistrates.

Accordingly, therefore, it may be appropriate for you to apprise him directly of your
interests in the topic.

Quite clearly the City Council is interested in close liaison and cooperation on all matters
of mutual interest and in this regard I would be grateful if you could let Mr Webster's
Chief Licensing Officer, Mr Bownes, have your thoughts on what areas you feel concern
the Magistrates in relation to the safety of sports grounds, such as for example, the
removal of perimeter fences.

I trust that I have answered the points you raise, but if you require any further
information or clarification then may I suggest that either your Assistant, Mr White,
rings Mr Bownes direct on Sheffield 734005, or alternatively that you ring Mark Webster
on the extension shown below.

Yours sincerely,




Chief Executive

   HILLSBOROUGH - ACTION TO BE TAKEN

  In light of the receipt of two recent communications, one by letter, and one by fax,
  from Mr Mackrell and Mr Jones respectively, I think it is appropriate for us now to
  consider how we are intending to deal with this stadia in terms of the new season.
                                                                                                              ■f
  In particular, I think it is necessary and appropriate for the meeting requested by Mr
  Mackrell to take place and I would welcome your comments and observations and in
  particular a draft reply to such letter in the near future.

  With regard to the letter from Mr Jones, I believe at the very least we should press
  for details of the problems apparently noted by the Health and Safety Executive as
  I believe it is unsatisfactory for someone to say that they have observed defective barriers
  without then offering to supply details of their observations.

  In summary, therefore, it seems to m e that prior to that portion of the ground re-opening
  for public use and indeed the ground itself re-opening there is a great deal of work and
  effort to be put in and if this requires additional resources to be allocated then the
  sooner we discuss this the better.

Thank you for your letter of 16 January about Sheffield City
Council's letter of 6 January concerning the proposed national
membership scheme for football supporters.  I am sorry not to
have replied sooner.

It may be helpful if I first explain the background to the
national membership scheme. Following the. disturbances involving
England supporters at the European Football Championships, and
the many serious incidents during the 1987/88 domestic season,
which saw the unacceptable high level of over 6,000 arrests at
Football League matches, the Prime Minister met the football
authorities on 6 July to discuss further measures to tackle
hooliganism associated with football. The football authorities
were invited to introduce a national memh ership scheme on a
voluntary basis but they refused. Accordingly we announced that
proposals for legislation to give statutory backing to such a
scheme would be brought forward, as part of the Government's
package of measures to tackle football hooliganism.

I invited the National Federation of Football Supporters Clubs
and the Football Supporters Association to submit written
comments to the working party I chaired which reviewed the
principles   of  the   national   membership scheme.    I  met
representatives of both organisations on 6 December to discuss
the scheme and I am ready to have further meetings as the Bill
goes through its parliamentary stages.

The Football Spectators Bill was introduced into the House of
Lords on 16 January.    The Bill's purpose is to deal with the
problems of hooliganism associated with football.    It proposes
that everyone who attends a designated football match in England
and Wales should be a member of the scheme, or otherwise
authorised by the scheme, and that designated matches should be
played only on licensed football grounds. A member would be able
to go to any designated match. Those who are convicted of a
relevant offence will be disqualified from membership of the
scheme and the scheme itself will allow for the Football
Membership Authority to ban others who misbehave at football
matches.     The Bill also gives the courts p o w ers to impose
restriction orders on convicted hooligans to prevent them
■travelling to specified matches abroad.
The Bill does not prescribe the contents of the membership
scheme. Rather, it provides for the Secretary of State for the
Environment to appoint a body, to be known as the_ Football
Membership Authority (FMA), to draw up the scheme in detail and
submit it to the Secretary of State for approval.   The Football
Association and Football League have decided that they wxll work
together in the establishment of a joint body to be recommended
to the Secretary of State for designation as the FMA and I
welcome their decision.
To help answer the many questions put to us about the scheme we
have produced the enclosed question and answer briefing paper
which you mtiy like to forward to the Chief Executive.  You will
note that the particular points raised by the City Council are
covered on pages 3 (costs of the scheme), 4 (attendances), 7
(problems   inside and outside the grounds)      and 11    (civil
liberties).
I welcome the measures which the clubs and the police have taken
to deter football violence. But their effect has been to contain
the problem not to cure it.        The Government accepts that
hooliganism is not a problem confined to football but all too
often the game provides a focus for trouble both at home and
abroad.  The activities of the hooligan continue to tarnish the
image of the game and physically endanger law-abiding people.
Introduction of the membership scheme will provide, for the first
time, an effective and comprehensive procedure to keep hooligans
away from football matches.  I am confident that it will lead o
the link between violence and football being broken and that
going to a football match will become a far more enjoyable
occasion than it has been for many years.

       (2 ) it provides the courts with power to impose
            restriction orders on convicted hooligans to prevent
            them travelling to key matches abroad.


What are the aims of the Bill?

•   Taken with the package of anti-hooligan measures in place since
the 1987 February Agreement, the Bill will provide the means to
break the link between football and hooliganism.       Football will
cease to be a focus for violence. For the first time there will be
an effective way to keep the troublemaker out of football matches at
home and to prevent the convicted hooligan from travelling to
matches abroad.


Kow will the hooligan be kept out of matches?

•   Spectators would only be able to attend designated matches if
they have a valid membership card which can be checked at the
turnstile    or are specifically made exempt under the scheme.
Troublemakers, inside and outside the ground, would be banned from
membership.



But why legislate to introduce a membership scheme?

•   We hoped that the football authorities would bring in a scheme on
a voluntary basis.    Unfortunately they have said that the clubs
would not agree to this.


Why is the Bill being introduced in the House of Lords?

•   Nothing unusual in this.   To ensure Parliamentary business is
dealt with effectively and efficiently the timetable requires a
number of Bills to be introduced in the House of Lords.


Department of the Environment                                      1
Why doesn’t the Bill spell out the details of the scheme?

• The Football Membership Authority will be responsible for running
the scheme    It should be for them to produce a workable ana
effective scheme.   The Government is prepared to be flexible on
matters of detail provided that the scheme meets the legislative
requirements.

What sort of bans will there be - and how long?
• Mandatory bans are proposed for anyone convicted of a football
related offence.  These bans would be for 5 years in the case where
the penalty is a custodial sentence and 2 years in other cases.

   The Bill also proposes that the scheme should provide for the FMA
to be able to impose discretionary bans of its own.       The period
would be determined under the scheme but it is likely that it would
be for a maximum of 2 years.

What if people defy a ban and try to go to a match?

#   Anyone attempting to do so would commit a criminal offence.


How will the courts know what a football related offence is?

• There is already a definition in the Public Order Act 1986. Most
cases will be straightforward.       There would be a degree of
interpretation involved for the courts within the framework set out
in the Bill.

Will those convicted of other criminal offences be banned?

•   The Bill applies to football related offences only.


What happens   if a club does not   install   a scheme or operate   it
properly?
• The Bill proposes that there should be a licensing authority.
A licence could be withdrawn from a club and this would mean
spectators would not be allowed into a match.


What if the FMA fails to run a scheme properly?
•   The Bill proposes that the Secretary of State should have the
power to terminate its contract and appoint another body to take on
the task.

Will the Bill apply to Scotland and Northern Ireland?

•   No.



2                                   Department of the Environment
•   As with UEFA, the Government agrees that English league and
international football faces a specifically grave problem.  The
measures are therefore directed at the 92 league clubs.



The Scheme
How will the details of the scheme be decided?

• It would be for the FMA to draw up the detailed scheme and submit
it to the Secretary of State for approval.


Which matches will be covered by the scheme?

• The Secretary of State will designate<the matches to be covered
by the Scheme by Order.    It is intended that all matches involving
clubs in the Football League should be designated.


Will the scheme apply to matches in which a League team plays a non-
League team?

•    It is intended that arrangements should be made so that
supporters of non-League clubs should not be required to produce
membership cards for these matches. , The licence arrangements will
apply-

Will I need to be a member to go to Wembley?

• We will be discussing this issue further with the FMA and the
Wembley authorities as the detailed scheme is worked up.


When is it proposed to introduce a scheme?

• Our target date for introduction is Spring 1990. The key issue in
settling the timetable is the need to install the right technology.

Who pays?

•   It has always been made clear that football should finance any
scheme.   There are considerable commercial opportunities in a
membership list cf millions.   A number of companies have already
offered to set up and run a scheme at no cost" to clubs or
supporters.

  Even without commercial development,    a leading company has said it
could put a scheme in place at a cost    to the member of about £3 per
annum.   This is less than some clubs    already charge their members;
for example, Tottenham Hotspur charges    £5.



Department of the Environment                                       3
     If the football authorities and the clubs take   a positive
approach to marketing, financinga scheme would not be a problem.
In addition, the Football Trust might be prepared to consider any
requests for assistance from the smaller clubs*


How will the casual supporters be     affected?
•   Joining   a scheme will be a simple process.     It would mean
completing a single form with a few personal details and providing
two photographs.   It is hoped that supporters will appreciate this
is a very minor inconvenience in the context of ridding the game of
hooliganism.
   The Government would like to see a means of allowing a casual
supporter to obtain a membership card on the morning of the match,
provided that this would not threaten the integrity of the scheme -
this is something for consideration when the scheme is worked up in
detail by the FMA for approval.

What effect will the scheme have on attendances?

• There might be a small short term downside effect on attendances
but as the scheme becomes more effective in keeping out the
troublemakers, more people will be attracted to attending games.
Many previously deterred by the threat of hooliganism will come back
into the game.

Wi.ll the supporter with no club affiliation have to nominate a club
allegiance?
• Most people would wish to be associated with a particular club to
benefit from the advantages which club membership will offer.
However those with no club allegiance may be able to join the scheme
without nominating a club.


VJ:11 there be exemptions from membership?

0   The Bill proposes that the scheme should provide for certain
groups to be exempt.   For example these could include accompanied
children in family enclosures   and  disabled people in designated
areas.
    Where guests visit a match at the club's invitation, the clubs
must be responsible to the licensing authority for their behaviour.


How will foreign visitors be able to attend matches?

•   There are several possibilities for the FMA to consider:

          they could join the scheme;
          they might be guests of the club;




4                                   Department of the Environment
        -   or, they could be asked to produce proof of
            identity like a passport, to secure temporary
            membership.

It is likely that the second option will be preferred.


Will Scottish and Northern Irish supporters be able to join           the
scheme?

• Yes. Anyone in the UK wishing to attend a designated matchr will
need to be a member.


Why not apply the Luton scheme nationwide?

•   Different grounds pose different problems.

     What has worked well in Luton could not be successfully
transferred to the whole country.   Look at London for example with
its mix of catchment areas for different clubs.

   A scheme at an individual club cannot provide the security which
a national scheme backed by legislation could offer.

     Dramatic effect on attendances by only permitting football
supporters to attend their own club when it is playing at home.


What is the attitude of the Police to the    proposal to introduce a
scheme?

•    The Police were represented on the working party by the
Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO).     They   agreed the
report and welcomed the principle, of a scheme.        The Police
Federation, having first welcomed the principle, have since voiced
reservations.

    A meeting with the Federation has taken place and further
meetings will be held to ensure that their concerns are taken into
account in working out the details of the scheme.


What do the football authorities think of the scheme?

•    The football authorities have made      clear   all    along   their
opposition to the principle of the scheme.

    They co-operated on the Minister for Sport's working party and
h^ve,   since the publication of its report,      confirmed  their
willingness to continue to co-operate with the Government in
producing a workable scheme.

   They wanted to see tougher action in some £treas, e.g. they would
have liked to see convictions for any form of violence in society
leading to membership bans.

The Card and the Technology
Where will I be able to get a membership card?
•   This is for the FMA to consider but the Government hopes
application forms would be freely available - from the FMA, t e
clubs and perhaps other agencies.

Will Scottish and Northern Irish supporters be asked to give their
national allegiance?
•   Yes it is proposed that anyone joining a scheme, from wherever
they come, would be asked to fill in a standard application form.


How long will the card last?
•   This is something the FMA would look at.  The working party
recommended that cards should be valid for two or, more likely,
three seasons.

What happens if a supporter loses his card?
•   He should report the loss to the FMA.    It is proposed that the
card would then be invalidated at every ground.    The FMA will wish
to consider whether clubs should be able to issue temporary
membership cards, valid for one match only to their guests and
members whose cards were lost, stolen or damaged.


Will my card entitle me to go to any Football League match?
•   Yes, a member would need and be allowed only one card but with it
would be able to go to any ground.    Any scheme would be a national
one.

How can you stop forgeries?
• No system can be impervious to forgery and fraud. The Government
believes that an electronically readable card supported by a
photograph will add a further layer of deterrence against hooligans,
on top of the measures already taken.

What happens if a supporter tries to use a card more than once at a
match - by handing it to a friend?
• Technology is available to ensure a card is only valid      once per
match and cannot therefore be passed back to someone else      to use.
We would wish to see that this is a feature of any scheme.    The
proposes that attempting to enter the ground without          a valid
membership card should be a criminal offence.

                                    Department of the Environment
What additional time will be required at the turnstiles?
•   Potential suppliers    of thetechnology say that some systems
would mean no extra timewould be necessary to check the card at the
turnstile.   It could be  done .inno more than the time it presently
takes to part with tickets or to pay for them.


What about checking photographs on membership cards?

•   It would be impractical to expect turnstile operators to check
photographs on entry.     The police advise that a photograph is
essential to deter fraud and assist detection if there is trouble.

What about last minute crowds?

#   There are problems now at some big matches with last minute
cfowds.    The scheme need not affect the problem at all if
appropriate technology is chosen.; If people were to enter the
ground a little earlier for the big games, this would be no bad
thing.


What happens if the equipment breaks down?

#   One of the features of the technology to be employed will be the
need for it to.be robust.    In the event of any equipment failure,
the scheme should provide for the local police in consultation with
the club to decide on appropriate arrangements.  It could be open to
the local police to allow a natch to go ahead without the normal
arrangements for checking membership cards, but attempting to obtain
admission to the match without a valid membership card would remain
a criminal offence under the licensing arrangements.       Like all
details of the scheme, this matter will need to be considered by the
FMA when it is drawing up its proposals.

Inside the Ground
Is not the problem now outside rather than inside grounds?

® ^ ^-s not true that hooliganism is no longer a problem inside
grounds. Arrest figures season after season are out of all
proportion to all other sports.

   22% of people interviewed in a National Opinion Poll published in
the Mail on Sunday on 27 November said they had been caught up in
violence inside the grounds, and 28% outside.


Has there been any trouble inside the grounds this season?

^   Yes,serious incidents have continued this season on a scale
comparable to last season. And it is not just incidents, the police
view remains that many matches "provide the focus for aggressive and
provocative behaviour with the threat of violence never far below
the surface".


Department of the Environment                                    7
What other measures have been taken inside grounds?
#   The police presence, segregation arrangements, strengthening of
the law on public order, including exclusion orders and tight
controls on alcohol*
   Enforcement has been much assisted by Closed Circuit Television
(CCTV) now in place at most league grounds.        Better quality
equipment has meant that ringleaders can be identified and rooted
out.
    The Public Order Act 1986 provided new offences of disorderly
conduct and for possession of fireworks or smoke bombs at matches.


What will the effect of the scheme be on segregation?    Will friends
be able to sit together?
#   Segregation as now would remain a matter for the club and the
local police.     The membership scheme need have no effect on
segregation arrangements.

What effect will the scheme have on the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act?
# It is important to avoid any overlap between the requirements of a
certificate issued under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and a
licence under the national membership scheme.



Outside the Ground
How will the scheme help solve the problem of hooliganism outside
the grounds?
• The scheme would end football as a focus for hooliganism outside
as well as inside the ground.      It would remove the match as a
central focus for the activities of hooligans.   If they cannot get
into a match they will not travel to one - a point amply
demonstrated under the Luton scheme.

What other measures are being taken to tackle the problem outside
grounds?
A great deal has and is being done.    Tough measures are being taken.

•   The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol) Act 1985 established
firm controls on the sale and possession of alcohol at grounds and
on footbaxl special coaches and trains.
• The Public Order Act 1986 provided the courts with the power to
make exclusion orders prohibiting attendance at certain matches by
convicted football hooligans.   This has proved useful but exclusion
orders are of only limited effectiveness.


8                                     Department of the Environment
•   Police effectiveness and intelligence    has been strengthened^
e.g. the improved exchange of information between forces; better
liaison between the police and the football authorities,.

• Advice has been issued on the enforcement of the law on the misuse
of alcohol and on the need to ensure swift justice following
incidents of hooliganism.




Abroad
What does Part II of the    Bill do?

• It proposes that when someone      isconvicted of a football related
offence, the court may also impose a restriction order requiring him
to report to an agency in England or Wales when certain matches take
place abroad.  Restriction orders would run for the standard length
of two years, or five years if the offender is sentenced to
immediate imprisonment.   In any case, the courtmust be satisfied
that a restriction order would help to prevent or reduce violence
or disorder at matches abroad.


Who will be 'the agency'?

• No decision has yet been taken, which is why the Bill leaves the
matter open-ended.   The police would be one possible candidate for
some or all of the functions, and we are discussing this with them.


How will someone know when to report?

• He will have to report initially to the agency within 30 days of
the restriction order being made. Thereafter the agency will inform
him when and where    to attend.   Someone subject to an order must
keep the agency informed if he moves house, and can apply to change
to supervision in another location.


What if he does not report?

•   Failure to report will be a criminal offence.


Can he appeal?

•    As with any conviction or sentence, a defendant may appeal
against imposition of a restriction order.     In addition the Bill
provides for application to have the order set aside, once it has
been in force for 12 months; and for someone to ask the agency to
waive a particular reporting requirement where there are special
circumstances to justify his exemption by virtue of which he would
not attend the match.   These are sensible provisions, to avoid the
reporting requirement acting unjustly.



Department of the Environment                                       9
 .Convictions abroad?
 •   There is at least as much reason why a conviction abroad for
 football hooliganism should lead to a restriction order being made.
 The Bill allows for application to be made for an order in England
 or Wales where someone resident here has been convicted of such an
 offence abroad. Relevant countries (and offences) must be specified
 in advance by the Secretary of State.     This should be seen as a
 facility, for other countries to use if they wish to present us with
 evidence of these convictions.


 Why not withdraw someone's passport?

 •   The objective of Part II of the Bill is to prevent hooligans from
 travelling to specific football matches abroad - not to impose a
 much wider ban on any travel abroad.


 When will the restriction orders come into effect?

 •   As soon as arrangements for the reporting agency are finalised.



 The FM A
Who will be appointed to run the Football Membership Authority?

•  The Football Association and the Football League have said they
wish to establish a joint body which they would recommend to the
Secretary of State for designation as the FMA.

    It will be open to other organisations and individuals to seek
appointment as the FMA.


Who will notify the FMA of those convicted?

•  The Bill proposes that the court should inform the FMA and the
police of a relevant conviction.


Will supporters be able     to   appeal   against   bans   imposed   at   the
discretion of the FMA?

•   The Bill proposes that the scheme should provide for an appeals
tribunal to be established.


Can people rejoin the scheme on expiry of their ban?

•  Yes.   But it will be open to the FMA to extend the period of
disqualification under their discretionary powers,  by rejecting an
application to rejoin provided it has reason to do so.  There would
be the right of appeal.



10                                   Department of the Environment
Civil Liberties
How will civil liberties be safeguarded?
•   A scheme would not interfere in civil liberties. It is not the
case that everyone has the right to enter a football ground. Clubs
refuse entry to thousands of unwanted spectators now.    Hooliganism
does infringe the civil liberties of others - shopkeepers, shoppers,
the general public and property owners in town centres and near
grounds and not least the genuine football supporter.


Why not make everyone carry a national ID card?

•   That is a subject for a different, wider debate.   A typical
national ID card could not be used to     keep hooligans out of
football.


Surely the commercial development of a scheme will infringe civil
liberties?

•   In developing the commercial potential of a scheme, the FMA and
the clubs would have to act in line with the principles of the Data
Protection Act - members would have the right to see and challenge
the accuracy of any computerised information held about them and
appropriate security precautions would be taken to safeguard that
information. No details of convictions will be held on the cards.

 Introduction of the membership scheme will provide, for the
•first time, an effective and comprehensive procedure to keep
 hooligans away from football matches.    I am confident that it
 will lead to the link between violence and football being broken
 and that going to a football match will become a far more
 enjoyable occasion than it has been for many years. Indeed, I
 believe that many people previously deterred by the threat of
 hooliganism will return to football.

      morning but they knew a 40p bus ride
      would get them out of town to a pub, and
      they knew where to go. We went to a call
       at a pub called The Gate. This was at twen­

       was being beaten up in there. We went in

       road blocks to stop the fans who were ap­

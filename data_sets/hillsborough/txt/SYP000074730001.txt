                I arn                                 a m a r r i e d woman.         My husb a n d fl.                        is the

                Saturday        15 April       1989     (150489)         I was w o r k i n g / n the         p u b . I had

                earlier        hung some w a s h i n g          out   in the       rear y^f/l of the          pub.   This ya rd

                backs     out onto the           pub car         park    in

                Due    to the football            m a t c h being        played at Hillsb orough,               we   had about

               2 0 - 2 5 L i v e r p o ol s u p p o r t e r s    in the       pub,   all    drink i n g     in the one bar.

               M o s t l y they were well             behaved,          at about 2 . 1 5 p m        (1415),    a group       left

                the    bar an d w a l k e d      out the back door to the                     car    park,    at the back of

                the     pub.

               Shortly afterwards                I d e c i d e d to      check my w a s h i n g and d i s c o v e r e d that

                it had been stolen off the                       line.

               All     the     pegs were       on the floor as                if someone        had just      pulled the
                                                                                                                      PAGE         2
                                                                                                                      S1899

             clothes      straight     off the       line.

             The     clothing w h i c h was taken        consisted of two            pairs of jeans             belonging

             to my daughter,          one    pair had suede a r o u n d the zip and                  p o c k e t s , they

             had a brand narne of Wryggs.               The    other     pair were      just normal Levi

             j e a n s . Also     taken were 4 t-shirts,           one was white wit h green and blue

              patt e r n on the front,         anot h e r was white w i t h a blue               pattern on the

             front,      both had a small           union jack on the s l e e v e . The other two t—

             sh irts were a pink t-shirt wit h white                     hoops across          the    chest,     t he       last

             being     pink w i t h a grey hoop across             the    c h e s t » all    four t— shirts were

             made     by Dunlop.

             No one had perm i s s i o n to remove             the t- shirts       or jeans          from the w a s h i n g

              line.

              I placed the w a s h i n g      out at a bout       12.30pm      (1230)       and d i s c o v e r e d    it

             m i s s i n g at about 2 . 1 5 p m     (1415),    although      no one saw who took the

              washing,      we have had no other             thefts a r o u n d the     pub for a considerable

              t ime.

                                                                                                                 SIGNED

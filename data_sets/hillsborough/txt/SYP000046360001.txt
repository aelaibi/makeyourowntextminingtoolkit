Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


 No. 13         Colin Wafer.

a. Summary par 17. Insert "including Photograph Reference RBI/3
RBI/4 and PR3/29A " after the word "photographs" and delete the last
sentence.

b. Very minor point but page 94 is not complete.

c. Please let me know which are the additions referred to on page 97.


 No 38. Christopher Edwards.

a. Summary Para 15. An even more minor point. There is a spelling
mistake of the word "pitch".

b. Summary Para 16. substitute the word "including" for the word "and"
in the second line and delete "is included with this file" .

b. Page 36. I cannot find the reference to the large male referred to
on this page in the previous statement. Can you direct me please.


 No 51. Kevin Daniel Williams.

a. Summary para 5. I cannot find the evidence in PC1790 statement for
"assisted by other persons, who have not been identified, but without
success. The officer left him with the other person whilst he went to
assist others". If I am right than can we leave this out but add after
the word "resuscitation" the words "but without success.".

b. Summary para 8 . This evidence is quite difficult. I think we will
have to deal with it at the Inquest. However I wonder whether it might
be better to substitute "several" for the word "six".
•   .




        c. Summary para 19 insert "including Photograph Reference TT1/30
        after the word "photographs" and delete   Photograph Reference
        TT1/30 is included with the file" .

        d. PC Craighhill on pages 27 -29 describes four cases. Is it possible
        to say which of these refers to his video identification ?

        e. How do we know that No 51 is the deceased on photographs PR5/32 and
        PR5/33 ?

        f . I assume that the other PC on the photos mentioned in e above has
        not been identified.

        g. I notice that there are no photographs of clothing. Is this a
        deliberate omission.

        h. We need Dr. Slater for this case. Can he be shown the statements
        of Craighill Bruder and Martin ( Highlighting the relevent sections)
        and ask him to consider in the light of his PM findings whether the
        account of SPC Martin is possible.


         No 76. John Alfred Anderson.

        a. Summary Para 2 . delete "four pints to drink" and substitute
        "something to drink". It is true that Mr.        ^ says four pints but
        Mr. Anderson does not.

        b. Summary Para 5 & 7 . It is difficult to reconcile all the accounts.
        It seems to me however that Mr.          did not participate in
        carrying this person as he left to look for his brother (Page 41).
        Would it be better to delete Mr.            name from the summary.

        c. Para 14. Please delete "following identification by Detective
        Constable WEIGOLD" .
                                                                           'V

        d. Small point but on page 80 the word "Aorta" is omitted from the
        cause of death.

        e. We will need Dr. ShoiHand in this case.

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in my letter of same date but under reference H/comments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.

 No. 90. David Leonard Thomas.

a. Page 57 Should be Dr. Clark.

b. See comments re Wardrope and                             made on other similar cases.



  No 92 Arthur Horrocks.

a. Evidence of                   I wonder if the plan which she refers
to would be useful in this case.

Dear Stan,

Further to our meeting on 13th March at my home in Nottingham
I am writing to inform you that as soon as it possible to do
so the following summaries (together with the front page summary)
may be released to the respective solicitors and Mr. Frazer.

In some of these cases there may be outstanding matters which need
sorting out in respect of statements or plans etc but I do not think
that these affect the release of the summaries.

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


 No. 59 Gordon Rodney Horn.


a.Summary Para           6   . Time of death should be 1602.

b. Confusion as to time of identification see pages                          19and 22
Also 24 hour clock times incorrect.

c. I notice that Mr.     identifies Paula Smith thoughhe is not
referred to in her file No 18. Has he in fact got the right
identification?.

d. I have already referred to in other cases to Mr. Wardrope and
continuity of NGH numbers.


 No 61 Colin Andrew Hugh William Sefton.

a. Front page and Para 9. Time of death. Any evidence for the time
stated as Dr. Bull does not specify.

b. Para 13. Please amend by deleting "following identification by DC
Weigold".

c. Please insert "Mr" before                                   on page 5. para 15.

d. Please show the pathologist pages 2 and 3 of T. Sefton's statement
I would like him to attend.

e. Was the body in a body bag?

f. I think we need a birth certificate if possible please.

g. P 69 which photos?
   No 75      Derrick George Godwin.

 a. Summary Para 10. Need amending to remove reference to DC
 Weigold.

 b. P. 40      See previous comments on this mans statement.

 c. P 49. Identification to Prof. Henry.

 d. Can we find out how Prof Henry knew whose body he was examining as
 he refers to them by name and number.

 e. P 69 Which photos?


  No 83 Jon Paul Gilhooley,

 a. Sum. Para 8 . delete "the body of Jon Paul Gilhooley" and
 substitute "several bodies"

 b. P. 33 Do we know who the the person is who is referred too? Could
 it be No 91? Is there any way of finding out?

 c. P.   68   Date of Death incorrect. Please   ask Pathologist toattend.

 d. Please let me have statement No S229 of R. Gilhooley.

 e. If possible we need a birth certificate.

 f. See earlier comments re Mr. Wardrope and continuity of No.


 No 84. Paul David Brady.

a. Sum Para 2. Spelling of

b. Sum Para     8   See below re comment re Dr. Jacob.

c. Sum Para 9 amend this para by deleting "accompanied the body        of Mr.
Brady and substitute "accompanied several bodies".

d. How did Mr. Jacob find out the name of Mr. Brady?

e. Is there any evidence of the details on the abdomen eg photograph?

f. Has Mr. Wardrope seen Dr. Jacob’s account. Please let him see it in
case he wishes to review his comments.

g. Do we know were Mr. Jacob is working at present?

h. Do we need Dr.            statement for continuity with the NGH no.?

i. We are still not out of trouble with DC Weigold. Please see
opening evidence of Mr. Parkin. Similar matter arise in some other
cases as well. Please discus with me.

j . The Gen 18 refers to some other Dr who certified death. Is this a
mispelling?
 No 85 Carl David Lewis.


a.   I think that although sum. Para 4 and 5 are factually correct and
give an interesting       account it would be better    to amend them by
deleting them entirely and substituting
1               ~|saw CARL LEWIS enter the ground through the
turnstyles. He did not see CARL LEWIS again."

This will mean renumbering subsequent paras.

b.     I assume that PC       Newbold adds nothing.

c.   P 54 Deceased is    referred to as "James"and     indeed also on page67
though the identification by Mr. Lewis seems to have been correct
(p63). Was this simply a transcription error by PS Timmins. If so DC
Weigold'sstatement is in error as to the name. Can we check the
original statements please.

d. Who is Dr.          P 64 . Statement please for reference.

e. I notice that the Gen 18 originally refers to him as James but was
altered . Perhaps that is the clue but when was it done?

f. probably will want the pathologist.


 No.   86   Gary Philip Jones.

a. Summary Para 8 . insert "(not Gary Philip Jones)" after the word
"casualty" and delete "(believed to be Barry Bennett Deceased
Reference 8 8 )"

b. Summary para 13.         Delete "It will be seen      these facts".

c. Can we have the spelling of Philip checked as sometimes it is spelt
with two l 1 s.

d. Can we discuss Mr.               ividence in relation to Hicks and Wild
at some point please.

e. On p 17 and 18 he refers to Gary Jones but does not seem to refer
to him in his original statement. Have I read this correctly?
                       «>


f. I assume that the man on p 39 is Barry Bennett.

g. P. 46. Is there any way of linking the NGH number to No        86   other
than by using Dr.

h. p. 55 Which photo please?

i. May need Pathologist.
 No 88 Barry Sidney Bennett.

a. Sum. Para 3. I think it might be better to delete "Whilst waiting
in the crowd in Leppings Lane Mr. C saw the outer gates being pushed
open by the crowd. The gates were then closed by the police. Mr. C
then saw the crowd push against the outer gates again which opened and
11. and substitute "Mr. Carroll saw the outer gates open twice. On the
second occassion". (Note the summary is not incorrect it just seems to
me better to summarise as above. I am willing to discus it.)

b.Summary Para 8 . Please put this para, in brackets. Please ensure
that the presenting officer will be able to give evidence of the
reseach undertaken.

c. Sum. para 10. The time stated is incorrect. Presumably typing
error.

d. Para 19. Poor Mr. ________ has difficulties in putting faces
to cases. I think it would be better if we deleted the whole
of the para from " visual and photographic........ " and substituted
"video and photographic evidence including a recent photograph of Mr.
Bennett. He is certain that Mr. Bennett is one of the persons who he
carried across the pitch on a temporary stretcher."
The presenting officer/ Insp. Layton can then deal with the detail
orally.

e. Para. 20 How do we know that Mr.          helped to carry Mr.
Bennett?

f. Para 22. How do we know that the man on the pitch is Mr. Bennett.

g. To whom did Mr. Turner make the identification?

h. Was there any reason why he declined to   make a statement?

i. I assume the presenting officer/Insp. Layton will be able to
explain this.

j. Page 4. Is there any way we could get a   time when he was seperated
ie was it before or at the time the gates    were opened?

k. Can we   find out whether Dr.       remembers if he put a cannula
into this   man's arm or attempted any other method of venous access.
 see page   41. If not and assuming this was done following the incident
than some   other Dr. or paramedic must have had dealings with Mr.
Bennett.

1. Which is Dr.         statement S575A?

m.   Can I have a copy of Ins. Bennett's statement S 565.

n. Usual linkage for hospital no. and Mr. Wardrope /Dr/
  No 91 Stephen Francis Harrison.

a.       Facing Sheet. Cause of death incorrect. See page              71

b.       Were does the certification time come from.

c.       Do we          know who the person on page 48 is ?

d. P. 50 I am not sure whether Dr. K says that patient intubated
at A & E. If so does not fit in with Dr. Q. unless he was extubated
and reintubated. Can we find out?

e. Do we know whether this patient was labelled NGH 21 in A&E or later
see page 51.

f. p. 60 I think it unlikely that the body was labelled 91 in A & E
can Mr.        link the numbers at all?

g. I think we need Mr. Wardrope and possibly Dr.                            in this case.

h. We definitely need the pathologist.

i. Please let Dr. Slater see Dr. Restatement and particularly p 50-51
and ask him whether he needs to review his PM findings?

j. p. 112 How do we know this is Stephen particularly as p 31 seems
to indicate that he was not with friends ?


  No 93             Philip Hammond.

a. Front page                     cause of death incorrect, see page 70.

b. Can you remind me who the person is whom Dr.                            prefers to on
p 58

c. P.          66    Indentification Insp. Timms

d. Can we discuss the evidence on page 22 re the Hicks files.

e. I would like to discuss the ambulance evidence at some time so that
I can be sure that I have understood it correctly.

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in my letter of same date but under reference H/comments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.


 No 79. Graham John Roberts

a. Every time I look at M r _________ statement I seem to find something
else. Apart from what I have alreeady pointed out before I now
notice:

i. 4.45 am is not 1645.

ii. I thought that Ins. Timms had gone off duty and allowed DC Weigold
to hold the fort during the night. If that is so whom did Mr. _________
brief ?

b. Page 32.           Pathologist was Dr. Clark

c . Page 63. Mr        in the last sentence saysthat he saw Graham
last prior to entering the tunnel. The Plan shows him as having seen
him well within the tunnel. Which is correct ?

d. Have we got a statement from PC Sherwood ?

Dear Stan,

Further to our meeting on 13th March at my home in Nottingham
I am writing to inform you that as soon as it possible to do
so the following summaries (together with the front page summary)
may be released to the respective solicitors and Mr.

In some of these cases there may be outstanding matters which need
sorting out in respect of statements or plans etc but I do not think
that these affect the release of the summaries.

Det Superintendent S. Beechey,
West Midland Police,
Nechells Green Police Station,
Fowler St.,
Birmingham,
B7 5DA.

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendmentsto the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


  No. 62       Barry Glover.

a. Small point in Summary Para                            6   fourth line should not the word
"them" be "him".

b. I think we are going to need Prof Usher in this case.


  No. 82       Philip John Steele.

a. Summary para 8 . The position with regard to Mr. Udall is not very
satisfactory as he does not know which bodies he transported nor
does PC Marsh refer to the NGH numbering system.

I think therefore that it might be wiser to delete "including Philip
John STEELE,"

b. Summary para 9. Delete "Upon arrival at the gymnasium" and insert
" a body which he subsequently learned was that of" after the words
"reponsibility for" .

c. Do we have statement of                                             Page 23 refers.

d. What do we know about the Major Disaster Plan No and documentation
referred to by Mr.         Who is the police woman who kept the record
and do we know who the six police officers he refers to are ? (Page
37).

e. I have a comment on                                        but I willl make it later on one
of the other cases.

f. Page 54. Which photo please ?

g. Can I have a copy of the statement of PC Smith                              S3254.

h. I think that we will need Prof. Underwood.                             >
  No 87. Stephen Francis O'Neill.

a. Summary para 4. I think that Mr. Wardrope say on page 17 that it is
possible that attempts at resuscitation may have taken place.
I suggest that we add "written" before "evidence" and substitute
"but there is evidence from the post mortem findings that medical
intervention took place" for "and believes he was triaged as dead on
arrival". If you do not agree please let me know.

b. Mr. Wardrope statement starting on page   6   . Has this in fact been
signed. I ask as there are blanks in it.

c. P. 8 . I think Mr.       is a senior registrar and not an SHO

d. P. 11. Do we know which family he refers too.

e. P. 14. Time of 1345 is patently incorrect. What time does he
actually mean?

f. P. 17. He refers to the NGH number as 119 for Mr.               Dr
       efers to it as 001. Which one is in fact correct.

g. P. 17. Does Mr. Wardrope know what Dr.        has said about
Steele. If not should it be drawn to his attention so that he may if
he thinks it right make an amendment to his statement.

h. Page 20. Do we know which body was the one that was brought
in late ?

i. Someone must have told Dr. Doore what our body numbers are. Can you
remind me how the relationship between our numbers and the hospital
numbers was established ?

j. Page 28 There does not appear to be a NHG number 65. Can we get
this sorted out if possible.

k. I think that we should warn Mr. Wardrope that I might want him to
give evidence on day 1 (April 18).


 No 94 Adam Edward Spearritt.

I have phone about a. on 29/3/90.

a. There seems to be rather a lot of confusion about this lad
Page 21. Pc. Pearson says he put him in the ambulance and accompanies
him.

Page 33 Mr.     says that it was a group of supporters and
does not really mention Mr. Pearson.
Page 43 Mr.          says the patient was in Mr.              care and
was bleeding heavily. Furthermore on page 45 he says that the patient
was unloaded into casualty and declared DOA and taken to plaster room.
I wonder whether M r . i s       really talking about another patient
and not Adam at all. It occurs to me that it could be Philip John
Steele No 82 particularly as he had a laceration of the lung. One
could check with Prof Underwood whether this could cause bleeding.
I think that it might be worth reinterviewing M r . ________ and showing
him photo's in case he can recognise the lad.

Page 52 and 53 Mr.           seems to suggest that the lad was left in
the care of the Hospital urS

Page 60 D r .         does not identify the patient but I assume that
you would suggest m a t because he refers to D r . Clark who does that
he was dealing with Adam.

Do we know who the junior Dr. who gave the intra cardiac injection.

Do we know whether Dr.           is still in Sheffield ? If not where
is he?

b. Can you please send as soon as possible a copy of Dr.
statement to Prof S. Jones and ask him to consider whether he wishes
to reconsider his stated cause of death in the light of what is said
on page 60 about the intra cardiac injection and his findings of
severe pericardial effusion and myocardial haemorrhages.

c. Have we any idea who the patient was whom Dr.            intubated at
the Gym ?

d. Can we warn Dr. Clark (the anaethetist) that he might be required
at the inquest.

f.In order not to hold up the release of the summary and in view of
my concerns about             evidence do you think it might be better
in Summary Para 7 to delete "Ambulanceman                   and
include him at the Inquest if we decide that he did deal with Adam?

A general point. Do we know were the Drs involved in these hospital
cases are now located in case we need to ask any of them to come to
the Inquests.




Yours sincerely,

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in my letter of same date but under reference H/comments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.


 No 24. Henry Charles Rogers.

a. Page 4. Do we know the identity of the two men mentioned ?

b. It is very tragic that another son should have died in this family
within the last year. Do we know anything about the circumstances of
this death?

c. I have noted the error in the death certification but as this has
in effect been corrected by the Dr. on page 49.

c. Page 26 . I am not clear what K.F. Knights is correcting as it
seems to me that in his statement of 8/5/89 (page 20) he already gives
the correct time.

d. The initial statement of Insp. Layton is pissing from my copy.
Please let me have this in due course.


 No. 28 Steven Joseph Robinson.

a. Page 14. Can we include the Grid please as I find it difficult to
understand without it.

b. Page 21. As I understand the file this lad was alone. Do we know
anything about the person described as "possibly be his brother" ?

c. Are there any statements in support from any of the other PCs
identified on MW1/3 (Page 34) ?

d. page 65 and 71. Usual problems with indentification .
 No 72. Michael David Kelly.

a. Page 29. Usual problem with identification not identified by name
and wrong pathologist named.

b. As a matter of interest I assume there is no evidence to show how
the pathologist actually learned the name in the cases where the names
were not known in the morning.

c. Please can you tell me which the additional photo is referred to on
page 44.

d. Have we had any contact with the divorced wife or the child of the
marriage ?

e. I think that Dr. Clark will have to be called.


 No 73.   Paul William Carlile.

a. Page 14. Previous statement please.

b. Page 19    Is the previous statement relevant   please ?

c. Page 21 see comments on h/comments reidentification        by Dr.


d. Page 23. Body identified by No. only.

e. Page 43 Name misspelt. I think we will correct this at the Inquest
if possible.

f. Page 63 64 and 65. I am a little nervous about the spelling of the
surname. Page 64 shows Donna's signature as "Carli s^ le". Can we check
the original statement and see what she really signed. If possible
we should obtain a birth certificate in this case.

g. I think we will need Prof Usher in this case.


Yours sincerely.

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


 No 29. Eric Hankin.

a. Summary Para. 4. The word "cursory" has slipped in again. Can we
delete it please.

b. Summary Para 15. insert the word "including" after the words "Pen
3" and delete "is produced".

c. Page 60 and 64. Usual problem of identification with pathologist
and DC Weigold.

d. Plan RL1 referred to in the additional schedule is not included in
the file.

e. I think Plan PRG1 may be useful.


 No. 60 Christopher James Traynor.

a. Summary Para 4. I am having difficulty in sorting out which of the
two bodies that the officers dealt with is the deceased in this file.
Summarising officer seems to have opted for the first body described
on page 13 and 17 but both had the officers number written on right
hand. Perhaps the interviewing officer is able to shed some light on
who is who?

b. Summary Para 5. What enquiries are referred to please?

c. Summary Para 15. Please insert "including" after the word "pitch"
and delete "is included in this file."
No. 78 Peter Reuben Thompson.

a. Summary para 5. Would I be right in thinking that some one must
be mistaken or can the accounts be reconciled in any way?
I think that the summarising officer should be prepared to deal with
this at the inquest.

b. I find M r . E v i d e n c e rather confusing. I assume that Mr.
P.R. Thompson is the person described on page 10 of the officers
statement. He states him as having blue jeans and this is
confirmed PC N.F. Smith on page 36. On the other hand on page 12 where
he identifies him he describes him as being all in white. Has he in
fact got the wrong person ?

c. Still on Mr.        in his statement of 19.10.89 he refers to three
persons but in his statement of 5.9.89 he mentions 4. It is not clear
from the statement of 19.10.89 whether the man described as Mr.
Thompson is the man with the large watch page 9 or the man with the
"beer belly" on page 10. Have we got the Daily Mirror photo and do we
know who he is ? Is it possible to try and sort this one out ?

d. I am also confused by Mr. Early. He identifies the deceased on page
33 but I cannot relate it to which one of the various people he helped
and which speaks about in his first statement. Can we find out from
him whom he means?

e. I have not noticed this before but on page 41 I am a little
surprised that Dr.          can say that the individuals had numbers
allocated as I think this must have taken place in the gym. Any
comments please?
                                      /

f. Pages 43 and 50. Which is the correct place of birth please ?


 No 95. Lee Nicol.

a. Facing sheet . There is a spelling mistake in the cause of death
Bronchopneumonia.

b. I think that plan KRM1 would be useful.

c. I am concerned that both Mr. Flack and Mr        seem to have
misidentified Lee in the temporary mortuary, have we found out which
lad they are in fact referring too please? Do we know who the police
officer with the beard is?

d. Page 92 . Who is the patient referred to by D r . p l e a s e      ?

e. Please note that we will need Dr. Holt at the Inquest and probably
also Dr. Appleyard.

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


 No 53. Stuart Paul William Thompson.

a. Summary Para 4. I cannot find in the statements of PC Larkin C.
Sup. Nesbit or for that matter PC Walton any postive confirmation
tha the body they handled was that of Stuart. I assume that the
summary is based on the statement of PC Jackson and worked backward so
to speak. Can you please confirm that I have understood this
correctly.

b. Page 79. Pc. Weigold's statement refers to Usher rather than Clark.

c. Page 85. Again this should have been Dr. Clark rather than Usher.
I note that the name is given in full but assume that this is because
of the date when the statement was taken.

d. At some point when we have completed the summaries I will want to
go over some of the visual evidence with Ins. Layton so that he can
explain to me how the indentification were done.  1519 57 07 is a good
example.


 No 65. William Roy Pemberton.

a. Summary Par. 14. Please insert " including Photgraph references
 PR6/2A and AH/11” after the word "photgraphs" in line 3 and delete
" Photograph Reference PR6/2A and AH/11 are produced."

b. On Page 7 Mr. Pemberton is upset about the fact that the officer
dealing with the identification did not recognise "LOTTO" baseball
boots. I assume the photographic evidence shows these boots but do you
know whether there is anything about them which clearly shows them as
LOTTO baseball boots.

c. Dr. Clark will have to come to this Inquest.
No. 69 Gerard Bernard Patrick Baron.

a. Summary Para.10. Delete "following identification by Detective
Constable Weigold" This is a case were the continuity must still be
sorted out if it is possible to do so.

b. Although we probably have the spelling of the first name correct
we should verify it by obtaining a birth certificate if possible.

c. Page 4. I assume the girls referred to are not the Hicks sisters.

d. Page 75 I notice that DC Weigold spells the first name apparently
correctly but the identifiers spell it differently. Was this spelling
in the original statement?

e. Is photo PR1/20 the same as PR1/20A ?


 No.74 Kester Roger Marcus Ball.

a. Summary Para. 8 . Delete " Following identification by Detective
Constable WEIGOLD on Sunday 16th April 1989,". This is a case were
continuity and identification still need to be sorted out.

b. Page 35 states that certification took place at 4.35pm. At page 40
(which incidentally is the statement rather than the recollection) the
time is given as 3.35 which cannot be right as the Dr. did not turn up
till 4.30. Please check the original statement and if necessary
obtain further statement if that is possible to explain the
discrepancy.

c. I do not think that I made this point when I wrote to you about
Mr. Wild NO 77 but it applies there as well.


 No 89. Victoria Jane Hicks.

a. Small point but at the foot of the facing sheet the name "Jane"
is ommitted.

b. Summary Para. 12. I think the time was approximately "1537" and not
"1530" see pages 47 and 104.

c.   S u m m a ry Para 14. insert "also" after the word

d. S u m m ary Para 15. I am not sure about this para, in this file. I
think it would be best if it were deleted though it is ofcourse very
sad that this added distress ocurred. Please discuss with me if you
feel differently about this.

e. If deleted subsequent paras will have to be renumbered.
•   .



        Victoria Jane Hicks continued.

        f. Summary para 18.(present numbering) delete "following
        identification by Detective Constable WEIGOLD". Identification and
        continuity needs sorting out if possible.

        g. Pages   28-36. Can we include the grid plan he refers to please.

        h. Page 75 is missing from my copy . Please let me have it.

        i.Page 131. Date of death is incorrect.

        j. Page 132. He diescribes a haemothorax. I think this is the first
        one that I can remember. Please let Dr. Denmark see a copy of the
        statement of J. S. Calder and particularly page 113 and ask him to
        consider whether the intra cardiac injection could have caused this or
        whether he has any other comments. He can make these at the inquest as
        I think that he will have to come to this one.




        Yours sincerely.

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in my letter of same date but under reference H/comments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.


  No 64. Sarah Louise Hicks

a. Who did the identification to Dr. Slater see pages 113 & 114.

b. The photgraphs show a Mr. Mitton . Can I have his statement please.


  No 68. John McBrien

a. Page 36 P.J. Webster states that he arrived at the tem. mortuary at
4.20 after loading the bodies from Lepping Lane. If that is correct
than the timing on the front sheet and summary for the death
certification cannot be right as this is shown 9 minutes later but tie
in with Dr. Ashtons timings. Can you help on this.

b. This man's statement also refers to 93 bodies Page 37. I doubt
whether that can be correct as all the bodies were present at the tem.
mortuary for the photgraphs except no 95.

c. Page 51 photo number differ from those in schedule.


 No 80. David John Benson.

a. Roger Utley. Is the statement referred to as the original statement
on page 23 the recollections included as pages 14 - 20 ?

b. Is No 80 the same as the body described in the last line of page
21 ?

c. Is the daughter referred to on page 42 represented                            by solicitors ?

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


 No 36. Kevin Tyrrell.

a. Small point but please delete "is produced" from para. 12 of
Summary.

b. P. 15 I note the misspelling of the Dr.      which I do not think
too serious but I wonder where the reference to Middlewood Hospital
comes from as this raises a bigger doubt about correctness.

c. P. 35 Dr.

d. P. 49 Pathologist is Dr. Clarke. I now understand that the main
statement refers to Prof Usher and his team but I think that the
subsidiary statements should also be more or less correct.

e. Your computer has not yet got the trainee out of it system.


 No.41. Eric George Hughes.

a. Facing sheet. I think the time of certification should be the same
as in the summary Para 5 particularly as the stated time is earlier
than the Doctor's time estimates.

b. I note that the name which I understand is based on my schedules
is never fully stated in any statement, we will need to verify the
name again .


 No. 43. Graham John Wright.

a. I think that there is a mistake in para 15 of the summary
as it refers to Mr. ASPINALL. It also has a quotation which I do not
object to in principle but it is inconsistent with the rest of the
presentations. Would you consider the following:
Delete 'and states " the only one which I feel is a possibility for
the person that I gave resuscitation to was body of Mr. ASPINALL. I
cannot be absolutely sure this is the person.'", and substitute the
following:

"and with hesitation thinks that the body he attempted to resuscitate
was that of Mr.G.J. Wright."

b. I think that we need the plans referred to on page 8 and probably
11 and 20.

c. Dr.        on page 31

d. I am not clear where the variants of this deceased middle name
originated from (Sean and Shaun and Shawn the latter on page 50)

e. P 35 and P 42 . The usual problem with the pathologist name.


 No. 67 Raymond Thomas "John" Chapman.

a. Notwithstanding my form it seems that the name which we got was not
complete see Page 1 statement of son. We need to verify the name
if possible with a birth certifcate and then make the necessary
amendments.

b. Previous statement of G.. Glaves please, page 59.

c. P 81. PC. Popplewell did not know the middle name and could not
have therefore identified the deceased as such.. Please also see P 82
were Dr. Slater says it was Ins Timms who did the identification.


 No. 50 Andrew Mark Brookes.

a. Summary para 16. Please amend by inserting " including Photograph
 reference SMR1/102 " after the words "number of photographs' and
deleting ** Photograph reference SMR1/102 ".

b. Page 17. I assume that the previous statement is not relevant but
perhaps I should have it for completeness.

c. Page 89. Can you please tell me which are the additions referred
to.

 No. 55 Nicholas Michael Hewitt.

a. Summary Para 15. Please delete "is included with this file".

b. On p 25    line 5 the time is stated as 1410 hours (1440). Which is
correct?


 No. 70 Alan McGlone.

a. Summary para 13. Please delete "is produced which".

b. It is   not relevant to the present activity but I notice that A.J.
Brazener   states that having satisfied himself that Pen 3 was empty he
moves to   Pen 4 and sees 20 to 30 bodies on the floor. I assume he is
mistaken   about the Pens or is there any other evidence for this?
c. Page 42. I assume previous statement irrelevant but I think I
better have it.

d. I am not sure on what basis the identification of the deceased has
been made on PR7/2 as the named officers disclaim recognising him.

 No. 71. Stephen Paul Copoc.

a. Summary para 2. I do not think that it is clear that they each had
three pints. I think it might be safer to delete "each" and "three
pints to" in line 6 of this paragraph.

b. Summary para 2 . Last sentence reading "At this stage he lost sight
of Stephen COPOC". I cannot find this in his statement. If I am right
than we should   delete or put it in but introduced   as a comment.

c. Page 32. PC   Griffiths did not know the name of   the deceased and
cannot therefore identify him by name to DC. Weigold.

d. I notice that on p.47 this lads name is spelt as COPOL. I will ask
Dr. Forrest to   check the labelling on the sample.


 No. 77 Martin Kenneth Wild.

a. Summary para 6. Please put the last sentence in brackets or
otherwise indicate a comment.

b. Pages 36 and 39. Mr. Lawrence in his first statement seems quite
clear that Mr. Wild was the first body he dealt with but in his
statement of 05.07.89 he seems to say that the first body was No 74
Kester Ball. I fear that he will need reinterviewing to clear this up.

c. Page 38 . Last Line Is this a typing error "7"?

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries^plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have "other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


  No. 8.        David Hawley

a. Summary Para 3. I think the evidence is difficult to summarise in
this case as there seems to be some ambiguity about it as well as
contradiction. Please consider the following as an alternative but
feel free to discuss with me.

Delete "     now known to be David HAWLEY on to the pitch. David
HAWLEY had been passed from the terraces by police officers and
supporters. Evidence suggests that HAWLEY was in Pen 3 but there is
contradictory evidence later in the file. Mr. TURNER left David HAWLEY
on the pitch.” and substitute the following:

 " whom he subsequently identified as David HAWLEY on to the pitch.
 David HAWLEY had been passed to him from the terraces. His evidence
 would support the view that David HAWLEY was in Pen 3 but other
 evidence referred to later (see Paragraph 11) would tend to contradict
 this. Mr. TURNER left David HAWLEY on the pitch.

 b. Please chck whether the original statement of Mrs.                          A.P. Hawley
 spells Mr. Owens name with an apostrophe.

 c. Which are the items referred to in the supplemental statement of
 Ins. Layton (page 51.)

 d. Can you help by explaining to me the misidentifications                          referred to
 in Mrs. M. Owens statement on page 54 ?


   No 42.         Paul Anthony Hewitson.

  a. I think it would be better to delete "drinking alcohol" from line
  two of paragraph 2 in the summary.

  b. I note that PC. Roberts refers to Dr. Hull in some of his
  statements but I assume this is an error for Dr. Bull.

  c. I think that it might be as well if Statement S1804 M r . _________w
  included in this file.
No. 54. Anthony Peter Kelly.

a. Foot of facing sheet the order of the Christian names is incorrect.
See page 10.

b. There seems to be some confusion with regard to the order of
indentification of the name. The body came to the mortuary before the
namp had been established (see statement of Pont). Mr. Weigold's
statement is therefore technically incorrect. Also PC Glaves statement
of identifcation only refers to one Christian name from mum whilst
there is no statement from him dealing with the identification from
Mr. Jenkins.

c. Is photograph PRI/N/10 the same as PRi/M/lOA ?

d. Dr. Curpen's second statement refers to him as Dr. Cyrpen. I assume
this is a typing error but please check . The error of course occurs
in all the cases in which he is involved ie 36, 43, 51, 53, 54 , 56
57 58 and 65.


 No. 56. David William Mather.

a. Facing sheet and summary. No evidence of time of death
certification on file.

b. This is not relevant to this file but do we know which body Mr. Fox
(Page 27-28) carried across field.

c. See above re   Dr. Curpen's name.


 No. 63. Richard Jones.

a. Summary. Para. 13. As we may not be using the photographs I think
it would be better if this para was changed. Please consider deleting
" Photograph Reference DEI/6 is produced." and inserting "including
photograph reference DEI/6" after the words "Three photographs".

b. Summary. Para 14. I wonder if it would be better to use the word
"mistaken" for the word "wrong".

c. Was a statement obtained from              (page 7) and if so who
are the three friends who he says lost tneir lives? (page 8).

d. I am a little confused by Phot NA63 as this seems to carry a legend
to the effect that the clothes belong to another body No 88.


 No 66.   Thomas Steven Fox.

a. Summary Para. 14. Please amend by deleting " Photograph reference
TH/1 " and inserting "including "Photograph reference TH/l" after
word "photographs" .

b. Please check the original of Mr. Pleavin statement re order of
Christian names which differs from the order given by mother and the
order in the identifications.

c. P. 17. Mr. Webster refers to 93 bodies. I thought there were 94.

d. I assume that we do not know to which policeman Mrs. Fox identified
her son (p.62).

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in my letter of same date but under reference H/comments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.


 No. 30. Alan Johnston.

a. There seems to be some confusion as to the spelling of he surname.
David Bower (page 35-36) spells it as Johnston e^ as does George Hugh
Johnstone (page 45) and Prof Usher (page 48). On the other hand Mr.
                    bnd the officers spell it with out an "E” . I have
also a record irom another brother                      taho spells it
           I I tM I
without an E

I think that we should leave the summary as it is but can we obtain a
copy of the birth certificate to verify the spelling please.

 No 35. Christine Anne Jones.

a. Mr. Jones (p. 2) seems to say that he found his wife on the pitch
and this seems to be confirmed by Lillyan Akred (pi7) . On the other
hand Mr.        ](p 9 ) indicates that the husband was with him in the
terraces. Do you think that it would be possible to clarify this ?

b. It is rather unclear from Lillyan Akred’s statement whether she
says that she recovered the body from Pen 3 or Pen 4. Does Plan LAI
help and if so could it be placed with the file.

 No 52 Simon Bell.

a. Video reference (p3) differs from schedule.

b. I think the plan referred to on page 13 would be helpful.

c. Page 45 Unfortunately th name stated on the schedule of Dr. Forrest
is that of the indentifier. Can we look into where the error occurred
and obtain any necessary supplemental statements if possible.
H/files   22 March 1990   cont. Page 2

 No 57. Martin Kevin Traynor

a.   Just Dr Curpen's name on the second statement.


 No 58. Paul Clark.

a.   I think it might be best to         include the visual evidence mentioned
on   page 13. As this is outside         the ground and not confirmed I think
we   can let the summary para 10         stand.

b. Also Dr. Curpen as before.

c. I notice that Dr. Curpen (Cyrpen) has spelt Paul's surname with an
"E". Can we please verify the original statement regarding this. I do
not"think it warrants a further statement unless we also need one
because of the D r 's name.

Dear Stan,

 Further to our meeting on 13th March at my home in Nottingham
 I am writing to inform you that as soon as it possible to do
 so the following summaries (together with the front page summary)
 may be released to the respective solicitors and Mr.

 sorting out in respect of statements or plans etc but I do not think
 that these affect the release of the summaries.

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in my letter of same date but under reference H/comments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.


 No. 37 Ian Thomas Glover.


a. Mr. Fojut original statement required.

b. Page 17. Spelling of name of deceased seems incorrect. Please check
original statement.

c. Page 24. Please include                                               statement for
completeness.


 No. 46 Carl Brown.

a. Page 12. I think it wold be better if we had a copy of this
photograph with suitable reference on the file.

b. Page 36 and 42. Identification of pathologist incorrect but ?
statement S1280AR which might deal with this.




 No. 47 David William Birtle.

a. Page 8 This witness S. Thompson in this statement refers to "mouth
to mouth resucitation" previously referred to. I cannot find a
reference to this in the statement pages 4-7. Is there another
statement of this man?

b. Pathologist continuity. ? is it in statment S1280AS.

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have "other comments" but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


 No. 26 Francis Joseph McAllister.

a. Facing Sheet and Para. 7 of Summary. Time of certification not
specified in statement. If no other evidence suggest follow Dr.
Redgrave wording (page 17).

b. This case seems to be linked with Case 45 (Nicholas Peter Joynes).
I note that in file 45 Mr. Roy Williams states that he identified Mr.
McAllister and also says that he sat in the stands with Mr. Guy who in
his statement does not even refer to him. I do not think that any
amendments need to be made regarding this at this stage other than to
remember the connection.

 No 45 Nicholas Peter Joynes.

a. Summary Para. 1. Please delete "(Nicholas Joynes took about three
cans of lager with him.)"
b. Summary Para 2. Please delete last sentence begining "NICHOLAS
JOYNES had three of four pints of lager to drink whilst at the
Sportsman Public House."

c. Page 29 The usual problems with continuity for the pathologist.




 No. 27 Joseph Daniel McCarthy.

a. S u m m a r y. Para 3. A very smalll point but there seems to be typing
error in the spelling of Mr. McCarthy's name.

b. Summary Para 11. Please put place the last sentence beginning " It
is believed     " in brackets.

c. I assume that on page 11 about line 8 the spelling of the name is
due to typing error rather than from original statement. I do not
think that we need retype the sheets as this can be corrected in ink
as necessary.
•   '




        d. P 24. Usu^al problem with pathologist continuity.

        e. Plan NBL1 has a wrong nmae on it. It says Joseph    Douglas
        McCarthy.




         No 25. Joseph James Clark.

        a. I think that this person's full name is as above, ie "James'' is
        ommitted from the front of the file the introductory page the facing
        sheet and summary Para 1. (Please see page 65 of statements.)




        c. On the facing sheet the address of the mother is spelt differently
        from that on page 9 of the son. Which is the correct address and
        spelling?

        d. Continuity see page 23 and 29.

        e.   Identification of deceased on the video is at different timeto
        that produce on the schedule (see page 67).

        f.   From photo FBI/do it is difficult to tell whether ?S C Bagnoli has
        anything to do with this case. If so should we not include a
        statement?




         No 32. Keith McGrath.

        a. Summary Par. 13. This may be correct but please recheck that we
        mean Gate 2 . See also page 13 . Please note that the time reference
        in the statement differs from the time reference produced as the
        exhibit.

        b. I think that photograph RDOP-32 as well as the plan referred to on
        page 23 are needed in the file.

        c. On the video/photographic schedule you refer to a recent photograph
        but this is not included. I assume that the reference has stayed in in
        error.

        d. I notice that you have not included the usual photographs of the
        deceased clothing. Is there a reason for this?




         No 40.   Peter McDonnell.

        a. Summary Para 4. I wonder whether the summarising officer would
        consider adding the words "by virtue of photographic evidence" after
        the words "It has been established". Can we also please put the last
        sentence in brackets. There is a small spelling error in the last
        sentence, "su r mised".
b. The statement of Mr. Weigold will need amendment. Perhaps this has
already been done as there is a reference in the Anna Cappa to a
statement S1280CS. (Body initially only identified by no. Also usual
problem with continuity.).

Birmingham,
B7 5DA.

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.

 No 9. James Gary Aspinall

a. Facing sheet needs time of certification amended to accord with
police officers evidence.

b.   Para 4 of summary has a tying error re time of certification

c. I am not clear whether the identification by C.A. Sterritt of the
deceased on MAP 1 at 14.53.18.20 is the one that has been discounted.
If not I think it should be included in the summary and the file.

d. The continuity of identification to Dr. Siva is incomplete.

e. Plans awaited as agreed.


 No 10. David Steven Brown.

a. The Anna Cappa refers to live identification at 1504 by A.M. Brown.
I cannot find this in the statements though there is some reference to
identification at 14.46.

b. In any event I think some reference to the live identification
should be made in the summary and the evidence included in the folder.

c. It is not clear from the statement of C.M. Fisher (p 23) whether
Mr. D.S. Brown is alive or dead at this point or perhaps better what
Mr. Fisher thought about his status.

d. Plans awaited as agreed.


 No 16.       Paul Brian Murray.

 a.  Summary . Para 5. I am not keen on the word "cursory" as to me it
has an innuendo. It does not occur in the statement and it would be
better deleted.

b.   Plans awaited.
 NO 17 Christopher Barry Devonside.

a. Summary Para 4   I think that the word "shortly" should be deleted.

b. Summary Para 4. I think that "laid down" may be more correct that
"carried from the pen".

c. The surname name in this case was originally spelt wrong. I notice
that the computer retype of the PM report spells it correctly but the
original PM report shows it as "Dev j5 nside". The family I think were
very concerned that the name on the PM report fehould be correct and I
think that a supplemental statement from Prof. Jones confirming that
he has been told what the correct spelling is and that he is prepared
to accept this should be obtained.

d. Plans awaited.




  No. 19 Tracey Elizabeth Cox

a. SPC       seems very clear that he removed deceased from Pen 4. I
think that it might be better to amend Para. 3 to make that clearer. I
assume that locating Tracey in pen 3 is based pn visual evidence but
please confirm. If that is so then S P C i s    either mistaken or she
was passed over the fence between 3 and 4.

I have no particular objection to an inference or comment being
included in the summary as long it is picked out as such either by
being in brackets or introduced with some word like "comment". This
would apply in all the body files..

b. I think that it would be better to substitute "after a time" for
the words "a few minutes" in Para 4 of the summary.

c. For the sake of completeness please let me have DC 1895 Latham
statement referred to on p 49.

d. Plans awaited in the usual way.


  No 21   Vincent Michael Fitzsimmons.

a. Facing sheet.



b. There is the usual problem of continuity with Dr. Siva. (P 77 & 79)
I think that we will have to sit down when we have gone through all
the files and review Dr. Siva in particular to decide how best to deal
with the outstanding matters.

c. Dr. Siva's PM report gives the wrong date of death (16.4.89).

d. As a general comment I notice that William Wood21-33mentions

whether these individuals have been identified so that we can compare
the PM reports with his assessment.

 NO 22 Brian Christopher Matthews

a. Para 11 of summary. Please put the comment "but this must be in
doubt       blood analysis" in brackets or otherwise identify as
comment.

b. P.J. McGuiness previous statements are not included in the file.
For completeness please let me have these.

c. Identification continuity. The pathologist was Dr. Clark not
Prof. Usher.

d. Dr. J. Clark is a Consultant Pathologist not a trainee. Can we
alter the record for this please.

e. Plans awaited in the usual way.


 NO 23 Peter Andrew Burkett

a. Summary Para 1. Could you please amend to say after "(reference
number 34)" " but initially identified as John Cross".

b. On a rather minor point I notice that PC Walton refers to a time
sequence of 15 28 54 to 15 28 56 whilst the video reference on the
schedule and still is timed at 15.28.52 ie 2 seconds earlier. Any
explanation?

c. Plans awaited.

 No 34 Jonathon Owens

a. Summary. Para 1. I think that in this para we should insert the
words "initially identified as John Cross" after the words "Jonathon
Owens". I know that para 9 seeks to deals with the error.

b. We have the usual problems with continuity with the pathologist.
Also both PC Weigold and Dr. Siva have the first name spelt wrong. We
ran discuss this later as to how to best correct it if the
pathologist is not called.

c. Pages 45-47 are duplicates of pages 42-44. Is there in fact another
statement which should be in the folder?

d. Plans are awaited in the usual way.

     Detective Superintendent S. Beechey,
     West Midlands Police,
     Nechells Green Police Station,
     Fowler Street,
     Birmingham B7 5DA.

     Dear Detective Superintendent Beechey,

     T?o« HTTXSB0R0UGH DISASTER - BODY FILES.


     As agreed with     _         I am contacting you in connection
     with any detailed amendments which I think perhaps should be
     made to the files.

     I have already mentioned to Inspector Tobe that the summaries
     are fine, my only reservation being because they are in the
     third person and do not contain quotes may give rise to perhaps
     some extra questions from solicitors. However, as the format
     has already been settled, and I believe that the majority of
     cases have already been drafted, I do not think that there is
     very much we can do about it at this stage.

      I have now managed to read through several files and would
      like to draw the following points to your attention:-

      Deceased Reference No.2. Inger Shah.

      On the summary sheet at the front of the file, I notice that                                  "") j£_aV
                                                                                                            g j f      <j ^
      the next of kin are given as                            wQnder                   ^             >




      whether we       tr>. i n this -particular case,
      in brackets                          On the summary sneex paragraph
                                                                -          ")
      4, I think it mignx pernaps ue a good idea to add a sentence        (   tJ/n
      to the effect that Gary Oyitech saw Inger Shah within the Pen       C
      after a final saSsefe and formed the impression that she was                                   J


      obviously dead (Page 24)*

      With regard to the time of death (referred to in the outlined
      summary sheet and also in the summary itself at Paragraph 8)where                                              ■
      there is a specific time of 1555 hours given, I cannot find the ^                                          r_r.7
      evidence for this as Dr. Ball merely seems to say that he       ®5*“‘^                                                  *
      certified various people between 1550 and 1650 hours.                                                     >S '

       There may be some simple explanation for this but I think
       it may be wiser to give the time bracket, unless there is evidence
       from say a police officer (as there is in one or two of the other
       cases) where a specific time is actually mentioned.
                                                                                                   cont1d

There are one or two other points in some of the statements, at
least in one of the statements which I do not find quite right,
but they are not relevant as far as these Inquests are concerned
so I will not refer to them.

Decffiged Reference No. 3. Gary Harrison.

Page 16 of the statement. The statement from Simon Weigold
seems patently incorrect as the body appears to have been identified
to him initially by number only, the full identification not having
taken place until the Sunday.

I +■>»•}nk- that this is probably just wording but it might be
better at some point to correct this.                                         O   .    }
                                                                                            vvr.»ss

Deceased Reference No.4. David George Rimmer.

In the summary Paragraph 2, I think we should specify the time                                 v-
when they entered the Pen which appears to have been at about 1438
                                                                                           Ss_C.
(see Page 10).

Deceased Reference No.81 Thomas Howard.

Page 20 of Peter Muir's statement seems to have a patent error on it.
He says that an ambulance collected the body from the temporary
mortuary at 5.25p.m. and took it to the Medico Legal Centre where
he stayed and identified it to someone as Body 81.

That I think is patently wrong in that the polaroid photographs
were not taken until well after that. The summary seems to have
got it right, but I am not quite sure how.

I am of course open to correction on any comments which I may
maifc to you. In addition, the onjy ones that are really urgent
are any typing corrections to the summary sheets as those are                               /Us
the documents which will have to be sent out.

For the next few days I will not be at the Medico-Legal Centre
                                                                                            a       a4u \£

Dear Stan,

Further to our meeting on 13th March at my home in Nottingham
I am writing to inform you that as soon as it possible to do
so the following summaries (together with the front page sui
may be released to the respective solicitors and Mr.

In some of these cases there may be outstanding matters which need
sorting out in respect of statements or plans etc but I do not think
that these affect the release of the summaries.

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in my letter of same date but under reference H/comments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.

 No 6 . Ian David Whelan

a. Plans awaited

b. Continuity of identification to pathologist needs sorting out.

  No 11.        Peter Andrew Harrison

a. I am rather confused as to whose son this lad was. See Mr.
Harrison statement in which he refers to him ashis son and as two
friends of

b. On page 12 (last paragraph)                                      seems to be saying that the
deceased was his brother                                      son

c. I am confused with regard to the identification as Mr. Harrison
initially identified the lad by the surname Frith. In the equivalent
statement of PC. Wheatley he says on page 30 that the identification
was made in the name of Harrison. In any case there does not seem to
be any statement which clarifies the identifcations.

d. Page 46 and 47. The Pm was in fact done by Dr. Clark though I
believe that the reports were signed by both Dr. Clark and Prof Usher.
However I think that the samples must have been handed over by Dr
Clark though the officer says Prof Usher. Can we sort this out.

 12. Roy Harry Hamilton

a. There is the usual problem of continuity with the pathologist but
in this case there seems to be a statement available according to the
Anna Cappa (statement 1280C0. Can we obtain this for the file please.

 14. Gary Christopher Church

a. Continuity of identification with pathologist needs sorting out.

b. No plans on file but I assume these will be available as discussed.
 15. Carl William Rimmer
                             *■
a. Plans awaited as discussed.

 20. Marian Hazel McCabe.

a. Identification continuity to pathologist. P. 68. I think that there
may be a statement no S1280.CQ which deals with this, (see Anna
Cappa).
b. Can you tell me whether the fencing was torn down in Pen 3 as well
as pen 4?

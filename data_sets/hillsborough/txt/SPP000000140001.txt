Dear Dr Slater
Kevin Williams (deceased)
I do not know if you have been contacted by Lord Justice Stuart Smith. In view of
everything that has gone before you may wish to take the opportunity to have your views
heard. If that is the case, I would be very happy to supply you with the relevant address.
In particular, I know that you have expressed reservations in earlier correspondence about
the 3.15 pm cut-off time. In discussion with Dr Popper, he has made it plain to me that the
question of the 3.15 pm cut-off did not arise until well after the interim inquests, at which
you gave evidence, had been completed. I am not quite sure if the inference made by
various people is that you were pressured into making the pathology fit the time. If so, the
apparent chronology of your giving evidence and the subsequent decision to impose a
3.15 pm cut-off may be relevant factors.
Kind Regards




C P Dorries
HM Coroner

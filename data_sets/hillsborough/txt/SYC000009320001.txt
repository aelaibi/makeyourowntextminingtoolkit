  NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                     Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                           Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.

     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                     Cause of death
     care/self-neglect1).

   b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
     of the following forms be adopted:

     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

     C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
     induced abortion.                                                     Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.                                        (...)
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.

   c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
     it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
   d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
     complete the remainder of the form.

         Dear Sirs

         Re: RESUME D INQUESTS                  19th N O V EMBE R 1990.


          If y o u are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
          of the 95 people w h o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
          on the 19th of November 1990 at 1 0 . a.m. Details of venue w i l l be n o t i f i e d m
          due course.

          I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
          evidence has already bee n taken, n or of the nature and limitations of a
          coronal in vestigation wh i c h you w i l l recollect is not a dversarial but
          inquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

          Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
          un der my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
          w i t n e s s e s w h o w i s h to give evidence. I am at present engaged m co nsid e r i n g
          this and in determi nin g w h o I w i s h to invite to attend.

          W i t h o u t prejudice in any w a y to m y rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
          to give you an opp ortunity to dr aw to my atte ntio n the names and other
          appropriate details of any w i tne ss or wi tnes ses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
          c o n side r call ing to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

           May I please ask you in c o n sid erin g w h e t h e r you w i s h to d r a w any names to my
           attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

           I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
           names for c o n s ide rati on is n o t h i n g more than that, and that the d e c i sio n as
           to w h o to call to give evidence                            is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

           I w o u l d be grateful if y o u could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
           h ea rd from you by the end of Sep tember I w i l l assume y ou have no names to
            submit

We have been asked by Mrs Traynar to make the following points, which appearto beat variance
with the Sammy which has been prepared by the West Midlands Police

1. When the deceased was removed frcm Pen 3, Mr Norman Langleyconfirms tocur client and to
his mother, that he had attempted along with a Fblice Officer to attempt to resusitate the deceased.
Our client wishes to know, whether or not Mr Langley is being called at the Inquest to give evidence.

2. Mrs E M Traynor identified the body of the deceased and not John Traynar.

3. Our client went to see the video \Mdi was prepared by The Vfest Midlands Police.

Our client does not wish to be represented by this firm at the Inquest but would prefer to be
represented by Mr Fraser of The Hillsborough Steiering Gomnitfcee.

Dear sir,

Res        CHRISTOPHER JAMBS TRAYjPOR (deceased) lfe.60.
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990 •

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,


   \
 S.L.Popper,
 H.M. Coroner.

Dear Sira,

You will be aware that■I do not normally release post mortem
reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they axe
in fact put in as evidence.

However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
and the obvious distress which delay is causing to youx clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
report of your client(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

        a.      They have to be treated s.3 provisional, and therefore
                subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                they are given or produced in evidence at the Inauest.

        b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                conselling of the deceased’s relatives or for proper
                legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
                in which solicitors may be engaged.

        c.      Subject to the';afe5Tf@, they are to be kept confidential until
                they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to youx client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of thi3 letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is 55p    per sheet (total £ l„10p )
Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

Yours faithfully,

                                     \

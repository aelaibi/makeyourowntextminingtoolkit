                I am Trevor Higgins,               years   < 1QQ245.) of 30 Boyd Road, Wath on

               Dearne, Rotherham.
              fa
                   ntil J uly 1988 (000788)          I was a Police Sergeant in the South

               Yorkshire Police stationed at Wombwell,                of Barnsley Division.

                                         Apri 1 1988 (090488)                 i 1 ed to s uper V is'e a -.

A ‘     ( { i i ^ s e r i al   of constables    performing duty at Hillsborough Football

               Stadium.           The two football teams taking part were Liverpool

               Nottingham Forest.

               The serial w'as delegated duty at the rear of the W e st                     # an d and in

                particular to control fans entering pens 3 and 4, tffiat is the centre

                pens of the stand.

               During the game and because of the amount of fans withinXpens 3 and

               4, I received i ns tr uc ts                       ,he gates to t w        entrance and

                thereafter direct fans to the two outer pens of the s t a n d .                    I cannot

                recall where the instruction came from.                Under normal        circumstances

                instruction came from a Serial              Inspector or via radio from control.

                I cannot say from which the instruction came.

               Bearing in mind the time lapse and having attended several matches at

               Hillsborough,             it is difficult to relate detail        regarding this

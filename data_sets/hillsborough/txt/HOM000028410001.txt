    Dear Mr McKee



    I was able to see your film on the Hillsborough disaster and the
    subsequent Inquiry last week in London.  I was greatly impressed with
    the work that your team has carried out.  If the finished product is
    anything like the copy that we saw, I am sure that it will be widely
    commended both for its accuracy and its sensitivity in handling an
    extremely difficult subject.

    Both I and my two colleagues were very grateful to you for letting us
    see the film and I feel sure that the representative from the DPP's
    office would make the same comments.



    Yours sincerely




    Chief Constable

    For the attention of Mr. D. M. Bownes
    -------------- :
                   -------------------- s

     Dear Sir,

     SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

    Thank ycu for your letter dated 3rd November, 1966, in respect cf the above
    Club.

     Please find below ay observations in response to outstanding matters.

     An inspection of the ground was. carried out on 17th November, 1986.       The
     comments appended below do not take into account the numbers cf persons using
     individual areas, lateral and radial gangways or units of exit widths, as
     it is assumed that from previous correspondence and documentation that the
     various working parties and committees have adequately dealt with these items.

     MEANS OF ESCAPE IN CASE OF FIRE

     North Stand

     Timber framed and clad buildings are constructed and located under the stand.

     The c-nly reference as to the acceptance is minuted in meeting dated 7.8.85
     in which one large store for bulky items was agreed on a temporary basis.

     There is also no record to indicate whether these buildings have been treated
     with fire retardant paint or solutions. Confirmation is required as to treat­
     ment of these buildings.

     Spier. Kcp

     A.    Timber framed and clad unit located on main central exit route has not
            received any approval, no approach has been made by the Club for its
            installation, this should be removed immediately.

     B.    It is understood that the gates in the pitch perimeter fencing form
            part of the emergency exits. The gates for reasons of security, fasten


                              All communications to be addressed to the Chie: Firg ^Hicsr.    DOCUMENT KO.   (j Z - O

                                                                               (5 0 t        -------------------------
     with barrel bolts secured to the gate both z z z and bottom and open in
     a sideways direction.    It is doubtful that if it were necessary to
     evacuate the stand onto the pitch in an emergency that the gates would
     open if pressure were generated by a crowd.      No record can be found
     in respect of discussion on gate fastenings.      It is recommended that
     a satisfactory security device easily openable from the pitch side should
     be found and fitted to all perimeter gates.

C.   During the inspection it was observed that several concrete steps on
      the lower terracing were in need of repair and in one case the complete
      step had erroded away.    Every endeavour should be undertaken to ensure
      that all steps are kept in a good stats cf reps

D.   The wire mesh protecting the stanchions and bracing supports from being
      climbed is ineffective.   It has been observed that patrons visiting
      the Kop can, in large numbers from the back cf the Kop, climb into the
      lower half of the roof.  The mesh should be extended to alleviate this
      situation.

E.   It’ was observed that where the terracing is above 1 m higher than the
      lateral gangways wire mesh infill had not been lccated along the full
      lengths.   Where the mesh had been provided this had been spot welded
      but the mesh had not been given an additional vertical support.

F.   Exit gates should be unlocked and keys held by stewards manning             the
      gate before patrons enter the stands.

West Stand

A.   Timber framed and clad units located ur.cer ttis stand have been there
     for seme considerable time. No record exists cf:-

      (1)    acceptance cf these units or,

      (2)    that they have been treated with fire retardant paint or solutions.

B.   Exit gates to the pitch perimeter as item B under Scion Kop above.

South Stand

The accommodation is divided into four areas

A.   Ground floor offi'ces,     directors   suite,   players area,   function suite,
      kitchen etc. •

B.   First floor, upper stand walkway,       press lour.re, players lounge, paint
      stores, disused bar area.

C.   Lower stand, uncovered stand seating.

D.   Rear stand, covered seating.

With respect to the four areas, the following observations are made:-

A.   Ground Floor:-

            (i)   During normal working hours nest cc:rs from the office area
                  are kept locked shut.   All doers narked     'Fire Exit1 should
                  be mace readily available for use by ar.y person within the area.
  (ii)      A number of rooms at this level i.e. kitchen, laundry, stores
            and directors' suite ventilate via openable windows and/or extract
            fans into the long corridor between areas A and C above.       It
            also appears that a number of the openable windows are protected
        ✓   by corrugated," lightweight plastic sheeting.

            The separation between the corridor and such ground floor areas
            should be to a minimum half hour fire resistance, any ventilation
            requirements being met by ducting to outside on the South Wall.

 (iii)      All storage should be removed from stairway enclosures and th«se
            areas always maintained -free-from such storage.

First Floor:-

   (i)      Again, a number of rooms i.e. players' lounge, press lounge,
            the store room previously used as a licensed bar and the paint
            store ventilate into this area.     Any ventilation requirements
            should be met by ducting to outside on the South wall.

  (ii)      Valves should be fitted to the gas supply line to each of the
            five refreshment positions in order that the supply can be cut
            off should an emergency arise.

 (iii)      All timber construction within this     area   should   be   suitably
            treated so as to be flame retardant.

  (iv)      The paint stores contain a quantity of flammable paints and
            mixtures and present a hazard which it is considered should
            be removed from this area.     Proposals to relocate the stores
            should be discussed with the Fire Authority before any worit
            is commenced in order that suitable siting and any need for
            licensing under Petroleum legislation can be ascertained.

   (v)      The timber constructed cupboard and the portable sales kiosks
            should be removed from this area.

  (vi)      In the cleaners' cupboard to this area, the fire resisting
            separation between the .ground and first floor levels is breached
            by the passage of cables through a wall.    The area around the
             cables should be infilled with material to ensure a minimum
    '       fire resistance of thirty minutes.

 (vii)      All rooms onto the upper stand walkway should be separated from
            it by minimum half hour fire resisting construction, any doors
            being to the same standard and made self closing onto 2? mm
            rebates.

(viii)      Spaces above toilet accommodation are being used for storage
            purposes. Again, these areas must be maintained clear of storage.

Uncovered Seating Area:-

The means of escape from this area is along the corridor in front of
the rear part of the stand. Should this route not be available then
evacuation onto the pitch is possible subject to persons having --the
ability to climb over the front wall on to the pitch perimeter track.
This wall is approximately 1.5 m high at the Spion Kop end decreasing
to 1 j high at the West end.
      To facilitate easier forward evacuation on to the pitch it is recommended
      that openings be provided in the wall at the foot of radial gangways.

D.    Covered Seating Area (Rear Stand)

      The means of escape from this area is not considered to be satisfactory
      in that escape is possible in one direction only, this being down through
      areas described in A and.3 above.

        Subject to all the recocmer.dations outlined in A and B above and made
        later in respect of automatic fire detection being implemented, the
     .. fufians ol*.escape from the ciTsreci ieatin^ area would be acccntabio.

AUTOMATIC FIRE DETECTION

In 1979 the working party discussed the provision of automatic fire detection
in the South Stand.

It is recommended that such prevision should be made in all areas beneath
the seated area of the stand as soon as possible.    The system should also
cover the Tavern Club which has = direct link on to the first floor corridor
of the South Stand.

The automatic detection provided should be tied in to the existing fire warning
system.

In order that persons using the Spicn Kop can receive early warning of any
fire occurring in the "Stands” Club, it is also recommended that automatic
fire detection be provided in tha- Club.

EMERGENCY LIGHTING

Soion Kcc

The emergency lighting has yet       be tested - no test certificate received.

South. North and West Stands

In letter dated 12th November, 198Q0 from Eastwood and Partners, it was
suggested that following test certificates dated llth August, 1980, a peri.od
of 5 years should elapse before re-testing for South Stand and 2 years Tor
North and West Stands. .As of today no record appears to exist as to whether
these areas have been re-testec or that the test certificates together with
maintenance records have ever been re-presented.      The emergency lighting
system should therefore be re-tssted for the whole of the ground and test
certificates produced.   In addition the whole of the system should confom
to B.S. 5266.

FIRE ALARM

West Stand

Existing call points to be relrcated to accessible positions outside of
franchise areas and be increased tc cover the upper areas of the stand-

North Stand

As West Stand above.       ■«
       South Stand

       This stand appears to be well covered with regard to the provision and siting
       of call points.

       Indicator Control Panel

       The indicator/control panel is situated within the Police control centre
       between South and West Stand.    Whilst this is reasonable for match cays it
       is not considered to be practical for the majority of the time.

       This panel should be duplicated with control at each location which should
       be: -

       1.      Police control box

       2.      .Main office reception area

^ .    FIRST AID AND FIRE-FIGHTING EQUIPMENT

       The current standard and displacement of First Aid fire-fighting ectipnent
       is considered satisfactory.

       GATES

        The sliding gates already in situ in the ground have been accepted by- this
        Authority after due consideration and account being taken both of their location
        and the fact that they are of existing construction.      I would wish, ho-wever,
        to point out that it is the view of this Authority that doors required for
        means of escape should open outwards and it is recommended that notice be
        given to the Club to the effect that when any such sliding gates are ic be
        replaced then their replacements must open outwards even if this involves
        structural work to recess the opening tc avoid impinging over footpaths.
        W.iile' the sliding gates remain in use however, they must be immediately avail-
  «                 use from the insice by any person should an emergency situation
r' .   "arise. _^Any method of securing the gates against illegal entry from the cuts ids
i      must be by way of a simply operated device not requiring the use        of a key,
' 4    additional security being afforded by the presence of a steward who should
        be familiar with the emergency evacuation procedures for the ground.

       If there are any queries on these matters please do not hesitate to ccntsct
       the Officer concerned.

       Yours faithfully.

                                       Anti-HocliganIsm Measures

     Further to the Divisional Meetings on 29th January, 1937, and a further
 meeting with the Government officials on Monday, 23rd February, I can new
 inform you that the Government Ministers, Mr Richard Tracey and the Hen.
 Douglas Hogg have endorsed the proposals embodied in the League's ccntrehensive
 Report cf November i9So - save that tr.ev required specific action tc be taken
 by the Clubs on-the subject cf Membership Sche~.es.

     This action is alcr.g the lines cer=iiec tc Cl^                                                        :r.e
 January, and is as follows:-

        1)        All Clubs are asked to develop and introduce membership scr.c~.es
                   for specific designated areas of their grounds by the beginning
                   of the 1987/88 season. These areas should be reserved for
                   members only. Nor.-members would net be admitted. The schemes
                   should cover at least z>0% of each ground’s capacity as determined
                   by the conditions of the ground's safety certificate. Clubs which
                   cannot attain 505 should identify the percentage they can meet.
                   Advice may be obtained from Andy Williamsin re points of detail.
                                               +
        2)        Clubs who feel that they are unable to meet the requirements for
                   505 Membership Schemes will be able to make representations to
                   a Special Committee consisting of representatives from the League,.
                   The Football Trust and independent advisers. If, after discussion,
                   it is agreed by the Special Committee, the club and the local
                   Folice that they are unable to meet the ; 15 requirement, then the
                   Club will be expected to shew that they are taking adequate
                   alternative measures. Should this be the case, their position will
                   be accepted by the Government.   If the Club is not able to convince
                   the Committee, they may become liable to a charge under F.A.
                   procedures for failing to implement the recommendations on
                   Membership.

                                                                                                                     /Conte.2

    Whilst appreciating that the principle cf membership schemes is a complex
matter, there is a requirement for all Clubs to respond quickly sc that
designated areas are identified'in ti=e for sale of season tickets, etc., for
next season.

    In addition to the above, the following points were also agreed between
the League and the Government:-

           All Clubs are required to submit detailed local plans.ftr dealing
           with the management and control of home and away supporters as per
           the attached document. These plans must be produced as soon as
           possible and they must be crawn up in consultation with the local
           police, local British Transport Police, the local~auth:rity and
           other relevant organisations such as local coach operattrs and
           recognised supporters clubs. These plans will be available to the
           F.A. in the event of a disciplinary commission.

           The League, the Football Association and the clubs, with advice
           from the local Police, will consider the need for all ticket
           arrangements at particular rr.azcr.es.

    c)     The League will commission a study by independent consultants to
           report-on the scope, costs and benefits/disadvantages cf a
           reciprocal membership sche-e embracing all 92 League Cl-bs. The
           Association of Chief Police Officers have agreed to assist with the
           acvice on this stuoy.

           Football Trust grants will be made available to Division Three ar.d
           Four Clubs for the installation cf closed circuit television
           depending on the particular r.eecs of individual clubs. Clubs who
           have not yet applied should review their requirements.

    e)     The League and the Football Association will support ar.d promote the
           development cf family enclosures ar.d other initiatives designed to
           establish closer links between clubs and their communities.



    The Management Committee need ycur urgent co-operation in order tc be able
to report back to the Government at the earliest opportunity.

Dear Graham,
                  Football League Proposals for
                    Anti-Hooliganism Measures
      Thank you for your letter of 10 March enclosing the
papers received from the Football League.      As requested I
have pleasure in letting you have our comments.
      Dealing first with the areas which have to be designated
as being for the exclusive use of members of a scheme.
I suggest that you would designate the South stand and the Kop
between them, these cater      for around 30,000 spectators,
which is comfortably in     excess of the   50% requirement.
      You would then beable to admit    those local supporters
who are not members to either the seating in the North stand
or to the standing accommodation at the North West corner.       Thus
the membership scheme is not likely to place any real restriction
on seated spectators but it could    be that for a handful of the
most important games in     a season# the   number of places forstanding
spectators who are not members will be inadequate.      The North West
corner of the Kop only holds 2,900 people and I would be fairly
confident that more ■casuals" than that will want to be in
standing accommodation for a few games each year.       However it
may not be too damaging if there is a shorta'
standing places in that there will generally be seating
accommodation for them in the North stand if they are prepared
to pay the extra money.
      Turning now to the various items in the document headed
"Local Plans".   I think you will seed help from us on the
following items >-'


1.    Ground Plan
      We will prepare the necessary drawings and details and
      you will provide a copy of the safety certificate.


2.    Stadium Operation
      It may be that you can deal with the whole of this item
      but we will provide a plan showing the location of
      turnstiles and if you so wish,a description of the
      counting system.


5.    Segregation
      We will provide the necessary drawings showing the way
      in which fans are segregated at the Leppings Lane end
      with the access routes clearly marked both inside and
      outside the ground.


8.    Security of Players and      Match Officials
      We will mark on the plans which we are p r o v i d i n g # the
      locations of car     and coach parks for players and match
      officials.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
received them as yet.

The Police have indicated that they are quite satisfied with :he stadiua and
have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they receive is very
satisfactory.

The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. I think the letter
is largely self-explanatory but I would particularly like to refer to the
comments which are made in respect of final exit gates. As you can see from the
letter the Fire Service are csr.cerr.ed about tfc* sliding gates and have Indicated
that as and when they reach the end of their useful life they must be replaced
with outward opening doors. The Fire Service have also produced a drawing (a
copy of which I enclose) to show a better arrangement for securing the sliding
gates against forced entry from the outside during the course of the game. The
Fire Service feel that this hook type arrangement will be more easily used in
the event of an emergency than the current locks, about which they are very
concerned

Would you please let" me have your comments on the Fire Service letter as soon as
possible.                                         ,

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sport* Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

 la November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to consent oo the
 condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 197S Act. 1
 have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar c o u e n t i but I have not
 received thea as yet*

 The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
 vlth the stadlua and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
 receive Is very satisfactory.

 The Fire Service have, however, made a number of cowments and I attach for your
 information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February.  Some points In the
 letter have now been further clarified a* follows:-

 (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
 from the walkways*

 (b) As far as the locked doors In the south stand are concerned they will be
 dealt vlth by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

 (c) Gates most be unlocked and stewarded at all tlaes, during Batches: If this
 cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be Insisted upon.

 I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
 particularly like to refer to the consents which are made la respect of final
 exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
 the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
 their useful life the? must be replaced with cutvard opening doors. The Fire
 Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
 better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
 outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
 type arrangement will be more easily used in the errent of an emergency than the
 current locks, about which they are very concerned.

poaalble.

Your* faithfully,

One again I am writing to you all to thank you for your assistance during the
past season, in particular all those who made the semi-final the success it
was.

Ihe season has not gone by without any "casualties" - persons dismissed for
various reasons - and Club policy for next season will continue to be strictly
upheld.

It is intended to make a few alterations with regards to various aspects of
the ground and to fully explain them and to do the usual briefing of match day
staff, the following nights have been arranged:-

Gatemen                         )
TUrnstile operators             )             6th August at 7.30 p.m.
Commissionaires                 )
"sundry area" stewards          )
                                and

All other Stewards                            13th August at 7.30 p.m

As before the briefing will be followed by a pie and pea supper and we would
like everyone to attend.

The stewards/gatemen passes for next season will be the same as last year but,
in addition, everyone will be issued with a security badge with a photo, which
must be worn at all times when on duty. An extra 50p is being paid to
everyone at next Saturday’s game - would you please bring 2 photo’s (from a
photo booth) with you to the briefing meeting.

For Che attention of D. 0. Grimshav


Dear Sir,

Safety of Spores Grounds Act 1975 -
Future Administration of the Council’s Certificating Function

Following a meeting on Tuesday lQth March I have given some further thought to
the above subject.

Many points were raised at the meeting but I think that the general feeling vas
that the roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

I have no objection in principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
make it clear that if it is agreed that particular Authorities adopt particular
roles then they will be under a duty to consult with other interested parties
where there is an overlap of interest. As I see it the Authority which carries
out a particular role will have the responsibility of advising the Council as
Certificating Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to define Lead Authority roles.
I should point out that the draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
would therefore welcome your comments on it. Would you please also let ice know
if there are any other matters which should be included in the Schedule.

Moving onto the question of inspections of stadia, this point was also'discussad
at the meeting on 10th March. My view is that the existing system of bi annual
limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel that one major inspection
per year should be carried out on each stadium which should include all the
areas and installations within the scope of the legislation. To back up this
inspection there should be a number of "during performance" inspections by
Officers. I think that there is general agreement in relation to "during
performance" inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.
                                                           Cont...

                                                                                          734690 - Mr. 3cvnes

                                                       Ttlex 54243 (Administration & Ligii)
                                                L-f-C O




                                        -2-

Perhaps "during performance" inspections could be arranged so ChaC each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree cx central
co-ordination Co prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
first step towards the development of a programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives free
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
encountered. ^

Mn--f.ncr on to the "vorkinsr .narcv" structure I. think it is clear from the meeting
of 10th March disc some clarification of its status is required, it is
reasonably clear from the County Council's records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
powers. Eowever, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with .
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority. This list will be circulated as well.

Would you please consider the points I. have raised *nd let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

Tours faithfully,




Read of Department

   For th e a t t a r t i c n o f " r . D. Bo:;r.ss


  Dear Sire,

  Xn. reply to your latter datad 1**>^li May, 1987 regarding tha "Future Administration
  of tho Ccunail's Certificating Function" under ths Safety of Snorts Grounds Act
  1975 r placac fir.i talc* tha observations of this Departaent.

   1.   With respect tc the schedule detailing a proposed division of responsibilities
        betrrscr. authorities it is fclU that this’ chouid ranain along tha lines, cf
        ths dccuncnt iaar.ad *   j” the previous certificating authority i.e. South Yorkshire
        County Council, a copy cf which is attached. Aa this document has steed the
        teat of tin a ;rit:i fc:.> pro’
                                      oloas, it is raccanand-ad that a ceetinj; of all author­
        ities cancamcd ca called aa sac:: as possible in order tc discuss the division
        of responsibilities it lays devm.

        l.liatcvsr th:- outcc.ao or 2 arsa ;;hera there-cay be a need for asphssis is a
        referan-zc to the fact that all ?.uthoritia3 should be aors awars cf other author­
        ities raa>*r.si*cilitie3 and that when considering any proposals all aspects
        of the graan suit's should be taien into account in order that full ccnsul-
        tation can. tak-3 place vith other interested authorities.

   2 . The pr'^'jjrd for one annual inspection by the working               group in conjunction
       with individual inspections by authorities as and whan               considered necessary
       is agreed with slthcujh it is envisaged that because                of n m p w e r resource
       linitaticr.s the derrvse of cantral cc-ordination referred          to nay causa probleris.

        The Fire Av.ihcrity :-:ould wish to carry out such inspections rub jset to the
        liaitatiens referred to above and under varying conditions at the ground.
        Obviously an;/ adverse concacnts on crowd safety vculd ba forwarded- to your
        Department.    Aa tc tha annual inspection, a good tina vould be at the er.d
        cr towards tha end cf a season in order that any necessary work can be fcllovrei
        up before: tha car.aan.a^r.or.t cf a new season.

   3.   Whilst tha situation regarding the status of working group is fully appreciated,
        this authority feels that the recognition of the group as a decision naiing
        fcodv by the City Council is imperative if it is to rc.uain effective. As under
        the'County Council however, tha terns of reference of the group would *00 within
        the conditions of certification laid down by the City Council, anything beycr.d
        thesa :err.s boir.G referred back via your Dcpartnar.'c for a Ccrujittoe decision.

                                                                            *A         Con -. ... -

       Metropolitan District



          4   The procedure outlined for cslling additional meetings of the working grcup
              is agreed with although it is considered essential that full ninutes cf all
              meetings ore produced and circulated and in particular ahculd maic-direct
              reference to outstanding matters frcm previous meetings in order that these
              are not 'lest* in the minutes.

          In addition to the above-matters it would be appreciated ‘if both Steffield United
          and Sheffield Wednesday Football Clubs were contacted in order to discuss the
          .             fcr.r.iir?.?    v-f.th in corresoondence between 'C' Division Headquarters
          and your D*n»r‘ 2 2 ent dated Sta December, i^od in respect ex oaen'iexa wiuj.>.eu m.U
          18th rebru^r/, 1937 in respect cf Sheffield Wednesday.

          If tl’
               .2 ~c are any queries on the above matters, please do not hesitate to contact
          the Officer concerned.

Mr. Eerfr.es opened the meeting and stared that‘the discussions would be divided
into- four areas:-

1.   Definition of Rolls
2.   Inspections
3.   Status of Group
k.   ac— ~a. Ha.cuxr.ery ox" cae Group


1.   It was agreed that rolls should be broadly defined and responsibilities
     taken on by the appropriate of the three "lead authorities" i.e. Police,
     Fire and Building Surveyors subject to agreement where overlap occurs.

     A1 contact with the grounds should be through the licensing authority.

     Environmental Health would take a "general safety roll" and not be a
     "lead" authority.

2.   The annual inspection is to be a Joint full inspection to be carried
     oi*t ru*cr     of* each .«».*cr,n.  • ••— ‘ ' .    t- f

     U.P. inspections to be done on an individual basis. Prior arrangeaer.ts
     to be made with the Police, but not the Club. The Licensing Authority
     to be informed when an inspection has taken place.

3-   The meeting was inforaed that legally the group is essentially an advisory
     authority - only the council can be the ultimate decision making authority.

4.   Individual authorities to correspond to the spnrts grounds through the
     licensing authority who will subsequently circulate copies of all letters
     to each "lead" authority.

     Meetings of the group will be held at irregular intervals depending
     on need and can be called by any member of the group.       Individual
     authorities need not attend specific meetings if they have no "interest".

     Agendas will be issued prior to each meeting.

            MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING

            The minutes of the Eeeting held on 6 August 1986 which had been previously
            circulated were accepted as a true and accurate record.

            MATTERS ARISING FROM. THE MINUTES

            a    Close Circuit Television
    &       3
i           •    The Chairman invited comment from the members as to the success or
/ .              otherwise of Close Circuit Television over the last season.

                 Chief Superintendent Lodge said that the equipment at Barnsley had proved a
                 success and a number of excellent arrests had resulted from it.

                 He continued by saying the equipment had also proved invaluable for
                 intelligence gathering.

                 A short discussion took place and it was generally agreed that the
                 installation of Close Circuit Televisions at football grounds within South
                 Yorkshire had been a success.

                 Item discharged.

            b    Conduct of Players and Officials

                 Mr Jackscr. referred to item 3 on the previous minutes and said that in
                 general the conduct of players and officials vas good and every
                 encourage-sr.t should be given for this to continue.
     Members of the meeting agreed with the consents cade by the Chairman.

     Item discharged.

c    Supply of Alcohol

     Club representatives queried the need for control of sale of alcohol in the
     grounds and said that it created a tendency to drink outside the ground and
     supporters arrived not too long before the catch started.

     Mr Jackson said there was plenty of evidence by way of practical experience
     and research that alcohol was a motivating factor in the commission cf
     offences and a causation of hooliganism. He said that prior to the
     legislation he had policed a first division ground and the fans arrived not
     long before the game started having been drinking elsewhere. Ke said it
     was the topping up of alcohol inside the ground that could cause problems.

     He had noticed a tendency, however, for problems to develop away from the
     grounds and that he was a member of the National Working Party who would be
     considering all such matters to try in co-operation with clubs and everyone
     else with a vested interested, to resolve the issues. In the meantime,
     clubs and the police should continue their efforts to fight hooligar.isa and
     make their views known as certainly had been done so in the past.

EMERGENCY EVACUATION AND STEWARDING

The Chairman referred to documentation previously circulated outlining notes of
guidance for Stewardir.g and Emergency Evacuation Procedures. He stressed the
need to ensure that there was appropriate briefing by the clubs and the
appointment of fit and responsible persons. For our part, we would assist and
give advice.

It was agreed by everyone that we should continue to ensure that public safety
was paramount and that the high standard of awareness would continue.

Item discharged


EXCLUSION ORDERS

The Chairman circulated guidance and said that from 1 August 1S87 persons
arrested at football grounds having committed certain types of offences would be
subject to Exclusion Orders.

Mr Jackson briefly outlined the procedure to obtain Exclusion Orders and its
effect on police and football clubs.




                                  X
V        A LL   TICKET E T C H E S   -   FANS A R R I V I N G   AT MATCHES V IT H O U T T I C K E T S


         Chief Superintendent Lodge said that their first match of the season was Leeds
         United v Barnsley and although it was an all ticket match a substantial amount
         of supporters vould attend without tickets.

         He continued by saying that this could create policing problems and there had
         been suggestions that supporters could be allowed entry to the ground but this
         vould defeat the object of all ticket matches.

         Chief Superintendent Eroorahead said that this created two police operations one
         inside the ground and another outside and by allowing persons into the ground
         vithout tickets, would lose the credibility of all ticket matches and cause
         general problems for others.

         Mr Broom'r.ead continued by saying that it was general policy to publish in the
         local press and the programmes that persons attending vithout tickets vould be
         turned away.

         Kr Jackson agreed vith the general view of the members that persons vithout
         tickets should not be allowed entry or otherwise we would never stop non-ticket
         holders c:~ir.g thus aggravating future policing operations.


         MEMBERSHIP SCHEMES

         The Chairman said that this vas a government initiative aimed at lessening
         hooliganism at grounds.

         He noted that clubs in South Yorkshire had not gone for a scheme which i n d u c e d
         photographs and said it was generally felt that photographs should have been
         included :n the cards.

    0. Mr Spinks, Secretary of 3arnsley Football Club said that to date, they had not
0    , agreed on a Membership Scheme as the Football League Working Party had rejected
       their Scheme on a technicality and proposed an amended Scheme.

         He continued by saying that the amended scheme vas unacceptable in relation to
         the segregation of members and non members and therefore vas rejected by the
         club.

         Mr Spinks said that they intended resubmitting proposals tack to the Football
         League Working Party and welcomed any comment the police wished to make and
         indeed invited officers to attend the ground to facilitate those actions.

         The Chairman said that Barnsley Football Club should try and resolve the
         situation with the Football League Working Party and as it vas their
         responsibility to consider them and monitor them, but there vas no doubt the
         police vcvld be asked to comment to assist the future evaluations.
                                         - 4 _




    Representatives from Barnsley Football Club said they would rather have no
    scheme than accept proposals that were not constructive and workable. The
    Chairman said that future developments and evaluations would hopefully determine
    the use of such schemes.

    Item deferred.

    POLICE ROOM AT OAKWELL GROUND - UP DATS

    Chief Superintendent Lodge said that the new police control room at Oakweli
    Football Ground would be an asset to all concerned.

^   He thanked the representatives of Barnsley Football Club for their help and said
    that the new control room would assist in better policing especially inside the
    ground, ie: camera sightings, personnel address system and possible evacuation
    procedures.

    The Chairman agreed and thanked everyone concerned.

    Item discharged.

    POLICING ARRANGEMENTS 1987/88

    The Chairman said that in addition to comments made earlier under Policing
    Arrangements 1986/87, we should continue to work together and any problems
    encountered by football clubs within the area should be discussed with the
    appropriate commander.

    Mr Jackson said that 'football is a national sport to be enjoyed by families and
    we should strive to stamp out hooliganism in whatever form.

^   Item discharged.

    There being no further business the meeting closed at 12.25 pm.

Dear Sir

SAFETY O F SPORTS GJCUtCS A T T 1975 -
DRAFT REVISED SAFETJY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

I refer t o ycur letter of 7 July 1987 end the new draft certificate and
would ccrtrsnt as follows:-

 1    I assure that no schedules are included as they are not as yet
      * Ground specific'.
              \
 2   • In Section 1 a form of vcrds should be found which puts the role
       of the senior police officer in charge in the stadium ana the role
       of the safety officer in context. The safery officer would oe in
       charge of t±fi holder's erployees but not police deoloymp.nt a H b o u g h
       his vaaws wculd fce sought.

 3    I suggest that consideration should be given to including in the
      safety certificate at paragraph 4 s                           _

      ’The holder shall notify the Chief Constable of scecified
      activity at least 23 days before such sn activity t£&as place
      (or such shorter time as the Chief Constable nay recylre).'

 4    You r a y also wish to consider including the following in the
      safety certificate:

      'In the event of a fixture being arranged as a result of a draw in
      a football/ru^by league or FA Cup ccrpetition, which would indicate
      the attendance of a club from a higher division, who b y the nature
      of the club or by local interest would attract a crowd well in excess
      of the current ground capacity, or the forward information is such
      that a public order situation may arise, then in consultation with

v   6    Under Section 10 (erergancy procedures) of the Safety at Sports
         Crounds Act 1975, a local authority is enpcvicred, if it considers
         that dua to any deficiency in safety procedures at a designated
         spcrts crcur.d, to taJoe certain steps to minimise the risk to
         spectators. Tbs local authority nary apply to the courts for an
         order prohibiting or restricting admission to the whole or arjy part
         cf the groirn until s u c h steps have been taJcen to r<?<tucc the risk

               range of stewards should be 18 - 65.

Section 10(a) Whilst specified in the green guide, it is difficult to
              inagine hov this task can be controlled by stewards. Thi3
              natter should be considered‘further.

Section 10(i) Reference should be made to the opening and securing open
              of exits on the intiation of any emergency procedure or
              at the end of a game and to assisting and directing spectators
              out of the exits.

Section 18     Add . . . "The emergency power supply should operate independ­
               ently of the main power supply     and cooe into automatic
               operation on the failure of the     latter and be capable of
               maintaining the necessary power output for a minimum period
               of three hours.

Section 23     Reference to "compressed gas or liquid" should be amended
               to . . . "flammable liquid or compressed gas (except fire
               extinguishing apparatus)".

Section 24     Add after "whatsoever"   "whether combustible or not”.

Section 28     The old SYCC certificate required that the Police had knowledge
               of the whereabouts of the doctor.

Section 29     Again the old SYCC certificate required that members          of
               the press, T.V. and radio were identifiable.
Section 35(d) This requires that the electrical installation be examined
              and a report submitted to the Council every 12 months.
              The same requirement should also apply to emergency lighting,
              and fire warning (including P.A.) systems.

Section 35(f) Sub paragraph (iii) requires emergency lighting to be tested
              at least 24 hours prior to an activity. It would be preferable
              that the original requirement of tasting 3 hours before
              an activity be maintained.

Two additional items for consideration are:-

 (i)   That acompetent electrician employed      or retained by the Holder
       3hall be present during a specified activity.

(ii) The Holder shall provide and maintain within the stadium to the
      satisfaction of the Council the access routes for emergency vehicles
      shown on the plans.

SCHEDULE - Interpretation

Whereas the old SYCC Certificate required certain matters (e.g. fire alarss,
extinguishers etc.) and the maintenance of these to be to the satisfaction
of the Chief Fire Officer, the proposed Certificate now requires these
to be to satisfaction of the City Council.

This Department doe3 not foresee this causing any problems subject to
copies of the required annual certificates of test being forwarded to
us for examination.....

If there are ar.y queries on the above matters, please contact Divisional
Officer Grinshaw.

Also enclosed for your information is a list of sports grounds and indccr
sports premises within Sheffield and known to this Department.

Yours faithfully,




 Chief Fire Officer ^ 0

             Annual Visit - Sheffield Wednesday'Football Club, Hillborough, Sheffield

             During the annual visit of the above ground, the following observations
             were noted

       1.0   KOP

       1.1 Ihe timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main means of
           escape exit route from the KOP should be removed, since it is causing both
           a high risk and a narrowing of the escape width.

       1.2 A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier adjacent to the
           tunnel exit at the north end ofthe KOP to beremoved,    andthe crush barrier
           be modified to join onto the end of the newsteelsupported barrierdirectly
           adjacent to it.

     1.3     A timber hut at ground level, under the KOP structure should be remov&d.

     1.^f An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed adjacent
          to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended terracing. This was
          agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.

     2.0     ’
             WEST STAND

     2.1     Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be permanently
             secured at the following positions

             •a)   between seats 1 and 14
              b)   between seats 20 and 28
              c)   between seats 136 and 150

             3inding wire ties are not          considered to be           satisfactory for this purpose.

             Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to       seats 62 and 72 are to be
             correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

     2.2     Hain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should have a gauze
             inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles onto the crowbelow.

     2.3     It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the suitability of
             the gate fastening device at the base of the emergency exit stairway on the
             south end o^jthis stand.    The fastening consisting of a     patent lockable
             barrel bollT,,cannot easily be unfastened in      the direction of travel, andis
             impossible to be unfastened from the other sidi.
                                                            I
     3.0     NORTE STAND

     3.1     A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced.

     3-2     The step between seats 12 and 13 on row 4-3 is loose and should be correctly
             bedded down.

      The Fire Authority's coianents, regarding the separation of the
      accotaaodation off the ground floor condrior and the terraced area in
      terss of fire resistance and ventilation is to be considered further

            THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
            SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, PENISTONE ROAD, SHEFFIELD
            SAFETY CERTIFICATION INSPECTION, 6TH AUGUST, 1987.

            I vrite with reference to Che above and following our recent sice meeting
                                       j        yfj.I-hs        £<.ttusi.il. grb'jrc   .*»
            requested, I would nov submit ay Department's findings to the "Safety of
            Sports Grounds Advisory Group" and to yourself as Certificating Officer.

            Spion Kop

            1.    An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding
                  to the side of the Kop is corroded and torn.

            2.    It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving
                  radial gangways had become defective.

            3.    At some positions within the new development there is a
                  difference in height between a terraced area and radialgangway
                  of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by
                  a suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.

            4.    Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
                  minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would
                  be adequately controlled by means of "ongoing" maintenance.

            5.    The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires
                  to be repaired.

            North Stand

   -        1.    It is important to ensure that the groundman's store beneath
   ]              this stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
                  fertilisers or weedkillers.

            Health and Safety - General

            1.    At a number of points within the standium various pieces of
                  abandoned builders waste were readily available for use as
                  projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected
                  and suitably disposed of.

            2.    The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
                  first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
                  become ill or injured within the sports ground.

             3.   In order to ensure that the football club fully discharge their
                  duty to supply an adequate number of first aiders, I would require
                  that a minimum of 12 be employed to render first aid to sepctators
                  during an activity. If the club continue to use the voluntary
                  services of the St. John's Ambulance Brigade, then it would be
                  necessary to formalise their relationship with them in order to
                  ensure adequate deployment.
4.   I am to understand that the club is now prepared to appoint,
     in writing, a safety officer of adequate status and authority.
     I would propose that he has the functions described in the draft
     safety certificate conditions.

Conclusions

During the inspection of the football club's standium it became obvious
that the stands and associated areas are subject to excellent standards of
maintenance and upkeep.   Bearing in mind the size of the premises the
♦ifcov.’.-                                        •>.•••»*> 1 •.**$ •;r \ V
impressed with the level of ground management being maintained.

I would advise that the identity and role of the Ground Safety Officer be
formalised in accordance with the green guide and without undue delay.

SAFETY OF   SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - THE CURRENT SITUATION AND PROPOSALS FOR THE
FUTURE ADMINISTRATION OF THE COUNCIL'S CERTIFICATION FUNCTION

Introduction

The Panel will recall that on 1st April 1986 the City Council inherited frca the
South Yorkshire County Council the role of certificating Authority under the
1975 Act.    The Act itself is basically aimed at ensuring adequate standards of
safety at   designated stadia; there are three of these in Sheffield at tie coment
- Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield United Football. Club., and the
Ovlerton Sports Stadium. A detailed report on the Act and its application in
Sheffield was submitted to the Panel on 6th Hay 1986.

The Current Situation

The Panel at its nesting in Kay 1986 identified several main areas for farther
investigation.

Firstly it vas accepted at the tine that the broad outlines of the
administrative system organised by the County Council should be continued for
the time being. This system has now been reviewed and the proposed
reorganisation is detailed later in this report.

The Panel also asked that the Health and Safety Executive be kept informed of
all oatters relating to sports ground safety and that the Association of
Metropolitan Authorities also be asked about the ESE's involvement. As far as
keeping the ESE informed of safety developments at the stadia the Zrecurive made
it fairly plain that they would not make any comments* The practice was
therefore discontinued. The involvement of the AKA. in the ES* issue has bees
somewhat forestalled by action at central Government level to review the EEZ’s
relationship with local authorities; this review vas announced is the
Government's reply to the Poppleweil Report but*no'results of that review have
yet been received. Fortunately, however, the Council's Director of Health and
Consuaer Services has permitted his Officer's to provide ahealth and sarety
input into the decision making process in relation to safety of sports groundsc 0
This substitution, therefore, temporarily covers the absence of an incur from
the ESS.

The Panel also cade reference to consultation on the safety of sports grounds
policy with the other District Councils in South Yorkshire. Unfortunately,
attempts at arranging consultation meetings have been unsuccessful to date. It
is proposed to try again to organise some consultations in the fairly near
future, perhaps when the Certification system has settled down in each area.

The drafting of-new safety certificate conditions in consultation with zhe
Council' 3 advisers has bees progressing steadily and new draft conditions are
currently under consideration by those advisers. It is hoped that the mew
conditions will be submitted to the Panel at ics meeting in October for final
approval;:;   V- -

As to the question of charging fees under the 1975 legislation, it should be
be made dear.that such fees are only payable on the grant of a Certificate.
It is anticipated that if the Panel approves the new Certificate cocditior.s a
Certificate will then be issued to Sheffield United and at that tire it is
Future Administration of the Council's Certificating Function

Following a chorough review of the legislation it has becoae d e a r that a
detailed administrative^systea needs to be established in connection' with the
Council's Certificating function. Discussions on this natter have oeea underway
for sone tine with the Police, the Fire Service, the Council’s Building
Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consuaer Services on the establishaent
of such a systea.

Accepting that the Council as the Certificating Authority will act cn the-basis
of advice froa experts (such as the Fire Service) the question arises as to how
that advicc s^y h* v*sz fcraulate'd. :J.a the -pks't* the Cmrat; Council crsauiiic! -
an Officer Working Party which was apparently used as a forua for discussion
between Officers prior to the final foraulation of advice to the Council. That
particular working party also appeared to have had soae decision asking powers.

As it is essential that meetings take place due to the potential overLa? of
requirements in many areas, all the Authorities and Officers have new agreed
that it would be appropriate to establish a revised fora of the working party Co
peri ora a siailar function for the City Council. It is reccnaended that the
"Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group" (which would consist cf
representatives frca the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's
Division and the Departaent of Eealth and Consuaer Services), would function as
a forua for discussion between Officers; its most regular use would probably be
the discussion of iteas of advice to the Council before they are finally
formulated by the appropriate Authority. Meetings of the Group would "be held at
the request of one or acre Authorities and on receipt of a request the Head of
Administration and Legal Departaent would-arrange a meeting and despatch a list
of iteaa to be discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting a furthe^list of
iteas would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be takin 'ey each
Authority would be noted. It is then anticipated^ that detailed written advics
would be provided by each discipline and be acted upoa as appropriate.

In addition the Head of -Administration and Legal Departaent will keep copies of
all relevant correspondence which will be available to all participants in the^
Group.

Coder the old County Council administrative structure the different Authorities
represented in their working party had fairly clearly defines roles within which
to operate. Although it can be seen that there is soae merit in this idea the
areas of potential overlap of responsibility are quite extensive in dealing with
sports grounds. However it appears* that the various Authorities and Officers
wish for some definition of roles and the following have been agreed:-

Authority                                         Area of Responsibility

The Building Surveyor                     All matters relating to the structure of
                                          stadia including crush barriers, walls,
             ’ »-                         etc.

South Yorkshire. County   Fire Service    Fire precautions, fire alaras, means of
                                          escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                          capacity.
It is anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Departaent vould have an
input to the Advisory Group on (a) aspects of general safety; (b) the general
safety management of stadia; (c) various special Items such as first aid
requireaents-. It will be appreciated that these areas of responsibility are not
exhaustive but it is anticipated that any areas of doubt will be dealt wittfBy"
discussions at advisory group meetings.



Moving on to a natter of core general policy it has been suggested .that one
large scale inspection per stadiua should be carried out by the Group backed up      -
by a strias of iii*i,fc.:tion-s vUi-h Hill ta k e place a^tMally tsurias-cvsucs.
This proposal is in line with both the Popplewell Report and'with licensing
practice in other areas.

Delegations

There is also a further question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
to the day to day decision asking required for the running of the Certification
Systea. At the nonent decision caking powers rest with the Panel but This, is a
highly impractical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently. It s«ens •
that as an iateris sseasure all routine natters could be delegated to Eaad cf
Administration and Legal Departaent with other natters regaining at the
discretion of the Panel. It is proposed that when the revisedCertificate
Conditions are in force then the delegation will be aaich nore closely defined.
Unfortunately this is not possible at the nonent with the current Certificate of
Conditions.

 The conduct of players on the fie ld can have a marked Impact on
•crowd*behaviour.       Particularly where the fixture 1s judged
 v o la tile the club should be encouraged to arrange for players to
 leave the tunnel together and to shake hands at the end of the
 game.      They nay also be 'reminded of the Importance of good
 behaviour on the pitch.      It rests with the natch commander to
 take up with the club any misbehaviour by players.
Entertainment
The club should be encouraged to provide some form of
entertainment to .take place during the half hour preceding kick
o ff, for example bands, displays and recorded music.     A good
'announcer' using the public address system can establish a
rapport with the crowd and influence behaviour. Thought should
be given' to lia is in g with *! announcers!" to oake suitable
interventions I f appropriate. This Beans may be used to advise
'.away' supporters as to arrangenients for their leaving the
ground, changed travel instructions etc.
Crowd Distributions
It is emphasised that stewards should ensure that all sections of
terraces and stands are f ille d to capacity before allowing accgss
to further sections where, possible. This will require monitoring
tuniitfre to ta lls e r s and the use of public address systems in
some instances.        This operation i s greatly assisted by the
compartmentalisation of grounds, each compartment being f ille d in
sequence.

                Contingency Planning

        1.61    Pre-determined plans should be available to control such
                contingencies as serious disorder, pitch Incursion and locked out
                sp e c ta to rs. Because of the great divergence 1n ground and crowd
                fa c to rs these plans oust be ground sp e c ific .       However, these
                plans        must  take     Into      consideration   the   !Popplewell!
                recommendations with regard to the transmission of coded messages
                over the public address system, the a v a ila b ility of emergency
                telephones and a f a c i l i t y fo r the police to intercept the public
                address system.
                Emergency Evacuation
         1.62   Stewards must be fam iliar w ith .th e action to be taken in the . . .
                event of ah evacuation of the whole or p art of the stadium.
                Police should a s s is t in the rapid evacuation of a stadium in such
                circumstances. Stadia should have a universal locking system and
 v              a ll stewards should be in possession of keys for the ex it gates.
                They should wear a d is tin c tiv e tabard or other means of easy
                i d e n tif ic a tio n .   I t must be made c lear to both the club
                management and to the individual stewards th a t they must not
                leave t h e i r post without being relieved.        I t is essential th a t
                e x it gates can be opened without delay 1n the event of an
                emergency.            Simulated emergency evacuation exercises for the
                s t a f f employed by the club must be held a t le a s t twice each
                season to t e s t the emergency evacuation procedure. The crowd
                will not be involved but depending upon circumstances i t could be
                an advantage to.explain to the crowd th a t an emergency evacuation
                exercise i s taking place.           Experience has revealed that in an
                actual evacuation i t is essential to monitor e x it doors when the
                crowd has l e f t the stadium to prevent them wandering back into
                the stadium before the reason for the evacuation has been
                completed.

                Retention of Visiting Supporters
       - 1.63   In some circumstances the o fficer 1n charge may decide to hold
                the y 1 si ting supporters 1n the 'ground until he considers i t
                appropriate to release them. I f such a ta c tic is employed then
                the s itu a tio n will be greatly eased i f the v isitin g fans are kept
                informed.
                Early Re-Deployment of Police Officers
                Police o ffic e rs should be deployed outside the ground, in key
                p ositions, early enough to be seen in these positions by the
                crowd as i t leaves the ground. This gives an appearance of good
                order and police control. At c r itic a l points the use of police
                o fficers in groups under the command of a sergeant should be
                considered.      The effective after-match deployment of police
                o fficers is dependent on the pre-match briefing and allocation of
                tasks.
                Vehicular and Pedestrian Traffic
                At the end of the game early dispersal of supporters is clearly
                b en eficial. Most Police Forces will develop a tr a f f i c control
       plan to f a c i l i t a t e th is . P a rtic u la r attention should be given to
       routes used by !away! supporters. Supporters who are not local
       ■ u s t always be able to find coaches where they got off them and
       generally 1t 1s good practice to convoy and e sc o rt coaches away
       from the general area.               Many grounds are 1n heavily built-up
       areas of old Industrial towns and I t 1s extremely d iffic u lt to
       move police resources 1n the Innediate aftermath - i t 1s
       therefore essential to detail t r a f f i c and public order duties
       beforehand.
       Bus, Railway and Main Line Stations
1.66   Foot patrol and mounted officers {1n lia iso n with B ritish
        Transport Police) should be used to control queues and prevent
        rowdyism occurring. Large groups of supporters should generally
        be escorted on to the sta tio n -a n d , where necessary, B ritish
        Transport Police nay wish, to consider travelling with supporters
        until they are dispersed.
       De-Briefing of Senior Officers
1.67   In the event of Inadequacies being exposed 1n the police
        operation, a t the conclusion of the match there should be a
        de-briefing of supervisory o fficers.

           NOTE: B ritish Transport Police usually pass t h is
           information e ith e r by telephone or te le p rin te r two or
           three days before the game, and update as necessary.
Action to be Taken by jAway Team! Liaison Officers
Liaison o fficers should establish and maintain close liaison with
the local supporters club and coach operators who carry football
supporters to away matches.

NOTE: The most accurate and up-to-date information Bay not be
available until the day before the game or even l a te r and liaison
officers should contact th e ir opposite number by telephone where
necessary.

Post Hatch De-Briefing on the Quality and Accuracy of the
Intelligence Provided
I t 1s essential t h a t home club lia is o n o fficers advise, as a
matter of course, t h e i r opposite number about the accuracy of
Intelligence provided by way of the football Batch summary form
includlng:-
(a)    the estimated number of v is itin g supporters;
(b)    the estimated number who travelled by coach;
(c)    the estimated number who travelled by tra in ;
(d)    d etails   of any incidents   before,   during or a fte r the
       match;
"(e)   details of v is itin g supporters arrested/ejected;
(f)     registered numbers of any oini-buses (or tra n s it vans)
       seen i n ' t h e vicin ity of the ground, in order that the
       names and addresses of the keepers or operators can be
       ascertained for future intelligence purposes.
The importance of the accurate completion and prompt return of
the   football   Batch   sunsnary ‘ forms   is   again stressed.
Consideration should also be given to the forwarding of C.C.T.Y.
tapes containing intelligence about v is itin g supporters to the
Police Force concerned.^
I t is important th a t supervising officers encourage officers to
submit any relevant intelligence to Football Liaison Officers in
order to positively a s s i s t in the gathering of intelligence.
Information to Police Force Through            Whose   Area   Visiting
Supporters are Expected to Travel
.It may be necessary for information to be supplied to the Force
 through whose area large numbers of supporters travel or on whose
 area notorious ‘crossroads' or 'watering holes' are situated.
 This assumes a more urgent aspect i f there has been trouble at
 the ground;     or i f there is a history of violence between
 supporters lik ely to meet en-route to t h e ir respective away
 fixtures.   Reports of such problems should be passed to the
 football liaison o ffic e rs of the.clubs involved by the Force in
 whose area the incident occurred.
Travel by B ritish Rail - Liaison with B ritish Transport Police

B ritish Transport Police policy 1s to segregate football
supporters froa ordinary passengers as fa r as practicable.       To
achieve t h i s , pricing and other policies have been Introduced 1n
an attempt to encourage supporters to travel 1n the following
order of preference
(a)   Charter Trains or Carriages
These tra in s are not normally accompanied by B ritish Transport
Police.    The chartering club MUST arrange for Insurance and
stewards, and accept responsibility for any damage which nay
occur on the t r a i n .

Liaison With B ritish Transport Police
The responsibility for preventing and dealing with Incidents of
hooliganism on train s carrying supporters of football clubs to
and from matches lie s primarily with the B ritish Transport Police
and they should be given full co-operation and assistance.
I f disturbances Involving tra v e llin g supporters have taken place
during the game or outside the ground afterwards, particularly 1f
a r r e s ts have been made, 1t 1s usually an Indication th at trouble
may be expected on trains carrying supporters home.                Any
Incidents which nay have a bearing on the behaviour of supporters
tra v e llin g by tra in should be reported as soon as possible to the
local office or Headquarters control room of the British
Transport Police.
For t h e ir part, the British Transport Police will inform the
local police a t the terminal sta tio n and, 1f necessary, a t any
stopping point on the route when hooliganism breaks out on the

to occur either on the train or a t the terminal sta tio n .
The British Transport Police send by telex details of the timings
of a ll special and charter trains to Police Forces covering the
departure and terminal stations and those en route.
Football Trains Etc., Ban on Alcohol
The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol Etc.) Act, 1985, as
amended by The Public Order Act, 1986, prohibits alcohol on a
vehicle which:-
(a)      is a public service vehicle, or not a public service
         vehicle but adapted to carry more than eight passengers
         (i.e. minibus),"or a railway passenger vehicle, and
(b)      is being used for the principle purpose of carrying
         passengers for the whole or part of a journey to or from

A bye-1 aw made by the British Rail Board under Section 67 of The
Transport Act, 1965, in effect bans alcohol from any train in
respect of which notice of the prohibition on alcohol has been
given to the travelling public.
WTIES OF STEWARDS
The E ffect o f Safety C ertificates Issued Under the Safety a t
Sports Grounds Act, 1975
A level of control i s provided by the Safety a t Sports Grounds'
Act, 1975, a t those grounds which are required to be c e r t if ie d .
The Local Authority, before issuing a Safety C e rtific a te , 1s
required to consult the Chief Officer of Police regarding the
terms and conditions to be Included in the c e r t i f i c a t e .

Whilst police do not d ire c tly control the employment of stewards
a t football grounds, 1 t should be accepted th a t there 1s a
re sp o n sib ility , within the wider context of public safety, to
exert influence to ensure t h a t the arrangements »ade by the
management of the ground are adequate in t h i s respect.        It Js-
most important that stewards are s u f f ic ie n t 1n number, suitably
deployed, well trained and capable Dentally and physically of
carrying out th e ir routine and emergency functions.            I t Is
recommended th at the police regularly Inspect stewarding
arrangements to determine they are 1n accord with c e rtif ic a tio n .
Iden tificatio n and Supervision

Persons employed as stewards a t football grounds should be
clearly id en tifiab le, wearing coloured tabards. They should a t
a ll times be under the d ir e c t control of supervisors whose
id e n titie s should be made known to the police officers on duty a t
the ground and who should be In contact with the Police Control.
Stewards should be d istrib u te d throughout, the ground 'in
accordance with a detailed pre-arranged schedule, agreed between
the police and management of the ground.
Their duties may be divided in to four main categories
(a)      controlling-or d irecting members of the public who are
         entering or leaving the football ground;
                                        *



(b)      patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, e.g .
         raising alarms, extinguishing f i r e , e t c .;
(c) -    manning entrances, e x its and other strateg ic points,
         particularly e x it doors, and gates which are not
         continuously open w h ilst the ground is in use;
(d)     . undertaking specific duties       relatin g   to emergency and
          evacuation procedures.

In accordance with the .'Popplewell' recocmendations all stewards
should:-

(a)      be trained and Instructed to deal with any emergency
         relating to .fire or evacuation;
(b)      be given written in stru ctio n s about the action to be
         taken in cases of emergency;
(c)     receive practical instruction and train in g appropriate to
         t h e ir responsibility;

(d)     not be employed as a steward unless they have been so
         instructed and trained;

(e)     be adequate in number, physically and mentally capable of
         performing    th e ir duties,    e ffe c tiv e ly      deployed,
         effectively supervised and readily id e n tifia b le .
Emergency Procedures - Stewards Role
Formal emergency procedures a t each      ground require jo in t
consultation between police, the management of the ground, f i r e ,
ambulance and other services.
I t 1s essential th a t stewards and t h e ir supervisors are fully
aware of the part they have to play 1n the plans which are
produced.         The management of the ground should ensure th a t
w ritten instructions concerning the action to be taken in the
event of an emergency are made readily available to all s t a f f and
stewards and, in p a rtic u la r, that all the s t a f f and stewards
should receive practical instruction and train in g appropriate to
th e ir re s p o n sib ilitie s in the event of an emergency. Exercises
for the s t a f f and stewards should be carried out regularly to
ensure the smooth operation of the procedure fo r dealing with an
emergency.

A record should be kept by the club authorities containing
details of the training and instruction given and the exercises
held, and should include the following matters:-
(a)    date and time of the instruction or exercise;
(b)    duration;
(c)    name of the person giving the instructions;
(d)    names of the persons receiving the instructions;
(e)    nature of instruction or exercise.
Consideration should te given to the inclusion of                  these
conditions in any safety, or special safety certificate.
After in itia l practical instruction all members of staff and
stewards should receive verbal instruction, given by a competent
person, at least once in evary period of three months at regular
intervals. Stewards should be given briefing cards relevant to
particular points.
P0LICIH6 FACILITIES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS
Ttmre are narked differences In the f a c i l i t i e s provided by clubs
and i t nust remain a n atter for local negotiation between police
and clubs as to the standard of f a c i l i t i e s , bearing 1n mind
average attendance and a need fo r police presence.                I t Is
recommended th a t 6eneral Safety C e rtific a te s are reviewed on an
annual basis In an e ffo rt to achieve continuing Improvement.

Prisoner Reception Point Within the Ground
I t is considered essential t h a t a prisoner reception point should
be available a t the ground.        The office should be sited, i f
possible, so th a t there 1s adequate access fo r the unobtrusive
removal of prisoners. There should be e ith e r a G.P.O. telephone
lin e or a d irect lin e to the nearest police s ta tio n . Ideally the
police accocroodatlon should have two detention rooms to separate
'home! and 'away' supporters.
Parading and Briefing

I t is desirable th at police o ffic e rs to be deployed in the ground
are briefed on s i t e . This can usually be done under cover in
most grounds. A standardised form of stadium grid reference used
by police and club personnel w ill f a c i l i t a t e briefing and
evacuation.
Control Room
I t 1s desirable,-and in some cases e s s e n tia l, th a t a control room
is provided to oversee police operations in the ground.
Provision should be made for a base statio n to control the U.H.F.
police radio.     I t should have a d ire c t access to the ground
public address system and eith e r a 6 .P.O. or d ire c t telephone
lin e to the local police s ta tio n , and the police office within
the ground. The room should be of adequate size to accocroodate
C.C.T.Y. monitors and ancillary equipment. I t i s desirable to be
able to operate, in addition, high in tensity lighting systems
frora the police control^which nay be switched on when there is
trouble or emergency.

The control room should be sited to give an over view of the
ground and to allow the match police conmander ready access from
the 'touch l i n e '.
The costs of the provision of the police office and control room
and f a c i l i t i e s should be borne by the club. The police generally
provide radio communication and additional items such as loud
h a ile rs and binoculars.
Safety a t Sports Grounds! Act, 1975, by providing for
consultation between the local a u t h o r it y ' and police (Section
3 ( i i i )) on conditions to be included on safety c e rtif ic a te s has
had a clear effe c t cm improving ground f a c i l i t i e s .  Full use
should be made of these provisions to ensure adequate police
fa c ilitie s.
C.C.T.Y. AND STILL PHOTOGRAPHY
The guidance offered in th is section 1s Intended to a s s is t
Commanders having operational responsibility fo r policing
fo o tb a ll.       I t 1s not a definitive work and should be read 1n
conjunction with the report of the A.C.P.O. Working Party,
e n t i t l e d , 'Use of Video and S t i l l Photography.
Introduction
The use of C.C.T.Y. and s t i l l photography as an aid to the
effective policing of football i s a recent development. At the
present time, a l l F i r s t and Second Division football grounds are
provided with s t a t i c video cameras and recording f a c i l i t i e s ,
which enable the police to nonitor crowd behaviour within and in
the _1naediate v ic in ity of stadia. - I t • i s -anticipated t h a t
videoing f a c i l i t i e s will be extended to all Third and Fourth
Divsion grounds in the near future but not necessarily of the
same type as in the two higher Divisions.

The quality of the equipment and re-production of image presently
available in football grounds is now always compatible with i t s
adequate presentation before the courts, and i t s use has resulted
in some confusion between i t s function in relatio n to 'command
and control' and to evidence gathering.          Experience to date
indicates the g reatest value l i e s in developing a system for the
use of C.C.T.Y. and s t i l l photography within stadia for the
purposes of intelligence and evidence gathering.
All systems a t present in use a t football grounds are capable of
being enhanced and developed.       When these changes are made i t
should be ensured th a t the replacement equipment is of su fficien t
standard th a t the quality of recording is such as to be
acceptable for use as evidence in court.
Accepting the need for identification and evidence gathering for
prosecution to be the primary function of the system, the
following points .are worthy of consideration in the use of
developtT^nt of existing -and anticipated f a c i l i t i e s .
Technical Considerations
(a)   - At the time of in s ta lla tio n , consideration should be given
        to the sitin g of cameras and cables so as to prevent
        interference or damage.
(b)     As good video recording requires good lig h t and as most
        football fixtures are played during winter months, the
        need for adequate lighting within and around football
        stadia is essential to eliminate areas of darkness which
        may be used as cover for disorderly, behaviour. Fans are
        increasingly aware th at such behaviour is monitored by
        C.C.T.Y. and they will attempt to evade detection by
        seeking whatever cover is available.              I t is therefore
        important th at caaeras are sited in such a way as to
        minimise blind spots and that f a c i l i t i e s are provided to
        increase lighting in te n sitie s in stands, etc. The sitin g
        of video cameras should take account of sloping roofs, to
         enable recording a t the rear of stands. This problem can
         be overcome by the            use   of hand-held     cameras.
         Consideration oust be given to all foreseeable problems
         th a t may affe c t the performance of video equipment. A
         good example th at is easily overlooked 1s the path of the
         setting sun. A video camera       would be Ineffective I f the
         sun was shining directly Into the lens.
 (c)    Police Control Rooms contain valuable equipment and are
         often vulnerable. Consideration should be given to taking
         protective measures to Increase security.
 (d)     Control Rooms      should be placed in a position which
          commands a       good all round viewof the ground        and
          consideration     should be given to placing the video
          monitors in      such a position that th e . operator is not.
        • distracted by   a c t iv i ti e s within the ground.
 (e)    Careful consideration to the type of lighting and the
         provision of glass p a rtitio n s should be given to prevent
         reflection or d isto rtio n .   The Control Room should have
         adequate background heating to protect the electrical
         equipment and for the comfort of personnel employed within
         the room. Heating should remain switched on 24 hours a
         day during cold weather.
-(f)    The use of flash equipment in the vicinity of sensitive
         video cameras may damage the tube i f discharged facing the
         camera. Even i f th is damage is not permanent, the video
         camera would be unable to function for some time. As a
         general rule flash equipment should not be used in -th e
         vicinity of operating video cameras.
 ( g)   Police Control Rooms must be provided with multi-recording
         f a c i l i t i e s in order th at the opportunity exists to capture
         all incidents which may occur in different areas within
         the stadium.
         Operati onal Consi derati ons
 (a)    I t is important th at police officers are made aware that
         th e ir actions in dealing with disorderly behaviour within
         the stadium will also be recorded on C.C.T.V.

 (b)    Consideration should be given to the preparation of a
        ground specific video, to be used in briefing officers who
        may not be familiar with the stadium.

 (c)    I t is important whenever possible to use the same
         personnel in police ground control room operations. They
         will more readily identify regular troublemakers and
         ! ta rg e t' them within the .ground. Over a period of time
         they will develop similar a b ilitie s in relation to
         v isitin g supporters
 (d)    Immediately following a fixture where arrests for
         misconduct have occurred, arresting officers should be
         allowed an opportunity to view any recording of the
G•

                    Incidents concerned to establish (1) the evidence for
                    t h e i r a r r e s t and (2) whether the offender has coonitted
                    any fu rth e r acts not witnessed by the arresting o ffic e r.
                    Intelligence Gathering
     4.12   (a)     Away fans arriving a t grounds nay be videoed as they come
                    through t u r n s t il e s , get off buses or leave railway
                    sta tio n s. This helps with Identification and the tracing
                    of those responsible for causing trouble. I t also makes
                    the fans aware th at they are on record.

                      When grounds are f u l l , the crowd nay be filmed all round,
                      so th a t 1f trouble s t a r t s , id en tificatio n will be
                      assisted . I t will also make the crowd aware th at they are
              '   •'* on record." To a s s i s t th is procedure, i t 1s always useful
                      to have id en tificatio n marks around the ground so th at the
                      fans! location within the stadium can be pin-pointed with
                      accuracy.

            (b)     Some clubs have followings from areas of the country many
                    miles from th e ir home base.       Therefore, when i t is
                    necessary to identify persons from the crowd, photographs
                    and video recordings should be circulated to Forces who
                    have supporters! clubs of th at p articular football club in
                    th e ir area.
            (c)     Each Force should compile sets of photographs and/or
                    videos of its own clubs hooligans and either (i) forward
                    on such tompilation to each force that is likely to host
                    the club during the forthcoming season, or ( ii) one- such
                    compilation be taken to each awa- game by officers
                    travelling with the club's supporters.
                    Each host Force should supply the visiting team's home
                    Force with photograph?, and video recordings of the
                    visiting team.s supporters, i f their conduct is such as to
                    warrant this. This will keep Forces aware of how their
                    own club's supporters behave away frora home.
            (d)    Some clubs have a section of supporters who are notorious
                    for hooligan behaviour.     I t would assist in future
                    investigations into serious disorder at other grounds i f
                    the host Forces of these clubs prepared video recordings
                    and photographs of their hooligan element and established
                    the identity of those involved. Then by comparing this
                    recording and the photographs with those of the incident
                    under investigation, identification should be greatly
                    assisted.
            (e)    Known hooligans should be targetted and followed in video.
                    This requires local officers operating the video who can
                    be assisted by officers from the visiting team's home
                    Force.
            (f)    Identified fans displaying consistently aggressive
                    behaviour, rrot amounting to a chargeable offence on a
                    single occasion, but who can be identified, on other video
        recordings displaying similar conduct, should be traced
       •end-charged on th is evidence of system.
(g)   The video recording of a football fixture 1s a valuable
      source of Intelligence which Is often overlooked 1n the
      absence of Identified disorder.           I t Is strongly
      recommended th at all video . recordings be viewed fo r
       Intelligence purposes, and th a t tapes be retained until
       the corresponding fixture in the following season has been
       played.
Identification
In the event of large-scale and serious disorder a t a sporting
f ix tu r e , there will be a need to develop a strategy to identify
and a r r e s t offenders, -using the evidence obtained • by • video *
recording and s t i l l photography.     Practical guidance 1n t h is
process i s as follows:-
(a)    Photographs or s t i l l s from video recordings should be
       displayed for public view and identification wherever
       possible, e.g. T.V., newspapers, match programmes,
       posters, etc.
(b)   A viewing studio should be created not only for the use of
       police o ffic e rs , but for the public as well as such
       organisations as supporters' clubs, stewards, residents'
       associations, social workers, probation officers, e tc.
(c)   Imnediateiy after the incident, all press photographs and
       other media evidence should be obtained and statements
       taken frora those responsible for taking the photographs,
       video recordings, etc. Attempts should also be made to
       obtain all amateur videos and photographs, and the
       appropriate statements taken. All this material, together
       with police photographs and video recordings, should then
       form part of the viewing studio exhibits.
(d)    Officers from the host Force should v is it the visiting
        team's area and other areas containing supporters' clubs
        of .the visiting team, where they should exhibit
        photographs and video recordings for identifiction
      " purposes as at (b) above.
(e)   The size of the police team working on identification is
       critica l. There should be sufficient to do the work, but
       i t should be kept small enough to be cohesive.
(f)   The task of viewing video recordings and photographs many
       times is tedious, therefore i t is recommended that staff
       should be selected who are interested in the sport
       involved.
(g)   Once identified and traced,.offenders should be invited to
      view the video recordings and i f they are able, to
       identify themselves whilst in non controversial
      circumstances before being questioned about alleged
      offences on video recordings and photographs.
             (h)    Where people Identify themselves 1n photographs, they
                    should be Invited to Indicate th is on the reverse of the
                    photograph over th e ir signature.

             (1)    Consideration should be given to videoing suspects whilst
                    they are watching the recording of the Incident. Facial
                    expressions, bodily movements and verbal exchanges nay
                    form vital supporting evidence.

        SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS’, ACT,          1975    -     CERTIFICATES
The Safety at Sports Grounds' Act, 1975, provides for the
c e r t if ic a t io n of designated football grounds specified within the
Act, which includes all Football League and Rugby League Clubs.
On application for c e rtific a tio n the management of the football
club concerned Bust satisfy the local authority -that certain
standards of public safety are available within the ground. The
le g is la tio n requires the local authority to consult with the
Chief            Constable of the area 1n which the ground is located
regarding the terns and conditions to be'included before any such
c e r t i f i c a t e can be issued.
The following recommendations on n a tte rs th a t should be included
in safety c e r tif ic a te s have been compiled    from c e rtif ic a te s
Issued across Force.Areas. I t is f e l t th a t the. reconnendatlons
neet the needs of police and should be considered for inclusion
in safety c e r t i f i c a t e s . '
Before the stadium is used on any occasion
(a)     The Holder shall notify the Chief Constable of a
         specified Activity a t le a s t 28 days before such an

(b)     The Holder shall make an agreement on his own behalf and
         on behalf of the occupier of the premises under Section
         15, Police Act, 1964, to secure the attendance a t the
         specified Activity of such number of police officers as
         is in the opinion of the Chief Constable sufficient to
         ensure decent and orderly behaviour a t the specified
         Activity.
(c)     The Holder shall comply with such directions as the Chief
         Constable deems f i t , as to :-
         (i)      methods of admission of spectators to the

                  safety; and
        (i i )    "methods of control employed to ensure the
                  segregation of spectators supporting one team
                  from those supporting the other.
The    Holder shall ensure the attendance          at every specified
Activity of a Chief Safety Steward and an          adequate number of
Safety Stewards to the satisfaction of the         local authority and
the Chief Constable, and the Safety Stewards       shall be:-
(a)     Trained and instructed to deal            with       any   emergency
        relating to f i r e or evacuation.

        mentally capable of performing t h e ir du ties, effectively
        deployed, effectively supervised and readily identifiable
        by coloured tabards.
In the event of a fixture being arranged as a r e s u lt of a draw in
a Football/Rugby League or Football Association Cup Competition,
which would indicate the attendance of a club from a higher
division, .who by the nature of the club or by local in te re s t
would a t t r a c t a crowd well 1n excess of the current ground
capacity, or the forward information is such th a t a public order

plan or as agreed with the Chief Constable or senior police
officer.
When owing to the condition of the ground a cancellation of the
catch is likely a police representative should be present when
tre ground is inspected.
No tu rn stile s should be classed as a means of escape.
Under Section 10 (Emergency Procedures) of the Safety a t Sports
Grounds' Act, 1975, a Local          Authority Is empowered, t f   It
considers that due to any deficiency 1n safety procedures at a
designated sports ground, to take certain step^ to minimise the
risk to spectators. The Local Authority may apply to the courts
for an order prohibiting or re s tric tin g admission to the whole or
any part of the ground until such steps have been taken to reduce
the risk to spectators.
I f the court 1s s a tis f ie d , on the application of the Local
Authority, th at the risk to spectators a t a sports ground 1s so
great th a t, until steps have been taken to reduce 1t tc a
reasonable level, t h e ir admission ought to be prohibited, or
re s tric te d , the court Bay order, prohibit,, or* r e s t r i c t , .to the
extent they consider appropriate 1n the circumstances of the
case, the admission of spectators to the whole or any p art of the
ground, until such steps have        been taken as, in the opinion of
the court, are necessary to          reduce the risk to a reasonable
lev el.
I f spectators are admitted to a sports ground in contravention of
an order made under Section 10 of the Sports Grounds' Act, 1975,
any responsible person, and i f a safety c e r t i f i c a t e is in
operation, the holder of the c e r t if ic a t e , shall be guilty of an .
offence.
N.B. The Fire Safety and Places of Sport Bill currently before
Parliament amends the procedure under Section 10 of the 1975
Safety at Sports Grounds' Act by allowing the local authority to
place an order of prohibition on sports ground management i f in
th e ir opinion the c r i t e r i a a t paragraph 16.12 above is s a tis fie d .
Thus disposing of the need to apply to a court for an appropriate
order. The club management or holder of the safety c e r t if ic a t e
may appeal to the Magistrates for cancellation or modification of
the order.                                                             •
      A N N E X A TO HOME OF F I C E C I R C U L A R N O 71/1937

      FIRE SAFETY AND SAFETY OF PLACES OF SPORT ACT 1987
      Advice note by the Home Office on Part II of The Fire Safety and
      Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 (The 1987 Act) amending The
      Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975 (The 1975 Act)
      Introduction

      1.   The general background to the 1975 Act together with a
      summary of local authority powers and functions under that Act,
      and procedures for the issue of safety certificates is set out in
      Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1936 issued 7 February
      1986 (taken from earlier Home Office circulars 150/1975, 130/1976
      and 187/1976). This guidance should therefore be read in
      conjunction with Annexes A - D of Home Office Circular 7/1986
 t    which will need to be cross-referenced.
      2.   The Popplewell Inquiry set up after the fire tragedy at
C )   Valley Parade concluded that the 1975 Act had worked
      satisfactorily at designated grounds but recommended changes to
      improve its operation. The Government's response was contained
      in a consultative document published in June 1986. Parts II and
      III of the 1987 Act implement these proposals and introduction of
      Part II as from 1 January 1988 is the first phase of this
      implementation.
      3.   The main mechanism for securing safety at sports grounds
      remains the safety certificate. Guidance on safety standards is
      contained in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (The Green
      Guide) revised in October 1986. Local authorities are reminded
      of the advice contained in paragraph 5 of Annex 3 to Home Office
      Circular 7/1986 highlighting the need to maintain flexibility in
      order to take account of the different circumstances at
      individual grounds.
      SUBSTANCE OF THE AMENDMENTS EFFECTED BY PART II OF THE 19 87 ACT
      Section 19: Application of the 1975 Act to all sports grounds
      4.   Section 19, together with the textual amendments of Schedule
      2 to the 1987 Act removes the distinction in the 1975 Act between
      a sports "ground" and a sports "stadium". As amended the
      provisions of the 1975 Act apply to all sports grounds as defined
      in section 17.(1) of that Act. The Secretary of State may thus
      designate any category of sports groind witheut first having to
      make an order extending the provisions of the Act to that
      particular class of ground.
      .5.   In consequence of this wider power, section 2 of the 1975
      Act (originally formulated with "stadia" in mind, particularly
       football stadia) has also had to be amended, by section 19 (2) of
       the 1987 Act, so that safety certificates are no longer required
       to contain certain obligatory terms and conditions. The
       Secretary of State is however empowered to stipulate by order the
       contents of a safety certificate for any class of sports ground.
In this way those grounds of a particular type, or grounds used
for a particular sport need not be subject to requirements which
would be inappropriate to them.

6.    As there are no present plans to extend designation to other
classes of sports ground it is not envisaged that an order under
this new power will be necessary. The discretion given to local
authorities under section 2(1) of the 1975 Act means that with
the possible exception of clauses in safety certificates relating
to police presence (see paragraph 9 below) the contents of safety
certificates will not automatically require•amendment as a result
of the removal of the obligatory terms of section 2 of the 1975
Act. Safety certificates should continue to specify maximvm
spectators; include terms and conditions as to size, situation
of entrances/exits to and from the ground and parts of it
 (including means of escape in the case of fire or other
emergency) plus means of access to any such entrances and exits;
terms and conditions should continue to require those entrances,
exits and means of access to be properly maintained and kept free
from obstruction; and terms and conditions should continue to
deal with the number, strength and situation of any crush
barriers.

7.   Section 19(2) also widens the regulation powers given to
the Secretary of State by insertion of a new subsection (1A) to
section 18 of the 1975 Act thereby enabling regulations to make
different provision for different classes of sports grounds.

Section 20:   Designation of grounds - variation in qualifying
              spectator capacity

8.   Section 20 inserts subsections (1A) and (IB) in section 1 of
the 1975 Act to give the Secretary of State power to vary by
order the numerical threshold above which grounds may be
designated as requiring a safety certificate. The threshold is
at present set at 10,000 by the Act.


Section 21:   Safety certificates - police presence

9.   Section 21 adds subsection (2A) to section 2 of the 1975
Act. Where the local authority includes in a safety certificate
a provision which requires the presence of the police, the
subsection requires that determination of their number is to be
left to the Chief Officer of Police. This is already the usual
if not invariable practice and this provision does no more than
give statutory force to existing arrangements. Safety
certificate conditions which do noc comply with this provision
will however be void and local authorities are advised to ensure
that any such conditions comply with the new provisions.

Section 22:   Safety certificates - appeals

10. Section 22 of the 1987 Act directs appeals under section 5
of the 1975 Act to the courts instead of to the Secretary of
State as hitherto. Such an appeal is to the Magistrates Court by
way of making a complaint (new subsection (3A) of section 5).
There is also provision for an appeal to the Crown Court against

1.0   Splon Kop

1.1   The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main
      meant of escape exit route from the KOP should be removed, since
      it is causing both a high risk and a narrowing of the escape
      width.                                                                   B.S.

1.2   A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier
      adjacent to the tunnel exit at the north end of the KOP to be
      removed, and the crush barrier be aodified to join onto the end
      of the new steel supported barrier directly adjacent to it.              B.S.

1.3   A timber hut at ground level, under the KOP structure should be
      removed.                                                                 B.S.

1.4   An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed
      adjacent to the base of.the ramped stairway from the extended
      terracing. This was agreed on site by Dr. Eastwood.                      B.S.

1.5   An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used as cladding to the
      side of the Kop is corroded and torn.                                    HCS

1.6   It was noted chat in some places the stair nosings serving radial
      gangways had become defective.                                           HCS

1.7   At some positions within the new development there is a
      diiJexence-jLn kftlfctxX— becwean -a-terraced area and radial» gangway
      of over 600mra. As such' these areas require to be protected"'by a
      suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.

1.8   Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
      minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would be
      adequately controlled by means of “ongoing" maintenance.

1.9   The defective rendering to the final exit gate wall requires to
      be repaired.

2.0   North Stand

2.1   A broken glass panel in the west gable end should be replaced.

2.2   The step between seats 12 and 13 on row 43 is loose and should be
      correctly bedded down.

2.3   It is important to ensure that the groundman's store beneath this
      stand is not used for the storage of potentially inflammable
      fertilisers or weedkillers.

3.0   West Stand

3.1   Signs over the front parapet wall at the upper level are to be
      permanently secured at the following positions:-

      a) between seacs 1 and 14
      b) becween seacs 20 and 28
      c) becween seacs 136 and 150.
       Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
       purpose.

       Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
       be correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

3.2    Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
       have a gauze inserted so as to Inhibit the dropping of missiles                  ;
       onto the crowd below.                                                  B.S.

3.3    It is felt that discussion should take plsce regarding the
       suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
       emergency exit stairway on the south end of this stand. The
       fastening consisting of a patent locksble barrel bolt which
       cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, and is
       impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                       B.S.

4.0    Miscellaneous Points

4.1    At a number of points within the stadium various pieces of
       abandoned builders' waste were readily available for use as
       projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected and
       suitably disposed of.                                                 HCS

4.2    The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
       first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
       become ill or injured within the sports ground.                       HCS

4.3    Th.e p^oxlsian.jjf               aide 13.,is. being reviewed at-tha- •-

A p o lo g ie s f o r Absence

Apologies for absence were received from Chief Superintendents Owen, Vain and
Nesbit.

M inutes o f t h e l a s t m e e tin g (17 June 1987)

The minutes of the meeting held on 17 June 1987, which had been previously
circulated were accepted as a true and accurate record of that meeting.

M a t t e r s a r i s i n g from t h e M inu tes

There were no matters arising from the previous minutes - 17 June 1987.

Coach O p e r a t o r s / T r a f f i c Commissioners G u id e lin e s

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and said that as a result of a
meeting with the Transport Manager of a local coach company (Ridings Travel) it
was apparent that some of the Traffic Commissioners Guidelines were not      being
adhered to by Coach Operators throughout the country. In particular, rule 4
’coaches attending designated events must not stop at any premises where '
intoxicating liquor is available'.

Mr Stuart continued by saying that this guideline was difficult to implement as
most motorway service areas sold intoxicating liquor and bona fide supporters
who wanted to stop at such premises for ordinary refreshments were being
penalised.

He continued by saying that Ridings Travel were to lose approximately £50,000
per annum in revenue if they adhered to the guidelines as regular customers were
hiring coaches from other companies that stopped at motorway service areas
irrespective of the rule outlined.

The Chairman outlined in full the Traffic Commissioners Guidelines and the
procedure to be adopted through Mr Phillips, ACC at Greater Manchester,
Secretary to the ACPO Sub Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events of
breaches to those Guidelines.
Superintendent Stuart said that to date only 16 breaches had been reported to Mr
Phillips this season and in percentage terms this figure appeared low taking
into account the number of supporters coaches that travel nationally each
weekend.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that it was slightly unfair on normal supporters
when executive coaches were offering to travellers, champagne breakfasts and
other similar packages in order to attract custom. He continued by sayir.g that
uniformity should be sought in implementing the Guidelines nationally.

Chief Superintendent Hole said th2 t one solution may be to 'stockpile' coaches
at such locations like Tankersley and question drivers as to their schedule
stops and then escort them in a convoy of ten to the appropriate ground.

The Chairman said that the use of intelligence across forces, good planning and
appropriate deployments were important features in preventing disorderand each
match should be treated on its merits.

A short discussion took place on the Guidelines resulting in theChairman saying
that he had written to Mr Phillips about Rule A with a view to
it being discussed at a national level - the important thir.g was that we should
use all methods available that contribute to a reduction in public order.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead said that coach parking facilities were now
becoming a problem at Bramall Lane and asked if other members had similar
problems and should we as a Force be asking certain clubs to provide parking
facilities.

A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that wherever
possible encouragement should be given for clubs to provide appropriate parking
places.

Item discharged.

F o o tb a ll In te llig en c e

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and said that a number of Divisional
Intelligence Officers and Football Liaison Officers were contacting other Forces
directly. This was outside the system presently being operated and frequently
created duplicity of information by the force Football Intelligence Officer, PC
Rosevear.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that he accepted information received from PC
Rosevear was correct, however, it was not always up to date and his Divisional
Intelligence Officer was in touch with the visiting teams and even the
appropriate sub division up to the kick off and beyond, thus gaining direct and
immediate information.

Chief Superintendent Mole continued by saying that it was frequently the C 2 s e
for more relevant intelligence to be gathered within the last few hours to kick
off than any other perio.d.
                                                     - 3 -



     Chief Superintendent Herold said that PC Rosevear was the Force Football
     Intelligence Officer and he should be the person to liaise with other forces
     throughout the week to avoid duplicity and after Friday evening for the other
     appropriate personnel to continue in respect of fixtures in their divisions.

     A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that it was
     equally important for relevant intelligence to be gathered and disseminated up
     to and including the football fixture, than days prior to it and a balance
     should be struck between those concerned.

     Item discharged.

     Dse o f CCTV a t F o o tb a ll S ta d ia - F orce S ta n d in g Order
Vv
     Assistant Chief Constable Jackson said that this item had been raised at Chief
     Superintendents Conference and certain valid points had been raised which
     differed from the draft guidelines issued by the National Working Party.

     In particular, viewing of CCTV, the preparation of pocket books by officers
     involved in incidents recorded on tape and collusion by those officers when
     preparing their pocket books.

     It was generally thought that when officers had made an arrest or been involved
     in an incident, they should be allowed to view a tape recording of that arrest
     or incident and converse prior to preparing their pocket books, these being
     contrary to the Guidelines.

     A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that these facts
     were to be raised at the National Working party.

     He continued by saying that it had been approved at Policy Review Committee   for
     tape retention to be 12 months from recording or corresponding fixture.

     Superintendent Stuart said that a number of other forces had also expressed
     their concern over the viewing of closed circuit television and the question of
     collusion prior to the preparation of pocket books.

     He continued by referring to problems encountered by police and comments inade by
     a High Court Judge when they allowed numerous viewings of a video tape to take
     place after an incident at Luton Football Ground and did not keep proper
     records.

     Mr Stuart said that the reasoning behind using closed circuit television is to
     establish the truth and create another way of presenting evidence of fact before
     a court.

     He continued by saying that it was thought nationally that collusion between
     officers should take place during viewing the tape and advice would be
     circulated to all forces in due course from Mr Ghandi, Deputy Director Public
     Prosecutions.
The Chairman said it was essential to keep an accurate record of all viewir.gs,
including place viewed, tine, day, date, persons present and other relevant
information coming to light during the viewing, in particular, identification of
persons in the video.

A short discussion took place on this item resulting in the Chairman saying that
ve should await the directive from Mr Ghandi and write the recommendations into
a draft order in due course for discussion at Policy Review Committee.

Superintendent Swann asked for advice on the purchasing of tapes and who should
provide the funding for the equipment.

The Chairman said that the purchase shotild be made centrally and in bulk. Chief
Superintendent Herold agreed to make arrangements for the purchase on behalf
divsions.

Item discharged.

Exclusion Orders

The Chairman introduced this item and asked members if any problems had occurred
with exclusion orders and the system adopted.

Mr Jackson continued by referring to the apparent delay in circulation of
exclusion orders by Magistrates Courts and that ACC Vatson was to raise the
issue during his liaison with Magistrates Clerks with a view to speeding up the
process.

Detective Chief Superintendent Addis said that in some instances, exclusion
orders had been received as late as one week after issue, however, the telex was
being received on the day of issue.

Mr Addis said that to date, 13 exclusion orders had been made and details
forwarded to the relevant forces.

Mr Addis continued by saying that only 2 minor problems had occurred, namely
that an exclusion order had been received with a black and white photograph
instead of colour and that on 3 occasions orders had been received without
photographs, however, in general the system was working well and all members
agreed.

Mr Addis concluded by informing members that in the near future all photography
would be in colour.

Item discharged.

S p o tters

The Chai rman introduced this item and asked members if any problems had occurred
with the use of 'spotters'.
                                           5



    Superintendent Swann said that B Division had 2 full tine spotters who travelled
    in uniform to away fixtures.  He continued by saying that the officers provided
    a deterrent, as away fans recognised them and knew that the possibility of being
    identified existed. The spotters also provided intelligence for local and home
    forces on persons of interest attending away fixtures.

    A short discussion took place and all members agreed that the system was working
    well. The Chairman concluded by sayir.g that the British Transport Police vere
    also very helpful by providing travelling spotters and intelligence.

    Chief Superintendent Hole made reference to an incident whereby one particular
    force refused to provide spotters due to financial constraints and concluded by-
    saying that if it was to be a national scheme, all forces should participate.

    The Chairman said that he would liaise with Mr Phillips on this matter.

    Item discharged.

    Membership Schemes

    The Chairman introduced this item and asked for members views on the present
    schemes.

    A short discussion took place on Membership Schemes and all members (with the
    exception of B Division) agreed that they vere working.

    Superintendent Swann said that Barnsley Football Club had not agreed with the
    Football Association on a suitable scheme.

    He continued by saying that Barnsley Football Ground had not initially been
    designed with total segregation in mind and a membership scheme would at present
    create problems in policing fixtures, however, the police and Barnsley Football
    Club did agree in principle to some form of scheme being adopted.
A
    The Chairman concluded by saying that the situation should be monitored closely
    with a view to being in a position to give a police view on the subject.

    L e v e ls o f P o l i c i n g

    The Chairman introduced this item and asked members views on current policing
    levels and if the balance was right.

     Superintendent Stuart made reference to the Dog Section and their attendance at
     football matches. He said that some divisions only wanted the provision of dogs
     in duty time and not overtime or leave, due to financial constraints.

    Mr Stuart continued by sayir.g that it vas not always possible to supply dogs in
    duty tine and a balance had to be struck. In future, when dogs were being
    supplied the commander will be given the option of having the full quota of dogs
    offered or only those working in duty time.
                                     -   6 -




The Chairman said that it vas important for commanders to identify their needs
according to the fixture, and deploy resources accordingly as members of tlie dog
section may be required elsewhere.

He continued by saying that the balance of handlers/dogs on overtime or leave
should be spread evenly across the force.

Community Policing at Football Matches

Mr Jackson referred to Community Policing at football matches and said that
Chief Superintendent Hole had introduced a system of using the same officer at
the same point within the ground at each fixture.

Chief Superintendent Hole said that it was similar to community policing in the
fact that the same officers was positioned in the same area of the crowd each
time. This enabled the officer and certain supporters to become known to each
other and become a community type constable.

Mr Mole continued by saying that the system vas working well and fewer resources
were now needed on the perimeter. The officers had become known to the rowdy
element and were quick to identify contentious areas. They also provided an
ideal intelligence gathering resource.

Chief Superintendent Mole then referred to resources and parking facilities at
Niagara Sports Ground. He said that a problem had evolved with officers/people
visiting Hillsborough. These people were using the parking facilities at
Niagara and therefore caused congestion resulting in emergency vehicles being
unable to move freely v^ithin the complex.

Mr Hole asked members to convey the message to officers with a view to finding
other parking facilities or to be more sensible in their mode of parking.

A short discussion took place resulting in all members agreeing that it was a
problem especially whenmatch days at Hillsborough coincided with other
functions at Niagara.

Item discharged.

There being no further business, the meeting closed at 11.50 am.

                                        MAJOR INCIDENT


DEFINITION

A major incident is defined as a serious disruption of life, arising with little or no warning,           XR 200
causing or threatening death or injury to numbers of people in excess of those that can be dealt
with by the public services operating under normal conditions and which require special mobil­
isation and organisation of those services.




                          OBJECTIVES OF THE MAJOR INCIDENT PLAN

It is impossible to cater for every contingency which might arise in a major incident situation.          XR 201
The Major Incident Plan, therefore, contains a basic format on which all major incidents should
be based.

Whilst setting out basic principles and responsibilities to be adhered to, it also allows for flexibil­
ity and initiative in the prevailing circumstances.
                                                                                          SECTION! 2


                   BASIC PRINCIPLES OF MAJOR INCIDENT OPERATIONS




The initial objectives of all services involved in a major incident are:—                              XR 20;

    . (a)    To ensure that those who can assist, get to the scene as soon as possible.
      (b)    To safeguard all persons and property from further danger.
      (c)    To release casualties from the wreckage as soon as possible.
      (d)    To quickly and accurately assess and treat injuries.
      (e)    To transport casualties to hospital with the minimum of delay.
      (f)    To provide prompt and skilled treatment on arrival at hospital.
      (g)    To inform the relatives of casualties of their condition and whereabouts.
      (h)    To re-establish normai conditions as soon as possible.

These objectives cannot be met by any one service. A major incident will invariably require the
full involvement of all three primary emergency services — ie police, fire and ambulance. These
services will be supported by the local authority and a number of other agencies.

To deal effectively with a major incident there must be a common policy and a complete under­          X R 20 :
standing between all three services. This will necessitate:—

       i.    The establishment of lines of control and communication at the earliest
             possible stage.
      ii.    The establishment of iiaison between all services for effective co-ordination.
     iii.    The provision of facilities to enable each service to operate to maximum
             efficiency.
     iv.     The co-ordination of requests for, and allocation of resources in order of
             priority.

The overall control and co-ordination of the effort of all the services involved in dealing with a
major incident is a POLICE responsibility.
                                                                      SECTION 3

                                              THE A L E R T


    Initial notification that a large scale emergency may have occurred within the Force area may         X R 20S
    come to the police by various means. Whether it comes from Air Traffic Control, British Rail,
    Fire Control, from a patrolling officer, a member of the public or any other source, it is possible
    that the available information may not immediately indicate the exact extent of the incident.

    It is imperative that no delay should arise while confirmation or further information is being
    sought, but action must be taken immediately on whatever information is available. Circum­
    stances will soon indicate if a large scale response is not required.

    If notification is received, the information must be passed immediately to the Force Operations
    Room who will alert the other emergency services that a major incident may have occurred and
    that the police are implementing the "Major Incident" plan. .

)   The recognised codeword between the emergency services is:—

                                           "CATASTROPHE"




                                                                                                               *
                                                                                      SECTION] 5


                           FIRST POLICE OFFICER AT THESCENE


The first police officer at the scene will be faced with enormous demands and his initial reaction   XR21
may well be to render assistance to survivors. This temptation must be resisted if co-ordinated
rescue plans are to be brought into operation.

The following guidelines may be most effective in the circumstances:—

       APPROACH THE SCENE                        —    upwind and downhill where appropriate.
       CAUTIOUSLY

        INITIAL RECONNAISSANCE                        speed is essential, a general picture will
                                                      suffice.

       DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN                    —    or take any personal risk!

    NOTE:  IF A MAJOR INCIDENT OCCURS ON A MOTORWAY, THE FOLLOWING NOTES
    DO NOT APPLY. PLEASE REFER TO THE SECTION ON "MOTORWAY ACCIDEMTS".


    If a major incident occurs within the Force area, elsewhere than on the motorway, police               XR 2
    personnel at the site of the incident will be working to their normal local radio control using
    personal UHF sets. It would be wrong for Operations Room to seek to take over the direction of
    operations at the site, although circumstances may make this desirable in the later stages, in order
    to allow sub-divisions to carry on with normal policing.

    The RESPONSIBILITIES of the OPERATIONS'ROOM are:-

         (a)    to ensure that the necessary action is taken in respect of special safety measures
                demanded by the circumstances of the incident;

         (b)    to alert the emergency services and other authorities and departments whose
                facilities and expertise wiil be needed;

         (c)    to deal with the possible Forcewide problem of traffic congestion;

         (c)    to direct the Forcewide deployment of manpower and equipment.

From the information obtained the officer in charge of Force Operations Room must decide
whether to implement the Major Incident Pian. The oniy advice that csn be offered in making the
decision is to consider the major incident definition in the light of the information gained from

INSTRUCTION CARD - PARKING ARRANGEMENTS


The indiscriminate parking of vehicles will cause serious problems at the site and may well            XR 242
obstruct rescue and fire fighting operations. The proper marshalling and disposal of all vehicles
not actively being employed for fire fighting, rescue or ambulance purposes is vital and wiil be
given immediate attention when the police first arrive at the scene.

The aim is to establish separate parking areas for police, fire and ambulance vehicles. Each
parking area should be located preferably off the roadway but on the approach route to the site
and convenient for personnel to park their vehicles and report to the Police Incident Post, Fire
Control Point or Ambulance Control Point before entering the site. Each area must be suf­
ficiently large to enable vehicles to turn around. Ambulances will also park prior to the driver
being summoned to the Ambulance Loading Area to receive casualties and obviously it is more
important that the Ambulance Parking Area should be more conveniently located than the Police
Police Parking Area.

Parking wiil need to be supervised to ensure that available space is sensibiy utilised and it may be   XR 243
practicable for ignition keys to be left with the vehicle or with the member of the service in
charge of that parking ares.

It can be anticipated that continual use will cause parking surfaces to deteriorate, particularly if
the weather conditions are bad. At an early stage arrangements will have to be mace to reinforce
parking surfaces with hard core, grave!, grit or timber. Since these arrangements may take some
time it is imperative that this need should be anticipated.

The parking areas wiil need to be well signed and particular attention given to indicating their
position on the approaches.

Parking areas may need to be illuminated.

Although a member of the service wiil remain at the entrance to the parking area to supervise
vehicles and give information, the responsibiiity for establishing the parking areas and marshalling
vehicles rests with the police.

                                                                                                CARD B



    INSTRUCTION CARD - TRAFFIC ROUTES AT SITE


    Traffic at the scene travelling to anc from the site and between the parking areas, loading points,     XR 245
    etc. should be marshalled to adopt routes which cause the minimum interference with other
    routes. Where routes do meet it will be necessary to establish control by a police officer
    performing traffic duty, although as soon as possible police officers should ba replaced by
    civilians or by mechanical apparatus. Although in the initial stages traffic routes at the site v/ill
    have been one of the priority tasks of the poiice, it is likely that traffic will soon have adopted a
    workable flow partem in and around the site and the need for police to actively marshall traffic
    will diminish. Routes may need to be signed using sign boards, cones, roadlamps, tape, rope, etc.

    Lighting will be required if operations may continue during darkness and it is important that
    arrangements are made in advance if emergency equipment is to be available ready for when it is
    needed.

    It can be anticipated that ccntinuai use will cause routes and standing areas to deteriorate, par­      XR246
    ticularly if the weather conditions are bad. At an early stage arrangements will have to be mace
    to reinforce routes and standing arsas with hard core, gravel, grit or timber. Since these arrange­
    ments may take some time it is imperative that this need should be anticipated.

    The terrain might be such that a bulldozer couid improve parts of the route.

    Routes must be kept c!e3r of parked or broken down vehicles and arrangements should be mace
    to bring the necessary towing vehicles,-tractors, breakdown equipment, mechanics, towing gear,
    etc. to the scene via sub-divisional control or Force Operations Room.

    A regular inspection and supervision of routes at and around the scene wiil be necessary.

 INSTRUCTION CARD - POLICE INCIDENT POST


 PURPOSE                                                                                                  XR 248

 The Police Incident Post should be established so that it can service and control the entire
 incident. Initially the post is likely to be a motor vehicle but as additional perscnrei arrive at the
 scene the post should be staffed and moved if necessary to fulfil the following roles:—

      (a)   Location of the Site Commander and his staff.

      (b)   The Administration Office for police at the site, which will include:—
               (i) Personnel office — te record the arrival, deployment and departure of
                    police staff.
              (ii) Communications office — to maintain permanent contact with su'c-
                   divisional control, Force Operations Room and other service commanders.
             (iii) Equipment office — to obtain and record the arrival and disposal of stores
                   and equipment for use at the site.

      (c)    The information centre for all police activity.

 LOCATION                                                                                                 XR 249

The decision as to the location of the Police Incident Pest should be taken in consultation with
the senior fire and ambulance officers at the scene to ensure that the total layout of the site is
compatibie with the requirements of al! services. If circumstances should indicate that the initial
locations are wrong, they must be corrected.

The Police Incident Post should be located well clear of operations in a prominent place near the
roadway forming the approach route to the site. Ideally it should be in the proximity of Fire
Control Point and Ambulance Control Point but not so close as to affect radio reception.

(n considering where to establish the Police Incident Post attention shouid be given to the pos­
sibility of locating nearby the Weifare and Assembly Centre, Lost and Found Property Office and
the Police Parking Area,

ACCOMMODATION '                                                                                           XR 250


The best place for the Police Incident Post is in a buiiding having furniture, heating, .lighting,
toiiets, telephones, etc.

Force Operations Room will have sent the mobiie police station to the scene and this vehicle has
the necessary office equipment if no building is available and is distinctive and well signed. It
should be utilised as part of the Police Incident Post in addition to any building. At the very start
of the incident Force Operations Room will direct a Traffic Department vehicle to the site ar-d
this should be used pending the arrival of the mobiie poiice station to provide radio ccmmurv
ication with Force Operations Room.

                                                                                            CARD C

                                                                                              Page 2



 SIGNS

The effectiveness of the Police Incident Post will depend considerably on how prominently it is         X R 251
located and how well it is signed. Sub-divisional control and Operations Room will broadcast
details of its location to personnel at the site and such messages may need to be repeated. E'/ery
effort should be made via sub-divisional control to obtain the necessary signs. It is particularly
important that the route from the Police Parking Area to Police Incident Post be well marked and
while signs are being erected officers should be deployed to direct persons arriving at the site.

 COMMUNICATIONS

 The necessary personal, telephone or radio links with Fire and Ambulance Control Points, the           XR 252
 Assembly snd Weifare Centre, Force Operations Room, sub-divisional control and Casualty
 Enquiry Bureau should be established. Force Operations Room will call out the Communications
 Officer to provide all possible assistance. Sub-divisional control will send any additional personal
 radios to the Police Incident Post.

As far as possible communications between Police Incident Post and other positions should be by
telephone where the message is a request for equipment, information, etc. This will leave the
radio clear for urgent messages, broadcasts, deployment of personnel, traffic regulation, etc.

Officers in charge of teams carrying out tasks at the site should be equipped with radios to com­
municate with the Police Incident Post. Other key personnel at the site, including the site medics!
officer and commanders of other services will each be assisted by a police officer who wiil be
responsible for dealing with communications.

EQUIPMENT                                                                                               XR253


 The sub-divisional major incident box will have been sent immediately to the Poiics Incident Pest
 by sub-divisional control. Force Operations Room will have arranged for the Force N'ajcr
 Incident Box to be sent from Headquarters. Other sub-divisions will send their major incident
 boxes if requested. The contents of the boxes are shown in Section 25. The mobiie poiice station
"contains a crest deal of office equipment and‘maps.

Sub-divisional control and Force Operations Room will be sending equipment to the site either
on their own initiative or as requested by the Site Commander.

It is likely that much of the equipment will be only partly used or not immediately required. All
such spare equipment should be stored and supervised near to the Poiice Incident Pest so that it
is readily available when needed.

ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS                                                                                  X R 254

The following tasks should be dealt with by personnel at the Police Incident Post:—

     (a)    Maintain a log of the incident. This should be in chronological order, giving
            details of problems, conferences, decisions, action taken, persons concerned, res­
            ponsibilities of particular persons, identity of prominent personalities and times
            of arrival at site, etc.

     (fci   Maintain record of police officers present at site, t/ieir hours of duty, postings,
            etc. Care should be taken to ensure that the record includes ALL officers, as
            there will be cases when an officer — eg an off-duty officer — attends the site
            without first reporting to the Post. Arrange reliefs as appropriate. Anticipate
       -    what manpower and related equipment might be required at future stages of the
            incident.

     (d     Maintain record of personal radios, telephone numbers of other method of com­             XR 255
            munication with particular police officers or other persons, points or areas at the
            site. Organise any necessary redistribution of rac'iosand batteries. Sub-divisional
            control can assist.

     (c)    Prepare a plan of the site, showing the location of Police Incident Post, parking
            areas, salient features, high risk areas, etc.

     (=!    Maintain record of police vehicles at the site, officers bringing them, station
            where garaged. It may be expedient for the Police Incident Post to' retain
            possession of vehicle keys. Poiice Incident Post staff may organise transport
             leaving the site to return vehicles and officers to their originating stations.

     (:}    Maintain a record of all equipment at site, including its use and whereabouts so
            that such equipment can be quickly located if necessary.

INSTRUCTION CARD - SITE SECURITY


For reasons of safety, security or in the interests of proper investigation, it is extremely impor­      X R 253
tant that no unauthorised person should be allowed to enter or remain within the site area. This
is particularly so in the case of crashed military aircraft incidents, in relation to which the police
have a duty to guard the site and any wreckage until relieved of that responsibility by the
military authorities.

The task of sealing off the vicinity of the site TO VEHICLES is the responsibility of Force
Operations Room using Traffic Department and other personnel.

The task of clearing the site and preventing access TO PEDESTRIANS is one of the respon­
sibilities of the Site Commander and the swift deployment of sufficient personnel to accomplish
this task may save a great deal of effort and manpower being used at a later stage.

Loudhailers and public address equipment will be useful.

It will be necessary to tape or rope off the limits of the site, placing barriers at roadways and vul­   XR 253
nerable points.

Suitable signs prohibiting access or warning of danger if appropriate should be placed.

It will be necessary to man the points in the perimeter through which the routes for emergency
vehicles pass and post officers to suitable points around the boundary.

It may be appropriate to arrange that the perimeter of the area prohibited to unauthorised pedes­
trians shouid correspond with that prohibited to traffic and thereby reduce the need for barriers,
personnel, etc. This will depend on the topography of the site and may not be practicable.

In addition to preventing access and guarding the perimeter of the site it wiil be necessary to          XR 260
patrol areas of the site to deal with persons who have gained access. It may also be expedient to
mount guard over particular places, wreckage, bodies, property, etc. within the site to prevent
interference from persons properiy present at the site.

Consideration should be given to the need to equip persons engaged on security tasks with pro­
tective clothing, torches, etc..

Dog handlers will be usefully employed on such duty.

INSTRUCTION CARD - MEDICAL ARRANGEMENTS AT SITE


The officers responsible for police action relating to med'caT arrangements must ensura the             XR2S2
smooth working of the arrangements outlined below, with particular attention to facilitating the
loading and despatch of ambulances according to the medicai priorities of casualties. It would be
wrong for the police to become involved in giving first aid to the relatively less injured instead
of carrying out the more vital responsibility.

In particular every effort should be made to ensure that ambulance crews are able to load the
priority patients rather than the relatively slightly injured. In a very short period sufficient
vehicles will be available at the scene to transport all the injured to hospitals throughout the
region.

In the event of a major incident occurring, the ambulance service will send ambulances to the
scene, all of which will be in radio contact with Ambulance Control whether or not they
normally operate in the South Yorkshire area. Ambulance crews will be under the control of a
senior ambulance officer at the site.

One or more medical teams, suitably equipped, may be sent :o the site by the hospitals to assist        XR 263
in the treatment of casualties and to advise the ambulance se'/ice which casualties need priority
for removal to hospital. It is anticipated that circumstances will indicate that casualties should be
removed to hospital rather than being treated at the scene.

One of the hospitals will send a doctor to be the 'Site Medical Officer' in charge of medical
arrangements at the site. Until his arrival, the senior ambulance service officer will act as Site
Medical Officer, supported by whatever medical expertise is available. The Site Medicai Officer
should be accompanied by a constable equipped with personal radio in contact with Sub-
Divisional Control. When the UHF station is set up at the site, the Site Medical Officer should be
accompanied by a police officer equipped with a portable radio on that local frequency. This will
provide a link between him and the Site Commander.

The Site Commander in consultation with the senior officers of the other emergency services at          XR 264
the scene, will have indicated the proposed location of an 'Ambulance Parking Area'. Police
action necessary for organising the Ambulance Parking Area snd directing ambulances to it will
be taken by the police 'Parking Arrangements' team but for tr.e sake of clarity details are set out
there. The Ambulance Parking Area should be on the route being taken by ambulances
approaching the site and the police should create sufficient space for ambulances to enter, park
and leave. Whether this will best be on a series of routes alone which the police can create a one
way system or on open ground, will depend on the location c: the incident. The police will need
to indicate to ambulances the location of this area until it can be signed, anddirectambulances
to it. Ambulance Control will broadcast this location via ambulance radio.

The Site Commander, in consultation with the senior officers of the other emergency services at         XR265
the scene, will have indicated the proposed location of the 'Ambulance Loading Area'. This will
be in a safe place accessible to ambulances and to the rescue parties bringing casualties to it. The
police will have to clear sufficient space for the ambulances tc attend, load up and depart. There
must be additional space for the less serious casualties to await transport, and shelter is obviously
an important factor. If requested by the ambulance service, tr.e police will do what they can to
establish communications between the Ambulance Loading Area and the Ambulance Parking
Area.

                                                                                             Pace 2



In the vicinity of the Ambulance Loading Area, casualties awaiting transport will ts receiving         X R 255
first aid treatment from the medical teams, ambulance personnel, fire service personnel and
perhaps other trained persons who have volunteered their services.

The police will assist in equipping this are3 by obtaining via Sub-Divisional Control ar.y necessary   X R 255
resources such as lighting, blankets, first aid equipment, etc. The amount of these resources wiil
depend on how long the incident is likely to extend before all casualties can be removed to
hospital. It is anticipated that the medical authorities will normally have sufficient resources of
their own.

It is not intended that documentation of casuaities should take place prior to their removal to
hospital. It may be that uninjured persons who were involved in the incident wii! accompany
their injured friends to the Ambulance Loading Area. Such persons should be discouraged from
congregating there and instead be marshalled to the Assembly and Welfare Centre (established by
another of the police teams) where they will! be cared for.

    INSTRUCTION CARD - ASSEMBLY AND WELFARE OF PERSONS INVOLVED


    The action indicated below may require radical adjustment dependent on the circumstances of          X R 252
    the particular incident and is suggested for general guidance only.

    There may be present at or near the site a number of persons who were invoived but are not
    injured or who have been treated at the scene, witnesses and persons temporarily displaced by
    rescue operations or safety measures. So that their welfare requirements can be attended to and
    so that they may be quickly re-united with their friends, families and property, an effort should
    be made to marshall all such persons to an Assembly and Welfare Centre.

    LOCATION

    The Centre should be in a safe place, out of the way of operations but not far from the site,
    ideally in the vicinity of the Police Incident Post. As soon as possible arrangements should be
    made to remove such persons from the scene to a police station or other suitable place. However,
    arrangements as to documentation and persons reported missing will need to be mace wherever
    the location of the weifare accommodation may be.

    ACCOMMODATION                                                                                        XR 270


    The most comfortable and convenient place. It may be that more than one building, PSV or place
    will need to be used. Shelter, warmth, toilets and catering should be considered.

    SIGNS                                                                         ■        '

    The location of the Centre at the site shouid be broadcast by Force Operations Room and Sub*
    Divisional Control as soon as it is established and arrangements to provide signs for it wiil be
    made via Sub-Divisional Control where necessary.

)   It may be appropriate to publish details of the Assembly and Welfare Centre to the site by using
    loudhailers or public .address equipment.

    PERSONS REPORTED MISSING

    Enquiries should be made of Casualty Enquiry Bureau, if practicable by the person from whom
    the enquiry originates. Casualty Enquiry Bureau may be contacted by telephone using the
    number supplied by Force Operations Room.

    DOCUMENTATION                                                                                        XR 271


    Using stationery available from the major incident boxes, full details should be taken of all
    persons attending the Centre, including whether or not they were involved or witnessed the
    incident, their exact location at the time of the incident, etc. Casualty Record Forms should be
    completed in respect of persons injured and details telephoned to Casualty Enquiry Bureau as
    soon as possible using the number supplied by Force Operations Room. Details of persons
    involved but uninjured should also be given to Casualty Enquiry Bureau. It might be practicable
    to obtain witness statements.

A lost and found p'operty office will be established at the Assembly and Welfare Centre where
details of property lost or found will be recorded and property stored using the books, bags and
labels from the major incident boxes. A full scale Lost and Found Property Office wii! have been
set up near the Police Incident Post and the officer in charge of that office will arrange for
property to be collected from the Assembly and Welfare Centre.

Radio and telephone communications will be needed to make the necessary welfare arrangements
and provide equipment for the Centre. It may be feasible to have a 'runner' system operating
between the Assembly and Weifare Centre and the Police Incident Post.

TRANSPORT

Police vehicles may be usefully employed to collect up persons and to transport property and
equipment. Longer term arrangements fcr the dispersal of these persons from the site will be
mace via Sub-Divisional Control or Force Operations Room as appropriate.

INSTRUCTION CARD - LOST AND FOUND PROPERTY


A Lost and Found Property Office will be established near to the Police Incident Post where           XR 274
enquiries and property will be dealt with as at any police station, using the books, labels,
envelopes, etc. contained in the major incident boxes.

A senior police officer will be responsible for arrangements and for the safe custody of the prop­
erty. He wiil also supervise the lost and found property offices at the Assembly and Welfare
Centre and any of the Refreshment Points and arrange to remove property handed in at these
places to the custody of .the main Lest and Found Property Office at the site.

Articles of property may provide evidence material to the Investigation and vital to the iden-        X R 275
tification of victims so particular attention must be paid to obtaining exact details of the place
where they were found.

Articles subject of customs and excise involved in air-crashes may be handed over to Customs and
Excise officials.

Particular attention should be paid to articles which might be mail in transit.

At a later stsce a search of the site will be organised and the officer in charge of Lost and Found
Property Office wiil detail personnel to accompany the searchers and deal with property found.

When the decision is made to discontinue the Lost and Found Property Office at the site the
property will be taken to the local sub-divisional headquarters.

INSTRUCTION CARD - PRESS LIAISON

Any major incident will attract a great deal of press activity at the site and it is important that       X R 277
liaison between police and representatives of the press is quickly established so that information
can be made available through authorised channels. Otherwise some people may act irresponsibly
by seeking to give or receive information individually.

The Force Press Liaison Department will contact the news media via normal channels and arrange
for a press conference, addressed by one of the Chief Officers, to take place at a stated time at
Police Headquarters. Subsequent similar press conferences will take place there at regular stated
times.

The Site Commander will depute a senior officer assisted by press liaison department personnel
to be responsible for dealing with the press at the site. Officers so designated will wear the 'Police
Press' armbands contained in the major incident boxes. Members of the press have been
instructed to look for this identification.

it is vital that emergency measures at the site should not be hampered by the activities of               XR278
irresponsible members of the press or public. Members of the press are not entitled to enter the
area to which the police are restricting unauthorised pedestrian access. Where, however, it is clear
that emergency measures would not be jeopardised, the police will give every assistance to enable
accredited members of the press to do their work.

If possible representatives of the press at the site should be dealt with collectively and given infor­
mation and facilities including:—

     (a)     the essential facts of the incident avoiding any statement as to causes;
     (b)     the arrangements that have been made for the press conference at Force
             Headquarters;
     (c)     facilities to televise and photograph appropriate areas of the site.

The details of any information released at the site must be telephoned to Force Operations Room           XR 273
fcr general distribution to the press.

It may be possible for the police to arrange for witnesses to be made available to the press con­
ference at Force Headquarters.'

In the event of any incident happening on private property, facilities for the press should be by
agreement with the owner's representative. In the casa of railway property, this wiil probably be
tne senior British Transport Police officer present.

Enquiries on technical matters may be referred direct by the police, as appropriate, to such estab­
lishments as the Atomic Energy Authority, the Central Electricity Generating Board, or relevant
government or other department.

PRESS PHOTOGRAPHS AT THE SITE                                                                             XR 280


So that a proper investigation can be made of the cause of the incident it is vital that the scene
sr.culd be disturbed as little as possible pending expert examination. Where there is a risk of fire
cr explosion from the escape of aviation fuel, petrol, gas etc., the use of flash equipment is
                                                                                        SECTION 11

                                                                                             CARD H

                                                                                                Page 2


dangerous. In cases involving military equipment the taking of photographs may be against the             X R 280
interests of security. For these reasons it is clear that as far as practicable all persons should be
prevented from taking photographs at the site.

Police action at the scene of the incident will lead to the clearing of the site of aii unauthorised
persons including members of the press. As soon as possible, however, every facility will be
afforded to such authorised representatives of the press and television as the senior officer
responsible for liaison with the press deems appropriate in the circumstances of the incident.

It will clearly be less disruptive to emergency services working at the site if arrancerr.ents could be   XR 281
made with the press that representatives take photographs as a party at a particular time rather
than indiscriminately.

A crashed military aircraft is a 'prohibited place' within the meaning of the Official Secrets Act
and in relation to such incidents, press photographers and television and film cameramen wishing
to photograph or film wreckage should be invited in the interests of security voluntarily to
refrain from doing so until the appropriate service personnel have examined the scene of the
accident and covered or removed any classified material. If, however, they are net prepared to
comply with such a request, they should be permitted to take photographs or films provided this
does not involve disturbance to the wreckage, interfere with rescue work or the observance of
any safety precautions in force at the time, or create an additional fire hazard by the use of flash
bulbs or electronic flashes near to free gasolene vapour.

Before they leave the scene of the accident, however, the police should take their names,                 XR282
addresses and telephone numbers, and those of the newspaper, agency or television or film
company which they represent. This information should be given to the senior rr.smber of the
Service 'Crash Party' on arrival who will thereafter be responsible for reporting as necessary direct
to the Ministry of Defence.

Where the accident involves USAF and RCAF aircraft, then until members of the USAF or
RCAF arrive a similar procedure to that outlined in the previous paragraph should be carried out
but the information obtained should be passed to the USAF or RCAF authorities cn their arrival.

Persons other than authorised representatives of the press, television, police and appropriate
services, should be reminded that a crashed service aircraft is a 'prohibited place' within the
meaning of the Official Secrets Act, and if photographs are taken before approval has been given
by the senior member of the Service 'Crash Party', the photographer will be required to hand
over the camera or negatives to the police.

INSTRUCTION CARD - SEARCH OF SCENE

As soon as it is safe and practicable to do so, and bearing in mind the needs of investigation, the     XR 285
police should liaise with the other services and organise a full scale search of the scene to ensure
that all casualties have been found, all sources of danger prcperly disposed of, and a!! bodies, high
value property and equipment are located and properly deslt with.

It is imperative that persons undertaking the search are prcperly equipped and briefed that they
must not move or touch anything unnecessarily but shouid report anything they find to the
medical teams or the teems of police officers detailed to c'eal with bodies, property, etc., who
will accompany the saarch. The searchers should be warned of any areas into which they should
not go for reasons of safety and security.

The search must be carefully supervised with all personnel divided into teams headed by officers        XR23S
responsible for searching specified areas of the site. Each team leader should prepare a plan of the
area of'search for which he is responsible and note on it anything found. These pians will be
handed to the officer in overall command of the search as they are completed.

It is envisaged that use will be made of fully trained exhibits officers from the Criminal
Investigation Department. He could use the Record of Exhibits Book provided for the purpose,
and ensure full continuity should this be necessary for evidential purposes.

INSTRUCTION CARD - FATALITIES

The officer in charge of duties relating to the dead should consult the section of the Major           XR 287
Incident Scheme Manual 'Fatalities'. He should ensure that a reconnaissance is made of the site to
obtain ir.'ormation as to how many dead bodies are involved, their whereabouts and whether any
special problems arise because of dismemberment, contamination, etc. If necessary, this officer
will get Force Operations Room to send Police Surgeons to the scene. When an accurate overaii
assessment of the problems has been made details should be given to the Site Commander.

The Site Commander will consult with the Coroner and Force Operations Room as to what
arrangements should be made with regard to bodies and parts of bodies at the site. Circumstances
wiil indicate whether they shouid be left in situ pending necessary viewing by a pathologist as
part of the investigation. When it is decided that the bodies should be removed whether from the
site or to 3 central point prior to being moved elsewhere, they will first be labelled, photographed
and their position, condition and location recorded in accordance with the procedure set out
below.--

The 'body book' contained in the major incident box will be used in connection with this task.         XR 288


A plan of the site should be prepared.

Sufficient stocks of books, labels, string, bags, stretchers, markers, hammers, stakes, etc. should
be obtained.

Selected officers will be formed into one or more teams equipped with protective clothing. A
photographer should accompany each team.

One senior orricer in charge wiil alone be responsible for allocating a number for each body or
parr fcunc at the site and recording its position on the site plan. The team will label the body and
related property and mark the location before taking the necessary action to remove it to await
transportation from the site.

A senior orricer will be responsible to the Site Commander for transport arrangements and will         XR289
obtain ccr.rirmation from Force Operations Room that the proposed destination is suitable
fceiore au’ ncrising removal of each body from the site. Transport will be arranged via Operations
 Room and where practicable a police officer will accompany any such vehicle from the site to the
mortuary accommodation.

INSTRUCTION CARD - INCIDENT INVESTIGATION

Once it is safe to do so and before any evidence is lost cr disturbed it may be desirable at an early   XR 291
stage to commence obtaining photographic evidence at the site and to record salient information
which will be needed for subsequent investigations and report purposes. This may induce an
estimate of damage and if necessary a surveyor should be contacted.

Expert investigators will attend the site of air and rail accidents but their arrival may be delayed
and the needs of the investigation may demand urgent action. However, if circumstances permit
it wiil be better to await the arrival of expert investigators before carrying out any sort of
inspection of wreckage and great care should be taken not to disturb any wreckage or other
evidence which may not be meaningful to police but which is significant to expert investigators.
Officers should be nominated to liaise with each of the experts during their investigations.

It will be valuable if a tour is made of the site area using a tape-recorder to record impressions      XR 292
and saiient details. Binoculars may be useful to view contaminated areas or parts where access is
difficult. The scale of the incident might suggest that a helicopter should be used to do aerial
reconnaissance and obtain aerial photographs of the site. A plan drawer will be sent to the site
and if practicable he should accompany the officer concerned in order that he may produce a
rough working plan if appropriate and include on any plan details of significance. As well as iden­
tifying retevant material evidence, ultimate positions, extent of damage, etc., evidence should be
considered which might indicate speed, direction travelled, wind direction, obstruction to view,
etc.

It is essential that the Site Commander is kept informed of significant evidence obtained which
may require to be preserved by taking special measures.

Detaiis should be obtained of all police, fire and ambulance and civilian personnel who may be
witnesses in relation to the incident.




                                                                              (fTT5>

    INSTRUCTION CARD - WELFARE AND CATERING LIAISON OFFICER

    The appointed officer should liaise with the Force Catering Officer as to what feeding arrange­
    ments can be made.

    In consultation with the Site Commander, the liaison officer will arrange for officers at the site to
    be relieved of duty in order to take refreshments. Dependent upon the feeding arrangements
    made, it may be necessary for officers to be transported to a nearby police station for more sub­
    stantial refreshments.

    It is better to locate refreshment points at different locations rather than one central pcint,
    although a central refreshment centre will be needed near the Assembly and Weifare Centre and
    the Police Incident Post.

    Refreshment points should be signed.

    The Liaison Officer should make provision at each refreshment point for:—

         (a)     taking details of any weifare problems concerning officers engaged at the site;
         (b)     recording and taking possession of found property;
         (c)     providing minor first aid to persons working on the site;
         (d)     supplying small items of equipment.

    It may be expedient to do this using one or more police vehicles, which will provide accom­
    modation for equipment, property and stationery as well as giving communications and emer­
    gency transport facilities.

    Sub-Divisional Control and Force Operations Room wiil broadcast information concerning the
    location of refreshment points as instructed by the liaison officer.

     (Motorways and Multiple Accidents)

     The 'Vehicle Clearance Officer' is responsible to the Site Commander for ail matters relating to        XB2S3
     vehicles AT THE SITE which are actually involved. He will nominate, instruct and supervise
     teams of officers in the recording of vehicles and drivers involved. These teams will also search
     vehicles and deal with prcpe^y found in or forming part of them; such property being placed in
     suitable bags and labelled prior to storage. When vehicles have been searched, a label indicating
     that this has been done will be completed and affixed to the vehicle. (The property bags,
     property tie-on labels and 'searched vehicles' gummed labels are in major incident boxes and
     should be collected together with the 'Vehicle Record Book' and the 'Vehicle Clearance Officer'
     armband.) The 'Vehicle Clearance Officer' will not normally approve the removal from the scene
     until the vehicle has been colour photographed and where necessary, searched and labelled.

     The Vehicle Clearance Officer will consult Accident Investigation Branch officers and Ministry
     Examiners on their arrival regarding the question of inspection and removal of vehicles from the
     scene.

     If a Casualty Enquiry Bureau has been activated, the Vehicle Clearance Officer should, as soon as
     practicable, notify the Bureau of the make, colour and, if possible the registration number of the
     vehicles involved.

     Drivers of civilian breakdown vehicles will be instructed to report to the Police Incident Post on
     their arrival. The 'Vehicle Clearance Officer' should designate officers to receive these drivers and
     direct them and their vehicles to a convenient place on the motorway dear of the main crash area
     until their services are required by the 'Vehicle Clearance Officer'.

     The 'Vehicle Clearance Officer' will maintain a composite record of the details of despatch and
     disposal of all vehicles at the scene in accordance with the 'Vehicle Record Book'.

INSTRUCTION CARD - VEHICLE POUND OFFICER
(Motorways and Multiple Accidents)

It is expected that if a major incident occurs on a motorway there will be a larce number of        xr   29£
vehicles involved and it will be necessary to set up one or more 'Recovered Vehicles Areas' to
which all broken down, accident damaged, etc. vehicles will be removed from the scene along
with other vehicles required to be stored for safe-keeping or inspection. The Vehicle Pound
Officer wiil obtain the Vehicle Pound Book and the 'Recovered Vehicles Area' signs from the
major incident box and go at once by poiice vehicle to the area indicated to him by the Site
Commander. His duties will be as follows:—

     1       Establish the 'Recovered Vehicles Area' ensuring that it is signed.

     2      Receive vehicles from the incident.

     3-     Record details of vehicles in accordance withe the instructions contained in the
            Vehicie Pound Book.

     4      Ensure that the 'Recovered Vehicles Area' and its contents are secure.

     5      Ensure that no vehicles are removed from the 'Recovered Vehicles Area' except
            with his authority.

The Vehicle Pound Officer will seek whatever assistance he requires in the way of additional man­
power or equipment via Force Operations Room.

                                         (Staff and Duties)


Initially the first radio equipped police vehicle at the scene will act as the Police Incident Post.
However, as soon as possible and in order that the Site Commander can assume en'ective oper­
ational control and co-ordinate activities at the scene, it is essential that he has a properly estab­
lished and readily identifiable Police Incident Post situated in a strategic position on the site.

The Post wiil be a reporting and briefing point for Police supervisory ranks, specialists, senior
officers of other services and persons in charge of other organisations. It will also be the on-site
administrative and communications centre for Police control purposes.

The Site Commander will assign particular tasks to supervisory officers in charca of teams of
personnel. These tasks are detailed on the "Instruction Cards” contained in the major incident
boxes. (See SECTION 11, Cards A to N).
                                                                                      SECTION 13


                           DUTIES OF ROAD TRAFFIC DIVISION


Where a msjor incident occurs anywhere in the Force area, responsibilities of this department          XB 200
will include the following:—

1    KEEP TRAFFIC ROUTE CLEAR

     (a)    On receipt of instructions from Force Operations Room, they wiil establish and
             maintain traffic routes in the vicinity of the site. Regular inspection and super­
            vision will be necessary to ensure that routes are kept clear for emergency vehicles.

     (b)    During daylight hours, where traffic problems are likely to be greater, the use of
             Police motorcycles for supervision of routes should be considered. Such vehicles
             have obvious advantages for many purposes — eg dispatch.

2    ESCORT DUTIES

    Where civilian vehicles have been employed as ambulance's and life is in danger, Police
    vehicle escort will be undertaken.

3    RADIO LINK WITH OPERATIONS ROOM                                                                   XB 301

     One mooiie will be directed to the site, the crew will be responsible for establishing a tem­
     porary base station. This can be achieved by utilising the VHF/UHF repeater radio. UHF
     Channel 25 should be used and communication to Operations Room wiil be on Force
     Channel 2. A telephone link should be established if possible.

4   TRANSPORTATION OF MAJOR INCIDENT BOXES

    On receipt of instructions from Operations Room, will transport the Force major incident
    boxes from Force Headquarters to the site.

5   SECURITY OF THE SITE

    Together with other available personnel will seal off the site for reasons of safety, security,
    or in the interests of the investigation. Such action wiil be carried out under the direction of
    Operations Room.

6   TRANSPORT

    The supply of suitable transport (including drivers where available) for persons, property or
    equipment is a primary responsibility of the department.
                                                                                           SECTION 14



+                   DUTIES OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION DEPARTMENT


    In any Major Incident members of this department will have a role to play. The actual rofe they         XP. 302
    wiil be called upon to fulfil will of course depend upon the nature of the incident. In the event of
    the incident being caused by terrorist activities, then it would clearly be the responsibility of the
    department to carry out a full scale investigation with the aim of bringing the perpetrators to
    justice.

    In other types of incident such as a rail or air crash, their role would be entirely different. The
    exact nature of it would be decided by the senior officer in charge of the incident. The depart­
    ment would probably be involved in the interrogation of witnesses and the taking of statements,
    being responsible for lost and found property and its documentation.

    When it is known that a major incident has occurred, and that the Major Incident Plan has been          XB 303
    implemented, all detectives should immediately report to the senior detective in their respective
    sub-division. They wiil form a small reserve available for deployment by the Operations Room in
    liaison with the Site Commander.

    Additionally, when such an incident occurs, all members of the HOLMES Incident Room staff
    and operationai detectives attached to Headquarters wiil report to Force Headquarters. The
    senior officer in charge will report to the officer in charge of Operations Room the fact that this
    team is ready for deployment.

    In the event of this incident being non-criminal, some detectives may be usefully employed at the
    Police Incident Post, etc.

                                                  FATALITIES

     GENERAL PRINCIPLES

    Dealing with fatalities is a second priority to be considered after the protection and preservation           Xr
    of the living. If it is practicable, it is in the interests of proper investigation and identification that
    dead bodies and parts should be disturbed as little as possible in the first stage of attending to the
    incident. This is especially important when the incident is an air crash. Whatever the incident
    much time and trouble can be saved if all matters relating to the dead are dealt with methodically
    and carefully. HM Coroner and his staff are responsible for dealing with the dead and everything
    possible should be done to enable them to carry out their tasks as normally as possible, in accor­
    dance with the usual procedures. They have been asked to contact Operations Room should they
    require any type of assistance.

     HM CORONER

    Where a major incident occurs involving a large number of victims the Coroner for the are3 and                XR33
    his staff will be informed by Operations Room as soon as possible. A list of personnel to bs called
    is maintained at Operations Room.

    The Coroner will inform Operations Room as to what premises he intends to use and if necessary
    will send a representative to liaise with the police commander at the site of the incident.

    TEMPORARY MORTUARY ARRANGEMENTS

    There is no need for the police to obtain the approval of the Coroner regarding arrangements for
    the temporary accommodation of bodies at the site. Should it be necessary to sst up temporary
    mortuary accommodation of a more permanent nature consultation wiil take place with the
    Coroner for the necessary arrangements to be made.

    It is essential that premises used as temporary mortuaries should have good access from the read XR 335
    and ideally should be such as to enable a vehicle to be driven into the building and away from
    public view. A telephone is essential but if necessary a telephone can be quickly installed by
    arrangement through Operation Room. Emergency lighting can be arranged if required.

     It is important that a 'waiting area' should exist, with telephone, toilet facilities, etc., separate,
^    but net too distant from the mortuary. It is to this are3 that relatives will be directed. Members
    -of the public will not be directed to, nor permitted to attend at temporary mortuaries.

    As far as possible, temporary mortuaries and premises used for post mortems, etc., will be staffed
    by members of HM Coroners' Departments, supported by additional personnel as necessary.
    Arrangements for personnel to staff mortuaries will be dene through Operations Room. Mortuary
    personnel wiil be responsible for searching and preparing bodies, documentation, etc. Stocks of
    identification forms, casualty record forms, etc., are kept at HM Coroners' offices.

    Supplies of clothing and equipment suitable for use in connection with temporary mortuaries are XR 336
    held at all Coroners' offices in the area. Supplies of rubber gloves, sheeting, coffins, etc., can be
    obtained when required vis Operations Room.

    Separate instructions for personnel working at mortuaries have been prepared and copies are
    available at all Coroners' offices in South Yorkshire.
                                                                                       SECTION 21

                                                                                              Page 2


 UNDERTAKERS

 It will be the responsibility of Operations Room to arrange for undertakers to assist in the trans-   XR 336
 port of bodies from the site to mortuary accommodation, should such service be appropriate. It
 is desirable that bodies should be accompanied by a police officer, but circumstances may make
 this impossible.

 The Coroner may request Operations Room to arrange for the assistance of undertakers to
 provide accommodation, personnel or transport.

 J H Kenyon Ltd are a firm of international undertakers able to attend the scene of a major            XR337
 incident in less than four hours. Further information concerning this firm is given at Appendix
 'A'. In consultation with HM Coroners and the police, the firm will deal with all matters relating
 to the de3d, including the removal of bodies, identification, the return of property to relatives,
 funeral arrangements, etc. The firm is retained by all the large civil aviation companies and wiil
 cesi with all air disasters involving those companies. Clearly the firm's expertise would be
 invaluable in dealing with any type of incident where there are particular difficulties or the
 number of fatalities is large.

 HM Coroners for South Yorkshire have agreed that the police should call upon the services of this     XR338
firm if the circumstances of the incident justify this course. In the event of such a major incident
occurring the officer in charge of Operations Room, after consulting with the Site Commander,
will be responsible for asking the firm to attend. It must be stressed that HM Coroner or his rep­
resentative must be consulted before this action is taken unless undue deiay is likely to be
occasioned. In cases of doubt, however, J H Kenyon Ltd should be called even without prior con­
sent from HM Coroner, since the firm have stated that they will attend a major incident even
though their services may ultimately not be used and that having arrived they will consult with
the Coroner prior to taking any action.

LA3ELLING OF BODIES AT SITE

Bodies and parts of bodies should not be removed without first being labelled and the position in      * * 339
which the body was found being marked. Photographs will be taken. Every body and every part
vvill have a separate label.

It is extremeiy important that only ONE person should be charged with the responsibility of
allocating numbers to bodies, although the labelling, marking of location, dispatching, etc. will be
done by a team using the specialist disposable clothing contained in the major incident boxes.
The person allocating numbers will maintain a record of every body which is lacelled, showing
details Oi its condition and position at the site and the place to which it is taken. Contained in
the major incident boxes is a 'Body Book’ designed for this purpose.

Body labeis are contained in all major incident boxes and should be fixed as securely as possible
to the body or part. If practicable the number should be marked on the body using indelible
crayon.

The location where the body lay should be marked with a stake or other suitable object and the
stake labelled using the same reference number as the body.
                                                                                       SECTION 21

                                                                                              Page 3


 PERSONAL ITEMS FOUND WITH BODY AT THE SITE

 Bodies should not be searched. It may be feasible to enwrap the body completely in plastic             X R 340
 sheeting or in a plastic bag or place it in a coffin before removal and thus keep all personal items
 and effects together with the bcdy to which they belong.

 An item of personal property (eg a handbag) found lying near a body, should not be assumed to
 belong to that body. Such property should be secured in a beg labelled 'Found near body
 labelled.......................... '. This property wiil go with the body.

Larger items of property such as iuggsge will not go with the body but after labelling wiil be dealt
with as detained property (see instruction card 'Lost and Found Property Office'.)

 DOCUMENTATION OF BODIES FOUND AT THE SITE

All bodies and parts of bodies should be labelled as set out above. All bodies should be made the       XR 341
subject of a 'casualty record form', books of which are contained in the major incident boxes.
This applies to bodies which are incomplete but does not apply to parts. In cases of doubt a
'cssuaity record form' should be completed. As far as possible a 'casualty record form' should be
completed at the mortuary accommodation as the body is being ceait with there. Property and
effects may give valuable information as to identity.

Where circumstances indicate that it is desirable to complete a 'casualty record form' before a
body is removed to mortuary accommodation this should be done but the body should not be
searched. All 'casualty record forms' should include the body label number and any othere
reference to the body, and detaiis forwarded to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.

REMOVAL OF BODIES FROM SITE TO MORTUARY ACCOMMODATION

When it is necessary to move bodies from the site, they will be taken to the local mortuary or to       XR 342
a temporary mortuary. Where possible bodies should be accompanied by a police officer but
circumstances may make this impossible.

At the request of the Site Commander, Operations Room will make the necessary arrangements
for transport to be used to move bodies.

Coroners have mace arrangements with local undertakers for them to stand by in the event of
emergency.

Eeiore a body is allowed to be removed from the site, a check will be mace to ensure that
sufficient accommodation is available at the place to which it is being sent.

DOCUMENTATION OF BODIES AT HOSPITALS

Where a person is involved in a rr.aior incident and is removed to hospital but subsequently dies,      XR 343
it is anticipated that the body wiil be lodged at the hospital mortuary from whence it will be
removed only on the direction of HM Coroner.

It is important for purposes of identification that ail clothing and property accompanying the
body should be retained with it. The police officer acting as liaison with the hospital should point
this out to the staff and will complete a 'casualty record form' for every such body. The form
should include ail hcsoitai, ambulance and other references.                              '
                                                                                      SECTION 21

                                                                                             Page 4


SPECIAL MORTUARY ARRANGEMENTS

Where large numbers of bodies are involved, or where investigation or identification is likely to be   XR 343
difficult cr protracted, it may be that the refrigerated accommodation which is normally
available at mortuaries, hospitals or undertakers' establishments is insufficient. The Coroner wiil
make whatever arrangements are necessary regarding such accommodation and preservation.

                                                FATALITIES

     J H KENYON LIMITED, FUNERAL DIRECTORS

     This Company, who ac* on behalf of all major British Airlines and several foreign Airlines, have        XR 347
     proved to be invaluable at the scene of major air disasters. They work closely with the path­
     ological team, and their wice experience dating from the R38 airship disaster has enabled them to
     perfect their procedures.

     The Company is based at 83 Westbourne Grove, London W2 4UI. Telephone 01—229—3810.
     Telex number 265346.

     They will arrive quickly at the scene with a field team, having been informed by the airiine
     involved-, and should have with them a written authority to act on behalf of the airline to oe=i
     with funeral arrangements and with any property handed over to them. The field team normally
     consists of five members, but where the total number of casualties exceeds fifty an additional
     two members are attached.

     Amongst the major problems facing Poiice at the scene of an air disaster are those related to           XR 548
     property, identification, and the disposal of the bodies. Kenyon’s procedure is divided into five
     main operations:

          1     recovery of the remains;
          2     identification;
          3     arrangements for disposal;
          4     removal to the place of disposal, and finally disposal by burial or cremation;
          5     recovery, renovation, cleaning and identification of personal and other effects.

      So far as the recovery of the remains is concerned, Kenyon's are well aware that this will
      normally be carried out by the local Police and Ambulance Services who wiil remove bodies to a
      mortuary, but they stress that every effort should be mace to prevent personal effects and
      Ciothing being moved from the bodies prior to xne arrival of the investigation team. Kenyon's
    ‘ starf are aware that permission must he obtained from the local Coroner and the Polics before
     any examination can be carried out.

    IDENTIFICATION OF THE REMAINS

    Much distress csn be caused to relatives by delay in the ice.ntificaiton of the bodies of the            XR 549
    victims, particularly where bodies are badly mutilated, and in neariy all cases, even in relatives are
    available to view the remains, it is undesirable. However, relatives and friends who do travel to
    the site wiil be dealt with very tactfully by Kenyon's field team, who base their identification on
    the followina:

         (a)     cental;
         (b)     documents;
         (c)     clothing;
         (d)     jewellery;
         (e)     physical;
         (f)     photographs;
         (g)     fingerprints. ^
                                                                                     SECTION 21

                                                                                   APPENDIX 'A'

                                                                                            Page 2


ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THE REMAINS

Although Kenyon's are primarily Funeral Directors, they will make arrangements with relatives         XR 350
who wish to use their own Funeral Directors, but as a first step 150 metallic lined coffins are
always held in readiness by Kenyon's in London and Birmingham for immediate despatch to the
scene of the accident.

REMOVAL TO THE PLACE OF DISPOSAL

This is deait with entirely by Kenyon's after a meeting with the local Coroner.

RECOVERY, RENOVATION, CLEANING AND IDENTIFICATION OF PERSONAL AND
OTHEREFFECTS

Before leaving the scene of operations, Kenyon's obtain possession of all personal effects            XR 351
removed from the bodies, or salvaged from the wreckage, where this is property of a non-
contentious nature. (Non-contentious in the sense that matters related to HM Customs or
suspected crimes do not arise.) This relieves the Police of the task of retaining and disposing of
property, and dealing with the heavy bolume cf correspondence in connection with the same.

In the matter of identification, Kenyon's field team quite often know the pathologists concerned,
and the field team are equipped with forms which assist in obtaining medical or dental evidence.
It is advisable at an eariy stace to have a meeting between the Police Officer in charge of the
incident, a member of Kenyon's field team, the pathologist, and HM Coroner, in order the*
arrangements for the disposal of the remains can be made.

From the foregoing it wiil be seen that the arrival of the Company at the scene of an air'aisaster,   XR 352
to act on behalf of the affected Airline, can result in the relieving of the Police from many
otherwise burdensome tasks. However, it must be stressed that this does not remove from the
Police the task of making initial arrangements relating to the safeguarding, labelling and preser­
vation of bodies and property, providing temporary mortuaries, and having available property
lists for HM Customs and Excise.

It is advisable to have a Police Officer of supervisory rank available to liaise with Kenyon's
representative throughout the incident. Kenyon's are well aware of the need to maintain a close
and friendly relationship with the local Medicai.'Legal and Poiice Authorities and naturaily they
will require sdvics in localities where they have not previously worked.

                               MORTUARY LIAISON OFFICERS

In the event of a Major Incident occurring which justifies the establishment of the Casualty           XR 354
Enquiry Bureau and which involves many dead persons, arrangements have been made with the
coroners for the areas of South Yorkshire that a police sergeant will go to each mortuary
receiving bodies and there report to the coroner's officer. (Separate arrangements have been made
with regard to hospital mortuaries, which will be the responsibility of the Hospital Liaison
Officer).

Kept at each coroner's office is a reserve of necessary equipment which includes a wallet con­
taining casualty record forms, deceased person's property forms and a copy of this Section of the
manual.

The Mortuary Liaison Officer will consult with the Coroner and Coroner's Officer to establish the
number of additional police personnel necessary to attend to carry out the police tasks at the
mortuary. He will inform Force Operations Room, who will make the necessary arrangements for
staff to attend. He should also indicate to Operations Room any items of equipment needed and
they will make the necessary arrangements.

 It is intended that the Coroner’s staff and the police staff should work together dealing with each   XR 555
body in turn. The Coroner's staff will strip, search and otherwise deal with the body. A police
officer wiil complete a casualty record form in respect of all bodies. This applies to bodies which
are incomplete, but does not apply to parts. However, in cases of doubt a casualty record form
should be completed. The mortuary staff wiil be completing their own records which will
necessarily contain specialist details of medical or forensic importance. The casualty record form
should not include such details but should contain information which may enable identification
to be established.

Depending on the circumstances, it has been found of great benefit in previous major incidents to
assisgn an individual police officer to each body. In this esse the teams would attend at the
mortuary and an officer would be allocated a body to try and establish its identity.

The officer would familiarise himself with the body and any property on or with it. He would           XR 355
accompany the body through the post mortem stage, gathering further information. That officer
would then licise ciosely with the Casualty Enquiry Bureau in an effort to complete identific­
ation.

It is appreciated that it is not always practicable to follow this procedure and the decision to do
so will lie with the Mortuary Liaison Officer is to transmit the details from the completed
casualty record form to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau, so the relatives and friends may be enabled
to identity and trace injured and deceased persons as soon as possible. Thsi will be done by tele­
phone, the telephone number of the Casualty Enquiry 3uresu being obtained from Operations
Room.

The second, but equally important task is to provide a line of communication between the mor­
tuary and Force Operations Room, and hence to the scene of the incider.:.

                                   CASUALTY ENQUIRY BUREAU

 GENERAL

 If a Major Incident occurs within the South Yorkshire Police area, or if an incident occurs wit-.in        X R 353
 another police area and numbers of casualties are received at hospitals within the South
 Yorkshire Police area, it wiil be the responsibility of the police to trace the relatives or friends of
 persons injured or killed and inform them of their condition and whereabouts. Allied to this
 responsibility is the general police duty to investigate or assist in the investigation of circum­
 stances giving rise to death or injury.

In order that these duties may be efficiently carried out, the police will set up a Casualty Enquiry
Bureau to which all enquiries and information relating to persons involved in the incident wiil be
directed, in order that collation of this information may be undertaken and, where required,
passed to relatives etc.

The establishment of the Bureau will also mean that many telephone cails will be channelled to
it which would otherwise be made to Operations Room, hospitals, etc.

 ESTABLISHMENT

It will be the responsibility of the Duty Officer in chsrge of the Force Operations Room ro                 XR 353
decide when the Bureau should be activated and esch incident must be assessed individually. C:n-
sideration should be given to the potential numbers of casualties, and/or enquiries regarding
casualties, and it should be borne in mind that a long delay in implementation wiil cs.se
unnecessary pressure upon Operations Room personnel.

It wiil be the responsibility of the Training Department to make the following arrangements:—

      (a)    Prepare the Bureau for use;
      (b)    Call out the necessary personnel;
      (c)    Inform the Hospital Administrator(s) orother responsible person that police
             officers are attending the hospitsi(s)to act intheir capacity asHospitalLiaison
             Orficers;
      (d)     Circulate by message switch, a message to all stations setting out the arrange­
              ments for the Casualty Enquiry Bureau and telephone number r.o be used by

               i.   the public, arid
              ii.   the police.

CONSTITUTION AND FUNCTION OF THE BUREAU

The Casualty Enquiry Bureau is located within the Force Training Department Communicstic-s XR : s o
School, Ecdesfield. The staff consists of one inspector (officer in charge), two sergeants (next :f
kin clerks) and ten other personnel who may be police constables or special constab es
(operators). The staffing level of the Bureau may be modified dependent on circumstance-.

The officerin charge of the Bureau will beresponsible for theefficientoperation of the Bureau
and itsstaff. He will ensure that all enquiries arecorrectly dealt withand all necessary records
and documents are completed and maintained.




                                                                                       <   g   :
                                                                                     SECTION 23

                                                                                            Page 2


He will also be responsible for the calling out of any relief personnel, bearing in mind the period   X R 360
of duty that Eureau personnel may have completed prior to the activation of the Bureau, and the
length of time they may reasonably be expected to operate efficiently. His responsibilities will
also include the liaison between Community Liaison and Crime Prevention staff at the hospitals,
mortuaries and incident site and the Casualty EnquiryBureau.

He will also be responsible forinforming the appropriate administrator(s) that police officers are    XR 361
en route to act in their capacity as Hospital Liaison Officers.

Telephones on both the national and internal lines are provided in the Bureau. The national
number to be used by the public will be released by the officer in charge of the Operations Room
to pre-arranged locations, including the media, when he is advised by the officer in charge of the
Bureau that he is ready to receive calls.

External unpublished national exchange lines are also provided into the Bureau for the exclusive
use of hospital, mortuary and incident site liaison staff. These numbers are held within the docu­
mentation which will be made available to officers responsible for hospital and mortuary records.
It is imperative that these latter numbers are not made public.

PROCEDURES FOR PASSING INFORMATION TO THE BUREAU

Information regarding persons injured or killed in the incident will be passed to the Bureau from     XR 362
three main sources:—

     1      the incident site;
     2      the hospitals;
     3      the Mortuary.

1    The Incident Site

     A casualty record form should be completed in duplicate for all persons treated at the
     scene and allowed to Ie3ve without attending the hospital as a patient.

     The Site Commander will designate officers to undertake this task at a convenient
     assembly point. The casualty record forms are contained in the Major Incident boxes
     with further supplies available in the Casualty Enquiry Bureau. The information on
     these completed forms should be passed by teiep’none to the Bureau. The national
     number of the Bureau for police use only is contained within the Major Incident boxes,
     but in the event of difficulty it can be obtained from Operations Room.

2   The Hospitals and Mortuaries                                                                      XR 363
and
3   Inspectors in charge of community liaison departments at divisions and their deputies
    will call out staff in accordance with pre-arranged procedures to man the receiving
    hospitals and mortuaries when they are advised by the Casualty Enquiry Bureau that
    the Bureau is being activated and this action is required.

    The full curies of these personnel are set out in Sections 22 and 24, but briefly they
    will pass details of all injured and dead persons, identified or otherwise, to the Bureau
    by telephone.
                                                                                      SECTION 23

                                                                                            Page 3


PROCEDURE FOR RECEIVING ENQUIRIES FROM THE PUBLIC

Members of the public who telephone the Casuaity Enquiry Bureau using the publicised numbers          XR 364
will be asked to supply information to enable a casualty enquiry form to be completed. This
information is matched up with the information relating to the casualties provided by officers at
the various receiving points.

Members of the public who make a personal visit to Force Headquarters or any other police
station to enquire about a possible casualty should be given the facility to telephone the Bureau.

If the Bureau is unable to immediately give them the information they require such persons
should be advised not to w-ait at polics stations, but to return home where they will be told of
any information which comes to police knowledge.

It can be anticipated that telephone calls wiil be received at police stations and Force Operations   XR 355
Room and such calls should be channelled to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau either by divisional
or Operations Room staff, giving the Casualty Enquiry Bureau public emergency telephone num­
ber to cailers. In the event of such callers being unable or unwilling to make an additional call,
officers should take details and notify the Bureau via message switch.

 It is for the officer in charge of the Casualty Enquiry Bureau to decide whether cr not a person
msking an enquiry should be given detaiis of a casualty. Where it has been decided    give details,
but it appears inappropriate to give them over the telephone, the person enquiring will be asked
to return to a fixed address, when arrangements will be made fcr the information to be passed by
telephone or message switch to the poiice station near to that address in order that personal con­
tact can be established.

No detaiis wiil be given out from the Bureau other than by telephone or message switch on the         XR 355
Command and Control computer, to prevent members of the public congregating at Force
Headquarters or the Casualty Enquiry Bureau, seeking information.

Detaiis of persons dead or injured wiil not be issued directly to the media by any member of the
Bureau. All items for publication will be issued through the Fores Press Officer.

A 'detailed plan of what initial action is required by the Inspector, Operations Room, to
commence the Bureau is held by Operations Room. Within this plan is a list of personnel who
may be called upon to assist him set up the Bureau, and further lists of persons trained to operate
the system.

 I he Superintendent, Training Department, will be responsible for maintaining the lists in           XR 367
Training Department and Operations Room of those personnel who may be called ucon to set up
and arrange the Bureau. He wiil also be responsible for arranging for the training of personnel in
the operation of the Bureau system and maintenance of the lists of persons so trained.

It is anticipated that prior to the Bureau being activated many calls will be receded at Force
Operations Room from persons seeking information regarding friends and relatives. Where it is
known the Bureau will eventually be activated, callers should be requested to monitor local/
national radio and/or BSC and IBA Television, where the appropriate Bureau telephone number
will be broadcast when the Bureau commences operation. This will assist to clear the 999 tele­
phone lines and the British Teiecom exchange lines into the Headquarters switchbcard enabling
Operations Room to attend to the requirements of the incident. It is emphas:sed that the
decision to activate the Casualty Enquiry Bureau must have been taken before persc~s enquiring
are given the above instruction.
                                                                                    SECTION 23

                                                                                           Pace 4



Prior to the decision to activate :_e Bureau being taken, enquiries will be recorded by Operations   XR 2S8
Room in accordance with norrra' procedures, obtaining sufficient details for an enquirer to be
contacted later if necessary, anc arrangements should be made for all this documentation to be
passed to the officer in charge cf :~e Bureau if it becomes operational.




                                                                                                              *
                                                                                       SECTION 24

                                                                                              Page 1


                                 HOSPITAL LIAISON OFFICERS

 In the event of a Major Incident occurring which justifies the establishment of a Casualty Enquiry      XR 370
 Bureau, arrangements have been made with hospitals in the County that police officers, from
 Divisional Community Liaison and Crime Prevention Deparrr.entss, will go to the Casualty
 Department of the hospital and there report to the person in charge of casualty documentation.

Officers attending will take with them the Hospital Liaison bcx which is kept at their respec­
tive offices. This bcx contains casualty record forms and stationery and protective clothing
required to administer the scheme.

The box also contains a copy of this Section of the manual and the telephone number of the
Casualty Enquiry Bureau. Force Operations Room will sucpiy this number in case of any
difficulty. Although there may be a delay in the call being answered whilst the bureau is being set
up, the officers need take no further action to establish comnvjnications, other than to ring this
number from time to time. At some hospitals there may not be a telephone available for police
use and in these circumstances officers will have to use telephones at adjacent premises.

A casualty record form wii! be completed in duplicate for every casualty involved in the incident,       XR 371
whether the casuaity is discharged, detained, moved to another hospital, found to be deed and
moved to another mortuary etc. The information required tc complete the form is largely seif
evident but every effort should be made to obtain as much accrete detaii as possible.

This information will be supplied by the hospital staff although it may be possible for an officer
to obtain information for himself. The work of the police off'cers is of a secondary importance
to that of the hospital and officers must use their discretion so that they obtain information
without causing disruption to the working of the hospital.

Particular attention should be paid to the dead and to unconscious persons so that ail details
which may assist in the identification are obtained and preser.ed. This includes trying to ensure
that hospital staff do not destroy clothing, property, etc., nc matter how insignificant it may
appear.

it is also important that details of the whereabouts of the casualty at the time the incident            XR 372
occurred be obtained, if possible — ie whether he was the occ_cant of any vehicle invoived, etc.

Inspectors in charge of divisional community liaison departments are responsible for maintaining
i:aison with their respective receiving hospitals, and the maintenance of the boxcontaininc the
required documents, i hey are also responsible for the trainir.: of their staff in their respective
roles at receiving hospitals. They may call upon the Force Tracing Department to assist in this
matter.

 i he prime task of the hospital liaison officer at the hospital is tc obtain and transmit information
■rom the hospital to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau so that relati.es and friends may be enabiea to
identify and trace injured persons as soon as possible. The secc~d, but equally important, task is
iO provide a line of communications between the hopsital ard Force Operations Room, and
hence to the scene of the incident.

 i hese are vital links in the organisation and under no circumstances will the officers be diverted     XR 373
1 om their tasks to deal with public order problems or any other incident occurring in the vicinity               *
cf the hospital.
                                                                                      SECTION 24

The hospital liaison officers will retain the casualty record forms for reference purposes after the   XR 373
information has been transmitted to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau. The officers should endeavour
to obtain updated information — eg transfers, deaths, discharges — and it may be that further
information concerning casualties will come to hand from other casualties, relatives, etc. This
additional information should be transmitted to the Casualty Enquiry Bureau.

                                            FLOODING

Flooding is rarely confined to a small area; it is usually widespread but there is invariably         X R 415
previous warning of it, and rarely does it assume Major Incident proportions. In this Fores srea,
flooding is most likely to occur as a result of heavy rainfall (or snow) causing overflow of rivers
and/or flooding of low lying areas when normal drainage systems become inadequate. It is
possible that East Coast high tides could result in a flooding situation in the Doncaster area.

The rivers likely to flood in our Force area are the Rivers Don, Rother and Sheaf. There are a
number of flood level monitoring points where the exact water level can be established. These
points are as follows:—

 RIVER ROTHER, CATCLIFFE, ROTHERHAM                                                                   XR 416

To ascertain the water level, telephone 0246—450687. Add the number of bells (feet) and buzzes
(inches) to 189 feet to ascertain the current water ievel. A preliminary warning will be issued by
Yorkshire Water when the level reaches 198 feet and rising. An action warning will be issued by
Yorkshire Water when the Ievel reaches 199.5 feet. Occupants of houses adjoining Orgreave Road
and Sheffield Lane should be warned of possible flooding.

 RIVER DON, NEEPSEND, SHEFFIELD

To ascertain the water level telephone Sheffield 344404. The amount of water above normal is
indicated by bells (feet) and buzzes (inches). If the height above normal exceeds 2 feet notify
Yorkshire Water.

RIVER DON - RIVER SHEAF, BLONK STREET, SHEFFIELD                                                      X R 417

There is a marker on the wail viewed from Bionk Street across towards Castlecate indicating the
water level. The danger level is 147.5 feet. When it exceeds this, notify Yorkshire Water.

RIVER DON, CHANTRY BRIDGE, ROTHERHAM

There is a marker on the wall against Chantry bridge indicating the water level. Inform Yorkshire
Water when the Ievel reaches 75 feet and thereafter at intervals of 6 inches.

RIVER DON, LONG SANDAL, DONCASTER

When the river level is 30 feet at St Mary's Bridge, Yorkshire Water wiil notify the Police, giving
one of the following warnings: —

     1      River steady, no risk of flooding unless prevailing conditions worsen or a
            ■breach occurs in the floodbank.

     2      River rising, gives a maximum of six hours warning before overtopping of the
            floodbanks occurs.

Police Action:                                                                                        XR 418

Alert public in areas of risk.
When the level reaches 35 feet Yorkshrie Water will inform the Police and Doncaster
Metropolitan Borcuch Council giving one of the following warnings: —
                                                                                     SECTION 29

     1      River steady — a general acrcn warning will not be given unless conditions              XR 418
            worsen or a breach occurs in the floodbank, in which case flood imminent
            warnings will be given.

     2      River rising — issue flood imminent warning to areas at risk (using local press,
             radio, public address in mobiles, etc.)

RIVER SHEAF, HEELEY BRIDGE, SHEFFIELD                                                               XR 419


The level will be monitored by the courcii depot at Duchess Road, Sheffield and by the
Yorkshire Water rain gauge at Dore. If flccdir: is imminent the police will receive the following
warnings:—

     1      Preliminary Warning — River Sheef at 54.90 metres and rising. Flooding at
             Heeley Bridge imminent.

     2      Action Warning — River Sheaf at 55.05 metres and rising. Flooding at Heeley

                             RAIL ACCIDENTS - SPECIAL MEASURES

The beiow listed instructions are in addition, and not in substitution of :ne instructions con-
tained in the general sect'ons of this manual.

The prime responsibility in connection with accidents on the railway rests upon the railway
operating staff and the British Transport Police in accordance with their own instructions.
However, it is likely that members of our Force will be first on scene zr.d they must assume
control until relieved by 2 responsible railway official.

FORCE OPERATIONS ROOM

1    Inform the Sheffield Power Box Supervisor of British Rail, Sheffield or the Divisional
     Control of the British Transport Police at Leeds about the incident, even though probably
     unconfirmed.

2    Sub-divisional control and officers attending the scene should be made aware of the fol­
     lowing:—

     (a)    Action must be taken immediately to prevent further canger by warning                      XR 424
            approaching trains. In addition to red flags and handlamps. canistors of deton­
            ators are carried (usually in a biack leather haversack) by ai! *‘ootplate crew and
            railway guards. Detonators are also stored in signal boxes and some platelayer
            cabins.

            All obstructed lines must be protected ON THE APPROACH SIDE of the scene
            by placing detonators as follows:—

              i.   Dne  detonator a quarter of a mile from the obstruction;
             ii.   or,= detonator half a mile from the obstruction.
            iii.   thrse detonators 20 yards apart, one mile from the obstruction.

            Track circuit operating ciips are carried in every driver's cab. They comprise
            two matai ciips which are wide enough to clip onto the lire and are joined by a
            piece cf yellow plastic covered wire. When fastened to the track it indicates, via
            the sigr.si system, that there is an obstruction on the track.

            When the railway track consists of double lines, the adjacent line is normally             XR 425
            used by trains travelling in the opposite direction. Line protection should be
            carried out first on the adjacent line(s) because the lire on which the train
            itself was running wouid normally be protected by the signalling system.
            However, in the case cf derailment this track shcuid also ce protected.

            Although British Rail staff are responsible for carr.'ng out these safety
            measures, the first police officer at the scene should ensure that any necessary
            safety action is taken, including the isolation of overhead electrified lines. Such
            officers must keep a sharp lookout for approaching trains.

    (b)    In each guardsvan or compartment is a ladder, a tool cupboard and an
           ambuiance box suitably marked with white letters on 3 red background. The
           tool cupboard contains hand tools and crowbars.

    (c!    Deta    s   of the best access routes shouid be obtained is a matter of urgency.            XR42S    *

                                                                                                   Page 2


    3   Notify British Transport Poiice.                                                                    XR 426

    4   Special safety measures may be necessary at the site if the train was carrying a dangerous
         load such as petrol or explosives. Nominate an officer to ascertain details of the load carried.

    5   Nominate an officer to report the position of the nearest bridge and/or signal box in re'ation
        to the crash point together with the identification number marked on such bridge or signal
         box.

    SITE COMMANDER                                                                                          XR 42?

    1   Ensure that the scene has been protected from other trains.

    2   Establish contact and liaison with the senior British Rail official and the British Transport
         Police officer.

    3   Arrange for a senior detective officer to investigate the incident in liaison with the British
        Transport Police, bearing in mind the possibility of sabotage, etc. Such investigation rust not
        interfere with the rescue operations or the clearing cf the lines for resumption of ".ormal
        services.

    4   Where aiternative transport arrangements have been made, detail officers to obtain -ames
        ana addresses of ALL uninjured passengers and their intended destinations before they leave
        the scene. All such information to be passed to the Casuaity Enquiry Bureau.

SAFETY ON OR NEAR RAILWAY LINES                                                                      XR 428


1   For safety reasons police officers (including British Transport Police officers) must not oo
    on or near railway lines unless absolutely necessary.

2   If :t becomes necessary to go on or near railway lines, police officers should always be aware
    of the hazards which can arise from the movement of trains; electrified conductor rails or
    ov-.'hesd power lines; remotely operated points and restricted clearances on bridges and
    cuttings. It is essential that officers maintain constant vigilance and avoid trains and elec­
    trical equipment when on cr near the railway.

3   Whenever possibie permission must be obtained from the railway authorities before going on
    or near railway lines and a decision must be taken in conjunction with the raiiway auth­
    orises concerned whether trains need to be stopped.

4   Whenever circumstances permit, the poiice officer making the initial contact with British        XR 429
     Rail must arrange for a lookout man to be provided. This can be arranged with the senior
    Iccai railway official, or in case of difficulty with the nominated railway contact points -
    ie

    EAnNSLEY/SHEFrlELD/ROTHERHAiW                            Leeds Operations Centre
    MSX30R0UGH areas
    DCNCASTER area                                           Doncaster Operations Centre

5   Cc“tact should be made with Force Operations Room who will make immediate contact
    w in the nominated railway contact point as above, ail of which are manned 24 hours. The
    ccrtsct points have direct telephone links with signal boxes and electric traction power
    cc'trol rooms.

6   Tre nominated contact point wiil need to be given a brief outline of the circumstances,
    together with reasons why it is essential for trains to be stopped or electric traction power
    to re switched off, or why police officers need to be on the line. On receipt of the infor­
    mation the contact point will:—

    (a:    be able to make such action as is necessary to facilitate those requests;                 XR 430
    (bj    confirm to Operations Room when trains have been stopped, electric power
            switched off, etc; •
    (c;    advise British Transport Poiice Headquarters Information Room.

7   Tre foilowing precautions must be taken whether or not a British Transport Poiice Officer
    or = raiiway employee is present, as it is appreciated that there are occasions where
    irr.—ediate access is vital:

    (a;    If practicable, officers shouid waik at the sice of the line facing the airection
            of oncoming trains where known. If it becomes necessary to cross over a line,
            the officer should:—

             i.   avoid crossing at points and junctions;
            ii.   make sure the lines are clear;
           iii.   cross quickly avoiding stepping on any rails as on some lines a third
                  rail carries an electric current.
                                                                                        SECTION 30

                                                                                               Page 4


              Modern Trains can approach, possibly from either direction, at h'gh speed with            xp   450
              very little noise. Even after brakes are applied, trains may travel up to a mile
              before coming to a halt. Although most trains are fitted with headlights, there
              are stiil some fitted with dim lights only.

      (b)    Vigilance must be maintained at all times and special care exercsed in areas of            X 8 431
             restricted clearance — eg bridges, cuttings, etc.

      (c)    Officers should not enter tunnels or cross viaducts etc. unless satisfied that
             train movements have been stopped, or lookout protection has ceen provided
             by the railway.

      (d)    When it becomes necessary for a police officer to go on to or in ccse proximity
             to railway lines, he should (if necessary) call for the assistance ;f a police unit
             carrying a high visibility tabard, in addition to asking for the ess'stancaof rail­
             way staff.

 8 A police officer must not question or distract any signalman, driver or c-_erd who is on duty.       AT?432
    A police officer must not enter any signal box except in instances c-5 extreme danger as
    disturbances of concentration might lead to further complications. If is not possibie to
    wait until that person concerned has finished duty, the poiice officer rust arrange for the
    person to be properly relieved. At the scene of an incident the officer must contact the
    senior railway official present or, in other circumstances, the British r.aii Area Manager
    responsible for the person concerned.

 9 Following an incident on or adjacent to railway lines, it will take seve.'si minutes after the
    request for train movements to be stopped and electrical supplies isolated. Cutting off the
    electric traction power wiil not stop ail trains, as some trains using the same line'msy use
    diesel traction. Trains may also continue to coast after power has .beer, cut off. Therefore
    it is essential that adequate lookout protection be maintained and necessary precautions
    taken against electrocution.

     Before taking further action it must be assumed that the eiectricai supc'v wiil still be 'live'    XR 433
     and that train movements are likely to continue until assurance is recei’.ed from the nomin*
     ated railway contact point that the current is off and (if necessary) all reins on that section
     or line have been halted by the railway authorities.

10   If it is necessary to rescue an injured person on roiiing stock close :c overhead eiectric
      power lines, an officer shouid not allow (because of the cancers of arci-gj any part of his
      body to come within TWO FEET of any live eiectricai equipment, c'rken or displaced
      wires, or foreign matter such as rope that is in contact with overhead e ectrical equipment.
      Officers should not climb above the interior floor level of locomotives zr carriages, or into
      wagons or freight vehicles unless the overhead electrical power lines - ave been isolated.

11   If trains have been stopped, or electrical traction power switched off, !: is essential that all   XR 434
      parties involved are left in no doubt when trains are likeiy to be movir: again or electrical
      power is to be restored. Before any police officer subsequently tells the senior railway
     officer at the scene, or the nominated railway contact point (when a rai way official is not
     present), that trains may restart and/'or the electrical traction power be 'estored, the police
     officer must ensure that everyone who has been involved is clear of the li-es and is told that
     normal working is being resumed. If British Transport Police are in atte-.dsnce, the senior
     orficer present of that Force is ressorsibie for ensuring that these procedures are carried
     out. The officer responsible for requesting the restoration of services rr.st also ensure that
                                                                                         SECTION 20

     Operations Room is informed that normal working is being resumed. When electric traction             XR 424
     power has been switched off, the request to restore power MUST be from the person who
     requested to be switched off,

     However, if the request to switch o f f the electric traction power C 3 m e from a police officer,   XR 425
     but the power is unlikely to be restored for a lengthy period — eg a serious incident -
     before tha*. police officer leaves the scene for any reason he must report to the police officer
     in charge cf the incident. The police officer in charge of the incident must then liaise with
     the senior railway official present in order to allow the officer to leave the scsne without
     the electric power having been restored. When a police officer leaves an incident in circurri'
     stances described above he should ensure that Operations Room is advised.

12   Unless there is good reason to suspect that a crime is involved, a dead body on the line must        XR 43S
     be moved hs quickly as possible in order to enable rail services to be resumed and thus mini*
     mise disruption. If, for any reason other than crime being suspected, it is considered
     necessary to photograph a body at the scene, it shouid be moved clear of the line and not
     left in pcs’tion, pending the arrival of a photographer. If crime is not suspected, a police
     officer shcjid not require a body to be left in position on the running line.

13   By the ve~/ nature of fatal accidents on railway lines, bodies are often dismembered and
     parts of t‘ = body spread out ever considerable distances. When bodies or limbs are moved
     clear of tr.s lines, train will often restart and run normally.

     ALL PERSONS ON THE TRACK MUST REMAIN VIGILANT AS TO THEIR OWN AND
     OTHER PERSONS' SAFETY.

                  HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS - EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

The following guidelines are based on training given to the Police in such incidents, and on advice   XR ■
from the Chemical Industries Association.

1    When dealing with hazardous chemicals it must be borne in mind that the inhalation of
     fumes and vapour from, or any physical contact with, any spillage of hazardous chemicals
     can have fatal or serious consequences. The Fire Service is specially trained and equipped to
     deal with this aspect and all related rescues, including the decontamination and the handing
     over of casualties to the Ambulance personnel.

     Should police officers suddenly find themselves in the path of a 'vapour cloud’ they should
     take cover in enclosed premises, immediately advising members of the public to do likewise.
     If in a vehicle all windows and vents should be closed, and the heating system switched off.

2    On receiving information of such an incident, Force operations Room must be informed             XR -
     immediately and they will control all such incidents.

     Operations Room will ensure that the Fire Service is requested to attend immediately and
     thst the Ambulance Sen/ice is alerted.

3   The Operations Room Inspector Will ascertain the direction and speed of the wind from the
     Leeds Meteorological Office. He vviil identify a Road Traffic mobile whose crew is fully
    trained in dealing with such incidents and direct that mobiie to the scene via a safe route —
    ie upwind from the incident.

    This mobile will be parked in a safe area and a member of the crew will liaise with the senior
    Fire Orricer present in an attempt to identify the chemicsi/substance involved, and msksan
    immediate situation report to Operations Room.

    The crew wiil not leave the safe area and will not attempt a rescue. The crew will be c’esig*     XRA
    nated as the INCIDENT CONTROLLER and wiil perform no other duties than:—

    (a)    controi of the incident;
    (b)    liaison with the Fire Service;
    (c)    liaiscn.-adviscr to the Senior Police Officer assuming control cf the incident.

    SENIOR OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT TRAINED IN KAZCHEM PROCEDURES SHOULD
    NOT GIVE INSTRUCTIONS WHICH CONFLICT WITH THOSE ADVISED 5Y THE
    INCIDENT CONTROLLER.

4   Other available Road Traffic mobiles wiil be directed to specified safe iccstions to effect
    necessary road closures, tratfic diversions and to keep the public away from the scene.

    IF THE INCIDENT IS ON A MOTORWAY, ONLY ROAD TRAFFIC PERSONNEL WILL
    BE INVOLVED ON THE MOTORWAY.

5   If not already aware, Operations Room will inform the affected sub-divisional control room        XR4:
    and direct that a senior officer attend the scene by a safe route and liaise with the 'Incident
    Controller'. Other sub-d.ivisional personnel will only approach the scene by a safe route and
    then only as far as the communications vehicle. All personnel ar the scene will await further
    instructions.
                                                                                     SECTION 32

                                                                                           Pace 2



 6   Operations Room will maintain constant liaison with the Fire Service conrol and other           XR453
     agencies, who will attempt to ascertain from these sources such information that wiil
     identify the chemical substance involved.

     This information wil. usually be achieved from information contained in the hazchem
     warning panels or labels displayed on the tanker or container involved. The tirver should be
     properly trained and if available should supply information about this substance.

     If no such markings are displayed it does not necessarily mean that the substance is not        XR454
     hazardous. The Fire Service Control are in possession of s 'Harwell' computer which holds
     information on all known chemicals, identification numbers and action to be taken in
     emergencies.

 7   These methods will identify the full extent of the hazard - ie the possibility of explosion,
     the extent of toxic :as release and firs* aid information. Once this is known, Operations
     Room wiil pass this information to the Senior Police Officer and ail personnel involved.

     Operations Room lr;pec;or wiil confer with the Fire Service control and ensure that
     specialist help is requested and if necessary assist with the conveyance of such personnel to
     the scene.

 8   If the nature of the chemicai or Substance, or the situation report identifies a Major          XR455
     Incident, or potentia Major Incident, then the full Major Incident pian must be put into
     operation immediately.

 9   Operations Room m ir. ensure that safe routes to and from the scene and relevant hospitals
     are well policed to ai :w free passage for emergency vehicles. If the incident is protracted,
     periodic checks must :e mace with the Leeds Meteorological Office to ascertain any chances
     in wind direction anc sceed.

10   The Force Authorise; Hazchem Officers are the Inspector and Sergeant of the Accident
     Investigation Branch. They should be informed of the incident and their assistance sought.

11   i he Operations Rcer. Inspector wiil ensure that a telex message is sent to the Cleveland
     Constabulary, who are responsible for collatina information on all such incidents on behaif
     of ACPO.

                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act
                    Stewarding at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.,
                    Hillsborough. Sheffield

                    I am advised by a member of my staff, who has attended recent games, that
                    there has been a lack of effective stewarding on the Kop, resulting in                     ©
                    the crowd occupying the radial gangways as additional standing areas,
                    throughout the games.

                    Although it is appreciated that these games were important Cup-ties and,
                    therefore, attracted increased crowd capacities, stewarding omst be of a
                    quality and of such numbers as to maintain these gangways free from                        ©
                    congestion during performances.

                    It is also understood that the turnstile capacity on the Penistone Road
                    frontage was insufficient, and that many of the spectators were still
                    entering the ground up to 15 minutes after the kick-off.
                                                                                                           ©
                    The combination of late arrival and ineffective stewarding could lead to
                    dangerous occurances.                                                                 <s>
                    It is considered that the Club should be made aware of these matters and
                    be required to. confirm   t _ste^wajding will Jje made available to keep these
                    areas clear.                                     ”      *    ...

                    This is possibly a matter that should be raised at the next meeting of the
                    Working. Party, so that police and fire authority comments may also be sought

 from Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 18 February.                                                                    We

                          With the exception of a small hut and the steel
                 clad groundsman's accommodation, which are both
                 located under the ramp and not the stand, the timber
                 clad buildings have been removed.
                      We believe that the reference in the minutes
                 dated 7 August, 1985 was to storage facilities and
                 not to buildings.

     removed so that the width of the exit route is not
     reduced.
     b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.
     c)   Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
     repaired but, as has always been accepted, the
     repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
     jo b   .
     d)   The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
     people from climbing onto the steelwork but to act
     as a guard preventing spectators\lamaging and
     possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
          We disagree that spectators climb onto the
     steelwork in large numbers although we do not deny
     that the police have, at some matches, had to tell
     a few specta-ors not to sit on the steelwork.
          The cost of erecting a full height fence
     would be several thousands of pounds. The Club is
     not at present contemplating that magnitude of
     expenditure just to protect a few spectators from
     their own foolish behaviour.
     e)   There are four or five lengths of barrier
     where the drop in front is just over one metre,
     but as far as we are aware this has not created
     any hazard. In fact to the contrary, because
     people can leave the ground by going under the
     barriers onto the lateral gangway. This is a
      common feature of most league grounds.
           The welding is performing well and it seems
      that any additional vertical support is
      unnecessary.         However, the welding can be inspected
      at regular intervals to make sure that it con­
      tinues to held the mesh securely.

      f)      Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
     the ground.      The keys then remain in the possession
     of the steward(s), given the responsibility of
     unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
     match and all spectators have left the ground.

     West Stand
      a)   Do we understand correctly that the
      reference to 'timber framed and clad units' is to
      the bar fittings at first floor level? If so, then
      those fittings were part of the original construction
      for which Building Regulations Approval has been
      granted. There has not been any previous comment
      about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
      or other stands. We do not consider that they
      present a hazard.
      b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
      letter dated 15 January.

      South Stand

      a)      (i)   We note the comment about the doors and
      this point has been dealt with under the regular
      procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
      the Fire Precautions Act of 1971 for the offices.
      Fire Officer Roger Woodhouse has been dealing with
      the matter.
          (ii)      We see the principle behind the creation
      of fire compartments. That is sensible. Sealing
      off the windows is not difficult but the provision
      of ducting to the south wall is, and furthermore
      very expensive. A major exercise such as providing
      ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
      redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.
EASTWOOD * PARTNERS                                    SHEET




        (iii) We agree that stored materials should be
     removed from stairways and exit routes. There is a
     particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
     ground floor level, but the caterers have been asked
     to clear that particular area well before the public
     are admitted on match days..
     b)    (i) It was agreed in 1979 that the fans
     ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
     be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
     controlled shutters. Those grilles and shutters
     were fitted although we see that two recently
     installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
     and shutters. As the form of fire protection from
     those lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
     Service,the Club are not prepared to have ducting
     installed* although the new. fans should perhaps be
     fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
     shutters.
          (ii) A close inspection of the gas supply pipe­
     work in the five bars revealed that four bars have
     valves fitted to the feed pipe or to the appliance
     when there is only one appliance in the bar. The
     pipework in the bar nearest to the Spion Kop has
     been replaced recently but without a valve.
               However, there is a master valve, at
     ground floor level, which isolates the gas supply
     to the whole of the first floor. That valve was
     installed at the request of the Fire Service in
     1980.
         (iii)    We confirm that all the timber facing onto
     the public circulation areas was treated with an
     intumescent paint during the work carried out in
     19 80. Since then the walls have been re-decorated
                                  4   -   ^




EA S T W O O D »   PARTNERS                              SHEET




        but this does not reduce the effect of the
        intumescent paint underneath.
             (iv)      We cannot understand this comment because
        the paint store was constructed in its present
        position on the advice of the Fire Officer. A
        special 'non-sparking' light fitting was even
        installed on his recommendation. It is not contem­
        plated to move the store again after spending money
        to build the store in its present position.
              (v) We do not consider that the two laminate
        covered toilet kiosks present a hazard. As for the
        wooden cupboards, they have been on the first floor
        for many years and no previous adverse comments
        have been made by the Fire Service about their
        presence.
             (vi) We agree that the holes ro'und the cables
        should be plugged with an appropriate fire resisting
        material.
            (vii) As far as we are aware all doors leading
        onto the first floor and ground floor circulation
        areas were provided with 25mm rebates and the doors
        made up to a nominal one hour standard.   That work
         was done in 1979-80.
            (viii) We agree that the spaces above toilet
         accommodates should not be used for storage but
         believe that the Club have now removed the stored
         materials.
         c)   We believe that clinbing over the existing low
         wall does not present any difficulty in the event
         of an emergency. Spectators will go over the wall
         whether there are gates or not. We do not consider
         that the installation of gates is necessary.

        d)   Escape through the rear of the stand has always
        been accepted by the Officer Working Party. Further­
        more, it has been readily accepted with the
        protection which has been provided so far to the
        escape routes.

        Automatic Fire Protection
             We will suggest to the Club that proposals
        should be put forward for the provision of a fire
        detection system but the system is not likely to be
        installed until the major re-development of the South
        stand which is planned for 1991

        Emergency Lighting

             Testing of the emergency lighting system is
        being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
        Service in the next day or so to agree a date and
        time for carrying out the test.
             The testing of the general electrical circuits
        will also be organised over the next few weeks and
        a current IEE Certificate produced.

        Fire Alarms .
              The Club was told by the Fire Service to put
         the call points in the bars in the stands. Moving
         the call points again is out of the question.

         Inidcator/Control Panel
              The Officer Working Party was asked, at the
         time of installation, where the indicator/central
         panel should be placed.    The Club was told that it
         should be located in the Police control centre,
         where it is now. No duplicate panel was asked for

                 The comments about the gates- are noted.

     The Club have expressed to us'their increasing con­
cern that with the introduction of each new member of the
Fire Service to the Officer Working Party new or
different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
which in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
offered by his predecessors. Whereas we agree that many
of the observations and recommendations are of a
subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
personal opinion. Some consistency in the comments
offered by members of the Officer Working Party would be
appreciated.




                                                Yours sincerely, -

Dear Sir,

FA CHALLENGE CUP COMPETITION
SEASON 1987-88
SEMI-FINAL TIES
SATURDAY 9TH APRIL 1988

As is customary this time of the Season, I am writing to'
enquire whether your Club would be interested in staging
an FA Challenge Cup Semi-Final Tie on Saturday 9th April
1988 or a Replay during the following mid-week.

I would inform you that you may charge 10% of all gross
gate receipts, less V.A.T., for the hire of the ground.
I would also like to take this.opportunity of clarifying
the position with regard to Executive Boxes. For Boxes
leased out for the Season we would require a payment equal
to the number of seats at top ticket price, while in the
case of Boxes hired out on the one-off basis for the match,
your Club will be entitled to retain 50% with the rest
being paid into match receipts. These amounts, however,
should not .be included in the gross gate receipts when
calculating the fee for the hire of the ground.

In the event of your Club playing in a Semi-Final Tie,
would you still be prepared to take the other Semi-Final
Tie on your ground the same day, bearing in mind the
administrative cost involved?

 for matches of this nature. Clubs should also note the new
 requirements of Challenge Cup Rule 26(b) whereby the two
 competing Clubs shall be entitled to 50% of the tickets for
 sale. The Association in Its absolute discretion may vary these
 allocations.

 Details of spectator segregation should be provided together
 with details of the present ground capacity, number of seats
 and standing places also Indicating if safety fencing is
 provided around the pitch.

  Clubs should also note that any special areas such as
  Executive, Vice-President, family or any similar seated or

A t the last annual safety i nspection at the H il ls borough
F ootball Ground it became a p p ar en t that the bolt type
fastenings in the p e r im et er t rack fence access gates was
inefficient, this being due to difficulty in operation
w h e n u n d e r pressure from the terraces which forced the
bol t against the keep p r e v e n t i n g novement.
A t this time it vas agreed that the club w ou ld attempt
to obtain some secure f astenings for the gate w h i c h could
b e e asily operated in an emergency. I have t oday (in c om pany
w i t h o th er members of the s a f e t y committee) v i s i t e d the
g round when a prototype l ever operated fastening was d e m o n ­
strated. (This is fitted to gate number 6 on the Spion
K o p perimeter fence).
This fastening was far s u p e r i o r to the present bolt fastening.
It is easily operated by one hand even when the gate is under
pre s s u r e from the terrace. It also has the great advantage
that it is impossible to inter fe re with from the terraces.
The committee agreed the new fastening was satisfactory and
could be fitted to all the perimeter track gates, both at
Hillsborough and Brajnall Lane.

I request that a copy of this report be forwarded to Operations
Department, Police Headquarters, for their information and
circulation to other divisions who may have a similar problem
at grounds in their areas.

           S.W.F.C. - Building Surveyor's memorandum of 2.2.88

           The Building Surveyor's representative outlined the
           memorandum and the circumstances which gave rise to it.
           Superintendent Stuart indicated that the gangway problem
n          had been discussed with Sheffield Wednesday who were
           going to take measures with their Stewards in an attempt
■V-
           to resolve it. As far as the turnstile question was
           concerned, a pattern hag developed of people arriving^--
           some 15 mins. before the start of the game hoping to
           gain admission. This trend may be due to the banning of
           alcohol at sports grounds which could lead to people
           going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football
           match. As th® available turnstiles operated quite
           effectively      the majority of the time, and that the
           late arrival problem could perhaps only be dealt with by
           education of spectators.'



           Owlerton - General Principles

           Discussion took place about the south and east terraces
           which Eastwoods in their original report had recommended
           be closed. There was no disagreement with the idea of
           closing the south terrace (which is in a very poor
           condition), but.whether or not there should be
           maintained along the front of the terrace a public
           walkway so that complete public access could be allowed
           around the perimeter ..of the stadium was not finalised.
           It was mentioned'-that the Company planned in due course
           perhaps to re-site the speedway pit on the site of the
           old south terraced"

           Tnere was a fairly lengthy discussion about capacity
           principally revolving around Eastwoods' original capacity
           estimate of 6,781 people. There was also discussion
           about controlling the access.of spectators to particular
           areas or zones of the stadium by various means. It was
           recognised that such area control would be difficult as
           the stadium is net at the moment physically split into
           different zones or sections. As the stadium at the
           moment requires considerable works to. be undertaken to

                 SUBJECT:     items for de-briefing re F.A. Semi-final 9th April 1968

                On S a t u r d a y 9th April I was duty sergeant in the Operations
                Roo m and I would like to submit m y observations concerning
                the foot b a l l match.

                1.    O perational    Orders

                      T raffic              no problems with this order other than the
                      fact that no call signs had been allocated to the three
                      p u b l i c order patrols at Woodall Services, Ml. It was not
                      until they cane on the air that we knew who was on this
                      detail. It was necessary to then create a d u t y rota on the
                      c o m p u t e r and allocate callsigns (X 1 0 1 , X 1 0 2 ,X 1 0 3 ). It would
                      have b een m u c h better if this had been cater ed for in the
                      order.

                     '•F* D ivision - no problems, other than the fact that Operations
                      Room c ia not receive a copy of the order. One was obviously
                      c o p i e d from another held at headquarters.

                     ’D* Divis i o n - this order catered very w el l with ’D ’ Division
                     involvement, the precise details of p r i m a r y and secondary
                     routes bei ng useful. One problem encount ered was that the
                     t r a f f i c signals on the Ml exit slip roacs at Catcliffe
                     we r e not turned off; officers were w o r k i n g traffic against
                     the lights. This ma tter was subsequently r esolved but should
                     be catered for in any similar operation.

                     Doc Section - Operations Room did not r e c eive a copy of any
                     order or duties in relation to duties at the match. It was
                     s f airly l e n gthy task creating a duty rota on the computer
                     for' all the dog handlers involved and in future advance
                     d uti es for such operations should be supplied in advance.

               ^ ‘ lT£e of spotter plane

                     As you know we did have         problems initially w i t h air to
                     grcund communications, buz once these p r o b l e m s had been
                     r e s o l v e d the assistance cf the spotter pl a n e became
                     invaluable. Prior to the natch, Operations Room were given
                     good accounts of traffic flow into Hil lsb o r o u g h and traffic
                     hold ups were reported. It was then p ossib le to give
                     instr uctio ns to officers on point du ty,vi a other match
                     controls, to ease the hold ups.

                     Ironically, there was a      two mile tailback reported on the
                     A616 at O u ghtibr idge - traffic building up through Karncliffe
                     Side to Deepcar. The hold up was on L ow R o a d ,Oughtibridge
                     wh e r e public order patrols manned by the Underwater S e a r c h
                     Unit were stopping and searching vehicles travelling into
                     city.                                -■               _         ‘

               The mate'- ’signing' on the motorway was pathetic, as was the route signing for
               both sets of fans. We need to consider the acquisition of LARGE CLEAR and
               easily portable signs as a master of urgency. We were trying to encourage
               Northbound catch traffic to use only the nearside lane of the Ml North after
               Catcliffe and the only signs we had were 18" square propped up at intervals on
               the hard shoulder where no one could see then. We should consider flexible
               signs that we could attach 'gantry sty l e ’ to the overhead bridge at the A57
               junction North (and also bridges on the motorway for Southbound spectators which
               give clear instructions to visiting fans and which they cannot fail to see).
               Subject to your agreement, I will arrange for Superintendent Brougham to
               research that area and report relative to cost etc. I do not envisage any great
               su~ bs i n e involved.

               The spotter plane was - as always - a real asset, but although we thought we had
               it right this time and the cor.-unications worked at rehearsal, they failed us on
               the day.  We will try again on Spring Bank Holiday when Middlesborough cone to
               Oakvell versus Barnsley.

               If you agree in principle with these very general consents, I would intend to
               circulate these papers to the Divisional Commanders concerned for their
               infcrsaticn and future discussion.

f                          I refer to the enclosed correspondence regarding the above event. I have
                           liaised with the officers concerned with the preparation, control end
                           supervision of the above event and we have noted locally the lessens that
                           were learned and the improvements that can be Race for any similar future
                           ever.t. Generally I w h s well satisfied with the event ar.c I will confine this
                           report to matters which effect the Force Cperaticns R o o t , and F.oac “Traffic
                           Department.

                           CO.'-C-f-^nCATIONS

                       Cn the cay more use than normal was made of the radio link between ground
                       .control at Hillsborough and the Operations roccr. in attempting to contact
                       those units equipped with both ground control and UHF radio. This was
&                      entirely due.to difficulties in personal radio transmissions which were
                       effected for most of the event by breakthrough from local radio. The
                       Superintendent (Communications) is aware of this and an immediate survey
1                      of the equipment was made after the eveni, but the fault cculd not be traced.

                       TRAFFIC FLOW A.VD CONTROL

                      Transmissions in relation to problems with traffic, from mobile units ar.c
                      the spotter plane were being received at Cperaticns room ar.c were not
                      monitored at ground control. It ss-srr.s sensible to me that for future 'seeds'
1                     all matters relating to the control end movement of traffic should be
                      supervised by Operations room, with the exception of the local arrangements
I                     made immediately outside the ground when tine final whistle is blown.

                       FOCTEALL TRAFFIC SIGN'S

n                     Purpose made signs have been requested in the past, but for financial
                      reasons have not beer, approved. . Such sicr.s are extremely beneficial and
                      it is pleasing to note that Superintendent Brougham is locking into this
                      aspect.                        'i-

                      SEARCHING CF COACHES FCR ALCOHOL ArJSE ETC.

                      The effect of alcohol on football supporters is well known ar.c I would not
                      wish to see any relaxation of enforcement of the laws relating to the carriage
                      of alcohol on coaches etc. It is appreciated that this can cause seme traffic
                      congestion, but surveys are beina carried out on the major roads approaching
                     .the city to "establish where this can be carried out to cause minimur.
                      inconvenience to trarfic flows.

                      CLCSZ CIRCUIT TV LINK WITH WADS LEY ERIPGE STATION'

                     A TV monitor was sited in the control room giving pictures from Wacsley Ericge
                     Railway Station. This BorJ.tor took up valuable rocr, in the control area ar.c
                     was of little use and I would not wish such a system to be implemented in tr.e
                     future.                                   '•

          THE SAFETY OP SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

          ANNUAL INSPECTION OP SHEPPIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
          ON THE 19th MAY, 1988

          I write with reference to the above aad following our receat site meeting
          and safety inspection of the named premises.

          I would confirm that while the general standards of health and safety
          being maintained were found to be satisfactory a number of points did
          require attention.  I have itemised these below for your convenience.
\
          Spion Kop Development

          1.     The pylon situated to the left-hand side of the kop was not suitably
                 protected from unauthorised access and climbing.

          2.     To several locations around the kop, accumulations of associated
                 builders wastes and stonework that could easily be obtained for use as
                 projectiles were noted.

          3.     At some positions within the new development, there is a difference in
                 height between a terraced area and radial gangway of over 600mm. I
                 would advise that these areas be protected by a suitably constructed
                 pedestrian guardrail.

          4.    An area of stair nosing was found to have become defective upon the
                "new" part of the spion kop and a similar defect was located upon ttie
                older radial gangway.

          5.     Some areas of the front terracing were found to be In need of minor
                 repairs.

          6.     A loose rainwater pipe and length of guttering were located to one of
                 the Penistone Road turnstiles.

           7.    An area of glazing serving one of the Penistone Road turnstile huts
                 has been broken.

           8. The club might consider the now combustible nature of much of the
               vegetation situated immediately behind the spion kop and take the
               appropriate remedial action.

           9.     The rendering to the entrance gate side wall was still found to be in
                  a loose and defective condition.

          DESCRIPTION:                         One hydraulic pump complete with tvo hydraulic cylinders.
                                               The force on the cylinders, under an app-ied force is
                                               measured by a pressure gauge sounted on the purp.


          IDENTIFICATION:                      Pump: D943005
                                               Gauge: BG? 168 SR
                                               Cylinder 1: 04773                   Model RC 55AF9N
                                               Clyinder 2: 04772                   Model RC 530J8N


          METHOD

          The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0.5 lever arm testing machine                                                                  in
          terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty                                                                of
          the forces applied during the calibration is ^0.52*

          Three tests were made on each cylinder.
                                      <           .
          Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

                  Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
    part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
    The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124,                                                                      124A,          125 to 128,
    1 2 8A,             129 to 136,                  136A,          137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
    the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane e n d of the ground.
 The location of the barriers tested is shown on o u r drawing
    1 610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
                  The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
 procedure set out in Appendix C of the                                                                'Guide to Safety at Sports
 G r o u n d s '.
                  In all but one case the barriers tested,                                                              successfully
w i thstood the applied load.                                                     A clip over the rail of barrier 124
br o k e before reaching the full test load.
                 Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also these tested on the
Leppincs Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.

        The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
 replaced now.      There wai' also a lot of movement of the rail on
 barrier 144, when tested,and we also recommend that that rail
 is also replaced.
        As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
 be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144/ before
 the start of the coming season.
       Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
 results of the barrier tests.

                          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                Annual Inspection of Hillsborough Stadium as required
                             by the Certificate of Ground Safety



                On 18 July 1988, I made an inspection of the ground
aaxing the time that this year's quota of crush barriers
were being tested by my firm.
             The results of the crush, barrier testing are given
in a separate report of today's date.
                I made a visual inspection of all the main structural
reaiures of the ground.                                   Particular attention was paid to
gates ^ d              entry and exit routes and to boundary walls and
fences.                No- significant defects were noted.
             The roor of the South stand was inspected from the g r ound.
Kc deterioration in its condition was observed.
             I            certify that in my opinion the various structures on
the ground are in a satisfactory condition and appropriate for
the stadium to be used to the full capacity as laid down in
the Certificate of Ground Safetv.

Dear Mr Mackreil

FA C H A L L E N G E CUP COMPETITION
S E A S O N 1 9 SS - 89
S E M I - F I N A L TIES
S A T U R D A Y 15 APRIL 1989

As is customary this time or the Season. I a- writing to
e n q u i r e whether your Club would be interested in staging
an FA Challenge Cup Semi-Final Tie on Saturday 15 April
1989 or a replay during the following mid-week.

I w o u l d inform you that you may charge 107. of all gross
gate receipts, less V.A.T., for the hire of the ground.
I w o u l d also like to take this opportunity of clarifying
the posit i o n with regard to Executive Boxes. For Boxes
leased out for the season, we would require a payment equal
to the number of seats at top ticket price, while in the
case of Boxes hired out on the one-off basis for the match,
your Club will be entitled to retain 507* with the rest
b e i n g paid into match receipts. These amounts, however, sho
not be included in; the gross gate receipts when calculating
the fee for the hire of the g r o u n d .

      In the event of your Club playing in a Semi-Final Tie, would
      you still be prepared to take the other Semi-Final Tie on
      your ground the same day, bearing in mind the administrative
    . cost involved?

      Please indicate if your Club has the necessary insurance cover
      for matches of this nature. Clubs should also note the
      requirements of Challenge Cup Rule 26(b) whereby the two
      competing Clubs shall be entitled to 507. of the tickets for
      sale. The Association in its absolute discretion may vary these
      allocations.

      Details cf spectator segregation should be provided together
      with details of the present ground capacity, number of seats
      and standing places also indicating if safety fencing is
      provided around the pitch.

      Clubs should also note that any special areas such as Executive.
      Vice-President, family or any similar seated or standing area
      cannot be retained by the staging Club. All parts o f ’the ground
      rust be allocated entirely for the two competing Clubs with
      the exception of Directors Box. which will be controlled by this
;•    Office.

      An early reply would be appreciated as the Challenge Cup
      Committee will be selecting the venues at their meeting to be
      held on .Monday 20 March 1988 and it is essential for the
      above information to be prepared fcr the Committee prior to
      the meeting.                "

     For the attention of Superintendent Stuart
     Headquarters Operations
     Dear S ir,
     Safety of Sports Grounds - Draft Kevised SafetT Certificate Conditions
     1 refer to jour letter of 4th August 1987 in connection with draft Safety
     Certificate Conditions* 1 now enclose for your attention a copy of the final
     draft of the new Certificate Conditions which take into account the observations
     aade in your letter.
     Tou will however notice that there are no references as such to the Police
     vithin the Certificate. I have carefully considered this utter and have eo»e
     to the conclusion that Conditions which purport to delegate the Council's
     functions to outside bodies are unenforceable as they are beyond the powers of
     the Council. Therefore several Conditions which were included in the first
     draft (relating to for example discussions between Certificate holders and the
     Police) have been deleted or modified.
      1 ate, of course, conscious of the very important Police role in
      connection with the safety of spectators at sports grounds and 1 have therefore
      taken two steps to ensure that this role is properly recognised in the
      certification system. Firstly the definition of "authorised officers” la the
      Conditions includes Police Officers. Secondly there Is also a nev Condition
      which relates to guidance given by the Council on safety matters. A draft of
      the proposed guidance is enclosed with the new Conditions and you will see that
      it refers largely to Police/Certificate bolder relations.
      Would you please let me have your cossents on the draft Conditions in due
      course.                                        ’

                       GUIDANCE FOR SAFETY 'CERTIFICATE HOLDERS •


  INTRODUCTION

  This note has been prepared by the Sheffield City Council ia'Jorder to inform
  Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety Certificate
  Conditions-  The Council in dealing with Safety Certificates'takes advice froa
  the Chief Fire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director of\Health and Consumer
  Services and the Council's Building Surveyor*. These Officersv'and the Council
  itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
  specified activities are reasonably safe.

‘ m
  GUIDANCE
    ■■■ iil
          i ii«                                              - W f l .t
                                                              •     *     ’


  Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
  should be acted upon in accjrdance with the time constraints'given in the '
  advice.  The holder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure the
  reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.

  The Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
  relation to "public order" situations the correct handling of which should
  reduce any risk to spectator safety.

  The Chief Constable aiust therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
  the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative
  purposes.  These facilities are essential if public order is to be maintained
  and the risk to spectators minimised.

  T he Chief Constable must also be informed at the earliest possible cement of the
  proposed date and content of all specified activities so .that appropriate
  planning can take place.

  In addition there must be consultation and agreement between the holder and the
  Chief Constable well in advamce of specified activities about the proposed
  methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation must also
  take place if advance information is such that public order difficulties nay
  arise.  As a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
  cay require, for reasons of preserving public order, that the specified activity
  is "all ticket" or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
  Stadium or the day and the time of the specified activity should be changed.

  The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever means are appropriate to
  exercise control over spectators for reasons of safety and as part of this
  control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas of the
  Stadium.

Safety of Sports Grounds - Draft Revised Safety Certificate Conditions

I refer to your latter of 13th August 1987 (your reference FP19/2/4:RG/E3) ia
connection with Safety Certificate Conditions.

I now enclose for your attention a copy of the final revised Safety Certificate
Conditions which as far as possible incorporate the comments made in your
letter.   You will appreciate that the wording of certain of your concents has
had to be amended slightly but I hope that the objective has none the less beer,
achieved.

There are four points which require some further consideration:-

          (a)     You say in your letter that an age range should be specified in
                  connection with stewards.  I think however that the wording of
                  Condition 11 should be satisfactory without stipulating an age range.
                  No final decision has yet been taken on this issue and you cay like to
                  consider it further;

          (b)     police knowledge of the whereabouts of a doctor - I believe this is
                  adequately covered in Condition 7;

          (c)     identifisbility of press T.V. and radio personnel - I am not sure of
                  the justification for such a Condition and wonder if you have any
                  further comments on it;

          (d)     the attendance of competent electrician - again I wonder what the
                  justification for this Condition would be.

Would you please let me have your comments oa the new Conditions in due course.

Yours faithfully,                                                                                            '

as we had arrived,                  our    serial was          i ns tr u ct e d to go to the            perimeter

track     in front           of the West Stand.                 I u n d e r s t o o d that      there was a

X w a l k e d onto       the    track       in front       of t he .West Stand.                 I noti c e d that

the       o %p k l 1     f l ay er s were         on the pitch,        although      I cannot          say     whether,

the game        had          in fact started,            of if it was the         pre -m at ch w ar m          up.           At,,

this     time    1 was        not aware          of a ny th i ng      untowards,          I c o nt in ue d     round

noti c e d t h a t ,the        people       directly       behind the         fencing were             screaming

and shout^tg            at us to do something                   as    they were      getting          crushed.

I was     sifet at       by a number             of fans.        I saw that         the    people at          the

fertcyng were           being       crushed up to the                fence and a young            girl       aged

abafit    15 years was              e x t r e m el y squashed.          She was      crying and obviously

  .stressed.            I bent       down to her and told her not                     to     panic      it w ould be

alright.         The     people       round her were             trying      in vain to          push back away

from her.         She was           in pen N o . 3         a rea to my       left    of the      railing,          w hich

d ivides     pens 3 and 4,                 There was      no way        of getting to this              girl.               I

initially s h o u t ed          to the          crowd to       push backwards,            but    I realised

imemdiately            that    this was          of     no use.       A y ou th aged about            16 years              old

climbed      up onto          the    fencing.             1 climbed onto a metal                bar    in front             of

the    fence and h el p ed                him over.        Once      on the track          I told him to stay

there and he             did,, as requested.               Other      fans   f ol lowed suit and               I

helped them            climb    over       the fence and onto              the   perimeter            track.           I was

t hen joined by a number                    of male       o ff icers who also             star te d     pulling

people     over        the    fencing.           As they were          taller    and s tr anger          than          I,       I

m o v e d out    of the way,              thi nking      they w o u l d get more           people       out quicker

and    relieve         the    crush ar ou nd the girl.                  There was         nothing more             I

could do at            this    point       so    I went    to gate       number 4, w h i c h had been

opened.

Detective Constable 3211



Headquarters Drug Squad



On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I commenced duty in full uniform at Police

Headquarters, Sheffield.     I then attended at the gymnasium at West Bar

Police Station for a briefing at 9-00 a.m.

After the briefing I walked to the Midland Station, Sheffield, to take

up duties as part of West Bar serial number 16.                    On arrival at the

station I was engaged in the control of football fans alighting from the

trains.     Both Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans arrived at the

station and were segregated and directed through separate exists and on

to P.S.Vs, which were waiting to take the fans to the Sheffield

Wednesday Football Ground.

At approximately 2.30 p.m., together with the rest of my serial, I

travelled to the ground on a P.S.V.

At approximately 2.45 p.m. tho hue I -was on                wqo   driven down Leppings
                         ~    ^        *i > - ' f y - ' i
Lane.     At %hio tine I notioe-d there appealed to be a large crowd of fans

still outside the ground, and a large number of people walking from the

direction of Halifax Road along Leppings Lane towards that entrance.

On our arrival at Penistone Road, I alighted from the bus and walked

into the ground via the main police access road.

Together with the other officers from my serial I went to the gymnasium

where we were to report for standby duties.                  Almost as soon as we had

arrived, our serial was instructed to go to the perimeter track in front

of the West Stand.     I understood that there was a problem with the crowd
                                         - 2 -



    but I did not know exactly what.

    I walked onto the track in front of the West Stand.    I noticed that the

    football players were on the pitch, although I cannot say whether the
                                          the.
    game had in fact started, or if it was a pre-match warm up. At this

    time I was not aware of anything untoward.     I continued round the track

    until I got to the centre of the West Stand.    That was when I noticed

    that the people directly behind the fencing were screaming and shouting

    at us to do something as they were getting crushed.

    I was spat at by a number of fans.     I saw that the people at the fencing

    were being crushed up to the fence and a young girl aged about 15 years

    old was extremely squashed.    She was crying and obviously distressed.      I

    bent down to her and told her not to panic it would be alright.     The

    people round her were trying in vain to push back away from her.     She

    was in pen no. 3 area to my left of the railing, which divides pens 3

    and 4.    There was no way of getting to this girl.   I initially shouted

    to the crowd to push backwards, but I realised immediately that this was

    no use.    A youth aged about 16 years old climbed up onto the fencing.      I cHmbeA

        onto a metal bar in front of the fence and helped him over.     Once on

    the track I told him to stay there and he did, as requested.     Other fans

    followed suit and I helped them climb over the fence and onto the

    perimeter track.    I was then joined by a number of male officers who

    also started pulling people over the fencing.     As they were taller and

    stranger than I, I moved out of the way, thinking they would get more

    people out quicker and relieve the crush around the girl.     There was

    nothing more I could do at this point so I went to gate number 4, which

     had been opened.

     Some fans were climbing over the railings which divided pens 3 and 4.       I

     was assisting them out of the gate.    It was at this point that one




1
                                     - 3 -



supporter who was standing at the gate in pen no. 4 refused to move out

of the way.   He became abusive and continually swore at me, saying he'd

got out of the crush and was watching the match.     I realised the game

was still being played.     I had to forcibly move this man out of the way

onto the perimeter track.     I assisted other fans out of this gate.

People in pen 3 were hindered by the centre railings and had difficulty

climbing over them in order to reach gate 4.

I saw that some of the perimeter fence had been pulled down, people were

being carried out and laid on the pitch.     As other officers had joined

me at the gate I left in order to see if I could help anyone else.

I made sure that everyone laid on the pitch had someone helping them or

rendering first aid.

I assisted a fireman who was giving the kiss of life to a heavily built

man aged approximately 25 years, and- who was wearing black track suit

bottoms and trainers.     We were subsequently joined by a doctor who took

over until an ambulance arrived and the man was                    that.

At one point a couple of fans on the pitch were becoming aggressive

toward fans in the North Stand.     I spoke to them, eventually calmed them

down and they left the pitch area.     Police Officers and fans carried

other injured people off the pitch to the gymnasium.     I went to the

gymnasium and in that area saw a number of ambulances.     I helped clear a

route for them.   I subsequently went, as directed, onto the North Stand

for a debrief, following which I attended at the casualty bureau at

Ecclesfield Training Centre and carried out duties there.

                                                      IN T R O D U C T IO N

   1. O n 15 April 1989 a football m atch to decide a semi-final ro u n d o f the FA C u p c om p etition w as to be
played betw een the Liverpool an d N o ttin g h a m Forest Clubs. T h e neutral venue chosen was H illsborough
Football S ta d iu m , Sheffield W ednesday’s g round. O nly six m inutes into the game, play was stopped w hen it
was realised th a t spectators o n the terraces b e h in d the Liverpool goal h ad been severely crushed. In th e result,
95 died a n d over 400 received hospital treatm ent.

  2. O n 17 April 1 9 8 9 1 was ap p o in ted by you to carry o u t an Inq u iry with the following term s o f reference:

      To in q u ire into the events at Sheffield W ednesday football ground on 15 A pril 1989 a n d to make
      r e c o m m e n d a tio n s ab o u t the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports events.

   3. Two Assessors were ap p o in ted to assist me: M r Brian J o h n so n Q P M , C h i e f C onstable o f Lancashire,
an d Professor L eo n a rd M a u n d e r OBE, BSc, P h D , ScD, FEng, FI Mech E, Professor o f M echanical
E ngineering at the U niversity o f Newcastle upon Tyne. T h e ir help has been in va luable a n d I am very grateful
for the ir ex p e rt ad v ice a n d wise counsels. W hile the sole responsibility for this rep o rt is m ine, I a m com forted
in the know ledge th a t both Assessors agree with it.

  4. M r R o b e rt W halley was ap p o in ted Secretary to the Inquiry. H e a n d his assistants hav e worked
prodigiously a n d skilfully to give m e all the advice a n d support I could have wished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help I have received, as always, from my clerk, M r Ernest Pott.

   5. T h e policing arran gem ents for 15 April were in the h a n d s o f the S outh Yorkshire Constabulary. T he
efficacy o f th o se arrangem ents a n d their im p le m e n ta tio n was from an early stage called into q uestion. It was
therefore d ec id e d th a t th e investigation o f the disaster an d th e gathering o f evidence for this Inquiry should be
co n d u c te d by a n in d e p e n d e n t police force. M r Geoffrey D ea r Q P M , C h ie f C o n stab le o f West M idland s
C onstabulary, u n d e rto o k this task. H e was m a d e responsible directly to me; he a p p o in te d A ssistant C h ief
C onstable M ervyn Jones to take full-time charge o f th e investigation. I a m deeply in d e b te d to both o f them.

  6. O n 18 A pril I visited Hillsborough S tadium . I inspected th e scene o f th e d isa ste r on the terraces an d all
relevant p arts o f th e stadium a n d its approaches. My Assessors a n d I have m a d e fu rth e r visits d u ring the
Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool on 21 an d 29 April.

    7. T h e L ord M ayor a n d the Sheffield City Council kindly offered to m a k e th e a c c o m m o d a tio n a n d facilities
o f Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing o f oral evidence. T h is offer was gratefully accepted a n d I would
like to rec o rd my tha nks for those facilities a n d for the co-operation afforded to th e Inquiry by the authorities
in Sheffield.

   8. O n 28 April 1 9 8 9 ,1 held a prelim inary hearing to an n o u n c e th e d a te w hen th e oral evidence w ould begin,
to give s o m e directions as to the procedure I in ten d ed to follow a n d to hear a p p lica tio n s from th o se wishing to
be r epresented at the hearing. I accorded representation to the following:
       (i)     T h o se bereaved o r injured as a result o f the disaster.

       (ii)    T h e Football Supporters’ Association.
       (iii)   T h e Football Association.
       (iv)    Sheffield City Council.
       (v)     Sheffield W ednesday Football C lub together with the Football League, the C lub’s casual sta ff and
               their insurers, the Sun Alliance.
       (vi)    S outh Yorkshire Constabulary.
       (vii) S outh Yorkshire Fire a n d Civil Defence Authority.
Subsequently, d u rin g the hearing. 1 fu rth e r accorded representation to;
      (viii) T rent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire M etropolitan A m bula nce Service
             (SYMAS).
and   (ix)   D r W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

    9. Since the circum stances o f the disaster raised urgent questions o f safety, especially at football grounds,
you indicated a t the outset that you w ould welcome any rec om m e ndations, even o f an in terim n ature, which 1
m ight be able to give in advance o f the new football season du e to co m m en c e in m id-A ugust 1 9 8 9 .1 therefore
a n n o u n c e d at the prelim inary hearing o n 28 April that I w ould co nduct a n oral h ea ring with all possible
e xped ition as th e first phase o f the Inquiry to discover the facts a n d causes o f the d isaster a n d enable m e to
m ake any im m e d ia te interim rec o m m e n d atio n s necessary in the short term .

   10. T h e West M id la n d s Police investigation began o n 24 April. A “ F re ep h o n e” n u m b e r was advertised to
enable m e m b e rs o f the public, especially those w ho had atte n d e d the m atch, to offer the ir evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this n u m b e r was available for three days on 28 different lines. T h e response from the public
was such that the lines were co n tin u ed for a further three days by the en d o f w hich 2,666 calls h ad been
received. T h e re were also m any w ritten offers o f help. Some 440 West M id la n d s officers were deployed on the
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in B irm ingham , Liverpool an d
Sheffield a n d c o m p u te r technology was used to the full. In all som e 3776 statem ents were taken. T h ere were
also som e 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry a n d to m e personally all o f w hich I read. T h e police,
Sheffield W ednesday Football Club a n d the BBC had video cam eras filming at th e gro u n d on 15 April. In
aggregate, they recorded some 71 hours o f film covering the period before, d u ring a n d after the disaster. T h u s
the m aterial g athered a n d potentially available for p resentation at the oral hearing was en o rm o u s. From this
m ass it was essential to select only sufficient good a n d reliable evidence necessary to establish th e facts an d
causes o f the disaster.

   11. W here it seem e d likely th a t any allegation or criticism might be m a d e o f the c o n d u c t o f any person or
party, th e T reasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, w rote to th e p arty concerned
setting o u t t h e likely grounds for com plaint. T h is followed the practice established by the Royal C o m m issio n
o n T ribunals o f Inquiry (the Salm on C om m ission).

    12. T h e h e a rin g began o n 15 May. It co ntinued, sitting long hours, for 31 days conc lu d in g o n 29 Jun e. In
th a t period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. C ounsel’s subm issions were delivered in w riting o n 7 July a n d
o n 14 July I h e a rd the ir b rief oral subm issions supp lem enting the w ritten argum ent.

    13. W itnesses were not sworn. Since this is a depa rtm e n tal inquiry, there was n o pow er to ad m in iste r the
o ath b u t th e re was no instance o f any witness giving evidence which I considered m ight have been different
h a d he o r she b een sworn.

   14. T h e w itnesses called were only a small fraction o f those from w hom s tatem ents were o r could have been
taken. N evertheless, I am satisfied th a t they were sufficient in n u m b e r a n d reliability to enable m e to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called m ore would have prevented m e from presenting an interim report in the
r eq u ired t im e a n d would not have a d d e d significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been able to
take into ac c o u n t m any written statem ents in ad d itio n to oral testimony.

    15. A part from the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry w hich was draw n fro m statem ents taken by
the West M id la n d s Police an d others volunteered by individuals, each o f the represented parties was given full
o p p o r tu n ity to put forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final subm ission was m a d e by
C ounsel for the South Yorkshire Police tha t since the investigation by West M id lan d s Police is still continuing,
all the evidence has not been assem bled a n d it would be unsafe for m e to m ake findings o f fact. I should
therefore m a k e clear that the investigation continues principally to furnish as m uch detail as possible to H M
C o ro n e r fo r the C ity o f Sheffield as to the cause o f death, the precise position at dea th a n d the care an d
m o v e m en t o f each o f the 95 vic tim s individually. 1 am assured by C h ie f Constable D ear an d Assistant C h ie f
C onstable M ervyn Jones tha t it is m ost unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter or a d d to
the h istory o f events which emerged at the hearing.

     16. I should like to thank all those who m a d e it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon afte r the
 event an d for evidence to be efficiently presented a n d tested so as to give a full a n d fair account o f what
 h a p p e n ed in all its aspects w ithout irrelevancy or duplication. I pay tribute particularly to the West M id lands
 Police for the ir speed and d edica tion in gathering the evidence a n d to all those responsible for processing it.
The most eloq uent tribute to the fairness and thoroughness o f the police investigation cam e from the Secretary
o f the Football Supporters' Association. He said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to w hether that
investigation w ould be fair an d objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness sta te m en ts
themselves. H aving heard the opening statem ent by Counsel to the Inquiry based u p o n the evidence gathered
by the police, he found tha t it accorded entirely with his A ssociation's evidence a n d the initial anxiety was
wholly dispelled.

   17. Before a n d d uring the Inquiry I derived great assistance on a w ide range o f technical issues from the
Health a n d Safety Executive w ho providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research a n d L aboratory
Services D ivision) where tests were conducted a n d reports prepared swiftly and efficiently. T h is was d one
in close consultation w ith Professor Maunder. I am m ost grateful to the Director, D r A Jones, a n d to the
D eputy Director, D r C E N icholson, for their invaluable help.

   18. I wish to c o m m e n d Counsel to the inquiry, M r A ndrew Collins QC, M r A lan G oldsack a n d M r
Bernard Phillips for the ir industry, care a n d fairness in selecting a n d presenting th e necessary evidence; also,
Counsel for all those represented who tested th a t evidence fully b u t expeditiously. T h is In terim R eport could
not possibly have been p rep a re d in so short a tim e had I n o t had the w hole-hearted co-operation o f all those
m e ntioned a n d m any others.

   19. T h e se co n d phase o f the Inquiry will be directed to m aking final a n d lo n g te rm r e c o m m e n d a tio n s ab o u t
crowd control a n d safety at sports grounds. 1 nee d to co nsider in d ep th inform ation, o p in io n s an d argum ents
from a wide range o f sources and c o ntributors both here a n d abroad. It was clear from the outset th a t this
second phase could n o t be carried to com pletion before the next football season. However, at a n early stage o f
the oral hearing I in vited evidence from all who w ished to c o n trib u te to it an d specifically from m any sporting,
local authority, em ergency service a n d police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked that subm issions
should be in w riting a n d should be m a d e pro m p tly so tha t the second p h as e o f the Inquiry could
follow im m ed iate ly after the first. I shall now proceed to consider the large body o f w ritten evidence w hich has
been su b m itte d . I shall w ant in som e instances to have further oral evidence or disc ussion in conju n ctio n with
my Assessors. We will also nee d to m ake a n u m b e r o f visits a n d inspections.

   20. I now present my Interim Report a n d R e com m endations. I shall prepare my Final R eport an d
R e co m m en d a tio n s as soon as reasonably possible.

Fixing T he Venue
   21. O n 20 M arch 1989. the Football Association (the FA) requested that the ir C u p semi-final between
Liverpool an d N o ttin g h a m Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium . T he corresponding
semi-final between the sam e two team s had been held there in April 1988. T h e arrangem ents had been
successful in the view b oth o f the police a n d o f the host club. Sheffield W ednesday (the Club) were therefore
willing to a c c o m m o d a te the 1989 match. South Yorkshire Constabulary were prepared to police it but only if
the ticketing arran g e m en ts were the sam e as those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
T hose arrangem ents did not please Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989. They thought the ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirem ent was
accepted an d the m atch was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

T h e Ground
  22. T he H illsborough Stadium is som e 2'6 miles to the north-west o f central Sheffield in the district o f
O wlerton T he gro u n d was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river D on. T he pitch lies
roughly eust to west. A plan o f the ground and its im m e d ia te environs is at A ppendix 1.

  23. T he west end. with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings L ane end. T he
east end abuts on P enistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river D on and to the north a residential street.
Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane an d Penistone Road North.

   24. Alongside the river is a private roadw ay giving access to the south stand, to the Directors’ an d players'
entrances, a n d to the adm inistrative block u n d er the stand. T he roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
access between P enistone Road an d Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut it o ff at each end. There
is som e car parking along this roadw ay principally for Directors, players a n d employees o f the Club. The south
stand d ates from 1914 an d is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8.800. 5.500 o f those are
roofed over an d 3.300 are uncovered.

  25. T he north sta n d is also all seating an d ac com m odates about 9.700. Behind it is a g ym nasium o r sports
hall. T here are also a first aid room a n d police room close by.

  26. The east en d is all terracing a n d is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged a n d roofed over in 1986 and
now ac co m m o d a te s som e 21.000 standing spectators. There are crush barriers in th e Kop ru n n in g parallel to
the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free m ovem ent from side to side.

   27. At the west o r Leppings Lane end o f the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
stand w hich provides covered seating an d was built in 1965 for World C u p m atches, s o m e o f which were held
at H illsborough in 1966. The covered stand ac com m odates 4.456 seated spectators. T he terracing in front o f it
extends higher in the corners between the stands a n d its total capacity was stated to be 10.100. At both the Kop
end an d the west en d access to the pitch is barred by perim eter fencing. T he fencing is about eight feet high
m o u n te d u pon the low wall at the foot o f the terracing. At the top o f the fenci ng the w ire returns back at a sharp
angle for som e 15 inches to m ake it difficult for anyone to climb over towards the pitch. T here are gates at
intervals along the perim eter fencing to afford access between terrace an d pitch. These gates are less th a n a
m etre wide an d were designed to be op en e d only from the pitch side for police purposes o r in an emergency.
They are m a rk e d a n d num bered on the plan A ppendix 1.

   28. U nlike the Kop end. the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radial
fences at right angles to it. dividing the area into pens. This division was begun after an FA C u p semi-final in
 1981 w hen cru shing occurred due to overcrowding an d gates had to be opened. It p roceeded in stages, the final
arrange m ent being shown on the plan A ppendix 1. T he first section o f the west terracing moving south to north
con tain s gates 1 a n d 2 and is known as pens 1 an d 2 although in fact co nstituting only o ne pen. Next is pen 3
with one gate: next pen 4 with one gate: pen 5, which is extremely narrow, was in ten d ed as a sterile area to
d iv id e pen 4 from pen 6. This was to isolate ho m e an d away fans on occasions w hen both might be
a c c o m m o d a te d on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west com er. Pens 5 ,6
and 7 each have a perim eter gate. At the back o f the pens, u nder the front o f the west stand, there is a gate in
each radial fence. W hen those gates are open, the back row o f the terracing is intended to perm it access from
pen to pen along ihe whole west side. In practice, w hen substantial num be rs are present, those gateways are not
readily visible or accessible. T he present layout o f the pens, fences, crush barriers and gates has resulted from a
series o f piecemeal changes. T h e nature a n d effect o f those changes m ust be considered later.

The Turnstiles
   29. Because o f the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north side o f the ground. Along
Penistone Road N orth there are som e 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop and to the east
end o f the north stand. They are m arked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. T he 12 num b e re d 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the north stand but were not used for tha t purpose on 15 April in o rd e r to segregate supporters o f the
two team s as appears later. Two o f them . 77 a n d 78. were however used for access to the Kop.

  30. At the south side o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles ( n u m b e re d 19 to 42 on the plan). T hose
num bered 37 to 42 led to the Kop a n d the rest to the south stand.

  31. In sum m ary, the south and east sides o f the ground ac c o m m o d a te d some 29.800 whose access o n the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. T he o th e r two sides o f the ground, north an d west, with a capacity o f 24,256 were fed solely from the
Leppings Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the Ground
  33. Most supporters were expected to co m e by road although rail transport was available. N ottin g h am
supporters travelling by train would arrive at the m ain line Sheffield M idland S tation whence they w ould be
directed and escorted northw ards by the police. They would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
N ottingham supp orters travelling by coach, m ini-bus or car would appro a ch Sheffield from the south m ainly
on the M 1. Again their arrival at the ground would pred o m in an tly be via Penistone R oad o r Herries Road.

   34. Liverpool supporters travelling by norm al rail service would arrive at Sheffield M idland S tation just
like their N o ttin g h am cou nterparts. T he police a im ed to segregate the rival fans an d put them into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
catering solely for football su pporters a n d situated to the north o f the ground. A police escort was available to
conduct them on foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. T hose com ing from Liverpool by road would approach
Sheffield either via the M62 a n d down the M 1 from the north o r across the Pennines from the north west. All
such routes would bring them to the ground via o ne or o th e r lim b o f Leppings Lane as shown on A p p en d ix 1.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north an d west: arrivals from N o ttin g h am
would be from the south a n d east.

Allocation of Places and Tickets
   35. Experience in recent years has p roduce d a policy o f segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
of rival teams. T he need for this policy to be m a in ta in e d was endorsed an d em phasised by the Popplewell
Report following the Bradford City disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 semi-final the police decided
that sections o f the Hillsborough S tad iu m should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation of
Liverpool a n d N ottin g h am Forest fans. T he section to be granted to each was d eterm in e d by the direction
whence each p red o m in an tly approached. T hus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides o f the ground
for which access was from Leppings Lane. N o ttin g h am Forest were allotted the south a n d east sides w ith access
from Penistone Road.

   36. The effect o f the decision was that for this all-ticket C up Tie. Liverpool were allotted only 24.256 places
as against 29.800 for N o ttin g h am Forest. This, although average atten d a n ce o f supporters at ho m e m atches
was substantially higher at Liverpool th a n at N ottingham . Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 a n d seats at
£12. N o ttin g h am Forest h ad 21.000 standing places co m p ared with Liverpool's 10.100. So. Liverpool’s
allocation was m ore expensive as well as smaller. U nderstandably. Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
o f places an d tickets. T hey sought with som e supp ort from the host club and the FA to have it changed in
1988. but the police were ad a m a n t. To switch ends would, in their opinion, have involved rival supporters
crossing each o ther's paths when approaching the ground thereby frustrating a ttem p ts at segregation and
creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989. when the sam e plan was proposed. Liverpool again challenged it. T he
police, however, m a in ta in e d their view, adding that those who had a tten d e d in 1988 would be fam iliar with the
arrangem ents and that any change would lead to confusion.
Access from Leppings Lane
   3 7 . As the plan Appendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck o r forecourt at
a b end in Leppings Lane where, com ing from the north, it turns to the south-west a n d crosses a bridge over the
river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north an d west o f the ground. They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs o f Leppings Lane a n d would converge on the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line o f railings with six sets o f d ouble gates. Inside
those perim eter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles. As shown in the ph otographs A ppendix 2. the
latter are in two sections d ivided by a fence. T h e n orthern section consists o f turnstiles 1 to 16. N u m b e rs 1 to
 10 gave access to the north stand. T hus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9.700 with north sta n d seats. T h e ir
tickets were m a rke d "E ntrance A" a n d were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above th e m an d brown b o ard s on the wall.

   38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in the west stand. T hus 4.456 were served by six turnstiles.
They were the next block to the right o f those m a rke d A. However, instead o f these turnstiles a n d the west sta n d
tickets being m arked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were m a rke d C. T heir colour-code on
tickets and b o ard s was red.

   39. O n th e o th e r side o f the d ividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
10.100 with tickets for the west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G . T h is was because there
h ad originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings L ane an d the sequential num bering c o n tin u e d from 19 u p w ard s
on the south side o f the ground. W hen the n u m b e r at Leppings Lane was brought u p to 23 the present
arrangem ents o f 1 to 1-6, A to G a n d then 19 upw ards was adopted to avoid re-num bering all r o u n d the ground.
However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. “ E ntrance B" also appeared on tickets for the west
terrace. T hus, the three blocks o f turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane en d read from
left to right A. C. B. T h e colour-code for west terrace tickets an d the b oards beside turnstiles A to G was m auve.
To the right o f turnstile G is a tubulai steel barrier to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadw ay to the
south stand.

Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
  40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. T here is an exit gate (m ark ed A
on A ppendix 1) between turnstile 1 a n d the adjacent housing.

  41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 a n d 7 and the steps to the west stand. T h ere is a
wall dividing this area from tha t inside turnstiles A to G. It had been built to segregate h o m e a n d away fans at a
tim e when the Club intended they should share the west terrace. T h a t idea was not pursued but the wall
rem ained. T here was. however, a gateway in the wall which did perm it access between th e two areas. An exit
gate (m arked B on A ppendix 1) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

   42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse b o u n d ed on the left by the wall ju st
m e ntioned an d on the right by the wall o f the private roadway com ing from the south sta n d to Leppings Lane.
T here was an exit gate in the latter wall (m arked C on A ppendix 1(just inside turnstile G .

   43. All three exit gates. A. B an d C. were o f concertina design. They could be o p e n e d only from the inside
an d w ere not in tended for entry o f spectators in to the ground.

   44. T hose entering through turnstiles A to G h ad three optio n s once inside the ground. They could by
moving to the right go round the south end o f the west stand an d gain entry into p ens 1 and 2. They could go
through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse b ehind turnstiles 11 to 16 a n d then ro u n d the north
en d o f the west sta n d into pens 6 o r 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting th e m to take either o f
those courses. T he obvious way in was straight ahe ad o f the turnstiles where a tunnel u n d er the m iddle o f the
west stand gave access to pens 3 a n d 4. Above its entrance in large letters was the w ord “ S tanding” an d a large
letter “ B". T h u s B ticket holders were draw n towards the tunnel.

   45. The length o f the tunnel is som e 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels o f f b u t finally descends
tow ards the terraces at a gradient o f 1 i n 6. As it em erges onto the terrace, the way ahe ad is bisected by the radial
fence between pen 3 on the right an d pen 4 on the left. A short spur o f brick wall projects forward from each side
o f the tunnel at its mouth. T hose em erging are thus guided straight forward rath e r th a n to either side. T h e
photograph at A ppendix 3 shows the west stand and terraces.

  46. As w ith the layout on the terraces, the configuration r f the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the areas inside
them was effected by a series o f piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary to analyse their resultant effect.
Policing Arrangements
   47. At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been u nder ihe control o f C h ie f Superintendent Mole, then
C o m m a n d e r o f F D ivision within whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 M arch 1989 w hen
the FA bro ached the 1989 semi-final, but he was du e to h and over c o m m a n d o f F D ivision on 27 M arch to
Superintendent D u ck e n field o n the latter’s p rom otion to C hief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
m eeting on 22 M arch, but on 27 M arch Mr Mole bowed out an d M r D uckenfield took over. U n d e r him were
Sector C o m m a n d e rs , all S u perinte ndents with m uch experience o f policing football m a tch e s at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular. S uperintendent Marshall was in charge o f the area outside the Leppings Lane
entrance an d th e approaches to it. S uperintendent G reenw ood was in c o m m a n d inside the ground, but this
included the area between the turnstiles and the perim eter fence. T hey thereby sw apped roles from the
previous year. U n d e r M r D uckenfield’s overall c o m m a n d were som e 801 officers a n d m en on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers and others from D Division to deal with the influx o f supporters into the city centre.
In all. therefore, som e 1.122 police were deployed for this m atch a m o u n tin g to about 38 per cent o f the total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the m o u n te d section o f 34 were officers from Liverpool an d N ottin g h am to
assist respectively in marshalling their ho m e supporters. T h e total at the ground was d ivided into serials
consisting usually o f eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. T h e serials were posted to duties
at various stations in and around the g round in three phases: before, d u rin g a n d after the match. All o f this
was provided for in an O perational O rd e r which followed closely the O rd e r drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into account the force's “Standing Instructions for the Policing o f Football G r o u n d s ” . T h e O rd e r
described the duties o f each serial at each phase. It was supplem ented by oral briefings before and on the day of
the match.

Sheffield Wednesday’s Arrangements
  48. T h e Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen an d turnstile o p era tors for duty on 15 April. T he stew ards
were briefed as to their duties on the m orning of the m atch by police Inspectors and were allocated r o u n d the
ground. They wore yellow tabards. T he C lub's control room , situated below the south stand, could
com m unicate by V H F radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in the ir control ro o m showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A com puterised counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. T his flashed o n to a screen in the Club control ro o m the running total o f
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at th e Leppings L ane end. there would be
separate ru n n in g to ta ls f o rtu rn s tile s 1 to 10 (n orth stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), a n d turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). W hen the total for any section was w ithin 15 per cent o f its perm itted capacity a warning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing that w arning would occur w hen the n u m b e rs were within 15 per
cent o f the total terrace capacity o f 10.100. W hat the system could not do was m o n ito r th e distribution o f fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no w arning therefore if o n e pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications
  49. T he nerve centre for police control is the control room o r box situated at the south-west corner o f the
ground between the south stand and pen 1 o f the west terracing. T he box is elevated an d reached by a n u m b e r
of steps. It has windows co m m a n d in g views across the pitch and straight a k ng the line o f the west p erim eter
fence. The box is very small an d has seats for only three officers. Superintendent M u rra y was in control o f it
and was advisor to M r D uckenfield as he had been to M r Mole th e year before. N ext to him sat Sergeant
G o d d ard who operated the radios. T h e third seat was for Police C onstable Ryan who operated the telephone
and public ad dress systems. At the back o f the box stood Police C onstable Bichard w ho was in control o f the
police closed circuit television system operated by a row o f consoles on a bench in front o f him a n d behind the
three seated officers.

   50. There were five television screens showing views o f five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
stands and directed both inside a n d outside th e ground. T here was also a m aster screen which flicked in
rotation from one cam era v ie w to an o th e r a n d which m ade a video recording. T he cam eras have a zo o m
facility to close in on any point o f interest. Specifically, there were good cam era views o f the west terracing, o f
the Leppings Lane turnstiles a n d beyond them o f Leppings Lane itself.

  51. The Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
ground and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, ho u se d u n d er the police control box. to relay
music before the m atch, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
speakers or if ap propriate to o n e area only.
    53.     R adio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside an d outside the ground was
U H F on channel 25. There was a W1 FU portable base station in the control box an d if it failed there was a
stand-by station u n d e r the o p era to r's bench. H an d sets were issued to all ranks o f Sergeant an d above
C o m m u n ity C onstables on du ty would already have their own. O th er C onstables had no radio.
C o m m u n ic a tio n was on “talk th r o u g h ’’ i.e. any message from any source w ould be h eard by everyone tu n e d in
a n d if m ore than one source spoke messages could becom e garbled. Ear pieces were issued to som e officers in
an a tte m p t to overcom e the loud crowd noise which m ad e receipt o f signals very difficult. T here were other
radio channels o pen to Sergeant G o d d a rd : V H F to police H ea d q u a rte rs at Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI
Sub-divisional H eadquarters at H a m m e r to n Road a n d channel 19 used by CID. T here was also a set tu n e d to
Sheffield W ednesday ’s radio system between its control room an d the stewards.

                                     15th APRIL: T H E B U IL D -l P T O 2.30pm

Early Arrivals
   54. 15 April 1989 was a w arm sunny spring Saturday. T h e m atch was a sell-out, so 54,000 ticket holders
were expected. O thers w ould com e w ithout tickets hoping to acquire them o r even to gain access otherwise.
T he following ac count concentrates, as d id the evidence, on the western approa che s a n d the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in
small num bers. Som e brought cans o f beer with them an d were seen drinking as they walked; others took
advantage o f the w eather a n d sat about on walls a n d open spaces. W hen the public houses opened, m any
resorted there, drinking inside or spilling o ut into the sunshine, Leppings L ane a n d its environs com p rise a
mixed shopping a n d residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house o r ofT-licence. Many were asking for tickets o r "spares". T h ere were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, som e o f the fans were using private g ardens an d yards to urinate. As the m o rn in g
wore on, n u m b e rs increased. Requests for tickets a n d trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevailing
mood was o n e o f carnival, good h u m o u r a n d expectation.

Public Houses
  55. T here were som e 74 shops with off-licences in a n d a ro u n d Sheffield. In general, they o pened at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters d id visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great a m o u n t o f alcoholic d r in k was
bought there.

  56. O pening tim e at public houses was in general 11 am . Some r em a in e d closed all day. O f the others, some
72, mostly in the city, were frequented by local patro n s only. S om e 23 public houses, however, served over a
hundred Liverpool supporters each. A n o th er 51 served m ore th a n 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
many supporters d ran k enough to affect the ir m ood. At first excitem ent: later frustration.

The Gathering Crowd
   57. Towards the end o f the morning, fans gathered on an d a r o u n d the bridge n e a r the Leppings Lane
entrance. They seem ed reluctant to enter the grou nd early. All turnstiles were o pen at 12 noon an d one o r two
as early as 11.30 am. Some 53 police had been deployed to o perate o utside the turnstiles a n d in the Leppings
Lane area. They enquired at random w hether fans h ad tickets. T h o se who had n ot were advised to go away;
nevertheless, m any returned more than once. T hose who had tickets were g uided in the right d irection. T he
police tried to persuade them to enter the ground early. Officers, m ale a n d female, h a d been posted outside
each turnstile with the duty o f searching e n tra n ts for weapons, d r in k o r drugs. O nce through the turnstile, an
entrant was liable to be searched again by one o f a serial o f officers p o sitio n ed ju st inside.

   58. At about 12 noon C h ie f Inspector Creaser asked S u p e rin te n d en t M urray w h eth e r the pens on the west
terrace were to be filled one by one successively, but was told that they s h o u 1,4 be available from the start and
the fans should find their own level.

  59. By 2 pm it was appa rent to those inside the ground an d those m o nitoring events in the police a n d Club
control room s that the n u m b e r o f N ottingham fans in their places greatly o u tn u m b e r e d those from Liverpool.
The Kop an d the south sta n d were filling up steadily, but the n o rth an d west stands were half empty. It was
noted about tha t tim e that the turnstile figures showed only 12.000 h ad entered as against 20,000 at the same
time the previous year. On the west terraces, although pens 3 a n d 4 were filling, the wing pens 1 ,2 ,6 a n d 7 were
nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 a n d 4 to move forw ard a n d m a k e ro o m for
others.

  60. T here had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. T his time, there was only one. It arrived
early, ju st before 2 pm. at Wadslev Bridge station. The 350 passengers were m et by both m o u n ted a n d foot
police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly an d passed through
the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm w ithout incident.

  61. By this tim e the police Traffic D ivision reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the m ajority o f
Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. T he num bers converging on the Leppings Lane e n tra n c e were
increasing rapidly. Between the perim eter gates an d the turnstiles the crowd b ecam e congested. T h e re was no
longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole a p p ro a ch area. T he foot officers
outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone a n d had difficulty in searching even selectively.
M ou n te d officers in an d outside the turnstile area were having difficulty m a noeu vring in such a dense crowd.
T h e police were beset by fans b em used by the ticket an d turnstile labelling asking for directions. M any had
been drinking but up to and just after 2.30 pm th e m ood rem a ine d good.

   62.      S up erin te n d en t Marshall was on foot am ongst the crowd. H e becam e anxious ab o u t the n u m b e rs
com ing down Leppings Lane a n d spilling out o n to the roadw ay where buses and cars were moving. At 2.1 7
pm he radioed to control to have m o to r traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. This was eventually d o n e at about
2.30 pm. U p to this time, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles an d the n um bers still approaching, there
was still no panic in the crowd; no perception o f crisis by the police. In the control ro om M r Murray, who could
see Leppings Lane on the video, advised Mr D uckenfield th at they would get everyone in by 3 pm . M r
D uckenfield reaffirm ed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there was som e
m a jo r external factor such as fog on the Pennines o r delay on the m otorw ay: not if spectators merely tu rn e d up
late even in large numbers.

                                         TH E C RISIS AT TH E T U R N ST ILES

    63. In the 20 m in u tes from 2.30 pm to 2.50 p m there were crucial developm ents both inside and outside
the ground. In pens 3 an d 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as m ore fans c a m e th rough the tunnel to the
favoured area b eh in d the goal. By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
discomfort to m any well used to en d u rin g pressure on terraces. T he num be rs at th a t tim e were clearly in excess
o f the m a x im u m density stated by the H om e Office G u id e to Safety at Sports G ro u n d s (1986 Edn) (the G reen
G uide) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (A lthough the G reen G u id e has no sta tu to ry or legal force, it is the
only official advice available about safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens I. 2. 6 an d 7, there was still
am ple ro om a n d bare patches o f concrete were visible.

  64. Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As more arrived at th e back the crush at the
front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles becam e m ore difficult. T h e ir efficiency was im paired and th e ir rate
reduced. A rrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the b u ild -u p increased. T h e foot
officers o u tsid e were unable to function and in danger them selves so they went th ro u g h the turnstiles an d out
again through gate C where they did w hat they could to relieve pressure by the tu b u la r barrier. T he m o u n ted
officers were su r ro u n d e d by the dense mass o f people an d b ecam e ineffective. S u p e rin te n d e n t M arshall was in
the midst o f the turm oil. He extricated h im self and stood on a parapet o f the bridge to get a clear view. A
drunken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a m o u n te d officer. But these were isolated acts by
individuals: the m enace ca m e from the m assive n u m bers single-mindedly d e te rm in e d to be in for the kick-off
with tim e running out. At the back o f the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack o f progress as 3 o’clock
approached. Some, mostly young men who had been drinking, tried to push a n d force the ir way forward. At
the front, people were ja m m e d together a n d against the turnstile walls. S om e panick ed as the pressure
intensified. Some youngsters and w omen w ere fainting an d in distress. They were helped out th rough the
tubular b a rrie r by turnstile G o r were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. F a n s clim b e d up and over the
turnstile b uilding o r on to the dividing fence. T his was to escape the crush rather th a n to gain free en try since
most o f th e m had tickets.

  65. At 2.44 pm M r Marshall radioed for reinforcem ents, for th e Tannoy to request the crowd to stop
pushing a n d f o r a vehicle with loudspeaker e q u ip m e n t to com e an d request the sam e. U nhappily, at ab o u t 2.40
pm. radio c o m m u n ic a tio n on channel 25 b ec am e defective. For a period o f two or three m inutes th e control
room lost contact. A co m m u n ic a tio n s officer ca m e pro m p tly and switched to th e sta n d b y station. W ith the use
of a handset at control, contact was restored. D espite this hiatus, two o f M r M arshall’s requests were received.
The Tannoy was used but w ith little effect. Reinforcem ents, including m ounted officers from P enistone Road,
were sent. T h e third request, for a Landrover. was received direct by its driver P C Buxton who arrived at 2.46
pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. T his was no m ore effective than the Tannoy. The
mounted officers besieged near the turnstiles cam e outside the perim eter gates. An a tte m p t was m a d e to shut
them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed o r at least th inned through the
turnstiles. T he pressure from without, however, opened the gates again. M o u n te d officers, now reinforced to
greater num bers, form ed a cordon across the elbow o f Leppings L ane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
with the object o f reducing pressure inside th e gates. They were successful in this fo r som e m in u tes despite
desperate in d i v i d u a l s fo r c in g their way u n d e r o r between the horses. However, th is exercise was overtaken by a
more d ra m a tic relief o f the pressure.

“Open the Gates'*
   66. Between 2.40 pm a n d 2.45 pm the crowd inside an d ou tsid e the turnstile ap proach had swelled to
over 5.000. At the head o f the phalanx co nditions had becom e intolerable. T h o se w ho got through were short
o f breath a n d sweating profusely. Many co m p lain ed to police officers on the conc o u rse inside the turnstiles
and asked t h e m in forceful term s to do som ething. Exit gates A an d B were being shaken. It was clear the crowd
could not pass through the turnstiles by 3 p m . Police C onstable Buxton radioed from the L androver to control
asking th a t kick-off be postponed. The suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

  67. S u p erin te n d e n t Marshall realised the crowd had becom e unm anageable. A lthough loth to do so, since it
was contrary to basic police strategy, he d ec id e d to request the exit gates be o p e n e d to relieve the pressure.
Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. O th er senior officers outside the gro u n d agreed. At 2.47 p m he
radioed control to perm it the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm , whilst M r D uckenfield was considering the
request, gate C o p en e d to eject a youth w ho had clim bed in with no tickct. Im m ediately, fans o u tsid e took
advantage an d about 150 m anaged to get in before a m o u n te d officer enabled the gate to be closed again. M r
Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third time, adding tha t if the
gates were not open e d someone was going to be killed. In the control room . Mr D uckenfield had not m ade a
decision. M r M urray asked him "Are you going to o pen the gates?”. M r D uckenfield gave the o rd e r and Sgt
G o d d a r d radioed to Mr Marshall "O p e n the gates". N either the Club control room n o r any police officers
inside th e turnstiles were told o f this o rd e r before o r after it was given o r o f any action it would require.

  68. At 2.52 pm. gate C was opened wide. Fans b eh in d turnstiles A to G an d from the concourse beyond
cam e r o u n d to flow through it in large numbers.

   69. A bout two m in u tes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite th e g atem a n’s
objection, for it to be opened. I f it was not, he said, “ It’ll go an d som eone will get killed” . Perm ission was given,
but this tim e reserve serials were alerted to m o n ito r the inrush towards the north stand. G a te B was also briefly
op en e d against the gatem an’s wishes an d about 200 o f those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
left.

   70. T he largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five m in u te s it was open a b o u t 2,000 fans passed
through it steadily at a fast walk. Som e m ay have had tickets for the stands. N o d oubt som e h a d no tickets at all,
T h e m a jo rity had tickets for the terraces. O f these, som e found the ir way either right to pens 1 an d 2 o r left
through the d ivid ing wall to 6 a n d 7. But a large p ro p o rtio n h eaded straight for the tunnel in front o f them,

                                                  T H E D IS A S T E R

   71. T he initial influx through gate C. aug m en te d by en tra n ts via the turnstiles, cam e through the tunnel
with great m o m en tu m . Fans spoke o f being swept through, feet o f f the ground. The 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
their progress. U pon reaching the crowded pens, som e wished to go back bu t were unable to d o so. T he new
arrivals found them selves pushed forward a n d the pressure becam e intense. At 2.54 pm, shortly after this
influx began, the team s cam e o n to the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. M any were now
acutely uncom fortable a n d some were in distress. T he mass seethed a bout but voluntary m ove m ent by any
individual was difficult; hands down could not be raised an d som e fans found it hard to breathe. Still the flow
continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. T here were shouts for help an d for the gates to be
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the p erim eter track did not im m ediately react. In the deafening noise
from chanting and shouting they did not at first recognise the problem . Realisation ca m e at different m om ents
to different officers in different places.

   72. G a te 3 sprang o pen u nder the intense pressure from w ithin. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it sprang again: officers tried to shut it. T hose seeking to escape were urged an d pushed back. G ate
4 was open e d by a policem an who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it and were directed
to the wing pens where there was still a m ple room . Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again a n d then re-opened. At
gate 3, a C onstable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his written orders a n d radioed for perm ission to
open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it u pon him self to o pen it.

  73. Just before 3 pm. the m atch kicked off. At the same time, gate C. which had been closed at 2.57 pm.
was reopened and a steady trickle con tinued to enter through the tunnel.

   74. To escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences out o f pens 3 an d 4 into pens 2 a n d 5. O thers
tried to get over the front perim eter fence but were at first tu rn e d back by police w ho feared a pitch invasion.
N ear the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the poi nt o f collapse an d i n som e instances death but
they were held upright by pressure all round. F u rth e r back, most were so preoccupied with the pain o f being
pressed against barriers an d with breathing p roblem s that they saw' nothing o f the game. But at the rear there
were m a n y who. although cram ped, were w atching the football unaw are o f the distress at the front.

  75. At 3.04 pm. Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. T here was a roar from the
Liverpool fans an d at the same tim e a powerful surge forwards in pen 3, T h e several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens tow ards the pitch. T h e force becam e such as to twist
and break two spans o f a crush barrier towards the front o f pen 3. T h e evidence does not establish with
certainty w hen this happened, Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm . But I am sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in th e pen, W hen the b a rrier broke those w hom it had
supported were projected towards the p erim ete r fence. M any fell and the involuntary rush o f those behind
pressed th e m down. T he crushing force was tran sm itted a nd dispersed so that all along the front o f pen 3 fans
were pressed h ard up against the low wall an d the wire mesh o f the fence above it,

  76. In pen 4 no b arrier broke. N evertheless those at the front were crushed against wall and fence. Further
back, two barriers were bowed an d som e individuals succum bed to the pressure aro u n d them.

   77. Surges on terraces are com m on. Usually, they go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight o f
num bers, there was no receding. T he pressure stayed an d for those crushed breathless by it. sta nding or prone,
life was ebbing away. If no relief cam e in four m inutes there would be irreversible brain dam age; if longer,
death.

  78. In the c ontrol ro o m no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything am iss in pens 3 and 4 until the first
fans spilt out o n to the perim eter track ju st before kick-off, T hen, the officers in c o m m a n d assum ed that there
was an atte m p te d pitch invasion, They called up reserve serials waiting in the gym nasium a n d all available
officers elsew here to go to the pitch. A request was m ade to H Q for dog handlers,

   79. S u perinte ndent G reenw ood, the G r o u n d C o m m an d e r, was by the players' tunnel at th e kick-off. He
noticed fans on th e track and went to the west end behind the goal. As he approa che d, he did not th in k the pens
overcrowded until he was very close an d saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
situation •‘retrievable'' if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. He clim bed on the wall below the fence
and signalled with both h ands to those behind to move back. O th er officers jo in e d him. It was impossible.
Those fans who would have wished to com ply were powerless to do so. Behind them , there were still many
unaw are o f the crisis, watching the game. The football co n tin u ed tojo>ous shouting a n d singing round the rest
o f the ground while those crushed an d trappe d slowly expired.

   80.   W hen M r G reenw ood's signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to rad io for the match to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his a r m s towards the control
box. M r D uckenfield sent M r M urray down from the box to have the m atch stopped via the linesman, the
agreed em ergency drill. Before he could do so. Mr G reenw ood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the
game. It was 5 /: m inutes past 3.

                                                 T H E AFTERM ATH

Rescue Attempts
   8 1. From 3 o'clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and rem ained so. At first, fans had walked or staggered out
w inded a n d faint. But the final surge at 3.04 pm . an d the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a h o r re n d o u s
blockage o f bodies. T h e dead, the dying and the desperate becam e interwoven in the s u m p at the front o f the
pens, especially by the gates. T hose w ith strength left clam bered over others subm erged in the h u m a n h eap and
tried to clim b out over the fence. They were now helped by police an d other fans w ho hauled them up a n d over.
N um bers o f fans were clim bing over the radial fences into adjacent pens. At the back, m any were h au led up
into the west stand to relieve the pressure.

   82. T h e steps from the su m p at gateways 3 an d 4 were so congested with bodies live a n d d ead tha t each had
to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A n u m b e r o f in dividual
officers a n d fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow tha t only two o r three
could get at the entw ined bodies Willing h a n d s got in on e a n o th e r 's way. M ore officers arrived from the
gym nasium a n d elsewhere in the ground. Many used their own initiative to help those laid o u t on the pitch, to
assist in getting others over the fencing a n d to com fort the distressed. But so m e stood in groups n ea r the
perim eter fence not knowing what to do. The> had been s u m m o n e d in response to w hat was thought to be a
threat to public order. W hat they found was a hortific scene o f carnage an d som e young officers were shocked
into im potence by what they saw.

  83. It was truly gruesome. T he victim s were blue, cyanotic, incontinent; their m o u th s open, vom iting; their
eyes staring. A pile o f dead bodies lay a n d grew outside gate 3. E xtending further a n d fu rth e r on to the pitch, the
injured were laid down a n d attem p ts m ade to revive them . M ore an d m ore walking survivors flooded o u t on to
the pitch as the players left. T he scene was em otive an d chaotic as well as gruesome. As the e n o rm ity o f the
disaster was realised, m any o f the fans milling about were bitter a n d hostile to the police, blam ing th e m for
what h ad happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat u p o n and even assaulted. A small n u m b e r o f
hysterical fans had to be subdued.

  84. A dding to the chaos, a n um ber o f press photographers dodged about am o n g rescue w orkers apparently
avid to secure photographs at point blank range o f those dying through the w ire m e sh a n d those laid on the
pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them. Police had to intervene,

   85. At about 3.12 pm . C h ie f Superintendent Nesbit. C o m m a n d e r o f the Traffic D ivision, a rriv ed on the
pitch. H e took charge at gate 3 and organised a chain o f officers to simplify a n d expedite the extraction o f
casualties from the pen. In the absence of any m echanical m eans, police and fans together pulled a n d worked
at the wire mesh with their bare hands a n d their feet to breach the fencing. T h ey succeeded in bo th pens,
enabling officers to get in an d fans to b e g o t out.

   86. By now, som e officers o f their own initiative went r o u n d from the pitch to th e tunnel w here they met
other officers from the turnstiles and the west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear o f the pens
to go back through the tunnel. Some com plied, but many resisted, wishing to sta n d their ground. Casualties
were brought out through the tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
further in an d bring out m ore casualties, dea d an d alive. They were laid on the gro u n d in the concourse outside
the tunnel an d a ttem p ts were m a d e to re\ i ve them.

First Aid
  87. T h e St John A m bulance Brigade h a d som e 30 personnel posted round the gro u n d for the m a tch - 25
adults a n d 5 ju n io r cadets. They were quickly on the scene w hen the first casualties em erged an d sought to
revive them. T heir D ivisional S uperintend ent. Mr Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help those pressed against the
fencing by feeding oxygen to them through the mesh until they could be got out.

  88. D r Purcell. Sheffield W ednesday's doctor, cam e from his seat in the south stand an d a ttem p ted
resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he m oved from patient to p atien t doing w hat he could,
but in most cases it was to o late.

  89. At 3.13 pm a St John's am bulance cam e on to the pitch at the north-east corner a n d drove to the
perim eter fence close to gate 3. There was no call for doctors an d nurses on the public address system until
nearK 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the m inutes ticked past, som e o f them cam e o n to the pitch to h elp o f their
ow n accord when they saw the casualties an d the a m bulance a n d realised the gravity o f the situation. Ma
fans also worked prodigiously in attem pts to revive the dea d a n d the dying, in some cases their own relatn
a n d friends. Artificial respiration, m o u th to m o u th respiration a n d cardiac massage were applied by the skill
a n d the unskilled but usually in vain. T hose capable o f survival mostly cam e ro u n d of their own accord. T
rest were mostly d o o m e d before they could be brought out an d treated.

    90. T h ere was an urgent need to get casualties off the pitch a n d to hospital. T here were six stretchers in tl
first aid room an d three in the St Jo h n ’s am bulance. T hey were quickly brought into use. T hen the fat
im provised by tearingdow n the hoardings a ro u n d the edge o f the pitch and against the stands so that lengths (
b o ard could be used as stretchers. Im provising in this way. p arties o f fans a n d police ran repeatedly the lengt
o f the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A n u m b e r were dea d on arrival there.

In the Control Room
  91. M r D uckenfield stayed in the control room . C h ie f Inspec tor M cR obbie was there in civilian clothes a
an observer. M r D uckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policew om an at gate 1 to ad m it thosi
displaced from the centre pens. M r D uckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw som eone laic
on the pitch. Even then, he did not realise the n ature o f the p ro b lem or its scale.

  92. M r M urray returned from his atte m p t to stop the m a tch a n d M r D uckenfield sent him down again tc
clear the pitch a n d assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear th e pitch. T his was
because M r D uckenfield could not from th e control room see clearly w hat was h appe ning for the milling and
increasing numbers.

   93. T h e Assistant C h ie f C onstable (Operations). M r Jackson, h ad atte n d e d the m atch in civilian clothes as
a guest o f the Club. He ca m e from his seat in the south stand to ask w hat h ad happened. M r Duckenfield was
unable to say: he did not tell M r Jackson that the exit gates h ad been opened o n his authority. M r Jackson went
d ow n to the pitch to discover the situation.

   94. At 3.06 pm Mr D uckenfield. still p rim arily concerned a b o u t public order, caused a message to be sent
to H ea d q u a rte rs asking for O p eratio n Support. T h a t was a call for all available additional police resources to
co m e to the ground to strengthen the police presence.

   95. M r Jackson was told by Mr G reenw ood that there were casualties an d retu rn ed im m ediately to control
to m ake sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile. M r M urray h ad seen the plight o f those behind the
fence. He radioed to control that a fleet o f am bulances was required. H e also asked for a Tannoy broadcast to
those in the pens to move back but there is no clear evidence tha t it was m ade.

   96. O n ly w hen M r D uckenfield received th e request for a fleet o f am bulances d id he realise the n ature and
gravity o f the situation. T h en , supported by M r Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting O peration
S u p p o rt into calls for the M a jo r D isaster Plan.

N o Information
   97. A part from the message to clear the pitch a n d the belated call for medical assistance ab o u t 3.30 pm . no
in fo rm atio n o r advice was broadcast on the public address system. M r D uckenfield feared that the crowd
m ight tu rn hostile or might all a tte m p t to leave together thereby ham p erin g the em ergency services if they were
given info rm atio n about w hat had happened. T he result was th a t a p a r t from those close enough at the west end
to see the terrible truth for themselves, the m ajority o f the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
N o ttin g h a m supporters in the Kop. still thought there had been a pitch invasion o r other m isbehaviour by
Liverpool fans. They co n tin u ed singing and c h a n tin g incongruously. This infuriated som e Liverpool fans who
were already distraught. A few began to run tow ards the Kop end. T h e police feared violence might result on
top o f the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large n u m b e r o f officers to form a line across the
w idth o f the pitch at the K op e n d an d advance up to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
m oved. T here the line stood as an insurance against disorder but doing nothing. O th e r officers were posted to
the p e rim e te r track facing the north stand for the sam e purpose. To those distressed an d distraught who
w anted urgent action, this large contingent o f passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
intensified.

Misinformation
   98. At ab o u t 3.15 pm, M r G ra h a m Kelly. C h ie f Executive o f the FA. Mr K irton also o f the FA an d Mr
G r a h a m Mackrell. Secretary o f Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for inform ation. M r
D uckenfield told them he th o ught there were fatalities and the gam e was likely to be a b a n d o n ed . He also said a


                                                             16
gate had been forced and there h ad been an inrush o f Liverpool supporters. He pointed to one o f the televisic
screens focussed on gate C by the Leppings Lane tu rnstiles and said " T h a t's the gate tha t's been forced: there
been an inrush". Inevitably Mr Kelly was interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke o f the two stone
concerning the gate - the fans' account that the police had opened it. the police assertion that the fans ha
forced their way in.

  99. About 3.30 pm there was a further meeting in the C lub's b oard ro o m . M r D uckenfield went there anc
met M r Kelly, the referee an d representatives o f the three clubs. A C C Jackson was also there. Mi
Duckenfield indicated the m atch was likely to be a b a n d o n e d although no firm ruling was given. He a d d e d that
he did not want people to know it was to be a b a n d o n e d lest the dispersing crowd h a m p e r the emergency
operations.

Public Announcements
   100. Later the m anagers o f the two te am s were asked to go to the control room . T hey were invited the re to
make a public an n o u n c e m e n t to calm the crowd. M r Kenny Dalglish agreed to d o so. H e told the crowd that
there were problem s and asked them to assist the police a n d those rendering first aid. He asked for calm a n d his
message was well received. It was th e n 3.56 pm. At 4.10 p m it was an n o u n c e d that the m a tch was a b a n d o n e d
for that day. Again that message was received calmly by the crowd most o f w h o m behaved responsibly as they
dispersed.

Fire Brigade
   101. Meanwhile the emergency services had been in action. At a bou t 3.10 pm a request cam e from the
perim eter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the w ire m esh. Sergeant G o d d a r d contacted the police garage
close by w ithout success. At 3.13 pm . P C Bichard requested H e a d q u arte rs to call the fire service to bring
hydraulic cutting e q u ip m e n t to the L eppings Lane entrance.

   102. T here was no arrangem ent for a fire officer to be present d uring the match. However, the M a jo r
Disaster Plan required all em ergency services to be alerted. After "phone messages w hich m ust be described
later, fire appliances arrived at both Leppings Lane a n d Penistone R oad at 3.22 pm. At b o th entrances their
arrival surprised police w ho were u n in fo rm ed as to why they had been called or where they shou ld go.

  103. At Leppings Lane a police Inspector told S tation Officer Swain "I d o n 't really th in k we need you".
Another police officer then asked for m ore resuscitators as people were dying so M r Swain radioe d for ten fire
appliances. Each carries oxygen an d resuscitation eq u ip m en t.

   104. At the Kop end. Leading F irem an Housley arriv ed w ith an em ergency tender a n d S tation Officer
Fletcher in a n o th er appliance, each with a crew. T he em ergency tender cam e along the roadw ay by the south
stand but owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefore backed out an d w ent to the Leppings
Lane entrance losing som e eight m inutes. From there. M r Housley an d his crew went o n to the pitch with
resuscitation equipm ent. T hey r endered help there and later at the gym nasium . M r Fletcher a n d his m en ran
along behind the so u th stand carrying cutting eq u ip m en t a n d oxygen cylinders. W hen th e y arrived at the
fence, the cutting eq u ip m en t was not required as by th e n the last o f the d ead a n d injured were being removed
from the pens. M r Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area u n d er the police box a n d firemen assisted in carrying
victims as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.

South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYM AS)
   105. Before 1986 there had been no SYM AS representative routinely present at Hillsborough matches. T he
Club was content, as indeed are m any o th e r clubs, to rely u pon the St Jo h n ’s A m bulance Brigade a n d a 999 call
if necessary. From 1986 onwards, after representations, the Club provided two seats in th e south stand for
SYMAS staff at League matches. At o n e stage it was suggested they would be best placed in the north stand
close to the gym nasium which had been designated as the casualty centre in the event o f a m a jo r incident. T he
south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYMAS staff closer to the players’ tunnel should a player be
injured. These seats were, however, not available at C u p semi-finals. SYMAS representatives nevertheless
attended at the se m i- fi n a l s by a rrange m ent with the police in 1988 and again in 1989. T h e SYM A S officers
stood on the ram p leading to the pitch at the north-east corner. They had one am b u lan c e o utside the ground
and one on standby.

   106. On 15 April 1989. Officers Higgins and Eason were at the ground with an am b u lan c e a n d crew. They
noticed fans on the track and went to the Leppings Lane e n d whilst the game was still in progress. T hey began
lo attend to casualties. Meanwhile, at 2.59 pm . there had been a call from Police Constable W augh at police
H e a d q u arte rs to the Hillsborough police control asking if am bulanccs were required. T his was on the
instruction ot C h ie f Inspector E d m u n d so n who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise and snatches o f speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no reports o f injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
ground tha t there m ight be injuries, police H e a d q u arte rs notified SYMAS that am bulances might be required
T hen, seconds later. Mr M urra y's request for a fleet o f am bulances was relayed to SYMAS. They reacted at
once. A m bulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entra nce at 3.13 p m an d at the Penistone Road
en trance at 3.17 pm. In all. som e 42 a m b u lan c es attende d. 31 o f them from SYMAS and 11 from
n eighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm . they had conveyed so m e 172 casualties to the N o rth ern G eneral
H ospital an d the Royal H allam shire Hospital.

Gymnasium
    107. T he gym nasium had been in use for serving meals to the police. W hen the M ajor D isaster Plan was
ordered, it was cleared a n d d iv id ed into two. O ne end becam e a te m po rary m o rtu a ry , the o th e r was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed an d im provised, brought in m ore an d more
casualties, the scene was initially a n d inevitably chaotic a n d harrowing. There was intense distress am ongst
the injured a n d bereaved; relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead a n d sought to revive them. There
were people looking for missing friends and relations: there were recrim inations, there were scuffles. S om e o f
those involved were the worse for drink. D octors an d nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to a tte n d the injured as best they could in the adverse circumstances. T hose in m ost urgent need o f
hospital tr e a tm e n t were taken to am bulances as they arrived, triage being em ployed to d eterm in e priorities.
Doctors were requested by the police to exam ine each person th o u g h t to be deceased to co nfirm a n d certify
death. A police C onstable was detailed to a tte n d a n d guard each o f the dead a n d a photograph o f each was
ta k en by a police photo g rap h e r so that relatives com ing to identify bodies could be spared the ordeal o f
searching am ongst all who had died.

The Dead and the Injured
   108. O f th e 95 w ho died, the evidence suggests that at least 16 a n d probably 21 cam e through gate C after it
op en e d at 2.52 pm . That is established by the statem ents o f relatives a n d friends who cam e through with them
but survived.

    109. By c o m m en d a b le hard work, a te am o f pathologists headed by Professor U sh e r com pleted
p o st-m o rte m ex a m in a tio n s on all the deceased w ithin 48 hours. They found tha t 88 o f the v ictim s were male
a n d seven female. Thirty-eight were u nder 20 years o f age. 39 were between 20 a n d 29 years a n d only three were
over 50. In virtually every case the cause o f death was crush asphyxia due to com pression o f the chest wall
against o th e r bodies o r fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all but nine cases tha t was the sole cause.
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to ru p tu re the aorta: in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck or chest: in the rem aining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. T hirteen o f those were rib fractures. However, on e was a fractured femur, o n e a fractured
radius a n d the rem aining three involved fractures o f bones o r cartilages round the voice box. These injuries
i ■ st th e victim s m ay have been trodden while on the ground.

   110. Blood sam ples were taken from the dead. N o alcohol was found in any o f the females. O f the males. 51
had no m ore th a n 10 milligrams p e r c e n t in th e ir blood which is negligible: 15 had over 80 m illigram s p e rc e n t
an d six over 120 milligrams per cent.

  111. A lthough the great m ajority o f those w ho died were in pen 3. at least five were in pen 4. Most deaths
occurred a t the front o f the pens but there were a few fatalities fu rth e r back.

   112. In all. som e 730 people com plained o f being injured inside the ground a n d 36 outside it. O f the 730,
ab o u t 30% are thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm . The largest category o f injury was
brursing. especially to the ribs a n d chest.

          113.      1 have given m\ findings as to the basic factual background an d th e main sequence o f events in
        narrative form. There was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to som e tim ings a n d numbers.
        Indeed, the consistenc\ of the evidence has been a rem arkable feature o f this Inquiry. The experiences o f most
        witnesses were unforgettable and no d o u b t the early hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
        existence o f tim ed videos and photographs a n d o f logged a n d taped messages provided reliable checks by
        which to pro m p t an d test witness recollection. Accordingly. I have not for the m ost part b u rd en e d the narrative
        with citations from the evidence o f individual witnesses.

           114.    However, there were several instances o f detailed evidence and assertions being highlighted by the
        media in d r a m a tic a n d em otive term s d uring the hearing. Since some o f those m uch-publicised incidents gave
        rise to unfair criticism, they ought to be the subject o f specific findings. I have therefore dealt with them
        individually at A ppendix 6.

                                  T H E LAYOUT AT T H E L E P P I N G S L A N E E N D

  118. 1 have already observed that th e layout o f the turnstile area, o f the terraces and o f the concourse
between them was the result o f piecemeal changes. A b rief history o f these changes is now necessary.


The History
   119. Before 1965, the Leppings Lane en d consisted entirely o f terracing like th e Kop. In that year, the west
stand was built an d the terraces rem aining in front o f it were tru n ca te d to th e ir present depth, front to back. As
to width, they consisted o f a single standing area with no dividing fences. D u rin g the early 19 7 0 ’s, hooliganism
an d pitch invasions m a d e it necessary to prevent access to the playing area a n d the p erim ete r fences were
therefore erected in 1977.


   120. Section 1 o f the Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Act 1975 em pow ered the Secretary o f State to designate a
sports sta d iu m having, in his opinion, ac co m m o d a tio n for m ore than 10,000 as a s ta d iu m requiring a
certificate from the local authority. H illsborough was so designated with effect from 1 J a n u a r y 1979 by SI
1978/1091. In anticip atio n o f that date. Sheffield W ednesday instructed Eastwood a n d P artners, a firm o f
consulting engineers, to act on the ir b eh a lf especially in their dealings with the local authority. D r Eastwood,
the principal o f the firm , is a highly experienced civil a n d structural engineer a n d has advised several m a jo r
football clubs. H e re c o m m e n d ed that a n u m b e r o f add itio n a l crush barriers sho uld be a d d e d since those
already in place were insufficient to com ply with the G re en G u id e (1976 edition). T hat work was approved
and carried out d uring 1979.


  121. T he relevant local auth o rity at the tim e was the South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council. It set up an Officer
Working Party consisting o f representatives o f the police, the fire service, its own building su rv ey o r’s division
and its own legal a n d ad m in istra tio n d e p a rtm e n t. T he Working Party m a d e inspections and co n su lte d with the
Club a n d D r Eastwood. A Safety Certificate was issued o n 21 D ec em be r 1979 for an indefinite p erio d . It has
rem ained in force ever since a n d has not been am ended.


   122. Schedule 3 o f the certificate sets o u t the m a x im u m crowd capacity for various areas in the ground. T he
figure for the west terrace is 7.200 a n d for the north-west terrace 2,900. These figures were in te n d e d to be in
accordance with the G reen G u id e (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided for a m a x im u m “p acking density" o f
between 54 a n d 27 persons p e r 10 square m etres depending o n the c o ndition o f th e terrace. D r E astw ood had
calculated 8,000 for the west terrace on the basis o f 54 per 10 square metres. H e thought this a ju stified starting
figure in view o f his im proved system o f barriers. However, he reduced it to 7.200 because the re were no
gangways on the terrace a n d he d id not th in k it feasible to provide any. So. the total figure for th e Leppings Lane
terraces was an d is 10.100.


The 1981 Semi-Final
   123. As already m e ntioned, there was crushing at th e C u p semi-final in 1981. T he m atch was between
T ottenham H o tsp u r a n d W olverham pton Wanderers. The police debriefing m inutes after the incident
prophetically refer.


  "to the late arrival o f a large n u m b e r o f spectators who were still w aiting to en ter th e Leppings Lane
  enclosure w hen the m atch started. T he flash point occurred w hen T o tte n h am scored” (at th e K op end) “after
  only three m inutes. T he spectators ju st entering pushed forw ard to see w hat was hap pening a n d caused a
  crush, which resulted in the injuries” .


   124. T hose being crushed called for the perim eter gates to be open e d o n to the track. T h ere was no
im m ediate reaction, according to M r Vaux w ho was there, but fortunately a police Inspector gave instructions
and the gates were then opened. A bout 250 cam e out onto the track. There were broken arm s, legs a n d ribs a n d
38 were treated either in hospital o r by the St J ohn A m bulance Brigade. It is clear from the d o c u m e n ts (a) that
the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure o f 10.100 had been exceeded by over 400 (b) th a t the police
shut o ff further access to the terraces because o f crushing, a n d (c) the police view after the event was tha t the
capacity figure o f 10,100 in the Safety C e rtificate was too high. This latter view was c o m m u n ic ate d to the C lub
by the C h ie f Superintendent then in c o m m a n d o f F Division but it was not pursued.
T hree Pens
    125. Alter this incident in April 1981 th e police requested that the terrace s h ould be d iv id ed into sections
T he object was to improve crowd control by reducing sideways movem ent. D ivision would enable m ore even
d istrib u tio n to be effected when there was a capacity crowd. It w ould also enable the west en d to be used for
both h o m e a n d away supporters who could be segregated in separate pens, if necessary with an em p ty pen
between them.

   126. T his proposal was agreed by the C lub a n d the Officer W orking Party a n d was approved by the local
authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in N ovem ber 1981. They are the fence now se parating pens
2 a n d 3 a n d th a t now separating 5 a n d 6. T he result was to divide the whole terrace into three pens. Access from
the conco urse to the m iddle pen was through the tunnel a n d to the wing pens ro u n d the sides o f the west stand.
D r E astw ood suggested a n d illustrated an altered layout which w ould have provided separate access through
separate banks o f turnstiles to the no rth stand, to each en d o f the west stand, a n d to each o f the three pens.
Whilst th e m ain object o f this was segregation, such a layout w ould have enabled each o f those areas to be
m o n ito re d num erically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its m a x im u m capacity was not exceeded. T h e plan was
not ad o p ted . T h e m a x im u m capacity for th e new centre pen was calculated at 2.200, but no alteration was
m a d e to the Safety Certificate so to limit it n o r was there any m e an s m echanically o f counting the nu m b e rs
going into that pen.

The 1985 Changes
    127. By 1985, Sheffield W ednesday had been p ro m o te d to the First D ivision an d was d raw ing larger
crowds. T h e im provem ent o f the Leppings L ane en d was raised again by the C lub an d D r Eastwood p repared a
n u m b e r o f drawings. These illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by providing m ore turnstiles
in separate banks an d divisions o f the concourse. T he police w anted further divisions o f the terrace itself,
again to im p ro v e control a n d segregation. T here was m uch discussion o f these schemes which included
suggestions o f 29 an d even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, the following alterations were carried o u t in
1985.

New Radial Fences
   128. O n the terraces, two m ore radial fences were fitted. O n e d iv id ed the existing central pen into the
present pen s 3 a n d 4. G ates were fitted at the m o u th o f the tunnel to enable each o f those pens to be closed off.
T h e second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow pen 5 inten ded to be a sterile area. Until
those two fences were added there existed only p erim ete r gates 1 . 2 . 4 . 5 a n d 6. T he creation o f pen 3 required a
new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.

Barriers
    129. T he lines of the new radial fences ran across existing crush b arriers so tha t w ithout m o dification those
barriers w ould have run through the fencing. T he police considered the barriers would be used by fans as
co n v e n ie n t m o u n tin g points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their object. They therefore wished
spans to be removed from the barriers. Had th e ir wishes been m e t in full the result would have been an
u n im p e d e d run in pen 3 from the m o u th o f the tu n n e l dow n the south side o f the new fence to the p e r im e te r D r
Eastwood d u g his heels in against tha t proposal which he rightly regarded as dangerous. H e did however agree
to som e m odification to the m iddle row o f b arriers in the newly created pen 3. chiefly to facilitate access.
Likewise in th e new pen 5. T he 1985 m odifications to the pens are shown on the plan A ppendix 4.

The Turnstiles and Concourse
    130. At th e entrance- modification but no increase in n u m b e r was m a d e at the turnstiles. T he bank 1 to 16
was d iv id ed fro m A to G by the m etal fence now in place a n d th a t division was projected across the concourse
inside the turnstiles in the form o f a brick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through tha t wall b u t
was enlarged to its present size at the request o f the police. T hose alterations were m ade in the interests o f
segregation. T he more elaborate divisions which D r Eastwood had suggested, giving separate access to each
sub-division o f the ac com m odation, were not pursued for financial reasons. In M ay 1985 the Bradford
disaster occurred. T he south stand at Hillsborough h ad w ooden decking a n d the C lu b realised it would have to
u n d erta k e expensive remedial works there. T he cantilever ro o f o f the sam e stand was also discovered to
require expensive repairs.

   131. In fact, shortly after the new dividing fence a n d wall had been built at the Leppings Lane en trance a n d
concourse, the C lub, by agreem ent with C h ie f S u p erin te n d en t Mole, ceased to a c co m m o d ate ho m e supporters
at the Leppings Lane end. There was therefore no longer any need for segregation at tha t end, b u t the wall
rem ained.
   132. Also in ! 985. electronic counting e q u ip m e n t was installed at all turnstiles. This conveyed the running
count for each bank of turnstiles, for exam ple A to G. to a television screen in the Club control room where the
figures were d isp la\ed. In 1986, an electronic eye was installed in each turnstile booth to catch a n d record
anvone who clim bed over the turnstile.

Barrier 144
   133. In Ju n e 1986. the police requested tha t the crush b a rrier nearest to the tunnel at the entra n ce to pens 3
and 4 should be removed to assist the flow o f fans into the pens. They found it caused obstruction because it
was in a good viewing position an d spectators liked to stand against it in n um b ers thereby blocking access by
others further into the pens. T he police also suggested it m ight ham p ereffectiv e evacuation through the tunnel
especially in an emergency. D r Eastwood con sidered the p r o s a n d c o n s o f this proposal an d accepted the police
view. T he O fficer W orking Party approved the proposal at a m eeting on 7 A ugust 1986 on site. A u thority was
given then a n d there by M r Bow neson beh a lf o f the Sheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility
for the Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council on 1 April 1986. Two spans o f the b a r r ie r were
therefore removed, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on A ppendix 4.

Effects of the Layout
   134. The result o f these changes was to d iv id e the terrace into a n u m b e r o f small areas w ithout providing
any com puterised o r m echanical m eans o f iim iting entry num erically into any o n e area if all areas were open
for choice. Before the fences and pens had d iv id ed the terrace, the overall figure o f 10.100 could be m onitored
via the turnstiles and in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was not possible strictly to
ensure co m pliance with Schedule 3 Part 1 o f the Safety Certificate which prescribed a m a x im u m o f 2.900 for
the north-west terrace a n d 7.200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 o f Schedule 2 o f the Safety Certificate
provides:

  "T he n u m b e r o f spectators a d m itted to th e S tadium an d to the several areas o f spe cta to r a c co m m o d atio n
  within the S tadium shall n o t exceed the figures specified in Part 1 o f S chedule 3".

  The C lub h ad to rely upon visual m onitoring.

   135. T h e situation becam e worse however with the division o f th e west terrace into pens. N o t only were
there more a n d s m aller discrete areas but som e were likely to attrac t more than th e ir a p p ro p riate share o f the
10.100 total. It is well recognised that the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, the p ositio n o f the
tunnel vis-a-vis the turnstiles A to G , its labelling and the absence o f signposts adv e rtisin g the wing pens would
draw to it those with terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely th a t pens 3 a n d 4 w ould fill to capacity and
indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. H a d D r E astw ood's plan f o r se p arate turnstile access to
separate sections with separate toilet an d refreshment facilities been im plem en te d , total c o m p u te rise d control
could have been kept.
                                                          CHAPTER 8

                                   LACK O F F IX E D C A P A C IT IE S F O R T H E P E N S

  136. In 1981. when th e terrace was d iv id ed into three areas. D r Eastwood gave the Club the figure o f 2.200
capacity for the centre pen. He based this on the G reen G uide, m aking such allowances as he thought right. No
doubt the n u m b e rs could have been counted in via the turnstiles if only that pen was in use o r if such pens as
were in use were filled sequentially, but not otherwise.

   137. After the 1985 changes. D r Eastwood did not him self give any figures for the new pens 3 an d 4.
S om eone on his staff however split the figure 2.200 into 1.200 for pen 3 a n d 1.000 for pen 4. T hose figures did
not even take account o f the fact tha t pen 5 had been carved out o f pen 4 which was b o u n d to have a reducing
effect on capacity. Nevertheless, the figures o f 1.200 an d 1.000 were put on a draw ing e m an a tin g from
Eastwood an d Partners a n d the figures have been notionallv regarded since as applicable by the C lub an d the
police. They are in fact too high.

  138. D r Nicholson, at the Research an d Laboratory Services D ivision o f th e H ealth an d Safety Executive,
has calculated that the figures for pens 3 an d 4 respectively w ould be 1.015 a n d 1.036 if the strength and
spacing o f the crush barriers h ad com plied with the G reen G uide. But they d id not.

Departures from the Green Guide
    139. In pen 3, four out o f five gaps in the lines o f crush b arriers do not conform with paragraph 115 o f the
G re en G u id e (1986). In pen 4, nine out o f ten do not conform. In particular, the spans taken out o f the barriers
in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess o f the m a x im u m o f 1.4 m e tres prescribed. O n e gap was 57% w ider than
the G re e n G u id e m axim um . Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from th e m o u th o f the tunnel to the
b a rrier which collapsed. D r E astwood ju stified these larger gaps by the absence o f gangways. Fans had to be
able to get in a n d out a n d sta n d ard gaps te n d ed to get blocked u p . T h e effect o f his reasoning was tha t the
absence o f gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice o f a second safety feature,
nam ely gaps o f strictly limited width.

   140. Again, the removal o f barrier 144 was bound, as D r Eastwood conceded, to affect capacity. In fact it
did m ore, as I shall indicate later.

   141. C apacity should also have taken account o f two further d e p a rtu re s from the G reen G uide. If. as was
the case, the p erim eter gates were not regarded as exits, some 40% o f those in pens 3 a n d 4 were m ore than 12
m e tres from an exit (and there was no gangway) contrary to the a im o f paragraph 96. Four out o f five o f the
crush barriers in pen 3 a n d six out o f nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
were the old barriers which had been repaired a n d plated where th e ir bases h ad corroded an d fresh concrete
h ad been applied, raising the level o f the steps. T h e point is not a c ad e m ic since, in the event, m any fans were
bent painfully over barriers u n d er great pressure.

   142. D r N icholson calculated tha t when all relevant fa c to r' regarding the configuration an d the G reen
G u id e are taken into account, the m a x im u m capacity for pen .   jit', have been 822 an d for pen 4.871.

Safety Certificate
   143. W h a te v er should have been the m a x im u m capacities for p e n s 3 a n d 4, the fact is that no figures at all in
respect o f th e m were put into the Safety Certificate. Despite all the changes in layout o f the fences and barriers,
the two figures, 2.900 for the north-west terrace an d 7.200 for th e west terrace, have rem ained as the only
m a x im a with which the Club has to comply.

   144. Section 2(1) o f the Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Act 1975 provides (so far as is relevant):

  “A Safety Certificate shall contain such term s a n d conditions as the local authority consider necessary o r
  ex p e d ie n t to secure reasonable safety at the s ta d iu m when it is in u s e . . . "

  S ection 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):

  “ W ith o u t p re ju d ic e to sub-section (1) above, a Safety C e rtifica te -
  (a) shall specify the m a x im u m n u m b e r o f spectators to be a d m itte d to the stadium ;
  (b) m a y specify the m a x im u m n u m b e r to be a d m itte d to different parts o f it;
  (c) shall include term s an d c o n d itio n s-
  ... (iii) as to the number, strength a n d situation o f any crush barriers."
Section 2(2) was repealed by the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987, section 19, which
gave power to the Secretary o f State to lay down, by order, te rm s a n d conditions. N o ord er has yet been
made and guidance from the H om e Office has recom m end ed local auth orities to approach the ir
function u nder section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See H om e
Office Circular 71/1987 dated 25 N ovem ber 1987, Annex A. paragraph 6.)

   145. It is clear that when the certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council went
further than sim ply to fix the m a x im u m n u m b e rs for the whole Stadium . They prescribed figures for
each part o f the ground not merely by the four points o f the com pass but by specified sections.

   146. Section 8(1) o f the 1975 Act requires the holder o f the certificate before carrying out any
proposals to a lter o r extend the stadium o r any o f its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
operation to give notice o f those proposals to the local authority. T h at obligation is specifically
repeated in Sheffield Wednesday's certificate at Schedule 2 P aragraph 5(2). T he Club com plied with
the requirem ent. Having received notice o f the alterations to the pens an d the barriers, the local
authority ought, in my view, to have a m en d e d the Safety Certificate accordingly. T hey d id not do so.

Why was the Safety Certificate not Amended?
   147. Although D r Eastwood acknowledged that the various changes to the layout would have had
an effect on capacity, he d id not take active steps to see th a t a p p ro p riate a m e n d m e n ts were m ad e. He
says he m e n tio n e d from tim e to tim e that the alterations w ould have an effect on capacity a n d th a t he
did not realise the Safety Certificate was not regularly u p d ated . However. 1 find two m e m o r a n d a in
early 1987 highly significant. D r Eastwood's assistant M r Strange was concerned with queries from
the FA as to Hillsborough's capacity for a semi-final. M r Strange recorded these questions in a
m em orandum :-

  ■“Has any account been taken for alterations d one on Leppings Lane over the last few seasons? Is the 10,200
  or so figure still correct? I said that in my o pinion it needs to be adjusted, better do it now than later."

  148. M r Strange's next m e m o (a few days later) records as follows:-

  " D r Eastwood says leave the capacity at Leppings Lane end as it is. providing police have gates u n d e r West
  stand o p en so that people can distribute throughout the terrace evenly."

Although he says the last nine words do not report him accurately. D r Eastwood accepts the rest o f that
message.

    149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought to have been reviewed and
altered. T he unhappy situation is that the police believed even the overall figure o f 10.100 to be to o high as far
back        ' P I . T h a t was reported to the C lub but apparently not to D r E a s t v — M eanw hile, that global figure
had b\_w. rendered acad em ic by the sub-division o f the terrace w hich was                tV  •! in the Saiety Certificate
at all. If p roper m a x im u m figures had been inserted in the certificate for each o f the pens, the C lu b a n d the
police might well have been prom pted to find som e m eans o f lim iting the num be rs entering those pens o th e r
than by visual m onitoring. T his could have been d o n e by im p le m e n tin g one o f D r E astw ood’s plans for totally
separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It could have been d one by insisting on sequential filling o f pens at
all matches: alternatively, by counting fans into each viewing area.

The City Council
   150. T h a t the Safety Certificate was not a m e n d e d an d individual capacities not reviewed ca nnot be laid
solely at D r Eastw ood's door. He was. after all. consultant engineer to the C lub an d responsibility for the
certificate was that o f the local authority. W hen the South Yorkshire C o unty C ouncil h a n d e d over to the
Sheffield City Council, the latter delegated all its powers an d d u ties u n d e r the 1975 Act to its G eneral Purposes
Panel. A p p a r e n tly therefore, the decision-m aking body on b eh a lf o f the Council was th a t Panel, altho ugh two
specific fu n ctio n s were delegated to the H ead o f A d m in istratio n an d Legal D ep a rtm e n t - th e p o w erto issue a

                                                                 25
    152. T he Officer Working Party was superseded by a Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Advisory G roup, but
apart from the change o f the nam e the system c o n tin u ed as before. Mr Bownes a tten d e d the inspections
and m eetings o f the Advisory G r o u p together with the representatives o f the police, the fire service, the
d e p a rtm e n t o f health and c o n s u m e r services, a n d the building engineer's division o f the Council. The
latter was an engineer an d ought therefore to have been alive to the sam e issues as D r Eastwood.

  153. T he Advisory G ro u p seems to have w orked in a very inform al m anner. A short passage from M r
Bownes' evidence gives the flavour o f it:—

     “Q     W ho was taking the lead in the working party as you u n derstood it?

      A     T h a t is a good question, sir. Leads were com ing from several different d irections really.

      Q     W h o chaired it. if anyone?

      A     N obody as such. sir. It was an inspection rath e r than a m eeting as 1 u n d e rsta n d it.

      Q     W ho decided what s hould be inspected'’

      A     Effectively the group itself, sir. it seem ed to me. T h ere was also som e input from the Club
            representative as to. if you like, an elem ent o f direction as to what should be looked at.

      Q     A part from the inspections the working party m et. presumably, o r did they only m eet                            on
            inspections?

      A     No. sir, I have referred to three previous meetings.

      Q     W h o took the ch a ir w hen it met?

      A     I suppose it could be said that I did. to som e extent.

      Q      T h ere is no point in having inspections unless you form conclusions as a result o f that inspection, is
             there?

      A     T h a t is correct.

      Q     T h ere must presum ably have been som e m eeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
             together an d decided w hat, if anything, should be done.

      A     T here was not. to my recollection, no.

      Q     How did you decide w hat should be done, i f anything n eeded to be done?

      A     T here were discussions on the site, particularly in relation to b arrier 144. which took place at the
             time.

      Q     N othing m ore th a n that and no record anyw here o f any decisions that were m ade?

      A     No. sir."

T h e decision to remove barrier 144 was assented to on behalf o f the City Council by M r Bownes. It was not
referred to the G eneral Purposes Panel. W h e th e r M r Bownes strictly had any power to assent to it is to say the
least very doubtful. But he him self adm its that he was ill-equipped to do so. He knew very little about football
grounds. H e had read the file passed on from South Yorkshire C o unty Council a n d assum ed all had been run
satisfactorily by them.

  154. It was recorded, however, in a report which M r Bownes drafted that " th e co nditio ns (in the Safety
Certificate) give some cause for concern as they a p p e a r to be in a d eq u a te o r in a p p ro p ria te in som e areas” . T he
report to the G eneral Purposes Panel suggested that new Safety Certificate co nditions should be drafted.

   155. T h e task o f revising the Safety Certificate was begun in Ju n e 1986. In July 1987. a draft was sent to the
fire service to which they replied in August. In S eptem b er 1987, the Panel was info rm ed that the redrafting was

30 March         1989. 16 d a y s b e f o r e t h i s d i sa s t e r .

   156. Meanwhile, the Safety Certificate has rem ained u n a m e n d e d since 1979. T he enlargem ent o f the Kop
in 1986 increased its capacity to 2 1.000. Although this was known a n d agreed by the Council it had not been
the subject o f any change in the certificate which still showed the capacity o f the Kop as 16.850. M r Mackrell.
Sheffield W ednesday's Secretary, raised the question o f a m e n d m e n ts to the Safety Certificate and in p articular
with regard to the Kop in April 1987 with Eastwood a n d Partners but nothing resulted.

  157. Sheffield U nited Football Club was designated u n d er the 1975 Act on 3 July 1984. A Safety Certificate
was about to be issued by South Yorkshire C o unty Council at the tim e it handed over to the Sheffield City
Council on 1 April 1986. N o certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

   158. T he explanation given for these delays was pressure o f work. Mr Bownes as C h ief Licensing Officer
was responsible for 32 o th e r licensing systems when this one was a d d e d to his b urden. He had a staff o f only
five. 1fully accept that the addition o f further statutory responsibilities to the already heavy w orkload o f a local
authority with curbs on its expenditure creates problem s. But it is clear that the attention given to this
im portant licensing function was woefully inadequate.

Summary
   159. T he Safety Certificate contained no m a x im u m figures for individual pens. T here was therefore no
sanction o r provision focussing attention as to the need to limit entry to the pens by numbers. T h e layout at
Leppings Lane as it evolved m a d e electronic o r mechanical control over nu m bers entering individual pens
impracticable if all pens were to be available. G iven an im p o rta n t m atch and a capacity attendance, fans were
likely to crowd into p opular sections like pens 3 and 4. T hose pens were likely to becom e overfull well before
warning cam e from the turnstiles that num bers were ap proa ching the terrace m a x im u m o f 10.100. Control
over num be rs an d the avoidance o f overcrowding therefore d e p e n d ed entirely on visual m onitoring o f the
crowd.




                                                                                            27
                                                     CHAPTER 9

                        LACK O F E F F E C T I V E M O N I T O R I N G O F T H E T E R R A C E S

  160. M onitoring the spectators on the terraces so as to avoid overcrowding involves observing the num bers
and th e ir distrib ution in each area, m aking decisions as to when an area is “ full", taking steps to close it off
and moving spectators from o n e area to another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problem s. 1) W ho
should carry it out? 2) W hen is an area “full”? 3) Fear of hooliganism .

Who should Monitor the Terraces?
   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? S hould it b e the police? Should it be both? O r should it be by
arrange m ent, depending upon th e ground or section o f the g r o u n d i n question?

   162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a m atch on its premises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at that event. T he G reen G u id e (1986) provides:

       “ 23. T he safety o f the public inside the ground is th e responsibility o f those who stage the event and
             adm inister th e grou nd in which it is held, i p t h e “m a n ag e m en t". T h is responsibility applies in
             both normal and em ergency situations...

         195. ...there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

               (a)   controlling or directing m e m b ers o f the public who are entering o r leaving th e ground, to
                     help achieve an even flow o f people to the viewing areas a n d safe dispersal o f spectators on
                     the terraces or viewing slopes:

               (b)   patrolling the groun d to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarm s or extinguishing
                     fires:

               (c)   m a n n in g entrances, exits a n d o th e r strategic points, especially exit doors a n d gates which
                     are continuously open whilst the ground is in use:

               (d)   assist i ng police as ap p ro p riate or as requested with crowd control: and

               (e)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency."

The Interim Popplewell Report
   163. T h ere was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry' held by Mr Justice Popplewell
in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club an d the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report, M r Justice
Popplewell quoted from a report p ro d u ce d for the M inister o f H ousing an d Local G o v e rn m e n t in 1969 as
follows:-

  “T h e responsibility for controlling crowd beha v io u r is d ivided between the police an d the club operatin g the
  ground. T h e broad line o f division being that police are responsible for m ove m ent o f spectators in public
  thoroughfares an d from public thoroughfares into the ground, while th e club is responsible for the control of
  spectators once they are on the club’s prem ises . .

M r Justice Popplewell said he d id not quarrel with that view and went on to o bserve that in p ractice the police
have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He th e n said (paragraph 3.8):

   “ It follows, therefore, that as a m a tte r o f practice, while the physical safety o f the building an d the
   m a in te n a n c e a n d good housekeeping o f the ground must always be the responsibility o f the club, the police
   have to take the de facto responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all that entails, d uring th e game . .

M r Justice Popplewell w ent on to instance evacuation o f the ground as a procedure in which only the police
could b ea r the responsibility o f su p e r v is in g the organisation o f the crowd.

The Final Popplewell Report
  164. He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 o f his Final R eport. There, he cam e down m o re firmly in
favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “ Because, as a m a tte r o f


                                                            28
practice, police officers have regularly attended in large num be rs at football grounds, u has somehow been
assumed bv the clubs th a t the responsibility for control o f w hat goes on inside the ground has passed from
them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcem ent of law and order. T hose responsible
for organising a private function, however, have the primary and continuing obligation and responsibility to
ensure reasonable safetv for those who are invited on to th e ir premises." Mr Justice Popplewell ended that
section as follows: “ It c a n n o t be too strongly em phasised tha t it is upon the club, or the occupier of the ground
who is putting on the function, that the primary' and continuing obligation rests."

   165. T h ere remains, however, the q uestion w hether there are som e grounds o r p arts o f grounds where the
club may need to rely upo n the police (w hom they pay to atten d ) to control filling o f pens and m o n ito rin g them
for overcrowding. In o th e r words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they m a y need,
and by agreement be entitled, to em ploy the police to act as th e ir agents in certain circumstances. T h is very
difficult an d grey area as to club an d police responsibility will need to be reviewed in g re a terd ep th at stage two
of this Inquiry.

Arrangements at Hillsborough
  166. W hat is clear, however, is that de facto the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility for
control o f the pens at th e Leppings Lane end. T h e evidence o f the senior officers who had been co n c e rn e d with
policing at Hillsborough over the years was all one way on this point. Only M r D uckenfield. who had not
policed at Hillsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.

   167. M r Lock is now security officer at Sheffield W ednesday a n d was formerly a police S u p erin te n d e n t at
Hillsborough m atches occupying M r M urra y's role. He c laim ed there h ad been a formal although unw ritten
agreement between the Club and the police in about 1982. w hereby the police agreed to steward the Leppings
Lane end o f the ground. Such a formal agreem ent is denied by o th e r senior officers an d I d o not accept that any
formal agreement was reached. Nevertheless, a practice o r arrange m ent d id develop which was know n and
accepted by both Club a n d police. Its effect was that th roughout the ground th e stewards were responsible for
m anning exits a n d entrances, for controlling entry into th e stands, for assisting spectators to th e ir seats in the
stands an d for helping to control the exits after the m atch. T hey were also responsible at the Kop e n d on the
terraces for keeping gangways clear a n d helping to control the crowd which usually consisted o f hom e
supporters. At the Leppings Lane end. however, there were no gangways o n the terraces a n d the crowd
consisted usually (and always since 1987) o f away supporters. M r M ole a n d o th e r senior officers accepted that
it would have been unreal an d u nreasonable to expect stew ards to go onto those Leppings L ane terraces. They
would not have been effective there; moreover, they could well have been in s o m e danger from hostile away
supporters. T he police accepted, therefore, that the p ro p er filling o f the p en s a n d m o n ito rin g th e m for
overcrowding could a n d would not be carried out by stewards. Many stewards have te nded to be either
extremely young or som ew hat elderly. T h ey are paid only a m odest sum (£9 at Hillsborough) a n d they are not
suitable either by physique or by training to cope on a crow ded terrace w ith no gangways.

Case for the South Yorkshire Police
   168. N o t - ithstanding the overw helm ing evidence from senior police as alri dy m e n tio n e d a n d from the
C lub. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police continued th ro u g h o u t the hearing to contend th a t the C lub and
not the police were responsible for filling a n d m onitoring the pens a n d tha t this was well know n to bo th parties.
He m a in ta in ed that the police were there essentially to secure a n d preserve law a n d order. Q u ite apart from the
police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance o f the South Yorkshire Police has not always
been to th a t effect.

Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club Limited
   169. In M arch 1986. the South Yorkshire Police A uthority o bta ined a ju d g e m e n t against Sheffield U nited
Football C lub for money du e for police services provided at Sheffield U n ite d 's matches. The defence h ad been,
inter alia, that the police were not providing “special police services". They were doing no m ore than
performing their normal police duties o f securing an d preserving law a n d o r d e r am ongst a crowd. T h e police
argument was th at they had additional duties. In h isju d g e m e n t, B oreham J sum m arise d the instructions for
policing as providing for:-

 ■ (a) the m a in te n an c e o f enforcem ent Qf law an d order:

  (b) the enforcem ent o f the C lu b ’s gro u n d regulations, m a n y o f which are concerned with law an d order;

  (c) the safety an d com fort o f the spectators, officials a n d players,”
H e re f erre d to t h e a r g u m e n t o f C o u n s e l for t h e S o u th Y orks hire Poli ce as follows:-

  "Thirdly. here the police were not discharging their own duty to the public: they were in fact discharging i he
  C lub's d uties to the spectators w hom the Club invited to the ground. The Club chose to invite large n um bers
  to the ir private premises; it was the C lub’s duty to provide for th e ir safety, health and com fort. T hey could
  have em ployed a security firm as banks a n d others have to do to protect their interests; they chose to request
  the police to perform those d uties knowing tha t the police expected payment. Fourthly, the police w ithin the
  ground provided serv ices which it was not within the scope o f the ir public duty to perform . For instance,
  they assisted in crowd m a n ag e m en t and in the enforcem ent o f such ground regulations as refused entry to
  those w ho tried to enter w ithout paying o r p rohibited spectators encroaching on parts o f the ground which
  their entry fee d id not entitle th e m to enter. It may be. s ubm its M r Bentley, th a t the m a in te n a n c e o f law an d
  o rder was the p red o m in a n t aim but there were other services perform ed."

T h e learned Judge found:-

  “ In a d d itio n to w hat m ay be called their law an d o rd e r role the police were expected a n d d id take part in
  crowd m a n agem ent, ensuring the safety o f spectators, the enforcem ent o f the C lu b 's regulations an d to be on
  hand to assist in the event o f som e emergencies such as fire o r accidental injury.”

Police Practice at the Leppings Lane End
    1 70. At League m atches at Hillsborough, the police p ractice was to decide in advance how m a ny a n d which
pens w ould be used. If a m odest crowd was a n ticip ate d only o n e or two pens m ight be needed. It was better to
confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent th em ru n n in g ab o u t an d (b) to reduce the n u m b e r o f police
required. T h e practice was then to fill the pens one by one. T h is involved making a ju d g e m en t as to w hen a pen
was full. T h ere would then be a police decision to close tha t pen a n d fill another. It was regarded as im practical
a n d unsafe for police officers (just like stewards) to go o n to the Leppings Lane terraces w ith away supporters.
T his m e an t tha t m onitoring the n um bers in any pen had to be d one from vantage points o utside it. Here, the
police were m uch better placed than the stewards. T here was a good view from the control box a n d the
television screens there. T here were officers on the p erim ete r track. N o stewards were placed there becausc
having bo th police an d stew ards interfered with the viewing. T here were also police in the west sta n d who
could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the police a good appreciatio n of
the state o f the terraces. W hen it was necessary to shut o f f access to the pens officers on the concourse could be
inform ed by radio a n d could take the necessary steps.

“Find Their Own Level"
    171, At C u p semi-finals, a different approach was ad o p ted . All th e pens were op ened from the start an d the
policy was “to let the fans find th e ir own level". T his phrase was repeated again a n d again by police officers at
the Inquiry. W hat it m eant was tha t no specific direction was given to fans enterin g through the turnstiles.
They were free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. If they becam e uncom fortable o r w ished for any
o th e r reason to m ove their position, then theoretically they could m ove elsewhere. In this way it was h o p ed that
the fans on the terraces w ould level themselves out a n d th a t distribution would be achieved w ithout police
intervention. On these occasions, the gates at the top o f the radial fences were locked in the o p e n position. It
was sought to argue, therefore, t h a t there was freedom o f m o v e m e n t from one pen to a n o th e r enabling fans to
“find the ir level” ,

    172. T h is argum ent was bad both in theory an d in practice. In theory, the w hole object o f the radial fences
had been to achieve even d istrib u tio n by directing fans into desired positions. To say then that they could move
freely from on e pen to a n o th e r would defeat the object and enable fans to go from a less p o p u la r to a m ore
p o p u la r area without inhibition. In practice this did not h a p p e n because the position and size o f the gates was
such th a t once a substantial n u m b e r o f spectators were in. the gates were unno ticeable a n d inaccessible
especially to those towards the front who might have m ost need o f them .

  1 73. T h e sam e argum ent was deployed to suggest tha t individual m a x im u m capacities for in dividual pens
need not be assessed since the presence o f the open radial gates still m eant th a t the terrace was one area. In
practice this simply was not so. T h e photograph at A ppendix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.59 pm shows
very clearly the congestion in pens 3 and 4 contrasted with the sparseness in pen 6. T h is gives the lie to the
suggestion tha t the fans could, if uncom fortable, “find their own level” .

  174.    T h e effect o f this policy was that whereas at League m a tch e s the police had to m ake a positive decision
when to close on e pen and open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was much m ore likely, the police
left it to t h e t a n s t h e m s e l v e s to " f i n d t h e i r o w n l ev el " . E f f e c t i v e l y . the> w e r e left t o m o n i t o r t h e i r o w n c o m f o r t
and saf et y s o a s t o a v o i d o v e r c r o w d i n g . T h e p o l i c e w o u l d o n l y i n t e r v e n e w h e n t h e r e w a s s o m e o v e r t s i g n t h a t an
area w a s “ full".

When is an Area "Full"?
   175. O ver the years, spectators on terraces have co m e to accept c o n d itio n s which are often very
uncomfortable and not infrequently dow nright dangerous. They are subjected to buffeting and squeezing to
get in and out o f the terraces. They are packed tightly an d exposed to surging a n d sway ing d uring the match.
They put up with these conditions because they are devoted to the gam e a n d because there is little they can do
about them . They believe the discomfort will pass an d nothing very untow ard will happen. Usually tha t is the
case and they are reassured by it. Most clubs have not. until very recently, consulted the ir supporters as to their
grievances o r suggestions. T he practice has been to pack th e m in on the a ssu m p tio n tha t if they are prepared to
put up with it the c o n d itio n s must be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased pro p o rtio n o f seating as against standing
accom m odation. Terraces have still been packed.

   176. It is said tha t many fans enjoy these features o f terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
discomfort, w eathering sways and surges together an d cha nting the sam e songs a n d slogans en m a sse d o evoke
good h u m o u r an d have produced a spirit o r cult o f th e terraces w hich many enjoy. Equally there are m a n y who
simply e n d u re these things for the football, for a che ap ticket o r indeed for the chance o f getting in at all. And
before H illsborough most fans on the terraces, ev en if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had not realised the narrow
margin o f safety between an uncom fortable crush an d a fatal one.

    177. T he G re en G u id e sought to im prove safety an d com fort by laying down criteria for m a x im u m
capacity, ie defining what is “ full". T h e sta n d ard set was 54 persons p e r 10 square m etres in favourable
conditions but fewer, down to 27. in less favourable conditions. T h e tendency may have been to a im o f f too
little from the higher figure for shortcom ings in the layout. C ertainly the figures considered ap p ro p ria te in
pens 3 an d 4 at Hillsborough were too high, as already indicated.

   178. Even taking the highest figure suggested in the G re en G uide, the problem rem ained th a t those
supposed to be m onitorin g pens visually h ad a nd have little idea o f what 54 persons per 10 square m etres look
like. M r D uckenfield's opinion was that w hen a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be “shoulder to
shoulder and chest to back". T h at view may deriv e from seeing the sort o f density crow ds regularly endure
without injury resulting. But it is much m o re dense than the G re e n G u id e m a x im u m .

   179. T h e South Yorkshire Fire Brigade provided the 1nquiry with p hotographs o f people standing in an area
of 10 square m etres at various densities o f packing. Together with my Assessors an d others. I took part in a
similar expe rim e nt at the Health an d Safety Executive's Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a room o f m easured
area at densities o f 54. 80 and 100 per 10 square metres. It was clear from the photographs an d from our
experiment tha t the m a x im u m density set out in the G re en G u id e left considerably more room th a n those
monitoring the terraces would have left before declaring an area "full” .

   180. T he tendency has been to allow the pens to fill until the fans com plain o r show signs o f discom fort. If
the density at the front appeared less t h a n at the back, the Tannoy would invite the fans to m ove forward to
make room for more. T he evidence before the Inquiry a n d m a n y anecdotal letters I have received clearly show
there have been frequent occasions w hen the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused
discomfort and som etim es, for b rief periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
eases and the incident passes unrecorded.

  181. After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final. H illsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 1987.
There was evidence tha t the central pens were uncom fortably overcrowded on that occasion a n d again at the
1988 C u p semi-final, although entry to the tunnel was blocked o f f by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
because the pens were deem ed to be “full".

Fear of Hooliganism
   182. O ver the last few years, hooliganism at an d associated with football m atches has strongly influenced
the strategy o f the police. In their plans an d m a nagem ent they have concentrated on averting o r containing
threats to public order. This is u n dersta ndab le an d indeed c o m m en d a b le . But it has led to an im balance
between the need to quell a minority o f troublem akers and the need to secure the safety an d co m fort o f the
majority. In the police O perational O rder, the em phasis was upon prevention o f d iso rd e r an d in p articular
prevention o f access to the field o f play. T here was no express requirem ent that officers on the p erim ete r track
or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed, the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling th e unruly since
the less room they had the less scope there was for misbehaviour.

Summary
   183. A lthough the police had accepted de facto responsibility for m onitoring the pens, th e ir policy on the
day was to leave fans to “ find their own level" and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.
Whilst in theory the police would intervene if a pen becam e "full", in practice they p erm itte d the test o f
fullness to be w hat the fans would tolerate.

  184. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 a n d 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncom fortable. To allow any m ore into those pens was likely to cause injuries: to allow in a large stream was
courting disaster.
    was                                                        C H A P T E R 10
^nce
                                               T H E B U I L D - U P AT T H E T U R N S T I L E S

             185. The decision to open gate C. an d subsequently gates A and B too. was forced on to the police by the
1 the     crowd co nditions which developed ou tside the turnstiles. The crush was so severe that injuries were being
rder.     suffered and dea ths were feared unless the pressure could be swiftly relieved. Why th e cro w d pressure had built
si o f    to such intensity was one oft he principal issues during the hearing. The suggested causes m ust be considered in
          turn.

Acre      The Physical Layout
was          186. I have already described a n d illustrated the approach to the turnstiles (Appendices l an d 2). At
          Penistone Road a n d at many other grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced a n d with a
          sufficient waiting area for queues to form. N ot so at Leppings Lane. T he building line, the bridge over the D on
          and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perim eter gates set in an arc, an d across a short
          forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. T h e pairs o f tu rnstiles were close together a n d the forecourt, especially
          as divided by the metal fence, provided little space for a waiting crowd.

          The Number of Turnstiles
            187. T he decision to fill the whole o f the north stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
          there to adm it 24,256 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G ) serving the terraces had to adm it
          10.100, ie an average o f just u nder l . 450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road end. 29,800 were
          served by 60 turnstiles, o r just u nder 500 per turnstile.

             188. T he G reen G u id e recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which spectators can pass through
          turnstiles depends on a variety o f local circum stances but states “ in general based on observation and
          experience, it is unlikely that the m a x im u m notional rate p er turnstile would exceed 750 per h o u r” . Since the
          semi-final was an all ticket match requiring no cash tran sa ctio n s, the C lu b considered that a higher rate o f
          about 1,000 per h o u r per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assum es the turnstiles
          working at m a x im u m efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly 1/; hours to adm it all those with terrace
          tickets. Al 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

             189. T he G reen G u id e provides (paragraph 44):-

            "Turnstiles should be o f such num be rs as to ad m it s pectators at a rate w hereby no unduly large crowds are
            kept waiting for a d m is s i o n ..

             190. T he Officer Working Party h ad discussed in 1985 the need, and D r Eastwood's various schemes, for
          improvement o f the turnstile arrangem ents. T h e m a th e m a tic s are elementary. Both the police an d th e Club
          should have realised that the Leppings Lane turnstiles a n d the waiting area outside them would be u n d e r strain
          to ai'mit all the Liverpool supporters in time. Success d e p e n d e d on the spectators arriv in g a t a steady rate from
          .in early h our and upo n the m a x im u m turnstile rate being m aintained. In fact n eith er o f these requirem ents,
          which are inter-linked, was fulfilled. T h a t they might not be so was in my view foreseeable.

           I he "Late" arrival of Liverpool Fans
             191. Between 2,30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5.000 a n d b ecam e
          unmanageable. T he case m ade for the police was that large n u m b e rs o f Liverpool supporters arrived late: a
          high proportion o f th e m were d ru n k an d unco-operative: a high proportion had no tickets: all o f th e m were
          lu ll-bent on getting in on time. T hey say this was unforeseeable and explains why they lost control.

             142.   W hether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 p m were “ la te” was m uch d ebated. T h e ticket
          simply requested its holder "to take u p [his] position 15 m inutes before k ic k -o f f . T h a t m ay have been
          intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take th e ir seats, but it would not be u n rea so n ab le for a
          standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm. W h e th e r they were "late” o r not,
          however, there was certainly a large co ncentration o f Liverpool fans a rriv in g a t ab o u t 2.30 pm a n d after.

           I raffic Delays
               I '>3. It is unlikely tha t traffic conditions had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
           1 1'erpool traffic routes. T here were roadw orks on the M 62 which was the rec om m e nded route. At various
           points the carriageway was reduced from four lanes o r three lanes to two. but no serious delays were reported.

Fine Weather and Drinking
   194. T h e likeliest explanations for the sparse Liverpool attendance in the g ro u n d before 2.30 pm were four­
fold - the w arm weather, drinking, disinclination to e n ter the ground early an d prolong the standing, an d a
tendency o f Liverpool supporters to cut it fine.

   195. T h e police em phasised that at the 1988 semi-final there was no co m p arable build-u p o f “late” arrivals.
They claim, therefore, that they h ad no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988. although the w eather
was fine, it was 11°F co o le rth a n in 1989. 15 April was the sort o f fine spring day which tem pted fans to sit or
stand ab o u t in the sun with a drink. If you had a ticket it would seem m o re pleasant an d sensible to relax in that
way than to e n te r the ground early an d stand on the terrace for an extra hour. Pre-m atch e n terta in m e n t in the
ground had been advertised but did not take place. Even if it had. it may not have been an encouragem ent to
many fans to e n te r so early.

Was Drunkenness a Major Factor in the Crisis at the Turnstiles?
    196. O f those who arrived at 2.30 pm o r after, very many had been d rin k in g at public houses o r had
brought d rin k from ho m e o r an off-licence. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority
were not d r u n k n o r even the worse for drink. T h e police witnesses varied on this. Som e described a high
p ro p o rtio n as drunk, a s"la g e r-lo u ts"o re v e n as "anim als". O th ers described a generally n orm al crowd with an
unco-operative m ino rity who had drunk too m uch. In mv view som e officers, seeking to rationalise the ir loss
o f control, o verestim ated the drunken elem ent in the crowd. T here certainly was such an element. T here were
youngsters influenced by drink an d bravado p ushin g im patiently at the rear o f the crowd thereby exacerbating
the crush. But th e m o re convincing police witnesses, including especially D etective S u p erin te n d en t McKay
an d C h ie f Inspector Creaser as well as a n u m b e r o f responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this elem ent as a minority. T hose witnesses attrib u te d the crush to th e sheer nu m bers o f fans all
anxious to gain entry. There was no criticism o f the crowd by any o f the witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
o r even 2.35 pm . W hat happened then was not a su d d e n d eterioration in th e m o o d o r sobriety o f those
assem bled there. N o d oubt those com ing b e h in d w ould have h ad m ore to drin k a n d would have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd b e c a m e packed into a confined
turnstile area a n d its very density ham pered its passage through the turnstiles.

   197. S u p erin te n d e n t Marshall an d other officers criticised the crowd as unco-o perative because police
exhorta tions to stop pushing an d to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In tha t crush most people
had no control over the ir movements at all. Two incidents involving police horses illustrate the point. O ne
horse was found afterwards to have cigarette b urns on its rum p. Clearly tha t was th e despicable work o f a
hooligan w h eth e r in drink or not. However, there were also eyewitness accounts o f a horse being physically
lifted o ff its feet by the crowd. T h at occurred, as the police accepted, w ithout m alice o r intent but as an
involuntary consequence o f crowd pressure w hich those by the horse's flanks c ould n o t resist any m ore th a n the
horse itself.

Reduced Efficiency of the Turnstiles
   198. T h e labelling o f the turnstiles in the o r d e r A. C. B was confusing. A fan with a B ticket w ho went by
m istake to the w rong side of the metal fence w ould have had the greatest difficulty in getting back a n d ro u n d to
the correct side. T he colour coding was inefficient because the coloured w ooden panels were affixed to the
turnstile walls so low tha t they were not easily visible through a crowd. T h e inform at ion o n the ticket p rinted by
Sheffield W ednesday Football Club was m isleading an d its layout unhelpful, as M r Mackrell frankly conceded.

   199. T h e result was that in the early stages, police officers were pestered by fans for help as to where they
should go. Later, as the crow d becam e m ore dense, fans were presenting th e ir tic k e ts at the wrong turnstiles.
T here were also Liverpool supporters who h a d acquired tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Leppings
Lane. T h ey caused delays in the turnstile o pera tion when entry' was refused a n d afte r a while the police
instructed the opera tors to let them through. T here was further delay because th e crush m a d e it difficult for
fans to get into the turnstile entrances. O nce there, the pressure from b ehind was such as, on occasions, to ja m
them in the doorw ay o r against the paddle o f the turnstile. Finally, there were fans w ithou t tickets who sought
to e n te r by offering paym ent, by seeking to go over o r u n d e r the paddle o r by sliding through w ith a ticket
holder. All o f these activities slowed down th e turnstile rate which at the worst p erio d was only a bout 6 00 per
ho u r per turnstile. T he waiting cro w d th e re fo re ex pa n ded an d as the m inutes passed frustration grew. Visitors


                                                                                         34
who had paid tor tickets and travelled from afar realised they were m aking little forward progress. Frustration
increased pressure and induced panic at the front. D eterm ination to get into the m atch was intensified by
determ in a tio n to get out o f the crush.

Were Fans W ithout Tickets a M ajor Factor in the Build-Up?
  200. It has becom e a fact o f football life that fans do turn up at all-ticket m a tch e s w ithout tickets. It is not
possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable estim ate o f the n u m b e r w ithout tickets on 1 5 April. Police
estimates varied from ab o u t 200 to ab o u t 2.000. T here were certainly frequent requests for tickets o r “spares”
during the hours before the build-up. M any o f those w arned o ff by the police were seen to return to the area.
Some were hanging a bou t o n the bridge. Again, however, the police witnesses w ho m ost im pressed m e did not
consider the n u m b e r o f ticketless fans to be inordinately large. This accords with two o th e r sources o f
evidence.

   201. First, there was a w ide range o f witnesses w ho observed inside the g r o u n d that the Liverpool end was at
a late stage well below capacity s a v e f o r p e n s 3 a n d 4. T he north stand still h ad m any e m p ty seats a n d th e wing
pens were sparse. T he m atch being a sell-out. there were clearly many ticket holders to co m e an d they could
account for the large crowd still outside the turnstiles. H ad the Liverpool a c c o m m o d a tio n been full by 2.40
pm, one could have inferred that most o r m uch o f the large crowd outside lacked tickets.

  202. Secondly, such figures as are available from the C lub's electronic m o n ito rin g system a n d from analyses
by the HSE suggest that no great n u m b e r entered w ithout tickets. They show that the n u m b e r w ho passed
through turnstiles A to G plus those w ho entered through g a te C roughlv equa lle d the terrace capacity figure o f
10.100 for which tickets had been sold. T h e C lub's record showed 7.038 passed through turnstiles A to G.
However, the co u n tin g m echanism on turnstile G was defective, so the H S E d id a study using the video film
and projecting figures from the other turnstiles. This gave an assessment o f 7.494, w ith a m a x im u m o f 7,644
passing through A to G. Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the n u m b e r w ho e n tered th e gro u n d whilst
gate C was open at 2.240 with a m a x im u m o f 2.480. Accordingly, the H SE’s best estim ate o f the total entering
through gate C a n d turnstiles A to G was 9.734 with a m a x im u m o f 1 0 .1 2 4 .1 recognise tha t these can only be
rough checks because, for example, som e with terrace tickets were allowed through turnstiles 1 to 16 a n d there
would be o th e r sim ilar factors which have not form ed p a r t o f the assessm ent. N evertheless, the figures d o
suggest that there was not a very significant body o f ticketless fans in the crow d w hich built up.

The “Conspiracy" Theory
   203. O n b eh a lf o f South Yorkshire police, the theory was advanced tha t the “ late" arrival o f so many
Liverpool supporters was planned to b uck the system. T he suggestion was that fans w ithout tickets conspired
to arrive late a n d create such trouble as would force the police to ad m it th e m to the m atch. T h e slender
ev id en ce upon w hich this theory rested cam e from two sources: overheard con versations in public houses and
the antecedent history o f Liverpool su p p o r te r s a t awav matches.

  204. O n e witness said he heard three Liverpool su pporters saving, in effect, that they w ould m a n ag e to get
in without tickets by causing trouble so that police w ould o pen a gate, a n d tha t they had d o n e this before.
Another witness hea rd two o f a group o f Li verpool supporters say they had no tickets, tha t they w ould go to the
ground ju st before kick-off. that no-one would stop th e m getting in and th a t they h a d not been stopped yet.
Statements were put in relating to two o th e r small groups talking in sim ilar term s.

Liverpool Supporters at Away Matches
  205. T h e South Yorkshire police p rep a re d a dossier o f reports on the b e h a v io u r o f Liverpool fans at away
matches with the object o f showing a p attern o f trouble som e behaviour by large n u m b e rs eith er w ithout tickets
or with forged tickets. W ithout setting o u t the whole history, it can be su m m arise d as follows.

  206. O n three occasions Liverpool fans w ithout tickets were allowed into all-ticket m atches upon paym ent.
(At Watford on 13 F ebruary 1988. 1.500 were a d m itted : at S o utham p ton on 24 S ep te m b er 1988, 150 were
adm itted; at S o u th a m p to n again on 12 D ec em be r 1988. 750 were ad m itted.) At N orw ich on 1 April 1989,
Liverpool supporters a rriv ed w ithout tickets but 1.272 tickets h a d been returned an d fans from b o th Liverpool
and Norwich were allowed to buy them for cash. A sim ilar situation occurred at W im b le d o n on 13 M ay 1989.
There were six o th e r o c c a s io n s fr o m 1 9 8 6 to d a te . including th e C u p f i n a l s o f 1986 an d 1989. w hen n u m b e rs o f
Liverpool supporters tu rn e d up w ithout tickets or otherw ise behaved badly.

   207. Four poi nts m ust be noted, however. O n none o f the occasions w hen ticketless fans were a d m itte d for
 payment was the m atch a sell-out. T here was therefore ro o m in the ground o n each occasion. At a sell-out fans


                                                                      35

No Conspiracy
   208. I have already found that there was not an a b n o rm a lly large n u m b e r o f fans w ithout tickets on this
occasion. With one o r two exceptions, the police witnesses them selves did not subscribe to th e “conspiracy”
theory. I am satisfied that the large con c en tra tio n at Leppings L ane from 2.30 p m to 2.50 p m did not arrive
as a result o f any concerted plan. T here were. I accept, small groups w ithout tickets who were willing to exploit
any a d v e n titio u s chance o f getting into the ground. They, tog e th er with the mi nority who had d ru n k too much,
certainly aggravated the problem faced by the police. But th a t m a in problem was sim ply one o f large n um be rs
packed into the small area outside the turnstiles.

The Police Operation at Leppings Lane
   209. T he O perational O rd e r for 15 April followed closely th a t laid down for the 1988 semi-final. T he
e m p h asis was on m aintaining law a n d order. Side roads were to be blocked o ff to prevent dam age in residential
areas. Pairs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent "clash o f rival su p p o rters” . Officers were to watch public
houses, shops an d superm arkets "w here loot i ng could take p la ce” . O utside the turnst i les. officers were to ensure
su p p o rters entering did not have ban ners, weapons, missiles o r alcohol.

   210. Unfortunately, hooligan beh a v io u r has m a d e all these steps necessary. But the only w ritten provision
a im e d at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was o n e e n jo in in g officers “ to ensure orderly queues are
fo rm e d ” . T h ere was no provision for controlling the entry o f the crow d into the turnstile area.

   211. As long ago as 1924. the D ep a rtm en tal C o m m ittee on C row ds stated:-

   " T h e control o f crowds should begin at a point som e considerable distance from the entrance to the ground.
   T h e advantages o f an arrangem en t o f this kind a r e ... in p rev e n tin g congestion at th e e n tr a n c e s to gro unds.”

T h is was particularly im p o rta n t at Leppings Lane where th e tu rn stile area was so small and aw kw ardly laid
out. If a large crowd was p erm itte d un controlled entry through the p erim ete r gates, the forming o f queues at the
turnstiles a n d control by officers, w hether on foot o r m ounted, w ould becom e im practicable. T h o s e waiting at
the turnstiles w ould becom e a single growing mass. O nce th a t h ap p e n e d , it w ould be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  212. W h e th e r steps were taken an d what steps to avoid this h ap p e n in g was left to oral briefing an d a d hoc
instructions on the day.

Previous Experience
    213. T h e senior police officers said it h ad never happened before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two previous occasions w hen the Leppings Lane terraces h ad been used to fill the whole o f the north
a n d west sides o f the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987 a n d 1988, In 1987. the match was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 12 noon, a n d kick-off was po stp o n e d for a q u a r te r o f an h our because o f late arrivals.

Policing in 1988
   214. As to 1988. there was a very large a n d consistent b o d y o f evidence that, on the day. th e police in
Leppings L ane conducted an efficient filtering exercise d esigned to keep away those without tickets a n d
control the flow o f fans towards the ground. I do not believe th a t so many witnesses without either o p p o rtu n ity
or reason to put the ir heads together could be m istaken about w hat they experienced o n that occasion. Yet. the
police m a in ta in that no filtering exercise o th e r t h a n o n a r a n d o m basis was co n d u c te d in 1988 a n d that their
policy a n d practice then were no different from those o f 1989.

   215. T h e answ er to this conflict m ust. I think, be that whilst the policy m ay have been no different, in
practice the policing in 1988 was m o te efficient a n d was not p u t to the same test a n d strain as a year later. T here
was not so large a swell in n u m b e rs a p p ro a ch in g the g r o u n d from 2.30 p m to 2.50 pm as in 1989.
N evertheless, there had been w arning signs in 1988. D etective S u p erinte nden t M cKay gave the following
evidence:



                                                                                            36
  -Q   Were vou aware o f a build-up o f num be rs last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles'1

  ■\   Yes. . . T here was a huge build-up aro u n d 10 m inutes to 3 when many, many Liverpool supporters
       cam e at that time. They had been drinking, the ones that I saw and there was quite a sizeable crush
       built-up - s iz e a b l e queue.

  Q    Q ueue or crush"’

  A    C o m p ac ted q ueue, built-up in the area by the turnstiles which I believe are marked A to G. T h at crowd
       reached back a lm ost to the gates. It never got any bigger than that a n d the turnstiles o p era ted relatively
       freely a n d they dealt with that crowd. Fans were still arriving at about 10 past 3 but by then t h e . . .

  Q    T h is crowd th a t you have described o f the late arrivals at ab o u t 10 to - was it an orderly crowd?

  A    O h no. No. T h e orderly crowd had gone in. and w hen I say they were not an orderly crowd, obviously
       m ixed am ongst those people w e r e . . .

  Q    O f course, but taking it generally?

  A    But by a n d large they had taken a lot o f drink on b o ard a n d they were in such num be rs tha t excluding
       th e m from the ground was com pletely out o f the question.

  Q    Were they sta nding in an orderly q ueue o r was there som e p ushin g a n d shoving?

  A    T h ere was a lot o f pushing an d shoving. T here was an urgency to get into the ground.

  Q    But fortunately it d oes not appe ar to have been in nearly such num bers as this year.

  A    It wasn't."

Police Intelligence in Advance
  216. A part from th a t experience in 1988. the tendency o f Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
u n k n o w n . Witnesses said that they get through th e turnstiles at their h o m e ground. Anfield. q u ite quickly and
tend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent tendency to p o stp o n e arrival was noted by the
Sheffield City C ouncil Advisory G roup, with police present, on 23 M a rc h 1988. T h e m inute re a d s:-

  “ As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed o f people arriving som e 15 m inutes
  before the start o f the gam e hoping to gain adm ission. T h is tren d may be d u e to the banning o f alcohol at
  sports g rounds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshm ent p r io r to the football m atch. As
  the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for th e m ajority o f the tim e, an d that the late arrival
  problem could p erh a p s only be dealt w ith by education o f the spectators" [sic).

  217. In so far as Liverpool supporters’ b e h a v io u r at away m atches m ay have been indicative o f what police
problems might arise o n 15 April, most o f the facts should have been available at the planning stage. As in o th e r
forces. South Yorkshire Police had a liaison officer whose jo b w as to seek, receive an d collate relevant
inform ation as to the visiting supporters. T h e Association o f C h ie f Police Officers' G u id e to Policing Football
highlights the im p orta nce o f such liaison:—

  "It is im p o rta n t that the officer responsible for policing th e m atch determ in e s the pre-m atch planning in the
  light o f the intelligence at hand. Whilst that intelligence can be o b ta in e d from a variety o f sources, the p rim e
  source for football intelligence is the Police N ational Intelligence System which is based o n the netw ork of
  police liaison officers. S um m aries com pleted by police officers o f the h o m e club force are forw arded to the
  visiting club's liaison officer m aking available intelligence ab o u t fans’ beha v io u r at both ho m e an d away
  fixtures. T h is info rm atio n will be collated a n d m a d e available for future m atches involving that club .

  218. T he FA h ad also laid down in a m e m o r a n d u m issued in the 1985/6 season measures to be a d o p te d by
the away club which included the following:-

  " lt is the responsibility o f the away club to advise the h o m e club of the recent beha v io u r o f the ir supporters
  at away m atches, irrespective o f w h eth e r the behaviour has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
  Association o r not".

   219. It does not seem tha t inform ation o f this kind was p assed to the Sheffield W ednesday Club or played


                                                            37

  220. T here is presently a proposal that a national com p uter-based police football intelligence system should
be set up to make the necessary inform ation readily available.

Police Intelligence on the Day
   221. The unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures for entry available from the
C lub's c o m p u te r a n d observations on the video screen should have enabled those in the control room to
m o n ito r the n u m b e rs arriving a n d still to arrive at Leppings Lane. R adio contact with mobile (Tango) patrols
detailed to m o n ito r licensed premises in the district could have indicated the n u m b e rs still to come. But at 2.30
pm when M r M urray told M r Duckenfield they would "get them all in by 3 o'clock" he seems not to have
ap preciated tha t in ad d itio n to those visible at the turnstiles there were many m ore still to come. Certainly. M r
Marshall outside the turnstiles was not told a n d could not otherw ise have known that there were still many
Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.

Mr Marshall and Mr Greenwood
  222. T he division o f c o m m a n d between these two officers d id not help. M r M arshall was in charge o f the
serials o utside the p erim eter gates in the Leppings Lane area a n d in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
inside a n d ju s t outside the turnstile area. M r G re en w o o d 's area as G ro u n d C o m m a n d e r exten ded from the
pitch to the peri m e ter gates. He in fact stationed h im self near the players' tunnel. He was wholly unaw are o f the
growing problem s at the turnstiles an d was in no position to exercise control over his officers who were u n d er
pressure there. N o-one in the control room thought to tell him.

Control Lost
  223. In the result, the large concentration o f arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed u nrestra ined into
the turnstile area through the perim eter gates which were fully open. When tha t area was full, later arrivals
swelled th e crowd out to the forecourt and even into the road. As already recounted, the foot officers at the
turnstiles b ec am e trap p e d and endangered a n d retired through the turnstiles. T h e m o u n ted officers could not
operate a m id s t such a dense crowd in a confined space. They ca m e o ut o f the tu rn stile area. T here were then
the belated a tte m p ts to close the perim eter gates a n d prevent m o re fans joining th e m ass until it had a chance to
dim in ish through the turnstiles; still later the attem pt to put a cordon o f horses across the entrance.

   224. D espite knowledge o f the difficult layout, the very large n u m b e r o f fans to be got through so few
turnstiles a n d the tendency o f fans to arrive in the last h alf hour, no contingency plans were m a d e to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the day. the need to close Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 p m a n d the
o th e r available intelligence already sum m arised, should have p r o m p te d those in c o m m a n d to take precautions
against such a crush. If som e o f the p erim eter gates had been closed a n d cordons o f m o u n ted a n d foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow o f fans into the tu rn stile area could have been
controlled before that ;.,ea becam e engulfed. It was the crush itself w ^ h p roduce d the frustration an d the
panic a n d brought out the worst in those who had d r u n k too m uc h V u /lic control oi entry w ou ld have
prevented the crush a n d m a in ta in e d the good m o o d which h ad prevailed until 2.30 pm.

   225. It should m oreover have been obvious by 2.40 pm. if not earlier, that a large part o f the crowd could
not be a d m itte d until well after 3 pm. H ad a decision to p ostpone kick-offbeen m a d e an d a n n o u n c ed m uch o f
the frustra tion a n d with it the im p etus crushing the crowd w ould have been reduced. A c o m b in a tio n o f
co ntrolled filtering a n d a postponed kick-off would probably have obviated the need lo open the gates.

Postponem ent of Kick-off
    226. At various stages in his evidence. Mr D uckenfield gave three accounts o f why he thought it too late to
po stp o n e kick-off. O nce it was tha t one o f the team s had already co m e onto the pitch. T hen it was th a t a group
o f p h otographers at the tunnel h ad wrongly led him to think tha t the team s were com in g out. Finally, he did not
know why he thought the team s were com ing out. They d id not in fact com e onto the pitch until 2.54 pm. two
m in u te s after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton h ad asked for a po stp o n e m e n t o f kick-off before
gale C was opened. It should not. however, have needed a police C onstable in the thick o f the crowd (and there
were o thers o f like m in d ) to think o f postponing the kick-off. T he n eed should have been clear in th e control
room .

   227. T he tru th was that Mr Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with M r Murray.
K ick-off w ould not be p o stpone d unless there were som e m a jo r cause for delayed arrivals eg a j a m on the
    motorway or tog. 1 accept that the thinking behind this policy was not callous or punitive. If kick-off is
    postponed whenever a proportion o f fans choose to leave the public houses late, the practice may grow and
    kick-ott times would become meaningless. Bui. a c o m m a n d e r must deal with the problem of the day. Paced
    with a situation which was becoming dangerous, crowd safety should have been his p a ra m o u n t consideration.
    Kick-off should have been delayed.

    Summary
       228.     T he layout o f t he turnstiles an d the n u m b e r they were required to serve left no margin o f safety against
    an uneven flow o f fans. Because police strategy in advance an d on the day did not cater for it. the arrival o f a
    large n u m ber o f suppo rters between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm created an unm anageable crush. T he presence of
    a substantial m in o rity o f fans who had drunk too m uch aggravated th a t problem . H aving lost control and
    rejected the option o f postponing kick-off. the police were faced with a serious danger o f d ea th s o r injuries.
    They were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gates. S u perinte ndent Marshall was right at that
    stage to ask for it an d M r Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects o f so d ra m a tic a step required
    other action.

   229. T he decision to order the opening o f the gates was not ac com panie d or followed by any o th e r o rd er to
deal with the consequences. W hen gate C was opened, a steady stream o f about 2.000 fans p o u re d through it
over som e five m inutes. Clearly they were going to go into the gro u n d somewhere a n d unless they were diverted
the ir likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. No w arning was issued from the control
room tha t the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. N eith er the Club control room
nor the C h ie f Steward at the Leppings Lane en d was warned. N ot even M r G reenw ood, the G ro u n d
C o m m a n d e r, was inform ed. From 2.47 pm when M r M arshall m a d e his first request until 2.52 p m when M r
D uckenfield acceded to it. there were five m in u tes in which o rd ers could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not done. In evidence, M r D uckenfield began by saying that no officer m a d e any
wrong decision but he later conceded he h a d erred in this regard. He said he did not consider w here the people
would go w hen the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no
o rd e r was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. M r D uckenfield said it d id not cross his m in d to detail
officers on the concourse to shut o ff the tunnel. T hose officers could not have know n from the ir position how
full pens 3 a n d 4 were. T h at was a m a tte r for the control ro o m to m o n ito r from its own o bservations an d using
intelligence from a ro u n d the ground.

   230. Since pens 3 a n d 4 were full by 2.50 pm . the tunnel s hould have been closed off w hether gate C was to
be o p en e d o r not. T he exercise was a sim ple one and had been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tu n n e l an d divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
1988 closure seems to have been unknow n to the senior officers on duty at th e tim e. It did not figure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore h ad no influence o n the pla nning for 1989.

   231. P lanning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room w here there was a view o f the
pens a n d o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel h ad to be closed. If ord ers h a d been given to that effect
w hen gate C was opened, the fans could have been d irected to the em pty areas o f the wings a n d this disaster
c ould still have been avoided Failure to give tha t o rd er was a b lu n d e r o f the first m agnitude.

    232. Significantly, when perm ission was given to open gate A. M r D uckenfield d id order serials to go to that
p a rt o f the concourse to m o n ito r the influx towards the n o rth stand. H e d id this because he feared that if fans
w ent to the north sta n d w ithout tickets, they would not get seats a n d . there b eing no p erim eter fences at the
north side, they might invade the pitch. T his illustrates again the preocci pation with avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety an d the risks o f overcrowding. Because tho se entering through gate C could not get o n to the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to m o n ito r them . T he possibility o f overcrowding simply
was not considered.

Barrier 144                                                                                       *
   233. The removal o f barrier 144 in 1986 should have reduced the notional capacity o f pen 3 as already
m entioned. But it d id more. In the absence o f b a rrier 144. the influx o f fans after 2.52 pm met no retarding
structure as it cam e into pen 3. T h e pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
the lowest line o f barriers. The pressure diagonally from the tunnel m o u th down to b arrier n u m b e r 124a which
collapsed was u n broken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight dow n th e pen
through the gap in the b arrier above it created in 1985.

  234. Inspector Bullas, positioned in the west stand, described w hat he saw looking down on the pens
aro u n d 3 pm.

  ” ... I saw from the direction o f the tu n n e l a kind o f m ove m ent dow n th e te rr a c in g ... the type o f th in g that you
  see on th e n atu re program m es, the m olten lead flowing down the side o f the m ountainside, the m olten l a v a ...
  a “river o f p eop le” ... going directly towards the pitch but the re again s p r e a d in g ... o u t.”

   235. D r Eastwood conceded in evidence tha t the removal o f barrier 144 was likely to have c o n trib u te d to
the collapse o f 124a. Later, he sought to resile from th a t answer, b u t I th in k his earlier a d m issio n was correct. It
was argued that if b arrier 144 had re m a in e d , the influx from gate C w ould have built up further back a n d the
tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel or might have broken barrier 144 itself. T h is is speculative a n d I
think unlikely. W h a t rem a ine d o f barrier 144 in pen 4 d id n o t cause a build-up; n o r d id it collapse. But its
rem aining in position m ay well have acco u n ted for n o barrier fu rth e r dow n pen 4 collapsing a n d for the lesser
carnage in tha t pen.

W hen did Barrier 124a Fail?
  236. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police sought to argue tha t this barrier collapsed or m ay have
collapsed at ab o u t 2.47 pm. His p urpose was to suggest th a t the opening o f gate C was not causally linked with
the crushing a n d fatalities resulting from th a t collapse. I have already found th a t whilst the evidence does not
perm it the tim e o f collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 pm. I now give my reasons:

  (a) I have several tim es w atched the BBC video tape on which Counsel relied. I do not find the in cident he
      identifies at 2.47 p m suggestive o f a collapse at th a t time:

  (b) the evidence o f fans who were n ea r o r at the b arrier was overwhelmingly to the effect that the collapse
      occurred at o r after 3 pm:

  (c) the biggest group o f witnesses was tha t which related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley’s
      "n e ar-m iss" at the Kop en d at 3.04 pm:

  (d) the a p p e ara n ce on video an d p h otographs o f fans in the area o f b a r rie r 124a after the in c id en t at 2.47 pm
      a n d before the final crush is not consistent with it having collapsed so early:

  (e) it is highly unlikely tha t if so ca ta stroph ic an event had occurred as early as 2.47 pm. the police o n the
      track a n d elsewhere would have taken until nearly 3 o ’clock to realise som ething was seriously wrong.
      Indeed, if Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his tim ing o f the collapse, the failure o f
      the police to resp o n d for so long w ould expose th e m to even graver criticism than th a t m a d e in this
      Report.

Dr Eastwood’s Testing of the Barriers
   237. Two sections o f b arrier 124a in pen 3 collapsed as a result o f the overcrowding. T h a t collapse caused a
n u m b e r o f d eaths. Dr E astw ood and his sta ff had undertaken the periodical testing o f crush b arriers required
by the G re en G u id e a n d by the Safety Certificate. Barrier 124a had been tested in July 1988 a n d passed.

  238. T h e test had been carried out in acco rdance with D r Eastw ood's interpretation o f Annex C to the
Green G u id e . T h a t requires a n evenly d istrib u te d force o f 6.0 k N /m etre w idth to be applied for 3 five m in u te



                                                                  41
periods, the interval between applications to be as short as possible. A record has to be kept o f the am ount ot
d efo rm atio n during each loading a n d o f the percentage o f recovery. If the recovery is less than 50% alter the
third application o f force, the b arrier has failed the test. If recovery is between 50% and 75%. there must be a
re-test. T he questio n is: 50% or 75% o f what? Is the recovery to be in relation to the position o f the barrier
before the first application o f force or before the th ird 9 If the former, a sp a n o f 124a recorded 53% at the 1988
test an d should have been re-tested. If the latter, it recorded 100% an d passed. U nfortunately the Green G uide
is unclear as to the correct interpretation. D r Eastwood took the latter view and so passed the barrier. He
ju stified his interpretation in evidence. He said failure to recover to the original position could be due to a
"shake-dow n" effect related to som e giving in the ashes u n d e r the concrete or to som e other extraneous factor
rather th a n to any defect in the m aterial o f the b arrier itself.

   239. I think, after consulting Professor Maunder, tha t safety ought to have d ictated recovery s hould be by
reference to the position o f the barrier before the first ap plication o f force. I accept, however, th a t the Green
G u id e is am big u o u s an d D r Eastw ood’s interpretation is tenable. It has som e support from the British
S ta n d a rd s tests on steel structures. Clearly, however, for the future, the G reen G u id e should be clarified on this
point.

Corrosion
  240. Inspection o f barrier 124a. a n d indeed o th e r barriers at Hillsborough, by the H SE showed
considerable corrosion o f the metal at vulnerable points w here water could accum ulate. D r Eastwood agreed
that if a significant degree o f corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a b arrier should be conde m ne d.

   241. T h e G reen G u id e does not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, inter alia:

   " C ru sh b arriers a n d balustrades should be ex am ined for d eform ation o r any o th e r overt signs o f weakness .

Paragraph 6 o f Annex C provides:

   “ I f d u rin g any test, even though the b a r r i e r ... satisfies the above loading requirem ents, d o u b t should arise
   for any reason (including such m a tte rs as cracking o f the terracing or distortio n o f connections) as to the
   safety o f the b a r r i e r ... a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results o f this investigation
   rem ove the d o u b t as to safety o f the b a r r i e r ... (it) should be d ee m e d to have failed the test".

  242. Since corrosion is a likely cause o f deterioration, a revision o f the G reen G u id e should m ake specific
reference to it.

Causation
  243. Tests d o n e by the HSE suggest tha t although b a rrier 124a passed the loading test in 1988 a n d probably
w ould have been able to sustain a force which d id not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist the load
im posed upon it bv reason o f the n u m b e rs in pen 3. the excessive gap in the barrier higher up the pen an d the
absence o f barrier 144. Corrosion probably played a part, but the effective cause o f the collapse was the
excessive a n d u n anticipated pressure to which the b arrier was exposed.

Observation from Control Room
   244. As the strea m from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control room could be expected
to keep a close watch on pens 3 and 4. They h ad a direct view o f them from an elevated p osition through their
window. A lthough they h a d no field-glasses, there was the zoom facility on the T V cam era. T he radio was by
then working again a n d although reception was difficult d ue to crowd noise an d possibly excessive air traffic
on ch annel 25. a tte m p ts could have been m a d e to alert officers on the perim eter track to watch for
overcrowding a n d repo rt their observations. In the event, pens 3 an d 4 b ec am e m ore and m ore crowded, surges
took place, fans were showing and signalling distress. N o n e o f this was seen o r recognised in the control room .

Officers on the Track
  245. T he 20 officers detailed to the p erim ete r track were distributed ro u n d the pitch so th a t som e five
officers were at the west end. T heir w ritten instructions m a d e no reference to the avoidance or detection o f
overcrowding. T h e sam e applied to the officers in the west stand. M r G reenw ood a d m itte d th a t his oral
briefings also c o n ta in e d no m ention o f m o n ito rin g the pens for overcrowding.

   246. T he O p eratio n al O rd e r for 1988 h ad instructed officers to forbid anyone “access to th e track from the
terraces w ithout the c onsent o f a senior officer (except to receive medical a tten tio n )” . At the end o f the 1988
semi-final, there was a m in o r pitch invasion. Accordingly, that prohibition was em phasised in the 1989
O perational O rd e r by being put into capital letters. T he co m b in atio n o f no instructions as to overcrow ding an d
a strong p ro h ib itio n on open ing the gates was likely to m ake police recognition o f crushing slow and the ir
response reluctant. Small w onder th a t tiie growing pressure an d congestion between 2.50 p m a n d 2.59 p m
went u n h e e d e d or certainly unrem edied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem , the rule required
consent o f a senio r officer before a gate could be opened.

  247. "S enior officer” m e a n t an officer o f Inspector ran k or higher. T he Inspector in charge o f the 20 officers
on the track was M r D arling. He sta tio n e d him self by the players’ tunnel, the most central position for
supervising his m en. In evidence he said:

  “ I would only take a c tio n if I thought crowding h ad got to such a stage tha t the fans were in danger. I’d then
  inform ground control a n d I would expect som eone deployed to the back o f the stand."

  T h a t underlines the in h ib itio n against opening p erim ete r gates. So did the evidence o f one C onstable w ho
said it had been so d r u m m e d into officers n o t to o pen the gates th a t when he saw distress in pen 4. he “d eb a te d "
with h im self before o p en in g the gate, thinking: " I f I’m wrong. I’m going to get a right bollocking for this.”
Naturally, o ne w ould h ope th a t co m m o n sense a n d h u m a n ity would make som e officers cut through the rules
and open a gate if fans were clearly in distress.

  248. T h is is w hat h ap p e n ed , but n o t until officers recognised the distress a n d even then n o t im mediately.
Hence, gates 3 a n d 4. having been opened, were shut again before they were finally o pen e d a n d at first those
seeking to clim b o u t over the fence were pushed back. T h is reaction o f the police d id not go o n for as long as
some witnesses believed. T h ey probably m isinterpreted the h an d m ovem ents from M r G reenw ood an d o thers
aimed at persu a d in g fans to move back a n d relieve the pressure as attem pts to stop those clim bing out a t the
front.

  249. N evertheless, there was a period d u rin g which the failure to recognise the problem a n d the inhibition
against tackling it caused vital tim e to be lost.

                                         T H E RESPO N SE OF T H E POLICE

The Officers in Command
   250. Even when realisation o f the problem cam e to officers on the track, it was som e m inutes before it
reached the control room. W hen spectators first appeared on the track, the im m ed iate a s su m p tio n in the
control ro o m was that a pitch invasion was threatened. T h is was unlikely at the beginning o f a m atch. It
bec am e still less likely w hen those on the track m ade no m ove towards the pitch. M r M otson, the BBC
co m m e n ta to r, recognised an d said, well before the m atch was stopped, th a t the trouble seem ed to be
overcrow ding a n d not misbehaviour. Still, the assum ption to the con tra ry persisted in the control room . U ntil
M r M u rra y r adioe d for a fleet o f am bulances, a b o u t 3.06 pm , M r D uckenfield c o n tin u ed to treat the incident
as a th rea t to the pitch a n d to public order. T h e message calling up all available officers m e n tio n e d a pitch
invasion. O p eratio n Support was initiated a n d dog handlers were requested.
    251. U n til C h ie f Superintendent N esbit arrived, there was no effective leadership either from con trol or on
the pitch to harness an d organise rescue efforts. N o orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel a n d relieve
pressure. Som e officers d id this on their own initiative. A part from the T annoy request to clear the pitch, no
a tte m p t was m a d e to clear an d m ark off a casualty area where first-aid could b e given w ithout hin d ran c e by
fans a n d photographers milling ab o u t between the bodies. T here was no co -ordination o f the early provision o f
first-aid or o f stretcher parties or o f the rescue effort through gates 3 an d 4. No request for help was b ro ad c ast to
doctors a n d nurses in the crowd until ab o u t 3.29 p m when it was too late. Probably, there was little th a t could
have been achieved in m ost cases however soon doctors h a d been su m m o n ed , b u t there were m arginal cases
where earlier attention m ight have m a d e a difference.
  252. T h e plight o f those b ehind the fencing a n d the existence o f injuries were know n to officers at the scene
from 3 pm. But the M ajor D isaster Plan was n ot started until 3.06 p m a t earliest w hen the am b u la n c e service
was called. N o request for cutting gear or for th e fire brigade was m a d e until 3.13 p.m . Again, it is unlikely that
these services could have saved lives if they h ad been called promptly, but it is possible.
Police on the Pitch
    253. D esp ite the initial lack o f leadership, m a ny officers did all they h um anly could to rescue a n d revive the
victims. M any supporters who gave evidence p aid tribute to these efforts. It is also fair to say th a t th e n u m b e r
o f officers w h o could at first be usefully involved at the two o pen gates was necessarily limited.
   254. C h ie f S uperintendent N esbit's action in deploying a line o f officers across the m iddle o f th e pitch has
already b een m entioned. I can well u n d e rsta n d the resentm ent it caused. However, the police assertion tha t a
rush by som e fans towards the Kop end raised fears o f conflict are well b o rn e o u t by the video tape. In my
ju d g e m en t. C h ie f Superintendent N esbit was well justified in using som e o f t h e m any officers called up
pu rsu a n t to O peratio n Support to prevent possible violence. To have h ad o p e n fighting in a g ro u n d where
som e 90 spectators already lay d ea d w ould have been an u n th in k a b le a n d obscene developm ent.
Fans on the Pitch
   255. M any fans who escaped o n to the pitch alive were in a state o f collapse o r close to it. M o st o f those who
reta in e d the ir strength strove magnificently to assist the victims. T hey helped pull th e m d ea r; they helped with
first-aid; they helped carry the im provised stretchers.
   256. T h ere were fans, however, w ho were distraught, angry, drunk, or all three. T h e ir conduct in abusing,
assaulting a n d spitting at the police was disgraceful, the m ore so since earlier police failures h a d little to do
w ith those officers now doing their best for the injured. In a d d itio n , there were abuse a n d assaults on
am b u la n c e m en an d firemen in the course o f their rescue work. T h is was probably because the ir sim ilar
u nifo rm s caused them to be m istaken for police. However, although the abuse was w idespread, th e n u m b e r o f
assaults a n d spittings was on the evidence com paratively small. In deploring them , on e m u st recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience which those responsible h a d ju s t suffered a n d were still suffering.
False Reports
    257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reported in the press, a n d said to have e m a n a te d from
police officers present at the m atch, o f “ m ass d ru n k en n e ss”. It was said th a t d ru n k e n fans u rin ated on the
police w hile they were pulling the dea d a n d injured out, th a t others h ad even u rin a te d on the b o d ie s o f the dead
a n d stolen their belongings. N ot a single witness was called before the I n q u iry to support an y o f those
allegations although every opp o rtu n ity was afforded for any o f the represented parties to have any witness
called w h o m they wished. As soon as the allegations I have m e n tio n e d were m a d e in the press, M r Peter
W right, C h ie f C onstable o f South Yorkshire, m a d e a dignified s tatem ent dissociating h im self fro m such grave
a n d e m o tiv e calumnies. Those w ho m a d e them , an d those w ho dissem inated th e m , would have d o n e b etter to
hold the ir peace.

                                                              44
                                                         C H A P T E R 15

                                  THE PERIM ETER GATES WERE TO O SM A L L

    258. T he peri m e ter gates in the pens were not designed as exits. T hey were intended to afford access by the
police to cope w ith any local disorder or with an emergency. T h e kind o f emergency con tem p late d was not
m assive crushing but. for example, the collapse or illness o f an individual. Emergency evacuation o f the pens
had been considered by the Officer Working Party. Although fire risk was m in im al since the terraces, west
stand an d tunnel were o f concrete construction, th e fire brigade were the principal arbiters o f evacuation
procedure. They aim e d to be able to em p ty the pens in six m inutes. T he plan was to evacuate spectators via the
tunnel. If for any reason tha t option b ecam e im practicable, eg d u e to a b o m b threat, then the alternative route
would be along the back o f the terraces, th rough the gates in the radial fences a n d r o u n d the sides o f the west
stand. T he fire brigade were satisfied th a t each o f these routes w ould enable the pens to be evacuated in less
th a n six m inutes, w ithout relying on the gates to the pitch. T hose gates w ould also be available, b u t their use
was excluded from the calculation o f evacuation time.

  259. T h e need to provide for speedy a n d large scale evacuation from the front o f the pens to the pitch was
not anticipated. T h e G reen G uide (1986) provides as follows:

  "209. Access to the pitch m ust be m a d e as difficult as possible in n o rm al circum stances while at the sam e
  tim e ensuring tha t the police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose o f crowd control a n d
  enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event o f serious emergency . . .

  214. . . . at som e m a jo r soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd m ovem ent forms a necessary part o f the
  safety m easures, it may be necessary to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in norm al
  circum stances . . . but allows for access in emergency.

  215. For m ost m a jo r stadia, w hether used for association football or o th e r sports, the pitch p erim eter fence
  will be req u ired either to prevent access to the p itch as m e n tio n e d above, or at least to discourage a ttem p ts
  by spectators to enter the playing area. G ates o r other access points (m in im u m w id th 1.1 metres) should
  nonetheless be prov ided for use in an emergency . . . Provision o f such gates or access points is particularly
  im p o rta n t to allow full access to the playing area (or track) w here it is likely to be used as a place o f safety in
  an emergency.            Such gates or access p o in ts should be properly stew arded an d                         clearly
  m arked so th a t im m ed iate access to the playing are a or p erim ete r track can be en s u re d ” .

   260. G a te 3 was .82 metres in width; gate 4 was .79 m etres in w idth. T here were therefore clear dep a rture s
from the G reen G u id e standard.

  261. T he Safety Certificate provided (by Schedule 2 Paragraph 24) as follows:

  T h e (club) shall arrange for the S tad iu m to be inspected by a suitably qualified C h a rtered Engineer . . . at
  least once each period o f 12 m o n th s . . . a n d . . . shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
  the . . . C ouncil a Certificate by the said C h a rtered Engineer as to the c u rren t com pliance or non-com pliance
  with . . . the ap p ro p ria te provisions a n d rec o m m e n d atio n s o f the (Green) G u id e o f all structural parts o f the
  S tadium . . .

  262. It was argued that there was no breach o f the Safety Certificate since the G re e n G u id e specifically
provides for flexibility. However, in my view the Safety Certificate c a n n o t a n d certainly should not be
interpreted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic req u irem en ts as the size o f exit gates to the total
discretion o f the club an d its advisers. O n e o f the m a tte rs for consideration at stage two o f this inquiry will be
whether, a n d in w hat respects, the G re en G u id e needs to be clarified a n d toughened.

   263. D r E astw ood explained the small w idth o f th e gates by reference to the d ilem m a facing the police. They
w anted a gate sufficient for its in ten d ed purpose le police access an d small scale emergencies. O n the other
h and, they did not w ant a flood gate o f such size as to endanger the p rim e principle o f preventing pitch
invasions. In the light o f Hillsborough, this is p erh a p s the m ost p oignant exam ple o f the difficulty o f achieving
a balance betw een stopping hooliganism an d ensuring crowd safety.

   264. Even if the w idth o f gates 3 an d 4 had com plie d with the present G reen G u id e standard, they w ould
have been wholly in adequate to relieve pressure a n d release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
G re en G u id e says nothing ab o u t the n u m b e r o f gates required for a pen o f given size. Whilst the Club,


                                                                 45
D r Eastwood, the Officer Working Party and the local a u th o rity can be criticised for failing strictly to conform
to the G uide, the real failure was co m m o n to all those who have been responsible for considering safety on the
terraces. The anxiety to protect the sanctity o f the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk
o f a crush due to overcrowding. C ertain it was. that once the crush occurred on 15 April gates 3 an d 4 were
wholly inadequate for rescue purposes.
                                         PART III - C O N C L U S I O N S

                                           BRIEF S U M M ARY O F C A U SE S

  265. The im m ediate cause of the gross overcrowding an d hence the d isaster was the failure, w hen gate C was
opened, to cut off access to the central pens which were already overfull.

  266. T hey were already overfull because no safe m a x im u m capacities h ad been laid dow n, no attem pt was
m ade to control entry to individual pens numerically a n d there was n o effective visual m o nitoring o f crowd
density.

   267. W hen the influx from gate C entered pen 3. the layout o f the barriers there afforded less protection
than it should an d a b arrier collapsed. Again, the lack o f vigilant m onitoring caused a sluggish reaction and
response when the crush occurred. T he small size an d n u m b e r o f gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So.
in the initial stages, d id lack o f leadership.

   268. T h e need to o pen gate C was d u e to dangerous congestion at th e turnstiles. T h a t occurred because, as
both C lub an d police should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope w ith the large n um bers
d e m a n d e d o f it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. T he O p eratio n al O rd e r an d police tactics on
the d ay failed to prov ide for controlling a conc en tra te d arrival o f large n u m b e rs should tha t occur in a short
period. T h a t it m ight so occur was foreseeable an d it did. T h e presence o f an unruly m inority w ho had d r u n k
too m uch aggravated the problem. So d id the C lub's confused a n d in a d eq u a te signs a n d ticketing.
                                                        C H A P T E R 17

                                           T H E FA's C H O I C E O F G R O U N D

    269. T he FA were strongly criticised by the Football S upporters' Association a n d others for having
im posed the H illsborough venue on Liverpool for a second year running. T h e Liverpool supporters had to
travel m uc h fu rth e r to Sheffield th a n the ir N o ttin g h a m rivals. T h e police required tha t if the match was to be at
Hillsborough at all, L iverpool would have to have the west and no rth side ac co m m o d a tio n . T h e disadvantages
o f tha t an d th e d isp a ra te n u m b e rs o f h o m e sup porters o f the two clubs have already been set out. Liverpool had
h a d to knuckle u n d e r to the arran g e m en t in 1988. T hey resented having it im posed in 1989. To hold the m a tch
at O ld Trafford w ould have b een a perfectly good a n d acceptable alternative. Indeed, the FA n o m in a te d O ld
Trafford as the venue for th e replay should there be a draw at H illsborough.

   270. M r Kelly, the FA’s C h i e f Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring Hillsborough, but th e only one
w hich seem ed to have any validity was tha t the 1988 m a tch had been considered a successfully m anaged event.
H e a d m itte d tha t a te lep hone call from the C h i e f Executive o f the Liverpool C lub protesting a n d putting
Liverpool's case had not been m e ntioned to the FA c o m m ittee w hich finally d ecided th e venue. M r Kelly
frankly conceded that “there was an elem ent o f unfairness" to Liverpool in choosing H illsborough f o r a second
time. I th in k the decision w as ill-considered. N o d o u b t in future the FA will be m ore sensitive a n d responsive
to reasonable representations.

   271. However, it was n o t suggested th a t the choice o f venue was causative o f this disaster. T he only basis on
w hich th a t could be said w ould be that, because o f its layout, the Leppings Lane en d was incapable o f being
successfully policed for this semi-final. I d o not believe tha t to be so.




                                                                 48

Choice o f Ends by the Police
   272. T here was m uc h bitterness am ongst Liverpool supporters tha t they had to m ake d o again for the
second year with the Leppings Lane end. But, cogent as their c o m p lain ts were, they a m o u n te d to reasons for
choosing a different ground altogether. G iven Hillsborough as the venue, 1 think the police were right to
allocate th e sections o f the ground as they did. T h e direction o f arrival a n d the need for segregation m a d e it
sensible a n d to reverse the 1988 arrangem ents would have m a d e for confusion. As w ith choice o f venue, 1 do
not consider choice o f ends was causative o f the disaster. H a d it been reversed, the d isaster could well have
occurred in a sim ilar m a n n e r but to N otting ham supporters.

Police Planning
   273. T h e O p eratio n al O rd e r for 1989 left m uch unsaid. A part from the lack o f any provision for late or
congested arrivals, or any provision for the avoidance o f overcrow ding on the terraces, the re was a n u m b e r o f
other om issions. For example, there w as no specific d eploy m ent o f officers to m an th e p erim ete r gates. T he
O rd e r d id not detail the duties o f the m o u n ted officers deployed at th e Leppings Lane entra n ce , w ho included
Liverpool officers to assist in m arshalling their own fans. T h e d u ties o f S up erin te n d en ts (especially M r
G reenw ood a n d M r Marshall) w ere not defined so as to achieve clarity a n d efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision requiring m obile (Tango) patrols to assist th e em ergency services was o m itte d from the text.

  274. T h e 1988 O rd e r was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the n u m b e r o f officers deployed in
shopping areas a n d to em phasise in capital letters the em b arg o o n fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
with the 1988 event led to complacency. T h at som e th o u g h t the pens overfull in 1988 a n d tha t the tunnel was
closed off on th a t occasion d id not figure in or influence the plan for 1989.

  275. M r D uckenfield was p ro m o te d a n d p u t in charge o f F D ivision only 21 days before this semi-final. T he
pre-planning was already in progress u n d e r M r M ole w ho h a d been in c o m m a n d bo th in 1987 a n d in 1988. It
might have been wiser to have left M r Mole in charge o f this operation. O n the o th e r hand, it is quite
understandable that M r D uckenfield s hould have been expected to take c o m m a n d o f events in his D ivision
from the date o f his p rom otion. In view o f his lack o f experience at Hillsborough a n d o f a semi-final m atch,
however, it was im perative that he be fully briefed a n d th a t he should also brief himself.

   276. H e was n o t inform ed o f the crushing incident in 1981 n o r d id he m ake inquiries w hich w ould have
revealed it. H e did not know the arran gem ent as betw een C lub a n d police for m onitoring the Leppings L ane
terraces. He d id not visit a n d tour the gro u n d before approv ing the O perational Order. Although he a tte n d e d a
m atch o n 2 April, there was only a small crowd p rese n t a n d he left control o f the gam e to the Superintendents.

Policing on th e Day
  277. O ne o f the regrettable features o f the football scene as it has developed is the e n o r m o u s expenditure o f
money, tim e a n d effort in em ploying large num be rs o f police all over the country to g uard against th e sort o f
disorder an d m isb eh a v io u r which have becom e endem ic. Police m a n a g e m e n t o f a gam e o f football has bec om e
a m ilitary operation. T h e problem s faced an d the responses received m ust be d isheartening an d m ay have
tended to h ard e n police attitudes to supporters in general.

  278. It is fair to state tha t over m a ny years the S outh Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
public. They have h andled crowd problem s sensitively a n d successfully ai a large n u m b e r o f football games
including m a jo r m atches, d uring strikes in the coal industry a n d the steel industry, a n d in o th e r contexts.
Unfortunately, th e ir policing on 15 April broke d ow n in the ways already described a n d , although the re were
oth e r causes, the m a in reason for the disaster was th e failure o f police control.

  279. In all som e 65 police officers gave oral evidence a t the Inquiry. Sadly I m u s t report that for the m ost
part the quality o f their evidence was in inverse p ro p o rtio n to the ir rank. T here w ere m a n y young C onstables
who as witnesses were alert, intelligent and open. O n the day, they a n d m any others strove heroically in ghastly
circum stances a g g ra v a te d by hostility to rescue a n d succour victim s. T hey inspired confidence a n d hope.

  280. By contrast, w ith some notable exceptions, th e senior officers in c o m m an d were defensive a n d evasive
witnesses. T h e ir feelings o f grief a n d sorrow were o bvious a n d genuine. N o d o u b t those feelings were
intensified by the knowledge th a t such a disaster had occurred u n d er their m an ag e m en t. But, n eith er their
hand ling o f problem s on the d ay nor their account o f it in evidence showed the q u alities o f leadership to be
expected o f their rank.

   282. W h e n M r M arshall’s request cam e. M r D uckenfield's capacity to take decisions an d give orders
seem ed to collapse. H aving sanctioned, at last, the opening o f the gates, he failed to give necessary
consequential o rders o r to exert any co n tro l w hen the d isaster occurred. H e m isinterpreted the em ergence o f
fans from pens 3 a n d 4. W hen he was un sure o f the problem , he sent others down to "assess the situation"
ra th e r th a n descend to see for himself. H e gave no info rm atio n to the crowd.

   283. M ost surprisingly, he gave M r Kelly an d others to th in k th a t there had been an inrush d u e to Liverpool
fans forcing o p en a gate. This was n o t only untruthful. It set off a widely reported allegation against the
su p p o rters which caused grave offence a n d distress. It revived against football fans, a n d especially those from
Liverpool, ac cusations o f hooliganism w hich cau sed reaction not only nationw ide b u t from E urope too. 1 can
only assu m e tha t M r D uckenfield’s lack o f c a n d o u r on this occasion was out o f character. He said his reason for
not telling the tru th was th a t if the crowd becam e aw are o f it there might be a very hostile reaction a n d this
m ight im p ed e rescue work. He did n o t wish to divulge w hat had h appe ned until he had spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell M r Kelly the tru th d id not require th a t he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
although Assistant C h ie f Constable Jackson was at han d . M r D uckenfield did not disclose the tr u th to him
until m uch later.

  284. T h e likeliest explanation o f M r D uckenfield's c o n d u c t is tha t he sim ply could not face the enorm ity o f
the decision to open the gates a n d all th a t flowed therefrom . T h a t would explain w hat he said to M r Kelly, what
he d id not say to M r Jackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd an d his failure to take effective control o f the
disaster situation. H e froze.

The Police Case at the Inquiry
   285. It is a m a tte r o f regret th a t at th e hearing, a n d in their subm issions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
p rep a re d to concede they were in a n y respect at fault in w hat occurred. M r Duckenfield. u n d er pressure of
cross-ex am ination, apologised for b la m in g the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But. that a p a rt, the police
case was to b la m e the fans for being late a n d drunk, a n d to b la m e the C lub for failing to m o n ito r the pens. It was
argued tha t the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate C b u t was d u e to b a rrie r 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic appro ach gives cause for anxiety as to w h eth e r lessons have been learnt. It would
have been m ore seemly a n d encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

                          T H E CITY C O U N C I L A N D T H E SA F ET Y C E R T IF IC A T E

   286. T he p erform ance by the City Council o f its duties in regard to the Safety Certificate was inefficient a n d
dilatory. The failure to revise or a m en d the certificate over the period o f three years preceding this disaster,
despite i m p o rta n t changes in the layout o f the ground, was a serious breach ofduty. There were, as a result, no
fixed capacities for the pens. The certificate took no account o f the 1981 a n d 1985 alterations to the ground.

  287. A n u m b e r o f breaches o f G reen G u id e sta n d ard s were p erm itted a n d persisted eg the spacing o f the
crush barriers, the w idth o f perim eter gates a n d the gradient in the tunnel (1 in 6 as against the G reen G u id e
m ax im u m o f 1 in 10).

  288. T he Advisory' G ro u p lacked a proper structure; its procedure was casual a n d unbusinesslike. Its
accountability to the G eneral Purposes Panel was ill-defined. Decisions were taken informally a n d too m uc h
was left to M r Bownes. In particular, the decision to remove b a rrier 144 was not referred to the Panel a n d ought
not to have been m ade.

                                          T H E CLUB AND DR EASTW O O D

    289. It should be recorded th a t in general the Club has over the years ad o p ted a responsible an d
c onscientious a p p ro a ch to its responsibilities. It retained the services o f D r Eastwood as con sulta nt engineer
a n d a b id ed by his advice. For his part, D r Eastwood is skilled a n d experienced in this field, as already
indicated, a n d he sought 1 have no d o u b t to act efficiently an d professionally in his advice a n d practical work.
T h e C lub also reta ine d Mr Lock w ho had acquired great experience a n d knowledge o f H illsborough d u ring his
police service. A n u m b e r o f witnesses described H illsborough as a very good ground, “ one o f the best in the
c o u n try ” . T h e police agreed that relations between th e m an d th e Club were good. O ver th e last fou r years, the
C lub h ad spent so m e £ 1h m illion on gro u n d im provem ents.

    290. Nevertheless, there are a n u m b e r o f respects in which failure by the Club co n trib u te d to this disaster.
T h ey were responsible as occupiers a n d invitors for th e layout a n d structure o f the ground. T h e Leppings Lane
e n d was unsatisfactory an d ill-suited to a d m it the n u m b e rs invited, for reasons already spelt out. T h e Club was
aware o f these p roblem s a n d discussed solving them in various ways between 1981 a n d 1986. In the result,
the re rem a in e d th e sa m e n u m b e r o f turnstiles, an d th e sam e problem s outside a n d inside them . T h e plan for
this semi-final, involving as it d id the loss o f 12 turnstiles for the north sta n d a n d large num be rs to be fed in
from Leppings Lane, was one agreed between the C lub an d the police. T h e Club knew best w hat rate o f
a d m issio n the turnstiles could m anage a n d ought to have alerted the police to the risks o f the turnstiles being
sw am ped.

   291. T h e alterations inside the turnstiles an d o n the terraces clearly affected capacity, b u t no specific
allowance was m a d e for them . In tha t respect, both D r Eastwood a n d the Club should have taken a m ore
positive approach. E ither a schem e such as one o f those D r Eastwood pu t forw ard s hould have b een a dopted
giving m o re turnstiles an d total se paration o f areas o r at the very least the capacity o f the new pens an d o f the
terraces as a whole should have been treated m ore cautiously. T h e police view in 1981 th a t 10.100 was too high
a figure was known to th e Club (although D r Eastwood says not to him ). Yet, despite tha t a n d the sub-division
into pens, the figure rem ained.

   292. Although the police had assu m e d responsibility for m o n ito rin g the pens, the C lu b had a duty to its
visitors a n d the C lu b ’s officials ought to have alerted the police to the grossly uneven d istrib u tio n o f fans on the
terraces. T h e C lub operated a n d read the closed circuit television an d the c o m p u te r totaliser. Liaison between
C lu b a n d police o n the day failed to alert the latter t o the n u m b e r o f Liverpool supporters still to come. T he
o n u s here was on the C lub as well as on the police.

   293. T h e removal o f barrier 144 was the responsibility o f th e Club alth o u g h it clearly acted on th e advice o f
D r E astw ood a n d the A dvisory G ro u p which in this instance was m isguided.

   294. Likewise, the breaches o f the G re en G uide w ere m a tte rs « n ; h m e C lub should have ap preciated an d
rem edied.

   295. Lastly, as already indicated, the p o o r signposting on th e concourse te n d ed to pro d u ce under-filling o f
the wing pens an d over-filling o f pens 3 a n d 4. Poor signposting outside the turnstiles a n d the unhelpful form at
o f the tickets also led to confusion aggravating the b u ild -u p in the turnstile area.

                                   FIRST AID A N D EM ER G ENC Y SER VICES

No Fault by the Emergency Services
   296. I say at the outset o f this cha p te r tha t no valid criticism can be m a d e of the response by the St J o h n
A m bulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by the fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party v entured any
criticism o f them . T h e only attack on SYMAS cam e from two Liverpool d octors. O ne claim ed tha t am b u lan c es
did not arrive swiftly o r with sufficient e q u ip m en t a n d tha t there was a lack o f triage. He was proved to be
wrong in all three respects. U nfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April w hen he said m o re
lives could have been saved if staff an d e q u ip m en t h ad arrived earlier. A part from being proved w rong in fact
as to the tim es o f arrival o f am bulances, he conceded in evidence tha t it was n ot possible to say w hether lives
could have been saved. His c o m m en ts on television were irresponsible. T h e o th e r d o cto r c o m p lain ed o f the
absence o f defibrillators. 1 am satisfied on overw helming evidence tha t to a tte m p t to use a defibrillator on the
pitch with people m illing a bout would have been highly dangerous owing to th e risk o f injury' from the electric
charge.

  297. 1 find th a t all three o f the emergency services n a m e d above r e sp o n d e d prom p tly w hen alerted, th a t
they brought ap p ro p ria te e q u ip m en t a n d th a t their personnel o pera ted efficiently.

  298. It w ould be unreasonable to expect, at any sports s tadium , m edical facilities capable o f dealing w ith a
m ajor disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, o th e r
eq uipm en t a n d m edical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is n ot practicable.

  299. W h a t is req u ired is a basic level o f provision for first aid. for professional medical a tte n tio n a n d for
am bulance atte n d a n c e , together with a system o f co-ordination with the em ergency services w hich will b rin g
them to the scene swiftly in whatever n um bers are required. W h a t will a m o u n t to an a p p ro p riate basic
provision for the future eg the eq u ip m e n t in a first aid roo m , requires ex p e rt evaluation a n d advice.

   300. O n the day, there was no clear u n dersta nding between the C lu b a n d D r Purcell as to his role. H e
believed he was p rim a rily there to atten d to the players. T h e C lub regarded him also as th e “ physician available
to attend at the first aid room if required", as laid down in the Safety Certificate.

  301. T here was insufficiently close co-operation between the police a n d the emergency services. It is clear
that SYMAS a n d the fire brigade should have been called earlier than they were. However, in view o f the n atu re
and extent o f the crushing, the tim e w hen police rescue began a n d the pathetically short p eriod for which those
unable to b rea th e could survive, it is im p robable tha t q uicker recourse to the emergency services would have
saved m ore lives.

   302. Finally, th e re was evidence th a t an advertising b o ard had to be k n o ''1- H down at the north-east c o rn e r
o f the ground to allow an am bulance o n to the pitch a n d tha t at the to p o           r?m p leading to the pitch the
access for am b u la n c e s was inadequate. T here was also evidence th a t the pre-m atch arrange m ent for
ambulances to use th e two gates from Penistone Road at the north-east en d o f the ground as in a n d out routes
was frustrated by the presence o f vehicles ju st inside the ground. In the event, none o f these m atters affected
operations. T he h o ard in g was quickly knocked down. T he difficult access to the ram p was negotiated a n d
ambulances used o n e entran ce satisfactorily by backing out w hen loaded.

    303.       O n e p roblem which im p ed ed police control and the gathering o f intelligence was the interm ittent
failure o f co m m u n ic a tio n by radio. There was the period o f two o r three m in u tes when the control room was
o u t o f radio contact. Even when th a t was rem edied, it was only by using a h and set in the control room. This
m e a n t th at control could not override any o th e r messages. N o effective radio co m m u n ic a tio n seems to have
reached control from the perim eter track at the relevant time. M r G reen w o o d 's request for the m atch to be
stopped and various messages from C onstables reporting the distress in the pens did not register. Likewise,
c o m m u n ic a tio n from Leppings Lane to control was unreliable. U n d o u b ted ly these b reakdow ns m a d e it more
difficult for those in co m m an d to m a k e pro p er assessm ents and exercise effective co m m an d .

Limited Objectives
   304. It is im p o rta n t to stress the lim ited objectives o f the interim reco m m e n d atio n s 1 can make in this
Report. M \ p u rp o se is to propose instant m easures capable o f being im plem ented forthw ith and w here
possible before the c o m m en c em en t o f the 1989 /1 9 9 0 season. They are designed to prevent overcrowding and
crushing on terraces in the short term and to im prove safciy procedures. T hey do not a n d can n o t m eet all the
problem s o r a d d re ss all the issues o f post-H illsborough football. W id e r issues such as m em b ersh ip schem es,
identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia an d long term re c o m m e n d a tio n s fall to be considered in m y Final
Report, So d o a n u m b e r o f o th e r specific m atters such as a co m pre h en siv e review o f the G reen G uide, the
problem o f excessive pre-m atch drinking, fans w ith o u t tickets and ticket touts, 1 m en tio n these m atte rs lest it
be thought 1 have decided no reco m m e n d atio n s need be m ade co ncern in g them. I have not. But before
d eciding w hat if any rec o m m e n d atio n s to m ake ab o u t these and o th e r m atters, more evidence and stu d y is
required.

   305. Accordingly, the m ain thrust o f these interim rec o m m e n d atio n s, as a holding exercise, is to reduce
n u m b e rs on th e terraces, to increase vigilance an d to achieve a p ro p er balance in crowd control betw een
prevention o f d iso rd e r an d m ain ten ance o f safety.


Perim eter Fences
  306. It w ould be im practical and unwise to re c o m m e n d works o f co n stru ction o r radical structural changes
now. before co m p letin g the extensive study and consu ltatio n w hich will form stage two o f this Inquiry. H asty
interim r e c o m m e n d a tio n s o f th at kind might well prove to be ill-judged after further study and require to be
changed in a m a tte r o f months.

   307. In particular. I d o not at this stage m ak e any re c o m m e n d a tio n as to rem oving p erim eter fences or
replacing th em w ith structures o f different design. U nderstan d ab ly , th e re was a wave o f p o p u la r feeling against
such fences in the im m ediate afterm ath o f Hillsborough. T h e h o rrify in g spectacle o f people being crushed
against th e fencing focussed blam e for the d isaster on the fences them selves. T here were pleas to d ism an tle
them and e m o tiv e references to the fans being treated like "caged a n im a ls ” . Som e clubs removed their fencing
straightaway. It was therefore very tem p tin g to co n sid er at an early stage m ak in g a reco m m e n d atio n th a t the
fences should be removed. I confess to being so tem pted,

  308. Regrettably, only a m onth after Hillsborough, there were incid en ts which showed that violence and
hooliganism are still liable to eru p t at football grounds. O n I 3 M ay at Selhurst Park. Birm ingham City
supporters invaded the pitch a n d fought with su p p o rters o f the h o m e club. Crystal Palace. Five police officers
and 16 su p p o rters were injured and required tre a tm e n t at a local h o sp ital. O n the same d ay at a match between
Bristol C ity a n d Sheffield I nited. spectators spilt o n to the pitch an d there •> ucip iig o n the t r a c e s . At the
Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton on 20 May. there was a pitch invasion, albeit a com paratively
benign one.

   309. Even the Football Supporters' A ssociation (FSA) felt it necessary to say in their final submission.

        " W ith so m e reservations, the FSA accept that p erim eter fences are necessary for crowd control.”

   3 10. B earing in m in d those matters, a n d the need to consider fu rth e r expert evidence. 1 have decided th a t it
would be unw ise a n d p rem a tu re for me lo m ake any rec o m m e n d a tio n s now eith er to rem ove or to preserve or
to alter the s tru ctu re o f p erim eter fences. I shall m ake re c o m m e n d a tio n s ab o u t th em in my Final Report.

  311. For the present. I would em p h asise that, although the fencing prevented escape, the real cause o f the
Hillsborough d isaster was overcrowding and it is against that d an g e r that my interim re c o m m e n d atio n s are
prim arily directed . W hilst declining to rec o m m e n d the removal o f the fences. 1d o consider that the gates to the
pitch should be kept open whilst the terraces are occupied. T h is will have. 1 hope, three beneficial effects.
Obviously, an o pen gate is a more ready escape route than one w hich has to be locked. Secondly, th e sight o f
open gates will be reassuring to spectators on the terraces. Thirdly, the existence o f gaps in the fencing by
reason o f the o p en gates will concentrate the m in d s o f police officers o r stewards on the track to th e n ee d for
careful m o n ito rin g of those on the terraces.


                                                              55
  312. It will o f course be necessary to have a police presence sufficient to prevent pitch invasion tor im p ro p e r
reasons through the o pen gates. However, 1 a m encouraged to th in k th a t this is n o t an insuperable p roblem by
the fact that, for ex am p le at Anfield, Liverpool's ground, there were no gates in the perim eter fencing before it
was taken down. T h ere were instead gaps o r "access points" as they are called in the G reen G u id e (p arag rap h
215). T h e ir existence d id not. so far as 1 am aware, prevent the au tho ritie s from m ain tain in g order. Also, the
gates were o p en th ro u g h o u t the replay o f this ill-fated semi-final at Old Trafford on 7 May 1989.


Reduced Numbers
   313. In th e assessm ent o f figures for capacity, the criteria in C h a p te r 16 o f the G reen G u id e were not at
H illsborough, an d m ay not elsewhere, have been applied w ith sufficient rigour. Therefore, in a d d itio n to

figure for m a x im u m capacity in accordance w ith the G reen G u id e. 1 r e c o m m e n d reducing th a t figure by a

     started forthw ith an d com pleted as soon as possible.

     Maximum Capacities for Terraces
     ★     1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
         should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

         A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
         another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

     ★     2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
         Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

         (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure", proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
             which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
             in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

         (b) after assessin g “the Green Guide figure” , a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
             margin.

     ★      3. Arrangements should be made:-

         (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
             figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
             ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherw ise, and

         (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


     Filling and Monitoring Terraces
     ★      4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
         responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
         . ‘her terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
         variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

     ★     5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
         area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
         sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
         period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
         or police presence. H e should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
         below, and by radio to the control room.


     Fences and Gates
            6.    All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
         duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition o f
         crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
         demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
         different crowd densities.

     ★     7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
         different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “ Emergency Exit” .



                                                                57
★    8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    when spectators are on the terrace.

★     9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
    The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. H e should be able to make radio contact with the control room
    either him self or via an officer close at hand.

★     10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal o f enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
    brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision o f a
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
★      11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

★      12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    com plies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessm ent of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions o f the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority' at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, mi itoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions o f the local authority are regularly and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the local authority's rules.

       17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory' Group consisting
    of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group's terms of
    reference should encompass all matters concerned w ith crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written reports for consideration by the local authority .


Duties of each Football Club
★     18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
    inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
    anticipated.
★       19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
      as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
      turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
      accordingly.

★       20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
      reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
      operators for this purpose.

        21.    Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
      concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

it      22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
      reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
      and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
      area.

★       23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
      the information provided in respect o f each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
      should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

★      24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
      by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
      admitting spectators to the ground.

        25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters' club as to the provision o f pre-match
      entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
★       26. The C hief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
      should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management o f each football club and local authority
      concerned in respect o f the safety and control o f crowds.

★       27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing o f all
      officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
      is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

★       28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
      any foreseeable pattern in the arrival o f spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
      sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment o f officers to be made at any point inside oroutside the ground.

★       29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion o f the officer in command at the ground.
       Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

          30. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
       monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record o f any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
       at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
       in the interpretation and use o f these data.


    Communications
         31     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
       received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
       priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be
       used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
       sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.




                                                           59
      32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
    with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

      33. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
    areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
    announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
    noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
    match.

      34. U se should be made where possible o f illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
    Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a sim ple code of hand signals to indicate to
    the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
★      35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
    liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★     36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
    ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
    spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
    concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
    rooms of each of the emergency services.

★     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium o f emergency vehicles from all three
    services should be reviewed. They should include routes o f access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
    within the ground itself.

★     38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
    the arrival o f emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
    they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
★      39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
    club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

      40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number o f such rooms and the
    equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
    medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

★     41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at etc h match and available to deal with
    any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and competen; in advanced first aid. H e should be
    present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
    match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
    contactable.

★     42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
    attendance at all matches w ith an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

      43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches w here larger crowds are expected should
    be specified by the local authority' after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement of the Safety Certificate.

                                                   S P E C I F I C IN C ID E N T S

M r H icks' Evidence
   1. M r an d Mrs Hicks’ two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived early en famille b u t had tickets
for different sections. T he tw o daughters h a d standing tickets: they w ent into pen 3. Mrs Hicks h ad a seat in the
no rth stand. M r Hicks took u p a standing p osition in pen 1ju st below an d to the west o f the police box a t a b o u t
2.15 pm F rom there, he h ad a view o f the centre pens. H e kept an eye on th em as they filled up since he knew his
d aughters to be there.

    2. His evidence was th at by 2.50 p m he could see people were in distress. At a b o u t 2.55 pm he a n d others
called to a sen ior police officer a t the top o f th e steps to the control box to draw his a tte n tio n to the crushing. M r
Hicks was only ab o u t 10 feet from the officer. H e described him as w earing a flat cap w ith gold o r silver braid
a n d a light coloured anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officer w ho stopped th e m atch. M r G reen w o o d , who
d id stop the m atch, was certainly not wearing a light coloured an o rak , as can clearly be seen on the video.

  3. M r Hicks says th a t he a n d others sh o u ted several tim es to this officer in a ttem p ts to alert h im to the
distress in the pens. T here was no reaction although M r Hicks believes the officer m u st have been in earshot.

   4. T h a t officer descen d ed from the steps an d tw o c a m e ra m e n w hom M r H icks believed were from
television ca m e a n d ap p e are d to direct their cam eras towards the pens. A n o th er senior officer a p p e are d two
steps dow n from the platform . H e was a stocky figure: he also wore a flat cap b u t w ith black braid. M r H icks
says th a t he a n d two o r three others tried several tim es to cap tu re this officer’s a tte n tio n w ith o u t success. T h e n
M r Hicks says he sho u ted “ For C hrist’s sake! C an ’t you see w hat’s going on? We can, a n d you have cam e ra s” . T he
officer is said to have replied dismissivelv “ S hut your fucking p ra ttle ” .

   5. W h e n the disaster occurred the two H icks girls were crushed. Victoria was p u t in an a m b u lan c e a n d M r
H icks a c c o m p a n ie d her to hospital where she was found to be dead . Sarah died a t the ground.

   6. M r H icks was an im pressive witness an d , despite his grievous loss, rem a rk a b ly stoical. H e gave his
evidence clearly a n d w ith o u t rancour. H e was certainly m istaken a b o u t M r G re e n w o o d being o n e o f those on
the steps a n d it has n o t been possible to identify either officer from M r Hicks’ descrip tio n s. He m a y well also
have b een im precise as to timings. Nevertheless. I see no reason to d o u b t th a t w h at he described d id occur in
relation to tw o officers. As M r Hicks generously said himself, the dism issive abuse from the second officer
(although reprehensible) m ay have been d u e to his being preoccupied with trying to see w h at was h a p p e n in g at
pens 3 a n d 4 aro u n d kick-off time.

The Goalkeeper and Gate 4
   7. M r B a m b ro ck , a Liverpool supporter, said he w ent through th e tunnel. H e w ould have liked to have
tu rn ed b ac k w hen he saw how crowded the pens were. H e w ent wi; a his f?, u “r a n d i 3 year old b ro th e r S tephen
towards th e front o f pen 4. H e saw the teams com e on to the pitch. C o n d it ri-.sat the fro n t were, he said, alright
until a b o u t 2 m in u tes to 3. T h en the pressure in the pen increased a n d he a n d his father becam e separated . H is
feet cam e o f f the ground. H e shouted to police officers through the fence to get th em o u t a n d help th em . T he
police d id not react. T h e Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce G robbelaar. spoke to a p o licem an on the track. T h e gate
was then o p en e d by a blo n d e policew om an a n d ab o u t 25 to 30 people went th rough it. They in c lu ded the
witness’s fath er a n d his b ro th er Stephen w ho h ad a broken arm . A police C onstable sh u t the gate. It was th en
reopened by th e sam e policew om an, the w itness thought, a n d he got out.

  8. M r Eccleston, a m ale nurse an d an im pressive witness, was sitting in the n o rth stand. He n o ticed pens 3
and 4 were full a n d realised so m eth in g was w rong w hen fans started com ing over the p erim eter fence b u t d id
not invade the pitch. He said the Liverpool goalkeeper ap p e are d to notice this too.

  9. Mr G ro b b e la a r was o u t o f the co un try du rin g the Inquiry a n d was therefore not called. However, he
m ade a s ta te m e n t w hich was p u t in as his evidence. In the course o f it he sa id :-

  “ Kick-off h ap p e n e d a n d we got into ou r strid e pretty quickly - we forced a co rn e r p retty early on a n d th e ball
  cam e dow n to my end - I rolled it out t£> the full back once an d play went on until Peter Beardsley h it the
  crossbar o f the N o ttin g h am Forest goal from a c o m e r a n d cam e b ack into play. I rem e m b e r ju s t after that
  there were shouts a n d scream s from the crow d ju st b ehin d m e, it was different; n ot the o rd in ary crowd noise
  and I tu rn e d a ro u n d to look. W h at am azed m e first was the co n cen tratio n a n d squash o f fans in the centre



                                                                 63
section, the e n d areas still had plenty o f space. It was only then 1 becam e conscious that the crowd was
sq u ash in g forw ard an d wasn't able 10 go sideways a n d th a t’s when I noticed the fencing alongside th em
h o lding them in. I saw fans being pulled up into the sta n d above the terraces. I saw fans clim bing over in to the
em p ty areas at the side a n d I saw fans clim bing out over the front o n to the pitch which was particularly
difficult because o f the spikes on the top o f the fencing b u t they were getting out.
    "Play was still going on and 1 was in a terrible position trying to concentrate on play and having my
atte n tio n taken by w h at was h ap p en in g b ehin d me. The ball cam e down to o u r end a n d N o ttin g h am Forest
won a corner, it was taken an d we cleared o u r box area an d as play was going forward over the centre line I
heard a shout, 'B ruce - please h elp ’ - a desperate sh ou t from a fan sq u a sh ed up against th e fencing to the
right o f my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces. H e scream ed, 'Please get the fucking gate open - Help,
h elp ’. All the people w ho could speak were pleading for help. T here were two policem en near the gate right
alongside th e fan w ho h ad shouted to m e an d so I sh o u ted to them , ‘G e t the gate o p en ’. I was still try in g to
co n c en tra te on play a n d was still having my atten tio n taken by w hat was h appening b eh in d me - there were
lots o f fans on the p itch b ehind the goal area by th em too. I called ag ain to the policem en, ‘O p en the fucking
gate’ a n d o ne ju st tu rn e d away from m e a n d looked back at the crow d but the o th e r w ent to the gate a n d
o p e n e d it a n d it was like taking the top o ff a shaken coke bottle - people were everywhere o n the play area
a ro u n d my goal. Play was still going on a n d it cam e down towards m e again for the left h a n d com er. It was
a N o ttin g h a m Forest throw-in, away to my left, the ball was out o f play a n d a fan ca m e u p to m e o n the
pitch a n d said. “Bruce, they're killing us’. I said ‘W h o ’s killing you?’, a n d he said ‘T h e y ’re crushing us-o ur
fans’. I said ‘G o a n d get som e help ’, a n d then a policem an cam e on a n d spoke to this fan. I d o n ’t know
w ho the fan was, a n d then he led h im off. It was ab o u t this tim e I saw a policem an r u n n in g o n to the pitch
fro m m y right across m y box an d to the referee who blew up, recovered th e ball an d told all players to clear
th e p itch .”
   10. It is clear from the video th at M r G ro b b e la ar’s recollection o f the sequence o f events, even w ith regard
to th e gam e, is inaccurate in a n u m b e r o f respects. For example, the tw o N o ttin g h am Forest c o m e r kicks
o ccu rred m in u tes before Beardsley struck the bar. Further, it seems highly probable fro m o th e r evidence th a t
gates 3 a n d 4 were open continuously well before M r G ro b b e la ar says the fan asked him to get the gate o p e n . It
seem s su rp risin g too th a t w ith all the noise M r G ro b b e la ar would h e a r the precise words o f a n individual fan,
let alone resp on d twice to them , whilst the gam e was in progress.
    11. As to M r B a m b ro c k ’s account, the evidence o f PC F iona R ich a rd so n was th a t sh e was th e on ly
policew om an on the track in the early stages although others ca m e from the seated area as the in c id en t
developed. P C R ich a rd so n began at gate 1 an d . although she d id go a n d help people o u t through gate 3, she
d id not go to gate 4, a n d d id not open it twice o r even once. T he two officers w ho spoke o f o p en in g gate 4 were
b o th male.
    12. I th in k M r G ro b b e la a r d id becom e conscious o f distress in th e crowd b eh in d h im a n d d id speak to a
police officer a t so m e stage, probably earlier than he now thinks. N o t to reach th a t b ro ad conclusion w ould
involve a ttrib u tin g his whole acco u n t to invention o r fantasy a n d I see no g rounds for d o in g so. However, his
d etailed a c co u n t was not tested in cross-exam ination a n d its inconsistencies a n d errors w hen co m p ared w ith
o th e r incon tro v ertib le evidence w ould m ake it unsafe to derive m ore th a n the b ro ad conclusion stated above.
T h e in c id en t shows how honest witnesses can becom e confused and th e ir evidence flawed w hen recollecting
events experien ced u n d e r tension or em o tio n .
   13. As to th e o p en in g o f gate 4 there was a n ap p a re n t conflict o f evidence. P C Illingworth said that a b o u t
five m in u tes to 3 he o p en e d it a n d guided fans em erging through it to gate 5. P C H ooson said th at it w as he
w h o o p en e d gate 4 ju s t before kick-off. I a m satisfied from the evidence o f a n u m b e r o f fans th at, like gate 3,
gate 4 was o p en e d m o re than once. T h e probability is. therefore, th a t whilst P C Illingworth was sh ep h erd in g
fans to gate 5, gate 4 h a d been closed again until it was re-opened by P C H ooson two or three m in u tes later.

Oxygen
   14. It was alleged by a d o cto r that an oxygen cylinder provided to h im on the pitch was em pty. D r Phillips, a
L iverpool sup p o rter, h a d been in pen 3 w ith his b ro th e r a n d others. H e cam e u n d e r pressure a n d clim bed in to
pen 2. W h e n the disaster occurred a n d gate 2 was o p en ed , he w ent through it, injuring his h ea d as he d id so. H e
ca m e o n to the pitch so m e tim e after 3.10 p m a n d started resuscitation procedures. He was given an oxygen
cylinder. H e believes this was from St Jo h n A m bulance. It was. he th o u g h t, too early to be the fire service. T h e
cy lin der was sw itched on b u t D r Phillips says it gave no oxygen since it was empty. T h e re was o ne oxygen
cy linder o n the St J o h n ’s am b u lan c e w hich cam e to the scene. M r Wells, the Divisional S u p erin te n d en t o f St
Jo h n took th a t cylinder on to the pitch. H e said it was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a patient b eing
trea te d bv D r Phillips an d says th at oxygen was flowing into that patient. Moreover, M r Wells tested the
cylinder afterw ards a n d found it was still h a lf full. It has a capacity th a t will last for 5 h o u rs 4 0 m inutes o n a
high setting.
    15. T h ere was evidence from Assistant C h ie f Fire Officer H ornsby th at a M a x a m a n resuscitator h ad failed
to work properly. It was delivering a n oxygen flow ap p ro p riate to a "ch ild " setting rath er than a full “ad u lt"
flow. O n ex am in a tio n , it was found that a retain in g nut in the control knob h ad w orked loose, possibly d u e to
v ib ratio n in transit, an d this h ad affected the flow o f oxygen, T h e device had last been tested on 10 April 1989.
   16. 1 accept the evidence o f M r Wells th a t th e St John A m b u lan ce cylinder was charged w ith oxygen and
w orking properly. In my view, D r Phillips m ay have been m istaken as to th e cy linder o f w hich he com plains
being empty. H e agreed he was u n d er great pressure, in an aw kw ard situation; his head was in ju red a n d he
b ec am e very angry at w h at he regarded th en as wholly the fault o f the police. H e co nceded th a t if the cylinder
was n o t e m p ty there was a possible alternative - th a t the m a ste r tan k to p valve was shut. It seems unlikely th a t
he could have been referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was clear th a t the bottle he received was a
sim ple piece o f eq u ip m e n t n o t designed to b rea th e for the p a tie n t b u t m erely to supply oxygen.
    17. I co n clu d e th a t on a balance o f probabilities the evidence do es n o t ju stify a finding th at a n em p ty
cy lin der was b ro u g h t to the scene.
Calling the Fire Service
    18. P C B ich ard ’s call to police H e a d q u arte rs at 3.13 p m for th e fire service to bring h y d rau lic cutting
e q u ip m e n t to cut m etal fences (see paragraph 101 supra) was h ea rd by C h ie f Inspector E d m u n d so n . H e went
into th e ad jac en t o p e ra tio n s roo m to give instructions for th e message to be passed to the fire service. T h ere, a
te m p o ra ry control ro o m assistant was already speaking to the fire service a b o u t a house fire. M r E d m u n d s o n
in te rru p te d th e call a n d asked the assistant to tell the fire service th a t cu ttin g eq u ip m en t was w an te d at
H illsborough. T h ere followed a conversation between the assistant a n d Miss D avies at the fire service in the

   Police             H ang on a sec.
   At th a t p o in t C h ie f Inspector E dm uftdson intervened a n d spoke for the police. T h e conversation
c o n c lu d e d :-
   Police             (M ale v o ic e )-H e llo !
   Fire C o n t r o l   Hello! N o w you writ s o m e c u t tin g g e a r - w h a t ex actly is it fo r9

   Police               T here has been a m ajor accident at H illsborough football ground where the semi-final is.
                        th e crowds have forced their way in, they have broken fences an d gates down. 1 d o n ’t know
                        exactly what it is but there are people trapped.

   Fire C o n tro l     Right! O K - leave it with us.

   T h a t co nversation took 1 m in u te 13 seconds. It was p ublished in a n u m b e r o f new spapers w ith strong
critical c o m m e n t mostly against the fire service. T he th ru st o f th e criticism was that valuable tim e was wasted
by the fire serv ice asking unnecessary q u estio n s as to w here a n d why cutting e q u ip m en t w as required.

    19. T h ere was a m eeting o f the emergency services in August 1988 to discuss p ro ced u re in the event o f a
m a jo r disaster at Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. It was p o in ted o u t a n d m in u te d th a t “It was im p erativ e th a t
th e Police C o n tro l give the exact location o f any fire or in c id en t a n d as m u c h detail as possible. N o sen io r fire
officer is on duty at th e m atch. . . Fire service will a tte n d via P enistone R o ad o r Leppings Lane as directed by
th e police.”

    20. T he message from P C Bichard con tain ed all th e necessary in fo rm atio n - Leppings Lane end, hydraulic
c u ttin g eq u ip m en t, to cu t m etal fences. Regrettably, it was not passed on by H ea d q u arte rs in th o se term s. Miss
Davies had rightly b een train ed to require a precise location a n d n eeded to k now th e problem w hich w ould face
th e fire service so th a t th e ap p ro p riate response could be m ade. In fact, there a re several football grounds in the
Hillsborough d istrict although clearly Sheffield W ed n esd ay ’s g ro u n d is th e principal one. In the result,
alth o u g h C h ie f In sp ecto r E d m u n d so n clarified, to an extent, th e n atu re o f th e problem , th e locus w hich
em erged in the co u rse o f th e co n v ersatio n (Penistone R oad) was not th a t co n tain ed in th e original message
from g ro u n d co n trol ( ; e “ Leppings Lane end.") W hilst on the face o f th e conversation th e fire service may seem
to have b een slow in the u p ta k e or p erh a p s pedantic, in my view the police ought to have b ee n m o re specific.
T h ey h ad th e necessary in form atio n to be so.

   21. I a m satisfied, however, that th e delay o f 1 m in u te 13 seconds over th e call, a n d even the delay
o ccasioned by th e c u ttin g eq u ip m e n t going to P en isto ne R o ad ra th e r th a n Leppings Lane, d id n o t affect the
outcom e. Even h ad those w ith cutting eq u ip m en t gone directly after a b riefer ’phone call they w ould n o t have
arriv ed at a stage early en o u g h to m ake cutting the fencing a helpful exercise.

Mr Kenny D alglish
   22. W hen th e Liverpool m an ag er w ent to the control ro o m a n d agreed to m a k e th e a n n o u n c e m e n t
b roadcast at 3.56 p m , he says in a statem en t that he could no t get th e Tannoy to work. Spectators c ould see
him trying to a d d re ss th e m a n d indicated to him m anu ally th a t n o th in g could be h eard . A n officer pressed
b u tto n s on the m a c h in e a n d M r Dalglish says he trie d again w ith sim ilar lack o f success. H e was th en taken
u n d e r the police box to th e ro o m used by the disc jockey to b ro ad c ast pre-m atch music. T h ere, the m icro p h o n e
w orked a n d ive b ro ad c ast his message.

   23. M r D alglish was n o t called. T h ere was no o th e r evid en ce ab o u t this incident. I accept it occurred as he
described. W h y th e T annoy could n o t at that tim e be successfully o p era ted from th e police box is, however,
strange a n d u n ex p lain e d . U n lik e th e radio, it h a d o p era ted satisfactorily from the police box at the critical
tim es save th a t its messages m ay not always have b ee n heard above th e prevailing noise. It h ad w orked a t ab ou t
3.30 pm w hen it called for medical staff. I can see no g ro u n d s for criticising the police in regard to this inciden t
a n d certain it is th a t th e b rie f delay in relaying M r Dalglish’s message can have had n o significant effect.

    7. ACTIONS AFTER DEATH

    Introduction

      At common law a person's death extinguished all rights of action that he
   m ight have had. In particular, if the death was a result of the tortious acts of
   another, the deceased's family would have no right of action in respect of
   the death.13 The position is now governed by statute.
     If a person dies as the result of the tortious acts of another there are two
   ways in which an action might be brought. First, by reason of the Law
   Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934, certain causes of action which
   were vested in the deceased at the tim e of his death survive for the benefit of
   his estate. Secondly, certain "dependants” of the deceased now have a right
   of action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976.


   Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934

     By section 1(1) of the 1934 Act it is provided that all causes of action, w ith
   the exception of actions for defamation and seduction which were vested in
   a person on his death shall survive for the benefit of his estate.
     It is expressly provided, by section 1(2)(<2 ) that the damages recoverable for
   the benefit of the estate “shall not include any exemplary damages." Where
   the person's death has been caused by the act or omission w hich gives rise


   12 [19791 Q .B .7 2 2 .
   13 A d m ira lty Com missioners v. SS. A m erika [1917] A .C . 3 8 .




to the cause of action the damages recoverable for the benefit of the estate
shall be calculated w ithout reference to any loss or gain to his estate conse­
quent on his death, except that a sum in respect of funeral expenses m ay be
included.14 Damages for "loss of expectation of life" and for the "lost years"
cannot be recovered if the death occurred after January 1, 1983.15
  It follows that an action can be brought by the estate of a person who died
as a result of police misconduct. Compensatory and aggravated damages can
be recovered by the estate.
The Fatal Accidents Act 1976

   The 1976 Act gives a right of action to "dependants" of a deceased person
whose death was caused by any "wrongful act, neglect or default" such as
would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the person injured to recover
damages.16
   Dependants are defined in section 1(2) and include spouses, parents and
grandparents, children and grandchildren, nephews nieces and cousins and
any person who had been living w ith the deceased in the same household
for a period of at least two years immediately before death as husband or
wife and any person treated by the deceased as a parent or as a "child of the
family."
   A husband or wife or the parents of an unm arried m inor are entitled to
damages for "bereavement” 17 in the sum of £3500.18 O ther damages are
awarded as are proportionate to the injury resulting from the death to the
dependants respectively. Such damages are assessed on the basis of the
"value of the dependency," in other words, the dependants are entitled to
that sum of money that will replace the "m aterial benefits" provided to
them by the deceased.19
   It should be noted that the dependants cannot recover if the deceased
earned his living by crime, because their claim would be defeated by the
defence of ex turpi causa.10
   The damages recoverable can be reduceci.to take into account any "con­
tributory negligence" by the deceased.21
   The dependants of anyone killed as a result of police wrongdoing will,
therefore, have an action against the police under the Fatal Accidents Act.


8. LIMITATION

  All the causes of action discussed in this chapter are "founded on tort."
The basic tort lim itation period of six years "from the date on which the
cause of action accrued" therefore applies.22

    The cause of action accrues at the m om ent at w hich the plaintiff could
 first sue. When a tort is actionable per se, tim e will run from the m om ent at
which the wrongful act was committed. Thus, a cause of action in libel will
run from the m o m en t of publication and will be time-barred six years later.
On the other hand, where damage is essential to the cause of action and it
will only arise w hen the damage actually occurs. Thus, a cause of action in
negligence, misfeasance in a public office or conspiracy will only arise w hen
the plaintiff actually suffers loss or damage as a result of th e defendant's
breach of duty or misfeasance. In the case of a breach of statutory duty the
date of accrual of the cause of action will depend on w hether th e statute is
construed as giving a cause of action which is actionable per se.23 If a statute
does give rise to a breach which is actionable per se then tim e will run from
the date of the breach, otherwise tim e will run from the date on w hich
damage takes place.
    Where the action is "in case" the cause of action will accrue w hether or
not the plaintiff know s that the damage has taken place.24 Thus, for
example, if property is damaged by negligent police action tim e will run
from the date of damage, not the date when the plaintiff discovers th at it has
happened.
    Where the damages claimed by the plaintiff "consist of or include
damages in respect of personal injuries25 to the plaintiff or any other per­
son" then the applicable lim itation period is three years.26 In such a case the
tim e period runs from either the date on which the cause of action accrued
or the date of knowledge (if*later) of the person injured.27 T he court has a
discretion to extend the lim itation period under section 33 of the Limi­
tation Act 1980.28
   If the person injured dies before the expiration of the three year lim itation
period then the lim itation period for a cause of action surviving for the ben­
efit of the estate under section 1 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Pro­
visions) Act 1934 is three years from the date of death or the date of the
knowledge of the personal representative, whichever is the later.29 If the
person injured dies after the expiry of the lim itation period then his per­
sonal representatives can ask the court to override the lim itation period.30
   An action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 cannot be brought if the
death occurred when the person injured could no longer m aintain an action
in respect of the injury, w hether because the action is time-barred or for any
other reason.31 Where the action would have been barred by the three year
tim e lim it in respect of personal injuries there is no statutory discretion to
override the tim e lim it under section 33.32 No action under the Fatal Acci­
dents Act can be brought after the expiration of three years from the date of
death or the date of knowledge of the person for whose benefit th e action is

33.34
   Where any fact relevant to the cause of action is deliberately concealed by
the defendant the period of limitation does not begin to run until the plain­
tiff discovered the concealment or could, w ith reasonable diligence have
discovered it.35
1   Fatal Accidents Act 1976

The Fatal Accidents Act 1976 allows dependants to claim against anyone who
causes death by their wrongful act, neglect or default, provided the wrongful

act, neglect or default would have been such as to allow the person who died to
have made a claim if they had not died. In other words the act, neglect or
default must constitute a civil wrong; if the police would have had a good
defence to the civil wrong, the claim for the death also fails.

 Who can sue?
Most members of the family of the dead person can sue, including:
(a) spouse;
(b) parents or grandparents;
(c) children or grandchildren;
(d) siblings, uncles and aunts, and all their descendants;
(e) common-law spouse of two years’ standing (lesbian and gay relationships
    are therefore excluded);
(f) anyone treated as a child of the family following a marriage;
(g) anyone treated as a parent.

 Wrongful act, neglect or default o f the police
It has to be shown that the wrongful act, neglect or default o f the police caused
the death.93This may be fairly straightforw ard if, say, the death resulted from
a deliberate assault or from a ro ad accident caused by a police officer’s
negligent driving. It is less clear-cut if the death arose partly from the act of the
person who died, say in the case of someone who died from alcohol or drugs.
The police have a detailed Code of Practice (see Appendix Two) on the
treatm ent of people in their custody concerning such matters as the conditions
of detention, the treatm ent o f detained persons and medical treatm ent. While
a breach of the Code does not o f itself render any individual officer liable to a
separate civil action, a breach o f the Code might be evidence of negligence.94
    A problem might arise where someone dies because the police fail to act to
prevent the death. This might occur where the police arrest someone who is ill
or someone becomes ill after an arrest and the police fail to call a doctor. In the
ordinary law of negligence a “ pure om ission” to act, such as where a passer-by
fails to call an ambulance after a ro a d accident, does not make the passer-by
liable. However, the position is different if the person who fails to act has a
legal duty of care:95police custody officers are under a statutory duty to ensure
that anyone detained at a police station is treated in accordance with the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act and the Codes o f Practice.96 U nder the Act,
failure on the part of an officer to comply with any provision o f the Codes does
not of itself render th at officer liable to any civil proceedings.97 However, it
seems that the special duty to take care of people in police custody existed
before the Act was passed98 so this provision should not defeat a claim based
on an act of omission by the police. Even if the courts decided it was an
obstacle, it seems only to protect the officer who failed to comply with the
Codes. A claim against the chief officer of police should therefore still succeed,
see p 101.
   A further problem may arise where someone commits suicide in police
custody. If the suicide was induced by a wrongful act of the police, a claim can
still succeed even though the person who died took their own life.99 There
must, however, be a clear link between the wrongful act and the suicide, such
as where a person is falsely imprisoned or assaulted and becomes depressed
and suicidal as a result. If the police have a good defence to the false
im prisonm ent or assault allegation, the claim for damages arising from the
death would also fail.
   It is arguable that a claim can be made if the police negligently fail to
prevent a suicide. This might arise where the police take into custody someone
they know to be prone to suicide,100 and then fail to prevent them harming
themselves by, for example, failing to keep them under regular and frequent
observation.™1 It is impossible to say with certainty th at this is the law, as it
appears that there has never been a reported case directly on the point, in
England. However, in a case which decided that it was justifiable to force-feed
a suffragette on hunger strike, the L ord Chief Justice said “ It was the duty,
both under the rules and apart from the rules, of officials to preserve the health
and lives of the prisoners, who were in the custody o f the C row n” . 102 This
however does not deal with the crucial problem that in the general law of
negligence if someone consents to a risk, such as consenting to a surgical
operation, their claim fails. Normally a person who carried out an act
themselves would be taken to be clearly consenting to the risk. The question
that remains to be decided is whether som eone o f unsound mind can be said to
“ consent” .


2   Damages

Damages are only awarded for:
(a) bereavement; and
(b) the loss of reasonable expectation of financial benefit.
Damages for bereavement are a fixed am ount, currently £3,500.103 They are
only awarded to the spouse of the deceased or the parents o f someone under 18
who never married.
   Damages for reasonable expectation o f financial loss can include such
things as loss of a p aren t’s financial su pport, or loss of a son’s voluntary gifts
during a period of em ploym ent104 or loss of free services as where a wife who
was killed acted as a housewife.105 However, if the person who died earned his
or her income from a life of crime, the dependants are not allowed to claim for
loss of the benefits of crim e.106
NEGLIGENCE
G eneral
                §4.1. THE DEFINITION OF NEGLIGENCE

            is clearly a mental state, and a type of legal fault. Another
In te n tio n
type of legal fault, not necessarily involving a mental state, is
negligence.
   Some accidents (or other events) are so unexpected that when they
happen we can only say that they were unavoidable— in legal language,
"inevitable." We cannot think of anything that a careful person would
have done to avoid the evil result, if he had been in the shoes of the
defendant.
   Other accidents happen because of the neglect of some precaution that
a reasonable man would have used. (The reasonable man is sometimes,
and better, called a prudent man.) Such accidents are the products of what
we call negligence, or carelessness.
   Negligence, then, is failure to conform to the standard of care to which
it is the defendant's duty to conform. It is failure to behave like a
reasonable or prudent man. in circumstances where the law requires such
reasonable behaviour. (In this context, of course, as nearly always in law,
the word "man" includes "woman.’') An employer may for example be
negligent as to whether safety precautions are being used by his
workpeople.

You mean the defendant was thoughtless?
   Yes. or incompetent in a job (such as driving a car) in which he should
have been competent. Or. worse still, he may actually have seen the
danger and "chanced his arm." In the latter case he is advertently
negligent, or in other words reckless. If he did not advert to the danger,
or in other words realise there was a risk, when he ought to have, he is
inadvertently negligent. Negligence means forbidden conduct where the
defendant's liability depends on the fact that he failed to realise (foresee/
know) what he ought to have realised, and failed to conform his conduct
accordingly, or. a fortiori, that he did realise it and yet failed to conform
his conduct as he should.
   The test of negligence in terms of the prudent man is called an
"objective" standard, because it does not depend upon a finding of what
passed in the defendant's mind.
Why do you bring in the prudent man in defining negligence? Is it because
otherwise the standard would vary for everyone?
  There would be no standard at all. Every judgment of a man's conduct
implies judgment measured against a standard external to him.
Who is this “ prudent m an’'? Is he the man in the street?
   The man in the street, that legendary combination of sage and
ignoramus, does not quite represent the idea. The "prudent man" or
"reasonable man" of the lawyer's imagining is the exemplary man: the
cautious, circumspect, anxiously calculating paragon who is held up by the
judges as a model of behaviour. Sometimes, it is true, he is described as
the ordinary man, or the average man. But little effort is made at trials to
find how ordinary men behave: and it would not be a cast-iron defence to
a charge of negligence to show that other people are prone to do exactly
as the defendant did. (At least, that is the position in the law of tort.)
H o m o juridicus is the ideal man. the moral man. the conscientious man—
not setting the standard so high that life becomes impossible in ordinary
terms, but nevertheless requiring the most careful consideration to be
given, so that harm is avoided and the law obeyed.
Why not eliminate talk of reasonable men by asking simply whether the
harm was probable?
   Probability is a matter of varying degree. Negligence consists in taking
a risk of harm with such a degree of probability as to be socially
unacceptable. This depends on what it is that is at stake. A surgeon may.
if there is no other way of alleviating his patient's suffering or prolonging
his life, perform an operation that carries a very high risk of killing his
patient, without being adjudged negligent. An employer who. in order to
increase production and profits, takes what is. statistically, a much smaller
risk with the lives of his workpeople may well be held to be so.
W hat should a prosecutor do to prove negligence?
  In an action in tort for negligence the plaintiff must give particulars of
the alleged negligence in his statement of claim. For example, in a running-
down case he will say that the defendant drove too fast, on the wrong side
of the road, without keeping a proper look-out, and so on. There are no
similar pleadings in criminal cases, but the prosecutor who alleges
negligence must be prepared to say what the defendant could and should
have done (or refrained from doing) in order to avoid the accident or other
occurrence.

Do I gather that when considering negligence you entirely ignore the
defendant’s state of mind?
   That would be going too far. One can imagine circumstances where an
ordinary driver would not be careless in running a blind man down, if he
did not know he was blind and had no reason to suppose he would proceed
as he did. But a driver who knew that the man was blind might on such
facts be guilty of careless driving.

Is negligence a form of mens rea?
  Some judges assume this, but there are substantial arguments the other
way.

• Negligence is not necessarily a state of mind, so it is not properly called
     m ens rea.
• The most serious and severely punishable crimes are defined to require
  intention or recklessness. If it were allowed that negligence is m ens rea.

   4 S. 202(2)(rf)-
      the judges might extend the concept of recklessness to cover negligence
      (which some of them are in any event strongly inclined to do), and might
      hold that all crimes at common law can be committed negligently (which
      would result in a great increase of severity). The argument does not
      involve saying that negligence should not be punished: only that it
      should not generally be punished on a par with crimes requiring a mental
      element.""'



 § 4.2. THE JUSTIFICATION OF PUNISHMENT FOR NEGLIGENCE

The reason for punishing negligence is the utilitarian one, that we hope
thereby to improve people's standards of behaviour.

Isn ’t the question one of moral wrong? It is wrong not to exercise
consideration for others.
   If inadvertent negligence results from not caring about other people, it
is a defect of character and may be regarded as morally wrong. But what
lawyers call inadvertent negligence is not always of this kind. Negligence
may be just a slip by a well-disposed person, and whether that should be
accounted morally wrong is open to debate.

Even though the offender did not realise the danger on the occasion in
question, he would have realised it if he had taken due precautions. So he
was morally to blame.
   I do not dissent; but we should keep our eyes open to the facts. Apply
what you say to the particular case of a forgetful person. A man with a bad
memory can often take steps to remedy his deficiency— by keeping a diary
of his engagements and consulting it frequently, and so on. But his memory
may be so bad that one day he forgets to look in his diary, or forgets an
item recorded in it. Perhaps, to overcome this risk, he takes additional
steps, such as asking his wife to remind him of a particular engagement.
But one day he forgets to ask his wife. Is he to think of another device to
remind him to look at his diary or to ask his wife to remind him? Is it moral
fault not to do so? What we are faced with is the plain fact that on the
particular occasion the thought of the engagement never comes into his
mind. That is a deficiency in his mental make-up which he cannot help. To
search back into his past for the purpose of finding some defect in the
arrangements he made to remedy his failing, and blaming him on that
account, often wears the appearance of being an unrewarding exercise in
moralism.

   It is not only a question of memory. Many studies have been made of
accident proneness; and it has been found that large categories of people
are more accident prone than others. Old people are worse than younger
people, men worse than women, unmarried people worse than married.1
But some individuals are particularly accident prone. They are born
negligent, so to speak, or become so through their experiences. A person
has an innate temperament, which may in course of time be modified by
many circumstances over which he has no control. The result may be that
he is impulsive, unable to stop and consider the consequences of what he
is doing, or too dull in mind to imagine them: that he is selfish, preferring
his own convenience to the safety of others: that he is clumsy, unable to
control his own movements (or those of a machine he is using) with due
precision, or with a slow reaction-time in case of emergency.

If, as you say, the individual is unable to help these aspects of his mind or
body, how can he be said to deserve punishment?
   This objection to imposing liability for negligence appeals particularly to
those who take the '■determinist" position, according to which all events
(including human acts) are governed by pre-existing events which are their
causes. Everything we do is the product of our genetic constitution and
personal history.
   We need not go into the voluminous arguments for and against
determinism. Sufficient to say that the determinist philosophy, though it
may be true, is of little interest either to the lawyer or to the moralist. The
question in law and morals is whether the offender could have acted
otherwise if he h a d willed. If he could, he is morally and legallv
responsible.2 The further question “Was he able to will?” may be
speculated on by philosophers, but is eschewed in law and morals for a
pragmatic reason. The object of the law and of a moral system is to
influence our wills in a socially desired direction. Once this simple point is
grasped, the apparent difficulty of reconciling the philosophy of
determinism with ordinary moralattitudes               disappears. However,
malfunctioning of the will is given moral and legal significance when it is
associated with childhood or is regarded as a symptom of mental disorder.

   Liability for negligence is a way of sanctioning (punishing) common
sense rules that in themselves have no legal force. There are well-known
rules of prudence relating to the management of firearms, that one should
never leave them loaded, or point them at anyone even though believed to
be unloaded, and so on. Again, it is only a rule of prudence, not explicitly
one of law, that one should not pass on a blind corner (except that there
is a law on the subject of not crossing double white lines). Failure to
observe these rules (which will generally be an intentional or reckless
failure) will readily be held to be negligence, founding a charge of careless
driving or of manslaughter.

The reason why drivers do not pass on blind corners is because they
apprehend a consequence much more immediate and terrifying than what
may afterwards happen in a court of law.
   That is true, but the law of reckless and careless driving can add to the
pressure to make bad drivers change their habits and in the last resort to
give up driving.
   Carelessness with firearms is in a different legal position from careless
driving. Such carelessness is not an offence in itself, and it is not an offence
even if it causes severe injury, the reason evidently being that accidents
with firearms are too uncommon to attract particular attention from the
law. However, if the victim dies, a charge of manslaughter may be brought.
    Paradoxically,              th e justification              f or p u n i s h i n g      negligence           is s t r o n g e r in m i n o r o f f e n c e s

                              § 4.3. THE HANDICAPPED DEFENDANT
When comparing the physically handicapped (blind, maimed, etc.)
defendant with the reasonable man, we suppose that the reasonable man
suffers from the same handicap. The defendant need only do his best with
the body he has. But it would generally be negligent for a handicapped
man to undertake something that could be done safely only by an ordinary
man, if he has the opportunity not to do it.

W hat if the defendant is substandard in abilities?
  The reasonable man is not imagined to be substandard in intelligence or

10. Negligence and
Other Civil Actions


1. INTRODUCTION

   In Part II of this book the "traditional tort actions" against the police were
considered. These actions are by far the most important. They cover the
areas where citizens will be most concerned with unlawful police activity:
assault, unlawful arrest and imprisonment, interference with land and
goods and unjustified prosecutions. Nevertheless, the law provides a wide
range of other causes of action which may be relevant to the citizen's pos­
ition in relation to the police. This chapter deals with six areas: negligence,
breach of statutory duty, defamation, conspiracy, misfeasance in public
office and actions after death.


2. NEGLIGENCE

Introduction

   The common law action in negligence has, in recent decades, become of
central importance to the law of tort. Large areas of tortious liability have
been gradually redefined and assimilated to it. Nevertheless there have been
very few attempts to fix the police with liability for negligence in relation to
their "operational policing" functions. Complex and difficult questions
arise concerning matters such as the existence of a duty of care, the policy
limitations on such a duty, and the intervening acts of third parties.


The elements of the tort

  The elements of the tort of negligence are clear and well established.
There must be:
     j1)   a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff)
     (2)   a breach by the defendant of this duty;
     (3)   damage to the plaintiff;
     (4)   which is caused by the breach of duty.
(1) D u t y o f care. The generally accepted test1 to be applied to establish
whether or not a duty of care is owed by the plaintiff to the defendant is set
out in the speech of Lord Wilberforce in Anns v. M erton 2:
     "the question has to be approached in two stages. First one has to ask
     whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who has suf­
     fered damage there is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neigh­
     bourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of the former,
     carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter, in
     which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly, if the first ques­
     tion is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider whether there
     are any considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit
     the scope of the duty or the class of person to whom it is owed or the
     damages to which a breach of it may give rise."
Thus, if it is forseeable that the plaintiff will be damaged by the defendant's
lack of care, a duty of care will arise unless there are policy considerations
which restrict or negative the duty. Policy considerations may "negative" a
duty of care if it is not "just and reasonable" that a duty be imposed.3

(2) Breach o f d u t y . The defendant will be in breach of his duty if he fails to
take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances. The standard of care
is that of the reasonable man. This is a matter of law and the court will take
into account matters such as the degree of risk if the duty is not fulfilled,
the seriousness of the risk, the utility of the defendant's acts and the cost of
avoiding the harm.4 In police cases the standard of care will often not be a
high one, because the police act under considerable pressure, with compet­
ing demands on their resources, often in situations of some danger.5
Whether the defendant is in breach of his duty in a particular case is a ques­
tion of fact and degree.
(3) D a m a g e . Because negligence is an action on the case, there will only be
a complete cause of action if the plaintiff can show some "special damage"
such as personal injury, nervous shock or economic loss. If economic loss is
the only damage caused then there are strict "policy limitations" on recov­
ery. The plaintiff can only recover for "pure economic loss" if he can show a
"very close proximity" to the defendant.6 In general, the plaintiff can only
recover for damage which is "reasonably foreseeable."7

(4) C a u s a tio n . Even if the plaintiff was damaged and the defendant was in
breach of a duty owed to him, there will be no action unless the damage was
in fact caused by the breach. The defendant will not be liable if, on a proper

understanding of events, the plaintiff's damage was not in fact caused by the
negligence of the defendant but by some intervening "new act” (novus
actus interveniens). Human action does not, of itself, sever the connected
sequence of events.8 The basic rule was summarised by Greer L.J. in the
leading case of H aynes v. HarwoocP as follows:
      "If what is relied upon as a novus actus interveniens is the very kind of
      thing which is likely to happen if the want of care which is alleged
      takes place, the principle embodied in the maxim is no defence."
In police cases the first element will often be the most difficult to establish.
Special considerations may arise if the police are acting under "statutory
powers."10 Even if the plaintiff can establish a prima facie duty of care this
may well be negatived by "policy considerations." When it is alleged that
there has been a negligent failure to carry out proper investigations special
difficulties arise concerning liability for the acts of independent third par­
ties.


Negligence liability and independent third parties

  Difficult legal issues arise when the plaintiff's claim is based on damage
caused by an independent third party who, it is said, was placed in a position
to cause the damage by the defendant's negligence. It is clear that the simple
fact that the-damage was caused by a third party:
      "does not, of itself, preclude success of the claim, since breach of duty
      on the part of the person against whom the claim is made may also have
      played a part in causing the damage."11
Nevertheless, the situations in which such an action may succeed have
been strictly limited although the precise basis and extent of this limitation
have been unclear.
  There is no doubt that there will be liability if there is a "special relation­
ship" between the defendant and the third party by virtue of which the
defendant is responsible for controlling the actions of the third party.12
There will also be liability if the defendant negligently causes or permits a
source of danger to be created in a situation where it is reasonably foresee­
able that third parties may interfere with it.13
  There have been, however, considerable difficulties as to liability in cases
where there is no "special relationship" or situation of danger.14 The auth­
orities revealed two different approaches with different practical conse­
quences. These can be called the "policy" and the "foreseeability"
approaches.
  The first approach treats the limitation as a question of policy. On this

view, policy excludes liability in the absence of a special relationship or
other special circumstances. This was the analysis of Lord Denning M.R. in
L a m b v. C a m d e n 15 and was partially supported by Oliver L.J. (as he then
was).16 In P. Perl (Exporters | v. C a m d e n 17 Goff L.J. (as he then was) applied
Lord Wilberforce's test in A n n s 18 and suggested that "policy consider­
ations" negatived a duty of care in the absence of a special relationship
between the defendant and the third party. More recently, Lord Goff has
refined his analysis of the absence of a duty of care in this area stating that
the fundamental reason for it is "that the common law does not impose
liability for what are called pure omissions."19
   The second approach treats the question as being a matter of foreseeabi­
lity: if the third party intervention is foreseeable with a sufficiently high
degree of probability there will be a duty of care. In Dorset Y acht v. H om e
Office 20 Lord Reid said that there would be liability if the "intervening
action" of the third party was "very likely" (or perhaps just "likely")21 to
happen. In subsequent cases it has been suggested that the defendant may
be liable where third party intervention is "likely or very likely to
happen/'22 that there must be a "very high degree of foreseeability/'23 per­
haps "amounting almost to inevitability.'24
   This conflict was resolved by the decision of the House of Lords in Smith
v. L ittlew o o d s25 when this second approach was endorsed by a majority. It
was said that "mere foreseeability of damage is certainly not a sufficient
basis to found liability."26 Nevertheless, as Lord Mackay (with whom Lord
Keith and Lord Griffiths agreed, Lord Brandon taking a similar approach)27
said:
      "what the reasonable man is bound to foresee in a case involving injury
      or damage by independent human agency, just as in cases where such
      agency plays no part, is the probable consequences of his own act or
      omission, but that, in such a case, a clear basis will be required on
      which to assert that the injury or damage is more than a mere possi­
      bility."28
The result must be "highly probable or very likely" and the needle that

measures the probability of a particular result must be "near the top of the
scale."29 It is submitted that this is the correct approach and is in line with
the older authorities which deal with the problem as one of causation. As
Greer L.J. put it in a passage which has often been approved:
    "it is not true to say that where a plaintiff has suffered damage occa­
    sioned by a combination of the wrongful act of a defendant and some
    further conscious act by an intervening person, that of itself prevents
    the court coming to a conclusion in the plaintiff's favour if the accident
    was the natural and probable consequence of the wrongful act."30
The fact that the third party's acts are unlawful is no objection to liability.
As Lord Reid has said:
    "Unfortunately, tortious or criminal action by a third party is often 'the
    very kind of thing' which is likely to happen as a result of the wrongful
    or careless act of the defendant."31
It is submitted, therefore, that in the absence of "special relationships," a
person will be liable for the tortious acts of third parties if these are reason­
ably forseeable consequences of his own negligence. Liability will depend
on the facts of each particular case.
9. GENERAL DEFENCES


Introduction


  There are a number of general defences which are potentially applicable
to all the tort actions considered in this chapter. The most important of
these are as follows:
        (1) contributory negligence;
        (2) consent;
        (31necessity;
        (4) the plaintiff is a wrongdoer.



Contributory negligence


  At common law contributory negligence was a complete defence to an
action in negligence or breach of statutory duty but does not seem to have
been applied to any other cause of action.36 The position is now governed by
the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945. If a plaintiff in an
action for negligence suffers damage "as the result partly of his own fault"
his damages are reduced "to such an extent as the court thinks just and
equitable having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the
damage.37
  The position when the plaintiff's claim is a tort other than negligence or
breach of statutory duty is unclear. "Contributory negligence" will only be
a defence to an action for defamation, conspiracy or misfeasance if it can be
shown that the defendant's acts were themselves tortious; mere "careless­
ness" by the defendant will not be sufficient.38

Consent

   The maxim volenti non fit injuria, that to which a man consents cannot
be considered an injury, is of general application in the law of tort.39 The
defence of consent takes two forms: as consent to the invasion of interests
or the willing assumption of risk of injury.40
   No action will lie in respect of acts which were authorised by the plain­
tiff. The defendant must establish that the plaintiff's consent was fully and
freely given. This form of the defence applies to intentional torts such as
trespass to land or goods. It also applies to actions for defamation41 and pre­
sumably to misfeasance and conspiracy.
   The defence of volenti also applies in "non-intentional torts" when the
plaintiff has agreed to "assume the risk" of suffering damage. The scope of
the defence of consent as "assumption of risk" has been considerably
restricted by judicial decision. It is necessary for the defendants to show
that:
      "the plaintiff voluntarily and freely with full knowledge of the nature
      of the risk he ran impliedly agreed to incur it."42
It is not enough that the plaintiff had knowledge of the risk; he must be
shown to have consented not to hold the defendant liable:
      "The plaintiff must agree, expressly or impliedly, to waive any claim
      for any injury that may befall him due to the lack of reasonable care by
      the defendant."43
The defence must be specifically pleaded 44
  The defence of volenti is very rarely successful in actions for breach of
statutory duty or negligence.43 Although it was held to be applicable in A s h ­
ton v. Turner 46 This was a negligence action by one of two burglars who
had been drinking against the other who had injured him by crashing their
getaway car. It was held that no duty of care was owed by the driver to the
passenger in that situation but that the action failed, in any event, because
the passenger had assumed the risk of such injury by taking part in the bur­
glary and attempted escape.


Necessity

  There is no doubt that "necessity" is a defence to an action in trespass,
especially when human life is at stake 47 The defence probably applies to
"intentional torts." It will apply if the defendant takes "reasonable

measures" to deal with a "real and imminent danger."48 The police may be
able to rely on it to justify taking reasonably necessary steps to prevent
crime.49 The defence will not, however, be available if the necessity has
arisen from the defendant's own negligence.50
   In the case of R igby v. Chief C on stable51 the police successfully relied on
this defence to an action for trespass when they had set the plaintiff's gun
shop alight by firing CS gas canisters into it to "flush out" a dangerous
armed psychopath. Although the trespass was justified by necessity it was
no defence to an allegation of negligence in making arrangements to deal
with the consequences of the intrusion. The defendant was, therefore,
found guilty of negligence for firing the gas canister when no fire fighting
equipment was on hand.52


The plaintiff is a wrongdoer

   This defence has been discussed in relation to trespass to the person53 and
interference with goods.54 Its scope remains unclear but it seems that the
plaintiff's wrongdoing may, in some circumstances extinguish any right of
action in reliance on the maxim ex turpi causa non oritur actio-, an action
does not arise from a base cause. In the case of Thackw ell v. Barclay's
Bank 33 Hutchison J. suggested that the Court should consider whether
there was any illegality of which the court should take notice and whether,
if there was, giving relief to the plaintiff was contrary to public policy
because it would be indirectly assisting or encouraging him in his criminal
act.
   The fact that the plaintiff was engaged in a criminal act may mean that he
cannot recover for damage caused by the defendant's tortious conduct. In
M urphy v. Culhane56 it was held that a man who takes part in a criminal
affray may be said "to have been guilty of such a wicked act as to deprive
himself of a cause of action."37
   On the other hand, the plaintiff's wrongdoing may mean that the defend­
ant's acts were not, in the circumstance, tortious. In the case of A shton v.
Turner58 Ewbank J. held that:
      "The law of England may in certain circumstances not recognise the
      existence of a duty of care by one participant in a crime to another parti­
      cipant in the same crime, in relation to an act done in connection with

    the commission of that crime. The law is based on public policy, and
    the application of the law depends on a consideration of all the facts."
He went on to find that, on the facts, no duty of care existed between the
plaintiff and the defendants.
   This defence is, however, limited in scope and "Cases where an action in
tort has been defeated by [it] . . . are exceedingly rare."39It is submitted that
it will only succeed in two situations:
     (1) where, to establish his cause of action the plaintiff has to rely on
         criminal activity to found his claim60;
     (2) where, by giving the relief sought the court would be "indirectly
         assisting or encouraging" him in his criminal act.61
Thus, for example, a claim that the police had not shown proper care in
looking after a person in police custody, would not be defeated simply
because the person being held was being held for admitted wrongdoing. On
the other hand, a plaintiff who was injured following a negligent failure by
the police to deal with his 999 call in relation to a criminal affray which he
had instigated would not succeed in a negligence claim.

Negligence and police activities


   There is no doubt that in many spheres of activity the police are liable for
negligence and that no special principles of law apply. One example which
lies outside the range of this book concerns "accident at work" negligence
actions brought by serving police officers. Such actions are common and are
governed by the same principles which cover ordinary negligence actions by
employees.
   Similarly, actions against the police in respect of negligent driving are
common and usually uncontroversial in law. It has been held that police
drivers, acting in the course of their duties owe the same duty of care as all
other road users.46 This applies even when they are answering emergency
calls.
   The fact that the police are engaged in "policing" activities does not
exempt them from ordinary duties of care. These duties of care are not
"negatived" just because the police are engaged in difficult or dangerous
work—but the nature of the work is taken into account in assessing the
applicable "standard of care." The principle is clearly illustrated by the case
of Marshall v. O s m o n d 47 which involved injury to a suspected criminal at
the end of a chase by a police car. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial
judge on the law and held that a police officer owed the same duty of care to
a criminal he was pursuing as to anyone else, namely a duty "to exercise
such care and skill as is reasonable in all the circumstances."48 They went
on to support the trial judge's conclusion and held that the officer was, in
fact, not in breach of this duty.
   If police conduct, in all the circumstances, falls below the standard
expected of "reasonable police officers" the courts will impose negligence
liability. Thus, in the case of Knightley v. Johns 49 the police had been called
to an accident in a tunnel. The police inspector in charge, in contravention
of standing orders, had forgotten to close the tunnel to traffic. He therefore
ordered the plaintiff, a police motorcyclist, to ride back down the tunnel,

 against the flow of traffic, to close it to traffic. The plaintiff collided with a
 car and the Court of Appeal held that the Chief Constable was vicariously
 liable for the inspector's negligence. The case raised complex questions con­
 cerning novus actus inteiven iens but the point to note is that there was no
 discussion as to whether the police should be held liable for a negligent per­
 formance of their duties. The Court assumed that, if the inspector did not
 come up to the standard of the "reasonable police officer" (and there was no
novus actus) then negligence liability followed.
    In general then, when the police are acting (as opposed to failing to act)
 they will owe a duty of care to people who are likely to be directly affected
by their actions. No policy considerations will "restrict or negative" this
duty of care. This is illustrated by four cases in which such a duty of care
was accepted.
    The briefly reported case of Bryson v. N orthum bria Police A u th ority50
concerned a young man who had been arrested for drunkenness, kept in a
cell to sober up for some time and then released at 4.55a.m. In the cell he
had been vomiting and it seems unlikely that he had fully recovered by the
time of his release. Wandering home in the wrong direction he was killed in
an accident on an urban by-pass. In those circumstances Reeve J. held that
the police, in exercising their discretion whether to release or detain an
arrested person owe him a duty of care, but that, on the facts they had dis­
charged that duty. No policy considerations appear to have limited the duty.
    A similar approach was adopted by Taylor J. in the case of R igby v. Chief
Constable of N orth a m p to n .3l This involved police attempts to "flush" a
psychopath out of a gun shop. They did this with CS gas which was gener­
ated by a canister which got very hot and which the police knew was likely
to cause a fire. The police originally had a fire engine on hand but it left and
they made no attempt to replace it. A CS canister was then used with no fire
fighters at the scene. The canister did in fact cause a fire which destroyed
the plaintiff's shop. In these circumstances he was able to recover damages
for negligence. No "policy considerations" limited the duty of care.
    The county court case of Charles Wilson A u to m o b ile Engineers v. Chief
C onstable of Greater M anchester52 involved a claim for the negligent
release of a car from police custody. The police stopped the car and arrested
the occupants on suspicion of theft. Although the occupants were of no
fixed abode, with no documents and were not the registered keepers of the
car they were released two hours later with the car and they disappeared.
The judge held that:
      "a police officer owes a duty to the owner of goods which he has seized
      to take reasonable care for their safety, to make such enquiries as may
      be reasonable to ascertain their ownership and to take reasonable steps
      to return them to their owner if that is possible."53
The duty owed by the officer was said to be "to take such care as is reason­
able in all the circumstances."34 As the judge said:

        "One has to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case
        including, for example, the difficulty of any problem facing the officer,
        the nature and extent of the information available to him, the need in
        some circumstances perhaps to make a swift decision and the myriad of
        other considerations which may arise in any particular case.''53
On the facts, it was held that the police were negligent.
   The Scots law in this area is the same as that in England and the Court of
Session case of Allan (or W ilson ) v. Chief Constable of Lothian &) Borders
Police36 provides a useful illustration of the applicability of ordinary negli­
gence principles to the police. The pursuer (plaintiff) was a widow whose
husband had died of hypothermia in a field after having been taken away in
a police car. The police had been called after a domestic dispute in the
middle of the night. The deceased had been drunk and aggressive and the
police were removing him from the place where he had been causing
trouble.
  Although Lord McCluskey was not prepared to hold that the police had
"deliberately decided to teach . . . (the deceased) a lesson by depositing him
in the remote outskirts of Edinburgh"37 he was of the view that:
        "there is no escape from the fact that had the police officers given any
        thought to the weather conditions, the deceased's condition, the
        deceased's clothing, the remote location in which they left him, the
        conditions underfoot they would have been bound to realise that he
        was a danger to himself."38
He held that the police had a choice, whether to release the deceased or to
hold him and:
        "In deciding how to exercise that choice they had a duty to exercise a
        reasonable care to have regard to the reasonably foreseeable conse­
        quences of his being released."39
Although it was not reasonably foreseeable that the deceased would die of
hypothermia the damage suffered by him was of a "reasonably foreseeable
type"—that is harm by adverse weather conditions—and could, therefore,
be recovered for.60
  The judge concluded that "the police failed in their duty to take reason­
able care for . . . (the deceased's) safety"61 and his widow was, therefore,
awarded damages of £62,537 calculated on ordinary "fatal accidents" prin­
ciples.62
  In summary when police officers act in a negligent way they will in
general be liable according to ordinary principles. However, they will not be
subject to high standards of care in situations in which there is an important
discretionary element in the activity in question.

1. The Legal Status
and Organisation of the
Police


1. INTRODUCTION

   The legal status of the British police is complex and suffers from many
obscurities. Modem statutes governing the position have, according to the
familiar pattern, been constructed on common law assumptions which have
never been fully clarified. Despite the central importance of the police in the
legal system there are considerable doubts as to such fundamental matters as
their precise duties, the legal status of the organised “police force” and the
extent to which they are obliged to follow the orders of police authorities.
   Many civil actions against the police turn on the extent of their powers.
These powers flow partially from statute and partially from their status as
“constables" at common law. An understanding of the "office of constable"
and the duties which flow from it remains fundamental to any analysis of
the legal position of the police. The powers which the law gives to the
police are, almost always, vested in individual constables. It is important to
distinguish between the different types of powers involved. These areas
dealt with in the first section of this chapter.
   Although the law has taken very little direct cognisance of the fact that
the police operate in "forces" an understanding of police organisation and
hierarchy is sometimes of great importance in considering the civil law pos­
ition of police officers. In the second section of this chapter, therefore, the
organisation and structure of the police is considered. This involves not
only the organisation of individual police forces but the relationship of
forces to police authorities and to the Home Secretary. The police are regu­
lated by a tri-partite system designed by the Police Act 1964. The present
constitutional arrangement is that the police (outside London) are super­
vised by an ill-defined co-ordination of chief constables, police authorities
and the Home Secretary.
   The relationship between police officers can give rise to practical problems
in relation to “vicarious liability." Difficult and unresolved questions arise
concerning the circumstances in which chief constables are liable for the torts
of officers in their force and the precise legal relationship between officers.
These questions are considered in the fourth section of the chapter. In the final
section police ranks, appointment and promotion are briefly discussed.
2. THE CONSTABLE: OFFICE, DUTIES AND
POWERS


Introduction

   From the point of view of most citizens the police appear to be one more
branch of the government. They seem to be a nationally organised, hier­
archical and disciplined body of men, under the ultimate control of the
Home Secretary. In strict law, however, their position is very different.
Although they are public servants in the broadest sense, they have a unique
legal status. A police constable is an officer of the Crown and holds a public
office. He is said to exercise an original discretion in keeping the Queen's
peace which derives from the office of constable and the swearing of the
constable's oath. He is said to be answerable to the law and to the law alone.
   The position of chief constables and the Metropolitan and City of London
Police Commissioners is also unique. The conventional view of their pos­
ition is that they have complete "operational independence" from national
and local government. It is said that the responsibility for maintaining law
and order belongs solely to chief officers and no minister of the Crown or
locally constituted police authority is entitled to interfere with the way in
which they carry out these functions. This doctrine is discussed and criti­
cised in Chapter 13.1
   The roots of the unique constitutional status of the police are to be found
in the gradual evolution of the common law system of part-time, unpaid,
"parish constables" into the modem professional police force. The first
organised "police force" along modem lines was, of course, established in
London by the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829. This force was always
under the ultimate direction of the Home Secretary although the precise
limits of his powers over it have never been clearly established.2 Outside
London, local authorities were empowered to set up police forces by the
Municipal Corporations Act 1835 (in the boroughs] and the County Police
Act 1839 (in the counties). The next century saw the slow development of
the present policing system with the number of police forces declining
(from 237 in 1856 to 43 today), chief constables gradually asserting their
"operational independence" and the Home Office taking on an increasing
range of regulatory and supervisory functions.3The modem policing system
was substantially in place after 1945 and was confirmed and regularised by
the Police Act 1964. Although this legislation clarified the relationships
between police authorities, chief constables and the Home Office4 the basic
"element of policing" is the same as it has been for many centuries: the
common law constable. Despite the increasing numbers of statutory func­
tions given to the constable over the past 150 years, there has been no com­
prehensive statutory definition of his duties. His basic legal status is still
defined by the common law.

The office of constable

  The 1929 Royal Commission5 described the police in the following
terms:
      "The police of this country have never been recognised either in law or
      tradition as distinct from the general body of citizens. Despite the
      imposition of many extraneous duties on the Police by legislation and
      administrative action, the principle remains that a Policeman, in the
      view of the common law is only “a person paid to perform, as a matter
      of duty, acts which if he were so minded he might have done volun­
      tarily.”6
Although these remarks are often quoted they do not recognise crucial dif­
ferences between the common law powers of constables and those of private
citizens. At common law a constable could arrest a person whom he had
"reasonable and probable cause to suspect” was guilty of treason or felony
(both of which at common law were capital offences). Furthermore, the
common law also gave constables, but not ordinary citizens, a range of
powers of entry and search.7
   Although the distinctive role of the individual police constable was recog­
nised by the common law, the police force as an organisation of constables,
was not. Thus, H a ls b u iy ’s Laws of England states that:
      "notwithstanding that the police have numerous statutory powers and
      duties, in essence a police force is neither more or less than a number of
      individual constables whose status derives from the common law,
      organised together in the interests of efficiency.''8
  A member of the police force when carrying out his duties as a constable
acts as an officer of the Crown and a public servant.9 Consequently, as a
public officer, a constable commits a common law offence if he wilfully and
culpably neglects to perform any duty which he is bound to perform (either
at common law or by statute) unless the discharge of the duty would
involve greater danger than a man of ordinary firmness and authority might
expect to encounter.10
  By virtue of the office itself, a constable acts on his own responsibility
when exercising his powers (unless executing a lawfully issued warrant).11
Therefore, although a chief constable commands his force, he cannot give
an officer under his command an order to do acts which can only be lawfully
done if the officer himself forms a suspicion on reasonable grounds.12

Similarly, he cannot divest policemen of their powers of arrest and any
attempt to do so would be unlawful.13
  A distinctive feature of the "office of constable" is the swearing of the
constable's oath. Every constable upon his appointment must be attested as
a constable by making a declaration that he does—
      "solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that . . . (he) will well and
      truly serve Our Sovereign Lady, the Queen, in the office of constable
      without favour or affection malice or ill will; and that . . . (he) will to
      the best of his power cause the peace to be kept and preserved and pre­
      vent all offences against persons and properties of Her Majesty's sub­
      jects; and while . . . [he] will to the best of his skill and knowledge,
      discharge all the duties thereof faithfully according to the law."14
The declaration must be made before the Commissioner or Assistant Com­
missioner of the Metropolis or in any other case, a justice of the peace with
jurisdiction within the police area.13 The Royal Commission on the Police
suggested that the constable's claim to be independent from outside control
is reflected in the terms of the constable's oath.16 However, it is difficult to
see how such a suggestion can be supported by an examination of the words
of the attestation itself.17


The "independence” of the constable

  Lustgarten has suggested that the precise nature of the constable's "orig­
inal authority" and "independence" can be subjected to further analysis.18
He argues that "discretion" plays a central role. Perhaps the most important
aspect of a constable's discretion is whether or not to invoke the criminal
law in the first place.19 Yet, the obvious dangers inherent in selective law
enforcement have not troubled the courts. In A rrow sm ith v. Jenkins20 the
Divisional Court dismissed such a complaint. Lord Parker C.J. said:
      "I think the defendant feels that she is under a grievance because—and
      one may put it this way—she says: 'Why pick on me? There have been
      many meetings in this street from time to time. The police, as on this
      occasion have attended these meetings and assisted to make free pas­
      sage, and there is no evidence that anybody else has ever been pros­
      ecuted. Why pick on me?' That of course has nothing to do with this
      court. The sole question here is whether the defendant has contravened
      [the statute].21"

  It is also entirely within the constable's discretion what particular legal
power he exercises and what particular charge he arrests for, where several
are available to him.
  At the same time the constable works within an organisational hierarchy
which imposes substantial limitations on his "independence." He is subject
to numerous standing orders which he is bound to obey as duly arising out
of the chief constable's power and obligation to control the police force.22
His decision to arrest is reviewed by his superiors who may reject his
charge. It has, therefore, been argued that the only sense in which the police
constable is "independent" is that he alone must assess whether or not the
factual pre-conditions for making an arrest exist.23



The duties of the constable


   The duties of constable derive from his office and have long been thought
to be common law duties. However, in George v. G a r l a n d it was held that
the obligations of a police officer had become statutory duties because they
are now expressed in the form of delegated legislation.25 In any event, the
question of whether the constable's duties are statutory or exist at common
law is irrelevant for the purposes of enforcing them by way of judicial
review.26 The House of Lords made it clear in C.C.S.U. v. M inister for the
Civil Service 27 that judicial review will apply to a power derived from the
common law or the royal prerogative just as much as it does to a statutory
power.
   The primary function of the constable is the preservation of the Queen's
Peace.28 The leading case of Glasbrook Bros. v. Glamorgan C o u n ty Coun­
cil29 concerned the payment of the police by colliery owners during a coal
miners strike. Viscount Cave stated that
        "No doubt there is an absolute and unconditional obligation binding
        the police authorities to take all steps which appear to them necessary
        for keeping the peace, for preventing crime or for protecting property
        from criminal injury."30
  In Rice v. Connolly 31 Lord Parker C.J. described the duties of the police as
follows:
        "it is part of the obligations and duties of a police constable to take all
        steps which appear to him to be necessary for keeping the peace, for

      preventing crime or for protecting property from criminal injury. There
      is no exhaustive definition of the powers and obligations of the police
      but they are at least these and they would further include the duty to
      detect crime and to bring offenders to justice."32
Thus, it is a constable's duty to prevent breaches of the peace that he
reasonably apprehends33 but not to protect an individual against "a mere
apprehension of future crime."34 He is under a general duty to protect life
and property35 and to execute in his area a warrant issued by a justice of the
peace.36
  There is an important discretionary element in these duties. As Sir John
Donaldson M.R. has put it:37
      "There is no doubt about the duty of the Chief and other Constables to
      keep the peace and enforce the law . . . However, Chief Constables
      have the widest possible discretion in their choice of the methods
      whereby they will discharge this duty [R. v. Com m issioner of Police for
      the M etropolis , ex. p. Blackburn [1968] 2 Q.B. 118j."38

Cases such as Glasbrook Bros. v. Glamorgan C ounty Council39 and Rice v.
C onnolly40 express this discretion in subjective terms: a constable must do
what appears to him to be necessary. Nevertheless, it has been established
by a number of important judicial review cases over the past two decades
that, however subjective a discretion is, its exercise is subject to objective
principles. The discretion must be exercised bona fide in accordance with
the law, relevant matters must be taken into account and irrelevant matters
must be excluded.41 furthermore, in the Scottish case of Wilson v. Chief
C onstable of Lothian e) Borders 42 it was held that, in exercising their dis­
cretion, the police owed a duty of care to someone who would, foreseeably,
be affected by its exercise.
  In general, a constable's duties:
      "must be carried out in a fair and even-handed manner. Because his
      resources are finite he will not be able to provide perfect protection for
      all. Even if he has available resources his public duty is not boundless.
      He has a duty to protect against crime or threatened crime, particularly
      threatened violent crime. It is not his public duty to protect against the
      mere apprehension of possible crime. There is no absolute standard of
      duty and no definition of the exact amount of police protection to

      circumstances."43



The nature of police powers


   In order to be able to carry out their various duties in an effective manner
the law gives constables a number of special "powers.” Under these powers
the police are "authorised" to do things which would otherwise be unlaw­
ful. If an ordinary citizen attempted to stop and search people in the street,
to arrest them on suspicion of having committed crimes, or to enter and
search their houses he would usually be liable to civil action. Police powers
provide constables with a defence of "lawful justification" against civil
actions in respect of actions carried out in pursuance of their duties.
   In invoking their powers the police are seeking to justify activity which
is, prima facie, an unlawful interference with another's interests.
   As a general principle of statutory construction, statutes which justify
such activity must be strictly construed against those seeking io reply on
them. To cite the words of Lord Diplock:
      "if the statutory words relied upon as authorising the acts are ambigu­
      ous or obscure, a construction should be placed upon them that is least
      restrictive of individual rights which would otherwise enjoy the protec­
      tion of the common law.”44
The comments of Lord Scarman on the importance of express statutory pro­
vision are also relevant here:
      "it is not the task of judges, exercising their ingenuity in the field of
      implication, to go further in the invasion of private rights and liberties
      than Parliament has expressly authorised. The importance of express
      provision is that it affords the citizen the opportunity, if he chooses to
      use it, to read and understand the extent to which his rights and liber­
      ties have been curtailed."43
  Police powers are of three basic types: common law powers, without war­
rant powers and with warrant powers. Different considerations apply to
defences of "lawful justification" based on different types.

(1) Common l a w powers. Despite increasing trends towards the statutory
codification of police powers the common law position remains of crucial
importance in many cases. This is in part due to parliament's strange reluc­
tance to abolish common law powers, even when enacting statutory powers
covering the same ground. An example of this is the failure of the Police and

Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to abolish common law powers of seizure.46
Police powers at common law have been refined and adapated by judicial
decision over the centuries. The courts continue to play a creative role in
this field. The most recent example being the extension of the M aieva juris­
diction to the police.47 As a matter of general principle such extensions
should be limited in scope because the powers in question represent
invasions of the common law rights of citizens.
   Common law police powers are usually such that they can only be exer­
cised if certain preconditions of fact and belief are fulfilled. Thus a constable
has a common law power to arrest someone whom he sees breaking the
peace or who so conducts himself that he causes a breach of the peace to be
reasonably apprehended. If no breach of the peace has taken place and none
is reasonably apprehended then the constable has no common law power of
arrest and any arrest made will be unlawful.

(2) Without warrant powers. Many of the most important police powers
of arrest, search, entry and seizure are statutory "without warrant" powers.
In other words, they can only be exercised if particular preconditions of fact
or belief laid down by the statute are fulfilled. The majority of such powers
are now to be found in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. If the
preconditions of fact or belief laid down by the Act are not met then an
arrest, search or entry will have been done without "lawful justification"
and an action in tort will lie. It is important to note that the lawfulness of
the exercise of a police power must be justified at the tim e of its exercise, "It
cannot be made lawful or unlawful according to what happens after­
wards."48
   The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 contains a number of "proce­
dural safeguards" in relation to "without warrant" powers. It is submitted
that the proper approach when examining such provisions is as follows:
   (a) It is first necessary to consider whether the police conduct at the tim e
they are obliged to follow a particular provision is prima facie tortious: are
they detaining or searching a person, entering land or holding goods at that
time? If not then no action in tort will lie simply for a breach of the proce­
dural safeguards. A failure to carry out a procedure that must be followed
after the prima facie tortious conduct has occurred will not retrospectively
render otherwise lawful actions unlawful.49 Thus, for example, the police
will not be guilty of false imprisonment solely because they fail to comply
with a duty which arises after the suspect has been subjected to a "stop and
search."30

   (b) If the conduct is prima facie tortious it is necessary to identify the
police power in the Act which "justifies” the conduct and consider whether
the police have acted "in accordance" with it;
   (c) If the police have not acted in accordance with their statutory power it
is necessary to consider whether or not, on a true construction of the stat­
ute, the provision casts a m a n d a to ry d u ty on the police. A procedural safe­
guard which gives the suspect an entitlement but which places the police
under no duty to implement it will not render them liable in tort if they fail
to do so (although an action for breach of statutory duty may lie).31
  (d) If the police were acting in a way which was prima facie tortious and
are in breach of a mandatory duty laid down by the statute then, it is sub­
mitted, they will be deprived of the defence of "lawful justification” and an
action in tort will lie.32
  Under section 66 of the 1984 Act the Secretary of State has a duty to issue
codes of practice in connection with "searches of premises by police offi­
cers” and "the seizure of property found by police officers on persons or
premises.”53 Any breach of the provisions of these codes of practice will
render a police officer liable to disciplinary proceedings.34 But, by section
67(10) a failure of a police officer to comply with any provision of a code
"shall not of itself render him liable to any criminal or civil proceedings."
Nevertheless, it is provided by section 67( 11 ] that
       "In all criminal and civil proceedings any such code shall be admissible
       in evidence,- and if any provision of such a code appears to the court or
       tribunal conducting the proceedings to be relevant to any question aris­
       ing in the proceedings it shall be taken into account in determining that
       question.”
In other words, the provisions of a code can be taken into account in civil
proceedings. They will, it is submitted, be relevant to the "reasonableness"
of police conduct in particular situations. Rather like the Highway Code
they will not be definitive of this but will provide a basic framework within
which reasonableness can be assessed.55

(3) "With warrant” powers. Police arrests, entries, searches and seizures
are often conducted under the authority of a legal authorisation or "war­
rant.”36 A warrant gives the person to whom it is issued lawful authority to
do acts which would otherwise be unlawful. A warrant provides a complete
defence to a civil action in respect of things done "in obedience to it." Even
if a warrant is, in fact, invalid the police will have a statutory defence under
the Constables Protection Act 1750 provided they act "in obedience" to it.37

was because police constables were not "servants" of the watch committee
or the chief constable but independent "officers of the Crown." The pos­
ition was summarised as follows:
      "A constable . . . when acting as a peace officer, is not exercising a dele­
      gated authority, but an original authority, and the general law of agency
      has no application."12
  It is submitted that, on the narrow question of whether police officers are
"servants" of their watch committees or police authority this conclusion
was legally sound.13Nevertheless, it gave rise to considerable practical diffi­
culties as members of the public would bring civil actions against individ­
ual constables who had no right to recompense from public funds against
awards of damages. The practice seems to have been to give financial sup­
port on an ad hoc case by case basis. The use of public funds by the Home
Office to settle a civil action in 1959 gave rise to stormy parliamentary
debates and was one of the factors which led to the setting up of the Royal
Commission on the Police.14
  The Royal Commission recommended that statutory provision be made
for vicarious liability and this was enacted by section 48(1) of the Police Act
1964. This provides that the chief constable of a particular police force (or,
in London, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner ) is vicariously liable—
      "in respect of torts committed by constables under his direction and
      control in the performance or purported performance of their functions
      in like manner as a master is liable in respect of torts committed by his
      servants in the course of their employment."
If the officers committing the tort were being "lent" by one police force to
another under the provisions of section of the Police Act 1964 then, by sec­
tion 14(3) they are deemed to be under the direction and control of the chief
officer to whom they are lent.
   If a chief officer is found to be vicariously liable for a tort committed by a
constable under his direction and control then damages are payable out of
the police fund.13 If an action against a chief officer is settled then the
damages are payable out of the police fund only if the settlement is
approved by the police authority.16
   The provisions of section 48 give rise to a number of potential practical
problems. First, it applies unclear common law provisions to the vicarious
liability of chief constables without dealing with possible differences
between police officers and ordinary employees. Secondly, instead of deem­
ing constables to be servants for all purposes it confines this to actions in
tort. This may give rise to difficulties in questions of vicarious responsi­
bility outside the law of tort. These problems are considered in the next two
sections.

 Vicarious liability and the law of tort

    The effect of section 48 is to fix a chief constable with liability in all situ­
 ations in which a "master is liable in respect of torts committed by his ser­
 vants in the course of his employment." The situations in which a master is
 so liable depend on the very considerable case law in this area. Only the
 briefest of guidelines can be given here.17
    The question to be asked in all vicarious liability cases is whether, at the
 time the tort was committed, the servant was "acting within the scope of
his employment."18 This does not mean that the servant must, in fact, be
 acting in performance of his master's purposes in an authorised way. If a ser­
vant is doing an authorised act then the master will be liable even if it is
 being done in an unauthorised manner.19 If a servant is doing an act which
is expressly forbidden by his master then the master will still be liable if the
prohibition deals with conduct within the sphere of his employment. If, on
the other hand, the prohibition limits the sphere of employment itself then
the master will not be liable in respect of the prohibited acts.20 The com­
mon law position is explicitly recognised in section 48 by the words "in the
purported performance of their functions."
   It is submitted that if a constable is on duty and is bona fide purporting to
carry out policing functions then there is no doubt that his chief constable
will be vicariously liable for any torts committed by him. If, however, a con­
stable is acting so outrageously that it could not possibly be thought that he
was "purporting to perform policing functions" then his chief may be in a
position to deny vicarious liability. Thus, for example, if a police officer
goes shoplifting whilst on duty it is difficult to see how his chief officer
could be vicariously liable for wrongful interference with goods. As in all
such cases liability will depend on all the circumstances of a particular case.
   A difficult which is peculiar to the vicarious liability of police officers
concerns torts committed by "off duty" police officers. In ordinary master
and servant cases there can be no question of vicarious liability if the ser­
vant is not actually working for the master at the time the tort is commit­
ted. The position in relation to the police is less clear.
   Police constables hold office under the Crown and it can be argued that
they continue to have responsibilities of such office whether or not they are
formally on duty. This is a problem which must often arise in practice in
relation to the criminal offence of "assaulting a constable in the execution
of his duty" contrary to section 51(1) of the Police Act 1964: is a person who
assaults an off-duty constable guilty of the offence? Surprisingly enough,
there is no direct authority on this point. The indirect authorities point in
different directions. In the case of M cLoiie v. O xford21 Donaldson L.J. treats
an officer's being on duty as a necessary condition for his acting "in the
execution of his duty."22 On the other hand, the defendant in the case of

A l b e it v. Lavin 23 was convicted of the section 51 offence in relation to an
off-duty police officer. Although the point was not explicitly considered by
either the Divisional Court (which included Donaldson L.J.) or the House of
Lords the conviction was upheld.
  It is submitted that, in strict law, police constables are always on duty.
Thus, a chief constable will be liable for any torts committed by a police
officer "in purported performance of" policing functions whether or not the
officer was on duty for police pay purposes at the time.
  Although there are a number of potential difficulties in this area there is
no reported case in which a chief officer has sought to contend that he was
not vicariously liable for the actions of one of his constables.


Agency and the police

   The case of Fisher v. O ld h a m 14 not only denies that constables are "ser­
vants" of watch committees but goes on to hold that they exercise "original
authority" and are that the "law of agency has no application."23 If this
were correct then it would mean that one police officer, exercising his func­
tions as a "peace officer," could never be regarded as "acting on behalf" of
the chief constable and senior officers who were giving him orders. This
could have some impact on civil actions where questions of police knowl­
edge are at stake.
   It is submitted, however, that police officers must now be regarded as
agents of their chief officer. The contrary dicta in Fisher v. O ld h a m 26 are,
strictly, o biter as the case was directly concerned only with the relationship
of master and servant. In any event, the position has now, arguably, been
altered by the effect of section 5 of the Police Act 1964 which places a police
force under the direction and control of the chief constable. Such direction
and control suggests a subordination of the original authority of individuals
constables to that of the chief constable.27 This contention is supported by
the case of H a w k in s v. Bepey28 in which it was held that a police officer
instituting a prosecution was, in effect, doing so "on behalf of" his chief
constable.
   It is submitted, therefore, that police officers are properly regarded as
agents of chief officers of police. It would follow that the usual principles of
the law of agency apply. In particular, information which is given to a police
officer within the scope of his authority is effective as if it were given to his
principal, the chief officer. Matters which are known by any constable
would therefore, be deemed to be known by the chief officer, and hence by
all officers under his command as his agents.
   The impact of this conclusion in police cases is limited by the fact that
many police powers depend on the state of knowledge of the individual con­
stable concerned. In deciding whether an arrest is lawful the knowledge and
beliefs of the arresting officer (or the officer who supplied the information

for arrest)29 must be considered. A chief officer cannot direct a constable to
make an arrest.30 The lawfulness of continued detention depends on what
was known to the custody officer31 Whenever a statute requires a
con stable to have reasonable grounds then principles of agency will be irrel-

The basis of present day police duties and responsibilities lies in the
requirement of each individual officer to uphold the the fundamental
principles contained in the statutory declaration taken upon enrolment This
is required by Section 18 of the Police Act 1964 and defined by schedule 2
to that Act as follows;


 L— — of.-------- do so/en?n/yands/ncere/y dec/areanda/firm that/ wi/J

according to tiie Mw.M

The composition of this oath indicates a duty to Sovereign, state, people
and custom in accordance with the dictates of the law.


A police officer’s authority, therefore, arises from his having sworn to serve
the Crown and when on duty he acts as an officer of the Crown and a
public servant. His powers are exercised by virtue of his office and on his
own responsibility.
                                      1
 Chief Constables and senior officers are not liable, except under certain
statutes, for the actions of their subordinates and constables are not
employees of police authority or Crown.


This unique position must be considered when looking at the responsibi­
lity of the police collectively or as an organsiation.


The precise constitutional position of the constable is still somewhat
ambiguous and little is written on the subject in government and
constitutional commentaries.


In 1959 a disagreement between the Nottingham Watch Committe and
the Chief Constable led to detailed debate about the constitutional
relationship between police authorities and police acting as law
enforcemnet officers. The Watch Committee dismissed the Chief
Constable but his re-instatment was secured by the Home Office. Their
view was that chief officers of police, as constables at common law,
exercise a discretionary authority in keeping the peace and are not subject
to control or instructions by watch committes whilst performing their
law enforcement function.


The original office of constable was held at common law and later
enlarged by the Statute of Wincester. It is debatable if, at that time, any
independence of action or freedom from control, was envisaged. The
status of constable was subject to variance and by the eighteenth century
had diminished to that of servant of the local Justices.
The supposition of the individuality of the powers of a constable is based
upon an interpretation of statute law which asserts that powers are
conferred on a constable as ” original ” and not ” delegated ” from any
other authority.


This position has not arisen as a result of any judicial enquiry neither is
there any principle in English public law on which it is based.


The only time when the position of the constable has been subject to
judicial review has been in the area of civil liability and in particular the
general rule that there is no master and servant relationship between
constables and their police authorities.


A man took an action against Oldham Corporation after being wrongly
arrested on a warrant.


His case was based on the fact that he considered the defendents were
acting through their watch committee and were the police authority for the
County Borough of Oldham and thus the employers of the police for the
borough.


The mans counsel was unable to cite any English decision in which civil
liability of a police authority for the actions of its constables had been
determined.


Judgement examined the relevant provisions of the Municipal Corporations
Act 1S82 which provided watch committes with the ability to make
regulations to ensure borough constables were efficient in the discharge of
their duties. However, this authority was complicated by the Police Act
1919 which gave the Home Secretary, as central police authority, power to
make regulations as to the government, pay, allowances, conditions of
service etc.
From these considerations and the common law view of the status of a
constable, it was clear that the police were fulfilling their duties as public
servants and officers of the Crown and the corporation were not
answerable in law for their actions. Judgement was given for the
defendents.


ffsfier v O/cIham Corporation f       Ji

The effect of the judgement was to make it plain that the powers of a
police officer, whether conferred by common or statute law, are exercised
by him by virtue of his office and cannot be exercised on the responsibility
of any person but himself.


A number of Royal Commissions, public enquiries etc, have reviewed this
general principle but it remains essentially intact.


Following a Royal Commission in 1960, the Police Act 1964 made Chief
Constables responsible in law for torts committed by his officers.


Further cases have confirmed the independence of the constable and the
position at present can be summarised by words from the judgement in R
v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis ex parte Blackburn ( 1968 ).


” Every constable in the land should be and is independent of the executive.
No minister of the Crown can tell him he must or must not keep
observation on this place or that he must or must not prosecute this person
or that, nor can any police authority tell him to do so. ”
The actual position of the police as an independent authority has never been
stated.


The cases quoted clearly indicate the thoughts of the judiciary but there is
evidence that this position is otherwise regarded by the executive. One such
example is contained within the Customs and Excise Management Act
1979, where customs and excise, being a revenue gathering service of the
government, have power conferred by the legislation to demand police
assistance.


We see then that each invidual within the police has a duty and responsibi­
lity to disharge his duties according to the law and is responsible for his
conduct.


The police as an organisation have a duty to enforce prohibitions created by
the legislature. When a law is passed it will, if required, grant a power to
the police to enable enforcement


Inherent in the power granted is the requirement of its use, and therefore, a
duty or responsibility to use it as circumstances dictate.

Many laws actually require a course of action by the police or chief
constables as with firearms control, immigration or licensing, and no
discretion is available in many instances.
Other laws within the criminal field are intentionally defined vaguely to
give the police discretionary powers. Threatening and abusive words or
behaviour under the Public Order Act or obstrucing free passage along the
highway under the Highways Act are such examples which allow the
police to control a situation using their judgement, they cannot be
understood as acts against which the police are instructed to proceed.


The law and the criminal justice system do not influence the police by
direct means or instructions. They define a set of opportunities and
constraints. The powers conferred by the law are resources that the police
may use in pursuing their objectives.


It may be said that the police have a duty to enforce all laws equally and
not attempt to change the rules by non enforcement of selected legislation.


The legislature may, of course, wish to define limits of conduct and set out
codes of behaviour for the police, such as The Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984, again the police have a duty to obey.


It would be pointless to list all those statutes individually which give
powers and responsibilities to the police, any act dealing with criminal law,
traffic law, control of licensed premises etc will by its very nature
empower the police to act as regulatory body.
VICARIOUS
   &
CORPORATE
 LIABILITY
(7) V icarious liability
   (1) A part from the criminal liability o f corporations, dealt with at §§ 17-11 et
seg ., vicarious liability rarely arises in trials on indictm ent, as it is usually confined
 to sum m ary offences. In som e cases how ever, these can be tried on indictment
 when the defendant has the right o f election.
     Where an offence has been held to be an absolute offence, in that mens rea as
 defined above is not required, “ the person on w h om a duty is thrown is respon.
 sible, w hether he has delegated or whether he has acted through a servant": R. v
 Winson [1969] 1 Q .B . 371, C .A ., {per curiam). See also B a r k e r y . Levinson [1951] 1
 K .B. 342; C. Gabriel L td . v. Enfield Borough Council [1971] C rim .L .R . and contrast
 Reynolds v. Austin and Sons L td . [1951] 1 K .B . 135.
     In Portsea Island M u tu al Co-operative Society Ltd. v. Leyland [1978] Crim L.R. 554,
 the D ivisional Court held that where a milk roundsm an, contrary to his
 em ployers’ orders and w ith ou t their knowledge, em ployed a boy o f 10 to help him
 on his round, the em ployers were not guilty o f an offence under section 21 o f the
 Children and Young Persons A ct 1933. T h e Court held that on the authorities the
 roun dsm an’s employers w ould only be liable i f there w as clear evidence that they
 employed the child or that a servant, for exam ple a personnel m anager, who was
 em ployed to take on staff, em ployed him.
    (2) In the class o f cases, where a duty is thrown on a particular category o f per­
 sons, e.g. licence holders, it has been held that i f that person has delegated his
 responsibilities to another the mens rea o f the delegate will be im puted to the princi­
 pal so as to make the latter criminally liable. T his form o f liability has been termed
 “ vicarious liability.” T h e leading case appears to be Linnett v. Metropolitan Polict
 Commissioner [1946] K .B . 290, D .C . T here a licensee o f a public house was held to
have been rightly convicted o f “ know ingly permitting disorderly conduct" where
he had absented h im se lf from the prem ises and had left control to another man
w ho him self had know ingly permitted the disorderly conduct, though the licensee
defendant w as unaw are o f it.
    Lord Goddard C.J. said: “ T h e point does not, as I say, depend merely on the
fact that the relationship o f master and servant exists; it depends on the fact that
the person w h o is responsible in law as the . . . licensee o f the house has chosen to
delegate his duties, powers and authority to som ebody else . . . . I do not wish it to
be thought that I am saying that where a statute provides that in a n y business a
certain act permitted by the m anager shall be an offence on the part o f the
manager if it is done w ith his knowledge, that if the act takes place whilst the
manager h im se lf is carrying on that business and is in charge o f the business but
without his k now ledge, so that he was pow erless to prevent it, that person necess­
arily com m its the offence. But i f the m anager choose to delegate the e a r n i n g on of
the business to another, w hether or not that other is his servant, then w hat that
other does or w hat he knows m ust be im puted to the person w h o put the other into
that p osition.”
    (3) C onsiderable doubts were cast upon this doctrine o f “ vicarious liability by
delegation ” in Vane v. Yiannopoullos [1965] A.C. 486. H .L . T h e doctrine however
w as reaffirmed and applied by the Court o f A ppeal in R . v. Winson , ante, where Vatu
v. Yiannopoullos was considered. In R. v. Winson the licensee was absent from the
premises, and the know ledge o f the m anager was im puted to the absent licensee.
T h e doctrine was applied in Howker v. Robinson [1973] 1 Q .B . 178, D .C . and
extended to the case where the licensee w as on the premises but had delegated the'
control o f a particular bar to the barman. T h e b arm an ’s know ledge was imputed
to the licensee. It is su b m itted that it is at least doubtful w hether the House of
Lords w ould approve o f any extension o f this doctrine to offences w here it had not
already been applied before the decision in Vane v. Yiannopoullos.
    N oth in g said above affects the liability o f a defendant w h o has counselled, pro­
cured, aided or abetted another to com m it an offence, see p o st , § 2 9 -3 et seq.
(8) O ffen ces by corporations
   (1)    T h e question o f w h ich offences can be charged against corporations is con­
sidered in § 1—29 ante. I t is proposed n ow to consider for w hose acts, intention,
know ledge etc., a corporation is held responsible. T h e authorities are mainly con­
 ce rn ed with limited com panies, but it is subm itted that they wiil appiv to all
  bodies corporate.
     Where absolute or vicarious liability exists the sam e principles apply as to the
 liability o f a personal defendant for the acts o f its servants, or its agents in cases
 s u c h as Linnett v. M etropolitan Police Commissioner, ante.
     (2) A corporation aggregate m ay be indicted, by its corporate nam e, for
 breaches o f public duty, whether in the nature o f nonfeasance or o f misfeasance,
 s u c h as the obstruction o f a highw ay by a railway c om p an y, in a m a n n e r not a u th ­
 orised by their Act o f Parliament: A tt.-G en . v. London & North Western R y. [1900] 1
 Q.B. 78. It would seem , also, that a corporation m ay be indicted by its corporate
 n a m e , and fined, for a libel published by its order. See Pharmaceutical Society v. Lon­
 don & Provincial Supply Association (1880) 5 A pp.C as. 8 57, 870; Triplex Safety Glass
 Co. v. Lancegaye Safety Glass Co. {1934) L td. [1939] 2 K .B . 395.
     (3) Apart from such cases, the principle seem s to be most clearly expressed by
 Lord Diplock in Tesco Supermarkets L td. v. N attrass [1972] A.C. 153 at 199: “T h e
 natural persons w h o are to be treated as being the c o m p a n y for the purpose o f acts
 done in the course o f its business are those natural persons who by the m em o ra n ­
 dum and articles o f association or as a result o f action taken by the directors, or by
 the com pany in general m eeting pursuant to the articles, are entrusted with the
 exercise o f the powers o f the c o m p a n y .”
     (4) In other cases difficult questions have arisen in deciding w hich o f the officers
 or servants o f a corporation are to be identified with it so that their guilt is the guilt
 o f the corporation. It m ust be a question o f law w hether, once the facts have been
 ascertained, a person in doing particular things is to be regarded as the corpor­
 ation or merely as the corporation’s servant or agent. In Bolton {Engineering) Co. v.
 Graham [1957] 1 Q .B . 159, 172, Lord D e n n in g M .R . said: “A c o m p an y m ay in
 many ways be likened to a h um an body. It has a brain and nerve centre w hich
controls what it does. It also has hands w hich hold the tools and act in accordance
 with directions from the centre. S o m e o f the people in the com pany are mere ser­
vants and agents w h o are nothing m ore than hands to d o the work and cannot be
said to represent the m ind or will. O thers are directors and m anagers w ho rep­
 resent the directing m ind and will o f the com pany, an d control w h a t it does. T h e
state o f mind o f these managers is the state o f m ind o f the com pany an d is treated
by the law as su c h .” In Tesco Supermarkets L td. v. N attrass [1972] A .C . 153, Lord
 Reid at p. 171, w hile generally approving the above-m entioned sta te m e n t o f Lord
Denning added: “ T h ere have been attem pts to apply Lord D e n n in g ’s words to all
servants o f a com pany w h ose work is brain work, or w h o exercise so m e m anagerial
discretion under the direction o f superior officers o f the com pany. I do not think
that Lord D en n in g intended to refer to them . H e on ly referred to those w h o rep­
resent the directing m ind and will o f the com p an y an d control w h a t it does. I think
that is right. . . . T h e board o f directors m ay delegate s o m e part o f their functions
of m anagem ent giving to their delegate full discretion to act indepen dently o f
instructions from them . I see no difficulty in holding that they h a v e thereby put
such a delegate in their place so that within the scope o f the delegation he can act
as the com pany. It is not always easy to draw the line, but there are cases in which
the line m ust be d r a w n .” H e cited w ith approval the speech o f Lord H a ld a n e L.C.
in Lennard’s Carrying Co. L td. v. A siatic Petroleum Co. [1915] A .C . 705, 713 and
expressed the view that R . C. H am m ett L td. v. Crabb 95 J .P . 180 a n d R. C. H am mett
Ltd. v. London County Council 97 J .P . 105 and Series v. Poole [1969] 1 Q .B . 676 were
wrongly decided and that in R. v. I. C. R . Haulage L td . [1944] K .B . 551 the prin­
ciples relating to the liability o f a c o m p a n y for its agent had been too w idely stated.
Lord Morris o f Borthy-y-Gest, at p age 180, said that there had been no feature o f
delegation in the case to a store m anager, who did not function as the directing
mind or will o f the com pany, but w as, so to speak, a cog in the m ach in e w hich had
been devised; it w as not left to him to devise it, nor w as he within w h a t had been
called “ the brain area” o f the com pany. Lord Pearson, at page 192, em phasised
that the shop m anager could not be identified with the c o m p a n y ’s ego nor was he
an alter ego o f the com pany, but an e m p loyee in a relatively subordinate post. Lord
Diplock, at page 199, laid dow n the principle set out in (3) ante.
    (5) In R. v. Andrews Weatherfoil L td . and others (1971) 56 C r.A pp.R . 31, in w hich
                                                                                             >4
Tesco Supermarkets L td. v. N attrass , ante , was followed, the C ourt o f A p p e a l stated^
 that it w as not every “ responsible a g e n t” or “ high executive” or “ agent acting orr

responsible, and that it was necessary to establish whether the natural person orV
persons in question had the status and authority which in law m ade their acts in$
the matter under consideration the acts o f the company so that the natural person'-
was to be treated as the com pany itself; and that it was necessary for the j u d g e to;;
invite the jury' to consider w hether or not there were established those facts which./";
the ju d ge decided as a matter o f law were necessary to identify the person con-?*
cerned w ith the com pany.
   (6)      T here is authority for the proposition that a corporation m ay be liable for x
the act o f its servant even though that act w as done in fraud o f the corporation ;
itself. T h u s in Moore v. I. Bresler [1944] 2 All E.R. 515 the subm ission by officers of •
a com pany o f false returns o f goods sold (required for assessm en t o f p u rchase tax)
was held sufficient to render the com p an y liable, although the returns had been^
m ade to conceal from the com p an y the fact that sales in fraud o f the c o m p a n y had .
been m ade. See also R . v. St. M a rg a ret’s Trust Ltd. [1958] 1 W .L .R . 522; 42
C r.A pp.R . 183. T h ese decisions have been the subject o f criticism by writers of
text books and it is doubtful w hether they w ou ld now be followed.                      li

MISFEASANCE IN PUBLIC OFFICE
6. MISFEASANCE IN A PUBLIC OFFICE

Introduction

  A police constable holds a "public office."82 One consequence of this is
that a constable who wilfully neglects to perform his duty is guilty of a
crime at common law.83 It also entails potential civil liability in the ancient
tort of misfeasance in public office.
  The action for misfeasance in public office can be traced back at least to
the eirly eighteenth century. In the famous case of A s h b y v. W hite,84 the
House of Lords upheld an action for damages by an elector who had been
wrongly refused a vote in parliamentary elections. The elements of the tort
were clarified and developed in a number of nineteenth century cases.
Nevertheless, for reasons which are not entirely clear, it appears to have fal­
len into disuse in England for a considerable period85 and the leading text­
books in the law of tort either ignore it entirely or classify it as being
"doubtful."
  Such a view is now plainly untenable. In the Privy Council case of D u n­
lop v. Woollahra M unicipal C ou ncil86 Lord Diplock refers to the "well-
established tort of misfeasance by a public officer in the discharge of his
public duties." In the case of Bouigoin SA v. M in istry of Agriculture87 Mann

J. provided an important and detailed analysis of the tort.88 The existence of
an analogous cause of action in Scotland was confirmed by the case of
M icosta SA v. Shetland Islands Council.89


The elements of the tort

  The precise "elements" of the tort do not appear to have been set out sys­
tematically in any case or textbook. There are, it is submitted, four of them.
The tort is committed when:
       (1)   a public officer;
       (2)   causes damage;
       (3)   to a "foreseeable" plaintiff;
       (4)   by acts or omissions which are a "malicious abuse" of his office.

(1) “A p u b l i c officer. ” This term covers:
      "everyone who is appointed to discharge a public duty, and receives
      compensation in whatever shape, from the crown or otherwise."90
There can be no doubt that a police constable is a "public officer" in this
sense. In Lew is v. C a ttle 91 Lord Hewart C.J. said that "a police officer is a
person who holds office under His Majesty." The point was conceded in R.
v. D y t h a m 92 In the important Australian case of Farrington v. Thom son &>
Bridgland93 a sergeant of police was held to be the holder of a public office.

(2) Damage. This is required because misfeasance is an action on the case.
Any kind of damage will be sufficient, including, it is submitted, not only
financial damage, but loss of liberty or damage to reputation.94

(3) A foreseeable plaintiff. This element involves the issue of limitation
of the class of potential plaintiffs. In many of.the old cases the defendant's
acts were "aimed at " a particular person for malicious reasons. There was,
therefore only one potential plaintiff and no "limitation" issue arose. In the
Bouigoin case it was unsuccessfully argued that "intent to injure the plain­
tiff" ( targeted malice") was an essential ingredient of the tort. It was held
that a plaintiff would be entitled to sue in either of two situations:
       (1) if damage was caused to him by a malicious act which was aimed at
           him;
       (2) if the defendant had deliberately done an act which he knew he did
           not have power to do—with knowledge of its consequences—and
           the plaintiff had suffered damage as a result.95

   6 2 3 - 6 2 4 p e r O liv e r L.J.
On this view, the class of potential plaintiffs would embrace any claimant
who in fact suffers damage, provided that damage was foreseeable. The
"limitation" issue was not expressly considered in the Bourgoin case but
the class of potential plaintiffs seems dangerously large, bearing in mind the
numbers of people who may be affected by the actions of public officers
such as police constables. It could be argued that one possible limiting prin­
ciple would be to confine plaintiffs to the class of those to whom injury
from an unlawful administrative act is reasonably foreseeable. The test
would, then, be the same as in negligence.
   Another possibility was suggested in the Australian case of Tam pion v.
A n d erso n .96 It was held that the plaintiff must show that:
      "he was a member of the public or one of the members of the public to
      whom the holder of the office owed a duty not to commit the particular
      abuse complained of."
Thus, it might be argued that if a police officer stood by and allowed
someone to be injured by attackers (as in the D y th a m case), the person
injured (or, as in D y th a m , his estate or dependants) could sue but, for
example, his employer, could not.
  The whole question of "limitation" of the class of potential plaintiffs to
whom the duty to behave properly in a public office is owed awaits further
judicial clarification.

(4) A ct Ol omission. The fourth element is some act or omission, by the
public officer, which constitutes a "malicious abuse" of his office. It is now
clear that there does not need to be a "positive act" or "misfeasance" to pro­
duce liability. An omission, by which the officer fails to perform a public
duty will be sufficient.97 An important question arises when a police officer
orders someone to do something when he has no power to do so. Is such an
order an "act" for the purposes of this tort? In an Australian case a police
officer ordered a hotel owner to close his hotel, knowing that he had no
power to do so. It was held that this was sufficient to found liability in mis­
feasance.98


Malice

   Malice has always caused the most difficulty in relation to this tort. It has
often been argued that whenever damage is caused by a public officer doing
something beyond his powers an action for damages should lie. This argu­
ment has been rejected in the large majority of cases.99 The position is dif­
ferent, however, if the act is knowingly invalid. There is now no doubt that
in such a case tortious liability will arise. In the Bourgoin case (in an analy­
sis accepted by all the judges in the Court of Appeal)1Mann J. put the point
like this:

96 [1973] V.R. 715 a t 749.
97 See H e n l y ’s case (1828) 5 Bing. 91 a t 107.
98 See F arrington v. T h o m s o n &> B r id g la n d [ 1959] V.R. 2 86 at 293—294.
99 See D u n lo p v. W o o ll^ h r a M u n c ip a l C o u n c il [1982] A .C . 158; a n d T a k a r o Proper­
   tie s v. R o w lin g [1978] 2 N .Z .L .R . 31 4 .

       "There is no sensible distinction between the case where an officer per­
       forms an act which he has no power to perform with the object of injur­
       ing 'A' (which the defendant accepts is actionable at the instance of 'A')
       and the case where an officer performs an act which he knows he has no
       power to perform with the object of conferring a benefit on 'B' but
       which has the foreseeable and actual consequence of injury to 'A'."2
Thus, a "misfeasance" or "malicious abuse" is committed by the police in
one of two circumstances:
        (1) where a police officer does something for a "malicious motive"
            which causes damage to the plaintiff;
        (2) where damage is caused by a police officer "knowingly" doing
            something which he has no power to do.

(1) Improper motives. The first alternative requires "malice." As in mali­
cious prosecution cases "malice" does not simply mean "ill will" or spite.
As Lord Campbell C.J. said to the jury in Tozer v. C h ild (a direction upheld
by the Court of the Queen's Bench}
       "malice might be proved, not only by evidence of personal hostility or
       spite, but by any evidence of any other corrupt or improper motive."3
Any "wrongful motive" will, therefore, be sufficient "malice" for these pur­
poses. Thus, it will be a "malicious abuse of office" for a police officer to
request a person to wait for him at a police station in a deliberate attempt to
harm his business or to relieve him of the burden of conducting immediate
inquiries to enable him to go home early. The latter motive is a "wrongful"
one in law, even though no spite or hostility are involved.
  If the actions of a police officer are "malicious" in this extended sense
they do not have to be ultra vires his powers to attract liability.4 In other
words, there will be liability in damages for any loss caused by police acts or
omissions based on wrongful motives. Thus a police officer who lawfully
seizes goods which he has reasonable grounds for believing are evidence of
an offence which it is necessary to seize to prevent them being concealed
will be liable for misfeasance if his motive in seizing the goods is not the
collection of evidence but some wrongful motive such as causing damage to
the owner's business. Despite the lawfulness of his acts he will be liable
because of the maliciousness of his motive.
  The mere presence of a wrongful motive is not, in itself, sufficient to
found liability. Such a motive must be determinative of the act or omission
in question. The criminal case of R. v. Llewellyn-Jones ,3 provides useful
guidance here. The case involved a County Court Registrar who was
accused of making an order in relation to funds under his control "in the
expectation that he would gain personal advantage from the making of such
an order." The trial judge ruled that:
       "if the registrar of a county court when exercising his power to order
       payment out of court of money held on behalf of a beneficiary were to
       make an order in expectation of some personal benefit he hoped to

        misconduct in a public duty . . . but I would not be prepared to say that
        it would be misconduct for this purpose for a registrar to make a
        decision which did affect his personal interests, merely because he
        knew that his interests were so involved, if the decision was made
        honestly and in a genuine belief that it was a proper exercise of his juris­
        diction."6

 (2) Knowing invalidity. The second alternative way that a police officer
 can "abuse" his office is by doing something which he knows he has no
power to do. Thus the unlawfulness of his actions is a necessary precondi­
 tion to liability. Under this second alternative motive is entirely irrelevant.
He may act out of the best of motives but, if he knows that he has no power
to act in that way then he will be liable in tort for damage caused.7It is clear
that "actual knowledge" of invalidity is necessary. "Constructive knowl­
edge" will not be enough.
    The most famous of all recent misfeasance cases was under this second
head. It concerned an order given by the prime minister and attorney-
general of Quebec to a liquor licensing authority. He ordered the cancel­
lation of the plaintiff's restaurant licence because the plaintiff had stood
bail for various Jehovah's Witnesses who were at that time responsible for
serious public order problems in Quebec. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court
of Canada found that the defendant had abused his office and awarded the
plaintiff damages of $33,123.8
    An important example is the case of Farrington v. Thom son &) Bridg-
la n d .9 The plaintiff was the licensee of a hotel which the police ordered him
to close down because they believed his licence to be forfeit. It was estab­
lished that the police, in giving such orders were "intentionally purporting
to exercise a power to give binding orders to the plaintiff which they were
fully aware, at the time, that they did not possess."10 It was held that this
was sufficient to found a misfeasance action. Smith J. also decided that the
fact that the plaintiff had obeyed the order was not sufficient to make the
resultant damage too remote.11


Applicability to police cases

   The tort of misfeasance in public office is, it is submitted, a well-estab­
lished cause of action which is plainly applicable to the police. In many
situations it will overlap with established torts. Thus if a police officer
arrests a plaintiff knowing that he has, in fact, no power to do so he will be
liable in false imprisonment as well as misfeasance. Given the fact that the
burden of justifying false imprisonment is on the police the former would
obviously be the simplest cause of action to pursue.

   Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which misfeasance may be the
only available cause of action. Thus if a constable makes a lawful arrest
with a malicious motive an action in false imprisonment will not be avail­
able but there will be a cause of action in misfeasance. To take another
example, if the police give a person orders which they know they have no
power to give and the person obeys and as a result suffers loss then there
will be no action in trespass. There will, however, be an action in misfea­
sance as Farrington’s case illustrates.
   It would seem that if a police officer brings a prosecution against someone
with a malicious motive but with reasonable and probable cause then, if the
prosecution terminates in that person's favour, an action for misfeasance
will lie.
   If a person is caused damage by a police policy decision which is known to
be ultra vires then damages can be recovered in misfeasance. If a policeman
knowingly or maliciously neglects to carry out his duties then an action
may be brought. In R. v. D y th a m ,12 the police constable was accused of
"wilfully omitting to take any steps to preserve the Queen's peace or to pro­
tect the person" of a man he saw being attacked. The man died and the con­
stable was convicted of the offence of wilful neglect of his duty. It is
submitted that the deceased's estate could have recovered damages in mis­
feasance.

BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY
3. BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY

Introduction

  The police have a large number of specific statutory duties under legis­
lation such as the Police Act 1964 and the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984. It has been held that the general duties of the police as constables
are now "statutory duties."90
   In line with general tort principles it is possible that a breach of some of
these duties may give rise to an action in damages for "breach of statutory
duty." In particular, such an action may be the only possible remedy for a
lawfully arrested and detained suspect who is denied his rights under Part
IV of the 1984 Act.91

 The right of action


    An action for breach of statutory duty will only lie if the statute is one
 which in fact confers a right of action for damages. This is, fundamentally, a
 question of policy: should the breach of a particular statutory provision be
 compensated in damages? The court must consider whether or not the stat­
 ute in question intended to give a right of action in tort.92 There are "indica­
 tions which point with more or less force to the one answer or the other."93
    The first "indication" is whether there is, in the statute, an alternative
 method of enforcing compliance or penalising non-compliance.94 The
 absence of any other sanction creates a presumption that there is an action
for breach of the statute.95
    The second "indication" is whether or not the duty is imposed for the
benefit of a particular class of persons.96If the duty was imposed to benefit a
particular class an action is more likely to lie.
    The third "indication" which may point to the absence of a right of action
is a lack of precision in the definition of the statutory right which it is
sought to enforce.97
    When a statute casts duties on a public authority such as the police, diffi­
cult questions arise as to which of the duties are "public law" ones and
which give rise to "private rights." A distinction has been drawn between
"decision-making" functions, which are a matter of public law, and "execu­
tive" functions which may give rise to private law rights and obligations.98
If the public authority makes an "unlawful" decision—because the proper
procedures were not followed, because an incorrect view of the law was
applied or for general W edn esbu ry reasons99 this must be challenged by the
"judicial review" procedure. No action for breach of statutory duty can
arise. Once the decision has been made, however, private law rights do arise
and may be enforced by an action for breach of statutory duty—provided
that, on a true construction of the statute, such an action is available. The
precise limits of this distinction remain to be worked out. The mere fact
that "public law" questions arise concurrently to a "private law" right of
action will not prevent a plaintiff from bringing an action for breach of
statutory duty.99a

The elements of the tort

  Even if it can be established that the statute is one which confers a right
of action, three other things must be established in order for a plaintiff to be
entitled to recover damages for breach of statutory duty:

(1) The duty must be owed to the p l a i n t i f f There is unlikely to be any
difficulty in cases brought by suspects for breaches of duty under the Police
and Criminal and Evidence Act 1984. This requirement may, however,
cause considerable problems if a plaintiff seeks to base an action upon
general duties cast upon the police by statutes such as the Police Act 1964.

(2) The defendant m ust be in breach of the statutory duty. This a
question of fact and, of course, depends on the precise wording of the rel­
evant statutory provisions. The burden of proof will be on the plaintiff.

(3) The harm m ust be of the kind that the statute was designed to
preventr Difficulties under this head are unlikely to arise in actions for
breach of statutory duty under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
as the statute is designed to prevent damage of all kinds to people who are
suspected of offences.
  Although an action for breach of statutory duty is an action on the case3it
is not always necessary to prove damage as part of the cause of action.
Whether or not damage is a necessary ingredient of the cause of action has
been said to depend on the construction of the statute involved. Thus:
     "Where, from its context, it is clear that the statute created alright in
     the plaintiff so absolute in its content that the plaintiff was to be pro­
     tected against violation, even though it caused no damage, then the tort
     is actionable per se."4
The following rights have been held to give rise to a breach actionable per
se: the statutory right to vote,3 the right to receive a statement of how
wages were made up,6 a person's right to have his suitability for a living as a
minister of religion determined.7 A person's rights under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 should be actionable per se as the interests
protected by the statute—interests in receiving information and assistance
while under police investigation—do not usually generate "special damage7'
if they are violated. As Street says:
     ''The courts are most likely to interpret in this manner a statute which
     protects an interest of the plaintiff other than his interest in his person
     or his goods.''8

Applicability to police cases

   The availability of this cause of action to police cases depends on the par­
ticular statutory provision which is being relied upon. The Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 gives rise to a number of rights to information
and assistance. No remedies for breach of these provisions is provided by
the statute. It should be noted that by section 67(10) it is expressly provided
that a failure to comply with any provisions of the Codes of Practice issued
under section 66 "shall not of itself render him liable to any . . . civil pro­
ceedings.” The only liability that this section can be seeking to exclude is
that for breach of statutory duty. It is significant that the statute does not
seek to exclude liability for breach of the provisions of the Act itself, as
opposed to the Codes. So, an action for breach of statutory duty must then
lie if the police fail to comply with the "information and assistance" pro­
visions of the 1984 Act. The following sections would appear to give rise to
potential actions:

(1) Section 56: Right to have someone informed when arrested. This
section provides that:
     “Where a person has been arrested and is being held in custody in a
     police station or other premises, he shall be entitled, if he so requests,
     to have one friend or relative or other person who is known to him or
     who is likely to take an interest in his welfare told, as soon as is practi­
     cable except to the extent that delay is permitted by this section, that
     he has been arrested and is being detained there."9
The section permits delay only in the case of serious arrestable offences10 if
it is authorised by an officer of at least the rank of superintendent.11 Delay
may only be authorised where there are reasonable grounds for believing
that12 telling the named person of the arrest:
    "(a) will lead to interference with or harm to evidence connected with a
    serious arrestable offence or interference with or physical injury to
    other persons; or
    (b) will lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having com­
    mitted such an offence but not yet arrested for it, or
    (c) will hinder the recovery of any property obtained as a result of such
    an offence."13
If a delay is authorised the detained person must be told the reason for it and
the reason should be noted on his custody record as soon as is practicable.14
Once the reason for authorising delay ceases to exist there may be no
further delay in permitting the exercise of the right.15 Similar consider­
ations apply to the duty to inform the "person responsible for the welfare"
of a child or a young person that he is in police detention under section 57.

13 s.56(5].
14 s.56(6] and (7],
15 s.56(9].
(2) Section 58: Access to legal advice. This section provides that:
      "(1) A person arrested and held in custody in a police station or other
      premises shall be entitled, if he so requests, to consult a solicitor
      privately at any time . . .
      (4) If a person makes such a request, he must be permitted to consult a
      solicitor as soon as is practicable except to the extent that delay is per­
      mitted by this section."
The section permits delay only where the person is in detention for a
serious arrestable offence and the delay is authorised by an officer of at least
the rank of superintendent.16 Such delay may only be authorised where the
officer has reasonable grounds for believing17that the exercise of the right at
the time the person desires to exercise it:
      "(a) will lead to interference with or harm to evidence connected with a
      serious arrestable offence or interference with or physical injury to
      other persons,- or
      (b) will lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having com­
      mitted such an offence but not yet arrested for it; or
      (c) will hinder the recovery of any property obtained as a result of such
      an offence."
If a delay is authorised the detained person must be told the reason for it and
the reason must be noted on his custody record.18 Special provisions apply
to persons detained under the terrorism provisions.19 It is difficult to see
how, in the large majority of cases, a private consultation with a solicitor
could lead to the results which would justify the delay.

(3) Section 21: Rights to access and copies. The section gives the per­
son who had custody or control of something seized by the police the right
to apply for access to it20 or the right to obtain photographs or copies.21This
right is subject to a number of statutory limitations.22
   The "indications" point towards there being a right of action against the
police for breach of the provisions of all these sections. The only remedy
provided by the Act for breach is disciplinary action against the officers
involved. This does not give any right to damages to the person deprived of
his statutory entitlement. The sections are designed to protect specific
classes of people, namely, those in police custody or whose property has
been seized. Finally, the duties under all the sections are defined with preci­
sion. It is further submitted that breaches of sections 56, 57 or 58 will be
actionable per se.23
   It would follow that a detainedpersonwho wasdenied hisrights under
section 56 or section 58 will have rights ofaction againstthe police for
breach of statutory duty. His damages for this breach would be "at large"24

and he would also have a potential claim for aggravated and exemplary
damages. Furthermore, any "reasonably foreseeable'7special damages could
also be recovered. A person who was denied access to property held by the
police or copies of documents would also have a right of action for breach of
statutory duty under section 31.
  In an unreported case23 two firms of solicitors applied for injunctions to
restrain the police from breaching their statutory duty in refusing to allow
them access to clients held'in police custody. Rose J. refused the application
saying:
    "I am not persuaded that I have jurisdiction. Assuming I did have juris­
    diction were I to make the Order sought it would be unreasonable, a
    hindrance to police inquiries may be caused."
It is submitted that there was, in fact, no jurisdiction to make the order as
the proper plaintiffs were not the solicitors but the prisoners who, in the
nature of the case, could not give instructions to make the application. The
prisoner would, however, have an action for damages after his release. It is
further submitted that in such a situation the solicitors would have locus to
apply for an order of mandamus to compel the police to discharge their
statutory duties under section 58.26

                                           § 16.1.              KILLING IN HOMICIDE

T    common law definition of murder, and similarly that of manslaughter,
    he

requires that the defendant should have "killed" his victim, and that the
death should follow within a year and a day (§ 11.1).
   A ‘‘killing" can take place by any means. There need be no direct
physical act. If the victim asks his way on a dark night, and the defendant,
intending to cause his death, directs him to a path that he knows will bring
him to the cliff edge, and the victim suffers a fatal fall, this is clearly
murder, though the defendant has done nothing more than utter words. So
we may say that “killing" means conduct causing death in any way that the
law regards as sufficient.1What these ways are has to be considered.

W hat of accelerating the victim’s death?
  This is a “killing" in law. Since we are all fated to die at some time, every
instance of killing is an instance of accelerating death: and even if death is
hastened by as little as five minutes it is still a criminal homicide. So it is
no defence to a person who stabs another to death to show that the victim
was already dangerously ill.2 All the same, as we shall see. there are some
cases where the courts will ignore minimal causation (§ .5).

Why require that the death must follow within a year and a day?
   In origin the rule was perhaps dictated by the desire to limit difficult
problems of causation.3 The CLRC proposed the continuation of the rule
on the ground that it would be wrong for a person to remain at risk of a
charge of homicide for a long time.4 He may have been convicted and
sentenced for causing serious injury: if the victim then dies from the injury,
it would be undesirable to have a fresh trial for murder.

Do problems of causation arise only in homicide cases?
  These are the most important in practice, but a causal question is
capable of arising in other offences, particularly those against the person

or property. For example, the offence under section 18 of the Offences
aeainst the Person Act is of causing grievous bodily harm. The wording of
sections 20 and 47 is different: the one speaks of inflicting grievous bodily
harm and the other of occasioning actual bodily harm, but these verbs,
also, imply a requirement of causation.
   Similarly, the offences under the Criminal Damage Act 1971 imply that
the act of the defendant has caused the damage.
   The notion of causation may also appear in general penal legislation,
where the context may give the word a special meaning. ‘‘Causing”
something to be done sometimes bears the narrow meaning of giving an
order or direction to do it.5


                                            § 16.2.             BUT-FOR CAUSATION
An important distinction must be taken. The question of causation, as it is
generally used in the law. involves both a problem of causation sine qua
non. and a problem of imputabilitv.1
  A convenient English equivalent of the term causation sine qua non is
but-for causation (properly speaking, but-for . . . not causation). For a
factor to be a but-for cause, one must be able to say that but for the
occurrence of the antecedent factor the event would n o t have happened.
Surely the notion of but-for causation is ridiculously wide, because it takes
us back to Adam and Eve. The criminal’s mother is a but-for cause of his
crimes, and so is his grandmother, and all his ancestors to infinity.
   That is perfectly true, but two factors limit the judicial enquiry. First,
one starts with the defendant who is charged: his mother does not come
into it, much less Adam and Eve. Secondly, but-for causation is only half
the story; the defendant who was the but-for cause of the harm is not
responsible unless his conduct was also the im putable cause. We still have
to deal w'ith imputable causation.
Is the notion of but-for cause a useful one? Where the cause is a positive act,
isn’t it too obvious to be worth stating? If D shoots V and V drops down
dead, surely you don’t have to prove that the bullet entering V’s heart
caused him to die?
   When but-for causation is obvious (as it usually is), it is not discussed.
Certainly the answer to your last question is in the negative. But
occasionally an issue of this kind may require expert assistance.
         D may administer poison to V. who may die shortly afterwards, yet an
         autopsy may reveal that V died not of the poison but of heart disease.
         There will then be medical evidence at D ’s trial to the effect that the
         poison did not cause the death, meaning that V would in any case have
         died at the time and in the way he did, and that the poison did not play
         any contributory part. If the jury believe this evidence, or, rather, if

           they are not sure that it is untrue, they must acquit of murder— though
           D may, of course, be convicted of the attempt.
   We may summarise, then, by saying that but-for causation is of legal
interest only in the comparatively rare cases where, notwithstanding
appearances, it is absent; that when it is alleged to be absent, this raises a
question of fact for the jury, who may decide by ordinary experience but
may have to be assisted by expert evidence; and that the burden is on the
Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant’s act (or
omission) was a but-for cause.2
   The last point occasions some difficulty in respect of expert evidence, because an expert
may not be willing to commit himself to more than the statem ent that the result would
■■probably" not have happ ened as it did apart from the defendant's act or omission.
Notwithstanding that the expert will not commit himself to more, the jury (somewhat
strangely) are entitled to draw a sure inference of causation from the evidence.3 Nevertheless,
they should be reminded that they themselves must be sure: and the hesitation or reserve of
the expert should surely be a factor leading the appeal court to scrutinise a conviction with
care.

The courts assume in manslaughter cases like Stone (§ 12.3) that an
omission can be a cause. But surely a non-event cannot be a but-for cause
of an event.
   Whatever the philosophical view may be, the courts certainly assume,
and must assume, that an omission can be a cause (just as lack of oxygen
or food is commonly regarded as a cause of death).4 (However, a court
can, and should, say that a reference to causation in a statute does not
cover omissions, in the absence of express words or necessary implication:
§ 7.3 n. 10). That is not a rule of causation but a question of the legal
import of words.
   The application of the usual burden of proof to the issue of causation is
of considerable importance in cases of omission, and sometimes gives the
court the opportunity of arriving at a merciful conclusion.5 On any charge
involving causation by omission it behoves the defence to go into the
evidence of causation most carefully.

W hat about two but-for causes contributed by different defendants? Doesn’t
your definition imply the paradox that if two persons independently cause
an event, neither causes it?
  To provide for this, an exception for cases of multiple causation has to
be inserted into the definition. It is possible for two sufficient causes, Cl
and C2, to be present together, so that E follows both, when usually it

the particular situation one or other (as the case may be) was not necessary
to be present. An example is where two fatal wounds are given
independently at the same time. See more in § .9.

Suppose that D l ’s shot entered the lung and would have caused the victim’s
death in an hour, but D2’s entered the heart and killed him instantaneously?
   Then, of course, only D2 has killed him. D1 is guilty of an attempt.
  The but-for cause is sometimes referred to as the factual cause, or the de
facto cause, or the scientific cause. The important thing is to distinguish it
from cause in another sense, the "imputable” (or “legal” or “effective” or
"direct" or “proximate”) cause, to which we now turn.




                       § 16.3.     IMPUTABLE CAUSATION

When causation is in issue, the defendant’s act (or omission) must be
shown to be not only a but-for cause but also an imputable or legal cause
of the consequence. Imputable causes are some of the but-for causes. In
other words, the defendant’s act, being a but-for cause, must be sufficiently
closely connected with the consequence to involve him in responsibility.
The lawyer is interested in the causal parentage of events, not in their
causal ancestry. The Model Penal Code expresses the principle by stating
that a person is not criminally responsible for a result if it is “too remote
and accidental in its occurrence to have a just bearing on the actor's
liability or on the gravity of his offence.”1
   Several attempts have been made to find a suitable nam e for this second notion of cause.
To call it the "dire ct” or "p ro x im a te " cause (as is often done) is misleading, because several
stages may intervene between the so-called direct cause and the effect. D may send poisoned
chocolates to V, who lives at the other side of the world: if V eats the chocolates and dies,
the law will certainly regard D as responsible for the death, though his act was far removed
>n space and considerably removed in time from its effect. T o call D's act the “ effective" cause
is unhelpful, because every cause must by definition be effective— if an act is not effective to
produce a given result, it is not a cause of it.
   Sometimes (looking at the situation backwards instead of forwards) im putable causation is
'tated in terms of "rem oteness of consequence.” To say that a particular consequence is “ too
remote" is only another way of saying that the defendant's act (or omission) is not an
imputable cause.
   Going back to the formulation in the Model Penal Code, the use of the word “just"
indicates the true nature of the problem . When one has settled the question of but-for
causation, the further test to be applied to the but-for cause in order to qualify it for legal
recognition is not a test of causation but a moral reaction. The question is w hether the result
"dn fairly be said to be imputable to the defendant. Sometimes the question of fairness is
'-ctiled by rules of law, sometimes it is left for impressionistic decision in the individual case.
    the term "cause” must be used, it can best be distinguished in this meaning as the
  ■rnputable" or "responsible" or " b lam a b le " cause, to indicate the value-judgment involved.
 The word “ im putable” is here chosen as best representing the idea. Whereas the but-for cause
 can generally be dem onstrated scientifically.2 no experiment can be devised to show that one
 of a num ber of concurring but-for causes is more substantial or im portant that an other, or that
 one person who is involved in the causal chain is more blameworthy than a n o t h e r .■'


 W hat are the principles governing imputable causation?
    Hitherto the judges have made little progress in establishing such
 principles. Generally, of course, no problem arises. Where causation is
 obvious, the judge may give no direction upon it. even in a homicide case,
 and even though the burden of proof of causation is supposed to rest on
 the prosecution. “In homicide cases." said Robert Goff LJ, “it is rarely
 necessary to give the jury any direction on causation as such."4 Even when
a direction is given, it is usually in very general terms, without so much as
distinguishing between factual and legal causation. The judge will use one
of the adjectives already mentioned, telling the jury that the defendant’s
act must have been the “efficient” or “direct” or “proximate” or
“substantial” cause of the result, or something beyond a trivial cause, or
that the result must not have been too “remote” Or he may tell them that
in law the defendant’s act need not be the sole cause, or even the main
cause, of the result, it being enough that the act contributed “significantly”
to that result.5 This is good enough if the defendant's act was clearly an
imputable cause, and it may be good enough in cases where no precise rule
can be formulated. It is unsatisfactory in some of the cases to be discussed
in this chapter, where the proper result may seem doubtful to the layman
and a vague direction may produce discordant verdicts which could have
been avoided if more specific guidance had been given.
   The direction to the jury should distinguish, where necessary, between
the two kinds of causation, and the jury should be informed with some
precision of any rules of law that are involved. If the issue is one of but-for
causation, it should be enough to ask the jury whether the defendant’s act
(or omission) was a cause of what happened, explaining that this means:
would the event have happened in any case? There is no need to talk about
“substantiality.”6 But if the issue is whether the alleged cause was an
imputable cause, and if the proper view is that for some specific reason the
alleged cause was not or may not have been an imputable cause in law, it
should be a misdirection to instruct the jury no more fully than this.7

    This was the practice during the 19th century. Courts would robustly tell
  the jury whether or not the defendant was responsible for the conse­
  quences on given facts. There are now indications that the judges will again
  do this, if the facts are sufficiently strong.
            In Pagetts the defendant was a gunman who shot at armed police,
            using a girl as a shield. The police returned his fire in self-defence, and
            accidentally killed the girl. Pagett, charged with the murder of the girl,
            was acquitted by the jury of murder but convicted of manslaughter,9
            and his appeal against conviction was dismissed.

    The case will be discussed later as an application of the principles of
 causation. At present we are concerned with it only as an instance of the
 judge's function. On the question of causation the trial judge had directed
 the jury that it was for him to decide as a matter of law whether the
 defendant caused the death. On this the Court of Appeal commented: “No
 legitimate criticism can be made of the judge's direction. Strictly speaking
 it was for him to direct the jury on the applicable principles of law\ leaving
 it for them to decide as a question of fact, on those applicable principles,
 whether the necessary causal link had been established. In practical terms
 that was precisely what the judge did.’’
    The first of these sentences seems to deny criticism of the judge, while
 the second sentence seems to express some faint criticism. Perhaps the
 court means that it is best for the judge not to say frankly that the causation
 question is for him, but that all the same he may instruct the jury in such
 terms that where the facts are clear they have no causation issue to decide.
 There is no virtue in such hair-splitting.
    The theoretical problem may be clarified if we distinguish between cases
 where there is and is not a relevant rule of law on the subject of imputable
 causation. If no satisfactory rule can be formulated, and it is a matter of
  'gut reaction,” the proper verdict on the point being subject to legitimate
doubt, the jury can be told that they must decide whether in fairness the
result should be attributed to the defendant. (The direction is
unnnecessary if it obviously is imputable to him.) If a rule can be
formulated, which ought to govern all similar situations (which was the
case in Pagett). the judge should be entitled to announce it firmly to the
jury, and where necessary to exclude irrelevant evidence.
    The last proposition is supported by another recent case, M a lc h e re k ,10
where the control of the trial judge was emphasised.

          trial judge refused to leave the issue of causation to the jury, and D
          was convicted. On appeal the defence sought to introduce evidence to
          suggest that the doctor had switched the machine off prematurely, but
          the court refused to hear the evidence. In such circumstances, the
          court declared, where a doctor decides "that the patient is for practical
          purposes dead,’’ and switches off. this does not in law prevent the
          assailant from being responsible.

   Granted, then, that rules of imputable causation are rules of law, we
must consider what these rules are. Subject to what is to be said in § .9 as
to the new intervening act, no problem generally arises when the defendant
has intentionally produced the consequence.11 The chief difficulties relate
to unintended consequences. It may be suggested that five rules are
supported either by authority or by common sense:

—      the rule that negligence must be relevant (§ .4);
—      the minimal causation principle (§ .5);
—      the ordinary hazard principle (§ .7);
—      the reasonable foresigh.t principle (§ .8); and
—      the principle of the new intervening act (§ .9).



                             § 16.4.           CAUSATION AND NEGLIGENCE

Where negligence (or recklessness) is in issue, a limiting rule straddles the
divide between but-for and imputable causation. The rule is that the
negligence proved against the defendant must be negligence in a relevant
respect. The case must be such that the accident would not have happened
if he had not been negligent. In other words, the defendant is not liable for
an event that is not causally connected with the feature of his conduct that
was negligent. The rule has some applicaton to manslaughter and causing
death by reckless driving.
         An illustration in the reports is D a l l o w a y } The driver of a horse and
         cart let the reins lie loose on the horse's back. This was of course a
         negligent way of driving. A child ran across the road, and was knocked
         down and killed. Erie J directed the jury that if the driver by using the
         reins could have saved the child he was guilty of manslaughter, but
         that if they thought he could not have saved the child by pulling the
         reins they must acquit him.
            In other words, the question was this. Assuming that the defendant
         had been driving carefully, holding the reins, would the death have
         occurred? A defendant is not guilty of causing a death by negligence
         if the victim ran out at a moment when no one—not even a person
         who had been behaving carefully throughout—could have pulled up.

     In Dalloway there was an element of but-for causation connecting the defendant's driving
with the death of the child. H ad Dalloway not been travelling in his vehicle at that time and
that spot, his vehicle would not have hit the child. Moreover, he was negligent, perhaps
c r o s s l v negligent. But it was also necessary to show (on a charge of manslaughter) that the
death was causally connected with the negligent failure to hold the reins.




                   § 16.5.             THE DEFENCE OF M INIM AL CAUSATION
Of the assorted adjectives mentioned in § .3, “substantial" currently finds
the greatest favour; and if this word is used in instructing the jury a
conviction is pretty safe from being upset on appeal. However, the Court
of Appeal regards it as being too favourable to the defendant.1 The
preferred direction is to tell the jury that they can convict the defendant if
his conduct (for example, his reckless driving) was “a cause” of the death,
being something more than a purely trivial cause (a de m inim is
contribution, as it is ungrammatically termed). The reference to “a cause”
is presumably to but-for causation, while the reference to minimal
contribution seems to express the idea that imputable causation is lacking.
This direction at least gives the jury some pointer to the fact that they are
entitled to use common sense (or moral instinct) on questions of causation.
   It may have been a notion of minimal causation that was in the mind of
Devlin J in A d a m s r As we have seen (§ .1), the acceleration of death is
supposed to be enough for criminal liability, so that the defendant is not
normally allowed to say that the victim would in any event have died
before long. But in A d a m s Devlin J directed the jury that when health
cannot be restored a doctor “is still entitled to do all that is proper and
necessary to relieve pain and suffering even if measures he takes may
incidentally shorten life." The passage as a whole seems to imply the view
that what the doctor does by way of approved medical practice is not a
cause in law. It plays such a minor part in causing the death that it can be
excluded from consideration. A more satisfactory reason would be the
doctrine of necessity, at which Devlin J perhaps glanced in his use of the
word “necessary.'0 But we may applaud his attitude without enquiring too
closely into its legal basis.



                                       § 16.6.            THE UNEXPECTED TWIST
Most problems of causation relate to what may be called the unexpected
twist, which is to occupy the rest of this chapter. Subject to what is to be
said later, an unexpected twist in the 'outcome of conduct does not

  necessarily put the end result outside the mental element, or mean that the
' conduct is not the imputable cause of the result.
           For example, D attacks V intending to stab him in the arm. but V
           jumps back, falls and cracks his head. Assuming that both the harm
           intended and that suffered are grievous bodily harm, there is no
           difficulty from the point of view either of m ens rea or of causation in
           convicting D of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, under
           section 18 of the OAPA. The legal category is “grievous bodily
           harm.” and it does not matter that the defendant intended one form
           and did another.1
    Such facts are very similar to transferred intention, except that here the
 intention takes effect upon the person intended, and the only variation is
 in respect of the way in which it takes effect or in respect of the precise
 description of the injury. The unexpected twist principle does not supplant
 the primary requirement of a mental element for the particular crime. In
 a crime of intention, the ultimate result must be as intended by the
 defendant2; but the mode by which the intended result occurred need not
 have been intended.0
   W h e re, as in the case of criminal dam age, the offence is defined in broad term s so that it
 covers a great variety of causal nexus, the unexpected twist principle can have unwelcome
 results, particularly in making the d efendant subject to conviction for doing much greater
 dam age than he expected. T he solution here would be to sentence on the basis o f what was
 within the range of what the defendant must have foreseen.
   A problem of justice can also arise w here the defendant is still at an early stage in his effort
 to commit the crime when events are. so to speak, taken out of his hands. Professor Smith
 suggests that the defendant can be liable for the result if he had reached the stage of attem pt,
 but otherwise n ot.4 H e puts two hvpotheticals.

         D prepares a poisoned apple with the intention of giving it to his wife. V'. to eat
         tomorrow. V finds the poisoned apple today, eats it and dies. O r D is cleaning his gun
         with the intention of shooting V tom orrow. T he gun goes off accidentally and kills V.

   It would obviously be too harsh to convict D of m u rd er in the second case: his liability is
for manslaughter. As to the first case, the answer may depend on the m ore detailed facts. If
D put the poison bv his wife's bedside, intending to administer it to h er when she woke up,
the jury should be allowed to find that he has launched himself sufficiently far on his ghastly
plan to be guilty of an attem pt, and th erefore (according to Smith's suggestion) to be guilty
of m u rd er if the wife unexpectedly wakes up and drinks the poison herself. If o n the other
hand th e poisoned drink is still in the kitchen, the result should probably be different. The
question of attem pt is further considered in § 17.5.
   W hatever the th eory may be. the law is not always applied with full rigour. O n a charge
of m u rd er the trial judge may permit or encourage the jury to return a verdict of
manslaughter. O r he may accept a plea to manslaughter, even w hen in strict law it is murder.
T he unexpected twist principle would probably m eet with general acceptance in obvious
cases. But the criminal law should, so far as possible, avoid saddling people with liability for
results markedly different from what was intended or foreseen. So it is im portant not merely
that the law should be applied with discretion but that we should find rules that satisfactorily

                      § 16.7.           THE ORDINARY HAZARD PRINCIPLE

This is a narrow principle and has not come before the English courts, but
it seems obvious.
         D attacks V intending to stab him to death; V runs away, and in his
         fight is struck by lightning and dies. One would say that D is not guilty
         of murder, though he is guilty of attempted murder. Why is he not
         guilty of murder? Because it was not he that killed V, but the
         lightning? But if V had jumped over a cliff or into a river in an effort
         to escape, or to commit suicide in despair, or had accidentally fallen
         over the cliff or into the river in his flight, D would have been
         accountable for the death, and we should not have said that it was not
         D who killed V but the water or the hard ground. What is it that
         makes us feel that the lightning is different?

   The most obvious answer is that being struck by lightning is an ordinary
risk of life that people do not seek to avoid. One is no more subject to
being struck by lightning when one is running away from an attacker than
when one is taking a walk. The attacker has not substantially increased the
victim's risk.
   A n o th er example of the ordinary hazard principle is where the victim o f an attack dies in
a traffic accident when he is being conveyed by ambulance to hospital, or dies as a result of
a fever which sweeps through the hospital. Assuming that his death was not contributed to
by his weak condition, the attacker is not guilty of it, because the effect of th e attack was
merely to place the victim in a geographical position where a n o th e r agency produced his
death. T he attack did not substantially increase the risk of the fatal result, because anyone
may die in a traffic accident or epidem ic.1 O f course, a reasonable man mulling over all the
possible consequences of an attack might think of these possibilities: but they would not be
possibilities rendered any more likely by the fact of the attack. E ven if it could b e shown that
there was slightly more risk of dying of fever in hospital than elsewhere (perhaps because of
the presence in hospital of resistant bacteria), this would probably be accounted too
insignifcant to affect the decision.
  Contrast the case w here the victim died of hospital fever, but a contributory factor was the
weakness caused by his injuries, so that he would not have died if it had not been for his
weakness. Probably the attacker would then be guilty of criminal homicide (m urder or
manslaughter), for on these facts there is a m edical (and not merely a fortuitous) connection
between the wound and the death. It is like the case of a w ound turning gangrenous and
causing death, where the wounding is clearly the cause of death.

  In the absence of English authority, the ordinary hazard principle is a
matter of theoretical speculation. In most but not all applications it can be
regarded as a particular application of a test of reasonable foresight, on
which decided cases can be found.

                   § 16.8.               THE REASONABLE FORESIGHT PRINCIPLE

 To say that a consequence, to be imputed to the defendant, must be within
 the risk that would be apprehended by a reasonable man is much wider
 than the ordinary hazard principle. Under the name of the "risk principle”
 it has been discussed by writers on the tort of negligence, and it also makes
 an appearance in the criminal case of R o b e r ts .’
            Roberts was driving a girl from a party, and. according to the view of
            the facts that (in the opinion of the Court of Appeal) the jury must
            have taken, he pestered her with advances, held her coat and told her
            that he had beaten up girls w'ho had refused him. She jumped out of
            the moving car and suffered injury. The chairman of Sessions directed
            the jury that on these facts Roberts would be guilty of an assault
            occasioning actual bodily harm under OAPA s.47. He was convicted,
            and the conviction was affirmed on appeal. The court said: “The test
            is: Was it [the injury] the natural result of what the alleged assailant
            said and did, in the sense that it was something that could reasonably
            have been foreseen as the consequence of what he was saving or
            doing?”2

   In previous cases of similar typeJ the test laid down had generally been
whether the victim acted reasonably in his endeavour to escape. Roberts
widens the area of liability and also puts it on a more intelligible footing.
Whether it is prudent for a woman to jump from a rapidly moving car to
avoid rape is a question on which opinions may differ, but at any rate it is
fully understandable, and the possibility of it could well have been foreseen
by the attacker.
   T he reasonable foresight principle gives the jury the opportunity of exempting the
defendant where what happe ned is particularly unusual and it would be unfair to hold him
liable. But the intentional w rongdoer will rarely be advantaged by it. A lthough he has a
theoretical opportunity of escaping a consequence brought about by the victim's
unforeseeable reaction, a jury would probably be loth to describe an act done to escape as
not reasonably foreseeable. A nyone who makes a serious or distressing attack on another
should realise that the victim may try to escape, and in panic may try to escape in a very
dangerous way. H ow ever the question o f causation is in the last resort decided by the jury,
and the jury may take a merciful view.4

         T h e facts of a New York case5 would seem to illustrate conduct that is not reasonably
         foreseeable, but the court did not take this view. D gave a lift in his car to an 18-year-old
         girl: and during the jou rney offered the girl SI to have sexual intercourse. T he girl in
         panic jum ped from the car, when it was moving at about 25 m .p .h .. fractured her skull
         an d died. D was convicted of manslaughter, though he had neither m ade an attack on
         the girl nor threatened her, the court holding that her effort to escape was a "natural
         consequence" of D 's act. O ne may gravely doubt w hether it was reasonably foreseeable.

      and in English law there would be the further difficulty of finding an initial act of gross
      neeligence on D ’s part.

   An event may be reasonably foreseeable as part of a generic risk, even though it is
i m p r o b a b l e in its details. This observation is illustrated by an old anonym ous case, generally
known as the harlot's case (1560)*.
      "A harlot woman was delivered of a child. She laid it away, alive, in an orchard: and
      covered it with leaves. A kite struck at it with his claws. In consequence of being thus
      stricken, the child died very soon afterwards. She was arraigned of m urder; and was
      executed. . . . For she had intended the child’s death: and voluntas reputatur p ro fa c to ."

      The last rem ark— that the will is taken for the deed— is not literally true: what should have
been said was that since the woman intended to cause the child to die (of exposure), the fact
that it died in a somewhat unexpected way was irrelevant. If the child had been killed by a
vaarant she would not on principle have been guilty of m urder, for. as we shall see, the
intervention of a responsible actor would have m ade the death too rem ote a consequence of
the infant's exposure.
      Kites were com m on in 1560. and appointed themselves scavengers to the City of London.
N o w they are rare: but if the drama of the harlot's case were to be rep eated, the baby being
 k i l l e d by one of these birds, the result would surely be the same. The harlot intended her baby
t o d i e as the result of withholding from it the hum an protection that an infant needs. This is
t h e way in which the baby did die, and the unlikelihood of the particular mode of death (if
it was unlikely) was immaterial. We may express the principle by saying that a risk is involved
i n the d efendant’s conduct, and an event is within the risk, if a reasonable person would have
contemplated the event as part of the general risk involved in such conduct, w hether as the
major risk or as some subsidiary risk; and it is im m aterial that a subsidiary risk was so unlikely
in itself that i f it had stood alone the conduct would n o t have been negligent.7
      Another way of explaining the rule would be to say that although the test of risk is usually
stated as one of reasonable foreseeability, in practice it is not a question w hether the
reasonable defendant, if asked beforehand what he foresees, would im mediately respond in
terms of w hat later happens. W hat happens may be only one out of an infinite n um be r of
possibilities, and vet it is regarded as foreseeable for legal purposes if it is the kind of thing
that does happen without causing surprise. T he question is one of the normality of what
happens w hen looked at with hindsight rather than foresight. This is so. at least, in the law
of tort, where the risk principle is relatively well developed.
      Again, the victim need not be the specific victim that the reasonably foreseeing defendant
would primarily have contemplated: it is enough that he belongs to the general class of
persons who in a larger view would be within such reasonable contemplation. Indeed, if one
thinks only of the particular victim (great-uncle G eorge who has paid an u nheralded visit from
Australia) the likelihood of his appearance may be so small that if this w ere the only risk the
conduct would not be accounted negligent at all. W hat characterises the conduct as negligent
i s . frequently, the likelihood that members of a class may be involved; and the class may be
defined merely as those who in fact come into perilous proximity.


Doesn’t the risk principle, as applied to crimes requiring intention,
contradict that requirement?
  The objection overlooks the fact that rules of causation cannot make the
defendant guilty of a crime of intention unless he intended the event
specified in the law (such as the death of a human being). All that the rules
do is to settle the question of liability where the event occurs in an
unexpected way. The foreseeability rule is a limitation upon the general
principle relating to the unexpected twist.

How does the rule in manslaughter excluding the victim’s special sensitivity
from consideration square with the risk principle?
   The special sensitivity rule is an exception from the risk principle, but it
can be justified on special grounds.
    These special grounds start from the observation that the risk principle does not operate
 to negative liability if the event happened precisely as the defendant intended. Suppose that
he aimed at the victim with a rifle and all the experts would have said that the victim was out
of range: but he hoped to hit the victim and by some freak did so. T he defendant is clearly
responsible for hitting the victim. Questions of foreseeable risk arise only w hen there is some
slight shift from the events that the defendant intended.
   All the authorities on the special sensitivity rule seem to relate to manslaughter, where
there was no intention to kill: but it can hardly be doubted that the same rule applies to
murder. If the defendant intended to cause death and actually did so, it is irrelevant that the
injury he inflicted would not have caused a normal person to die. This is somew hat similar
to the case just put of the victim being out of normal range of the w eapon. H ow ever, it is not
quite so straightforward. The defendant may have aimed to stab the victim through the heart,
but only succeeded in cutting him slightly, but the victim was a haemophiliac and bled to
death. T here is here a shift in the intended chain of causation, though (perhaps it may be said)
only a slight shift. At any rate, it is intelligible that a court should refuse to pay attention to
the victim's parlous state of health, if the defendant has substantially achieved his purpose.
   T he special sensitivity rule does not or should not qualify a requirem ent of m ens rea or fault
for the particular offence. A n attacker whose m ens rea is limited to the infliction of slight
injury cannot become guilty of murder if. owing to the victim’s sensitivity, the slight injury
becomes serious and leads to death. A person who is negligent as to causing slight injury
should not be guilty of m anslaughter if. owing to the special sensitivity of the victim, the slight
injury proves to be fatal. M anslaughter should require negligence as to death, or at any rate
as to grievous bodily harm.
   T he law of constructive manslaughter is anom alous, because if strictly applied it turns a
minor assault into criminal homicide if the victim dies because of his peculiar physical
condition. T he interpretation of O A P A s.47 as creating an offence of half m ens rea can also
have the effect that a person may be convicted of an aggravated assault although he neither
intended to inflict bodily harm nor was reckless or even negligent as to it. if bodily harm
follows because of the victim's special sensitivity. But if the bodily harm follows only because
of the victim's effort to escape, it is clear from Roberts that the attacker is not liable under
this section unless what the victim did was reasonably foreseeable.


Does the risk principle apply to the doctrine of transferred intention?
  Apparently not. No case decides that it does, and one suggests that it
does not.8 It may be thought that in G ore (§ 11.5 n. 1) the defendant could
not reasonably have foreseen that the apothecary would be poisoned, yet
her intention was transferred.



                       § 16.9.     NEW INTERVENING ACT
An extreme view of criminal responsibility might be that a man is under
a duty to act in such a way that others are not led to cause harm, so that
in some circumstances he would be responsible for harm that is
directly caused by others, even though without his authorisation or
 encouragement. This does not represent the criminal law. The legal
 attitude is that a man is primarily responsible only for what he himself does
 or incites. The fact that his own wrongful conduct provided the background
 for some consequential wrong act by another, and that he should have
 foreseen this act, does not make him responsible for it.
   Putting the rule in terms of causation, the new intervening act (novus actus interveniens) of
a responsible actor, who has full knowledge of what he is doing, and is not subject to mistake
or pressure, will normally operate to relieve the defendant of liability for a further
consequence, because it makes the consequence "too r e m o te ." Underlying this rule there is.
undoubtedly, a philosophical attitude. Moralists and lawyers regard the individual's will as the
autonomous prime cause of his behaviour. What a person does (if he has reached adult years,
is of sound mind and is not acting u nder mistake, intimidation or other similar pressure) is
his own responsibility, and is not regarded as having been caused by o th e r people. An
intervening act of this kind, therefore, breaks the causal connection that would otherwise
have been perceived between previous acts and the forbidden consequence. (A n intervening
wrongful omission does not break it.)
   The rule can be rationalised in psychological terms by saying that the intervention of the
responsible actor diverts our retributive wrath from the defendant, the previous actor, who
may appear to be so much less culpable than the later actor, and this switching of retributive
feeling is expressed in causal language. Sometimes, too, we may feel that making people
responsible for the subsequent behaviour of others, merely because they foresaw or could
have foreseen that behaviour, would be too great a restriction upon liberty. Y et another way
of explaining the rule would be to say that part of the object of the criminal trial is to
dramatise society’s rejection of the deed, and this is adequately done by prosecuting the
immediate author. T here is no pressing necessity to regard more rem ote authors as
responsible for the harm itself, though they may well be prosecuted for o th e r offences, such
as attempt, or in appropriate circumstances as accessories. It is im portant that the law should
not saddle a man with liability for consequences that not only he but also the general public
would blame on som e on e else.

        To take a fanciful case, suppose that D1 prepares a poisoned drink, intending to offer
        it to V. D2, who has his own score to settle with V . and who has observed D l ’s
        preparations, offers the drink to V . who takes it and dies. D2 was not acting in
        collaboration with D l . D 2 is guilty of murder an d D1 is not. If the poison which D Tleft
        for V to drink had been administered to him by som eone who did not know it was
        poisoned, D l would have been guilty of murder. As it is, D2's criminal intent insulates
        him from liability.1
           A s another example of the rule, a person who provokes another to kill without inciting
        him to do so does not become guilty of m urder or manslaughter, even though he realised
        or should have realised what the effect of his conduct would b e . 2 Similarly,
        unintentionally provoking another person to break the peace3 or to drive recklessly4 does
        not make the provoker criminally responsible.
           A painter m akes a habit of painting pastiches in the style of a famous artist. He sells
        them, saying that they are his own work but realising the strong probability that
        eventually some of them will be resold at inflated prices to people who believe that they
        are genuine. E ven if one of them is m ade an instrument of fraud, it would be going too

           far to say that the painter is a party to the fraud. Perhaps there should be a law against
           selling pastiches not clearly marked as such, but there is not.

   T he novus actus rule is of fundamental importance at common law, because it underlies the
 doctrine of accessoryship. If D2 incites D l to kill V, and D l complies, D2 has prom pted (in
 ordinary speech, caused) D l to perpetrate the crime, and is himself an accessory to the crime,
 but he has not in law caused V's death. Fletcher states the principle as follows.

          “ Aiding th e crime of a responsible, self-actuating perpetrator does not 'cause.' 'control'
          or 'determ ine' the latter's conduct. The access'orv contributes to the crime, but the
          execution is not his doing.” 5

   A s we have seen, there are certain important differences between the liability of the
accessory and that of the perpetrator. If it were not for the novus acius rule the successful
inciter would be liable as a p erpe tra tor, which would require the law of complicity to be
rew ritte n.6
   T he point just made also shows that the no vu s actus principle is distinct from the
r equirem ent of reasonable foreseeability. If D2 pays an assassin D l to kill V. of course he
foresees that D l will do the killing, so that the requirem ent of foreseeability is satisfied: but
still D 2 is not a perpetrator of the crime.
   T he novus actus rule does not prevent liability arising for joint negligence in concerted
action, even though it is the act of only one of the parties that produces the evil result.7 The
law of complicity creates liability where the normal rule for causation would n o t.8
   A lthou gh a novus actus rule is recognised in the law of tort, it differs from the criminal rule
in that if A instigates B to com m it a tort, both A and B are regarded as causing the result as
joint tortfeasors. T he law of tort does not distinguish between degrees of complicity as the
criminal law does.

   The n ovu s actus principle is so potent that it can even rescue a defendant
from strict liability.
            In Im press (Worcester) Ltd. v. R ees 9 the appellant company's fuel
            store leaked oil into the Severn, after an unknown person had
            tampered with the valve. Normally (it was assumed) the leak would
            have been an offence of strict liability,10 but the Divisional Court held
            that the company was not liable, because the intervening act of the
            stranger was an “intervening cause of so powerful a nature that the
            conduct of the appellants was not a cause at all but was merely part
            of the surrounding circumstances.”
   The pollution of the river was, of course, factually caused in part by the
circumstance that the company had accumulated fuel near the river. But
this was merely the background of the matter; in law. the only operative
cause was the act of the mischief-maker. The distinction is between
something operating directly to produce the result and something
operating only indirectly through the wrongful intervener.
   The n ovu s actus principle was expressly recognised, for the law of

  homicide, in P a g e t t It was held not to prevent liability attaching on the
  tacts of the case, for the reason to be considered in the next section.
    Difficult problems can sometimes arise. Suppose, for example, that D l and D2 successively
 and independently wound V with murderous intent, and V dies from the loss of blood caused
 bv both wounds together, when he would not have died from either alone. Beginning with
 D2. the later assailant, he is guilty of murder, since he must take his victim as he finds him—in
 this case, weakened and bleeding from the first wound.
    As regards the liability of D l . the question is moot. O n the one hand it may be argued that
 he is not guilty of m urder if the wound he inflicted would not alone have caused the death,
 because he is not responsible for the subsequent act of a fresh agent. T he argument the other
 way is that both causes are physically operating to bring about death. Does the novus actus
 Joctrine insulate D l from liability in respect of the death? (If D l and D2 acted at the same
 time, though independently, both would clearly be responsible, since their acts would be
 concurrent causes: § .2).
    My own opinion is that D l in the hypothetical should not be held liable for the death. But
 we do not hear much of the novus actus doctrine from the courts nowadays, and it is likely
 to prove in practice to be a fragile shield for the defendant when the facts are horrific.
    The concurrent causation rule is applied in cases of nuisance. Two musical bands together
 (or two pig-farmers together) may be a nuisance when one alone would not. Two cars parked
 opposite each other may render a narrow highway impassable when one alone would not.
 Each defendant is clearly liable if all started their activities at the same time. But it has been
 ruled that where one was first on the scene, and did not at that time commit an offence, the
 subsequent act of the other does not make him responsible for causing a nuisance or
 unreasonable obstruction as the case may be. T he first has not caused the act of the second,
 and what the first did, if it stood alone, would not have been an offence. (This particular
 ruling may be doubted; the offence being a continuing one. questions of intervening act can
 hardly arise.)12




                     § 16.10.              THE NON-RESPONSIBLE INTERVENER

 We have seen, in discussing the subject of complicity, that if D incites an
innocent agent to commit a criminal act, and the innocent agent does so.
D is regarded as perpetrating the crime. Put in terms of causation, the rule
is that if D has done the last act that he intended to do (instructing the
innocent agent), he causes the result notwithstanding that the immediate
cause was the act of another (the innocent agent), if there was no
subsequent criminal volition of another. This principle is wider than the
simple doctrine of innocent agency, as M ic h a e l 1shows,
          Michael, a single woman, had an illegitimate baby boy a few months
          old whom she boarded out with a foster-mother. Intending to murder
          the infant she bought a bottle of laudanum, told the foster-mother that
          it was medicine, and directed her to give the infant a teaspoonful every
          night. The woman gave none, but put the bottle on the mantelpiece.

      where a few days later her own small boy, aged about 5. being left
      alone with the infant, took the bottle down and administered half its
      contents to the infant, who died. Michael was convicted of murder,
      and the conviction was affirmed by the Court for Crown Cases
      Reserved.
   No clear reason was given by the court for holding Michael responsible,
but we may rationalise as follows. Michael intended to poison her baby
with laudanum administered by the hand of another, and this very thing
happened. The fact that she intended the killing process to be spun out was
immaterial. (The trial judge in directing the jury assumed that it was
necessary for the prosecution to show that a single teaspoonful of the
liquid— the dose directed by Michael—was enough to kill the baby; but
nowadays this would be regarded as too lenient a direction. Even if the
dose of a teaspoonful each night would have killed only by reason of having
a cumulative effect, the variation whereby half the bottle was administered
at once would have been immaterial.)
   The more striking deviation from Michael’s plan was the intervention of
a different, and unforeseen, 'actor. The small boy w'as innocent, being
under the age of criminal responsibility, and Michael was responsible for
the result that he helped to bring about, even though he was not Michael’s
intended tool. Michael had done the last act that she intended to do. and
there was no affront to the sense of justice in saying that the variation in
the chain of causation was immaterial.
  T he negative rules we are now studying are cumulative in effect. It is not eno u g h to show
that there was no new intervening act of a responsible actor; it must also be shown that what
happened was reasonably foreseeable. T here was am ple evidence in Michael that the latter
rule was satisfied. The defendant had placed the poison in the room where the baby was. and
had described it as medicine for the baby. (It seems very likely that the boy of 5 who had
administered it to the baby had been told or otherwise had come to believe that it was the
baby's medicine, though the jury were not asked to consider this point.) The fact that some
other m e m b er of the foster-mother's family might do the actual administering o f the medicine
was clearly within the risk she created, though of course the question was one for the jurv.
  T he innocent agent or non-responsible intervener may. of course, be the victim himself.
This type of problem was discussed in §.6.

   Two decisions mentioned previously provide further examples of the
non-responsible intervener; M alcherek2 and P agett,3 The judgment in the
latter case proceeds on the basis that the police were acting in self-defence,
but the more obvious justification was that they were entitled to kill if
necessary in the course of trying to make an arrest or to prevent violent
crime or the escape of a violent offender. On any view the police w'ere
acting under the pressure caused by the defendant, and so were not
exercising the unfettered volition presupposed by the novus actus rule.
        § 16.12.     CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF VICTIM

The principle is that the victim's contributory negligence is no answer to a
charge of crime.1 In other words, it is generally no defence that the victim
laid himself open to the act, or was himself guilty of negligence bringing it
about.
   This rule can have strange results. Suppose there are tw'o burglars
engaged together in blowing a safe in a grossly negligent way. If one is
killed the other is presumably guilty of manslaughter, even though the
victim participated throughout in the act of negligence. It can be argued
that there should be a defence of negligent joint enterprise, but the courts
have not hitherto recognised it.

   Occasionally the contributory fault of the victim may be so great that the defendant's act
is held not to be the im putable cause of the harm. A n illustration is the "exhaustion of
danger" principle, where the risk created by the defendant is at an en d before the victim
commits the careless act.

    In Waters ( 1834),2 the defendant W aters, being on board a ship, and V, who was in a boat
    alongside, disputed about paym ent for some goods, both being intoxicated. T here was
    a conflict of evidence as to what subsequently happened, but according to one witness
    Waters, to get rid of V. pushed aw'ay the boat with his foot; V. reaching out to lay hold
    of a barge, to prevent his boat from drifting away, overbalanced, fell into the water, and
    was drowned. Park J ruled that even if this evidence were accepted it was not a case of
    manslaughter.

   No reason was given for the ruling, but a reason can easily be framed. If V had fallen into
the water immediately upon his boat being pushed, it might perhaps have am ounted to
manslaughter, supposing that Waters knew that V was unsteady on his feet and probably too
drunk to swim. But this is not what h appen ed. V remained safe in his boat, and the only effect
of the push was to cause him inconvenience, in having the boat drift from the place where he
wanted it to be. A t that point the risk caused by Waters's act was exhausted.

(2) Involuntary manslaughter
   This is unlawful killing without intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm: R.
v. Taylor (1834) 2 Lew. 215 and see Stephen Dig.Cr.L. 9th ed. p. 221. Apart from
the intent required the elements o f the offence are the sam e as in murder (see
§§ 2 0 - 3 — 20 -1 3 , and §§ 20-15— 2 0 -2 7 , ante). T h e rules as to causation,0 time
limit o f a year and a day, self defence etc., therefore apply though it must be
remembered that provocation and dim inished responsibility only apply to murder
and so as to reduce that crime to manslaughter.

   T h e difficulty is to identify the elements which m a y m ake the killing unlawful:
see Andrews v. D .P .P . (1937) 26 Cr.A pp.R . 34 p er Lord Atkin. T h e law has gone
through a process o f developm ent. It was formerly held that there was a doctrine
o f constructive manslaughter whereby death resulting from any unlawful act,
w hether intrinsically likely to injure or not, was m anslaughter, but this has long
ceased to be the law.
   T h e authorities on involuntary m anslaughter are difficult to reconcile, but the
following propositions appear to be established:
    (1) T h e killing is m anslaughter if it is either
   (a) T he result o f a grossly negligent (though it m ay be otherwise lawful) act or
         omission on the part o f the accused (see § 2 0 -4 9 , post); or
   ( b ) T he result o f his unlawful act (though not his unlawful om ission), where
        the unlawful act is one, such as an assault, which all sober and reasonable
        people would inevitably realise must subject the victim to the risk o f some
        harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm, w hether the accused
        realised this or not: Andrews v. D .P .P ., ante ; R . v. Larkin (1944) 29

        R . v. Lamb (1967) 51 Cr.A pp.R . 417, C.A.; R. v. Mackie (1973) 57
        Cr.App.R. 453, C.A. (applying R . v. Church (1965) 49 C r.A pp.R . 206,

        [1961] Crim .L.R. 547, C.A.; R. v. Cato (1976) 62 Cr.App.R. 41, C.A.
        (Injecting another person with heroin which the defendant had unlawfully
        taken into his possession for that purpose, is an unlawful act and if death
        results the offence is m anslaughter notw ithstanding that the victim con­
        sented and the heroin is only one o f the causes o f death, i.e. a cause o f death
        outside the de minimis range— drug addicts had prepared a strong solution
        o f heroin and injected each other with it: R. v. Cato [1976] 1 All E.R. 260,
        C .A .), c.f. R. v. D alby (1982) 74 Cr.App.R. 348, C .A . (intravenous con­
        sumption o f dangerous drug was substantial cause o f death— D had sup­
        plied the drug, he had not participated in the injecting o f it— the act of
        supplying the drug was not directed against the person o f the deceased and
        the supply did not cause any direct injury to him— conviction for man­
        slaughter quashed).
            In R . v. Mitchell (1983) 76 C r.A pp.R . 293, C .A ., the Court certified the
        following point but refused leave: “ whether in order to constitute the-
        offence o f manslaughter the unlawful and dangerous act must first, be
        aimed at the person w ho died, or second, involve direct contact or impact
        upon the person w h o d ie d .” T h e court upheld-a conviction for manslaugh­
        ter where M b ecam e involved in an altercation with X , aged 72 (M having

  5 See, e.g. R . v. Pagett (§ 2 0 -5 ante), a n d see R. v. Mitchell (§ 2 0 -4 8 ).
        tried to force his w a y into a queue) and hit X w ho fell against an 89 year old
        w o m a n . H er femur was broken and an operation w as performed to replace
        her hip joint. She died subsequently, the cause o f d e a th being pulm o nary
        e m b olism caused by thrombosis o f the leg veins w hich in turn was caused
        by fracture o f the femur. T h e court could see no reason o f policy for holding
        that an act calculated to harm A could not be m a n sla u g h te r if it in fact
        killed B. T h e fact that there was n o physical contact b etw een the defendant
        and the victim was immaterial. In D .P .P . v. N ew bury, ante, the H o u s e of
        Lords approved the following dictim in R. v. Larkin [19 43 ] 1 All E.R. 217,
        219: “W h er e the act w hich a person is engaged in perform ing is unlawful,
        then if at the sam e tim e it is a dangerous act, that is, an act w hich is likely
        to injure another person, and quite inadvertently he causes the death o f
        that other person by that act, then he is guilty o f m a n sla u g h te r .” It is
        unnecessary to prove that the a ccused knew that the a c t was unlawful or
        dangerous: D .P .P . v. N ewbury. In ju d g in g w hether the a ct was dangerous,
        the test is not did the accused recognise that it w as d an g er o u s, but w ould all
        sober and reasonable people recognise its danger: ibid. T h e practice o f
        directing juries other than in accordance with the principles set out abo ve
        should cease: ib id ?

(2) Risk o f “h a rm ”: meaning o f “h arm ”
    “ H a r m ” m eans physical harm. A ccordingly, if, for ex am p le, robbers so frighten
a person by their a ppea rance and conduct that in c o n se q u e n c e that person suffers
a heart attack from which he later dies, a proper direction to the jury w ould
involve telling th e m that the requisite harm was caused i f the unlawful act so
shocked the victim as to cause him physical injury, see R . v. D aw son, Nolan and
 Walmsley (1985) 81 C r.A pp.R . 150, C.A.
   D alby, P agett and M itchell were considered in R. v. Goodfellow (1986) 83
Cr.App.R. 23, C .A . It was subm itted on b e h a lf o f the a p p e lla n t that D alby was
authority for the proposition that in the case o f “ unlawful a c t ” m a n sla u g h ter the
action o f the d e fendant m ust have been directed at the victim . T h is subm ission
was based on the following passag e from W aller L .J.’s j u d g m e n t in D alby — (1982)
74 C r.A pp.R . 348, 352— “ w here the charge o f m anslaughter is based on an u n la w ­
ful and dan gerou s act, it m ust be an act directed at the victim an d likely to cause
im m ediate injury, how ever slig h t.” Lord L a n e C J . , d elivering the ju d g m e n t o f the
court in Goodfellow , having quoted this extract, continued: “ H o w e v e r, w e d o not
think that he w as suggesting there m ust be an intention on the part o f the defend­
ant to harm or frighten or a realisation that his acts were likely to harm or frighten.
Indeed it w ould have been contrary to the dicta o f Lord S a lm o n in D .P .P . v. N e w ­
bury [(1976) 62 C r.A pp.R . 291] if he was. W h a t he was, w e believe, intending to
say was that there m ust be no fresh intervening cause b e tw e e n the act and the
d ea th ” (at p. 27). H is Lordship referred to Pagett and M itchell as supporting this
interpretation o f D alby.
   (3) Mens rea is essential to m anslaughter but it can consist o f either (in ( l ) ( a )
above) gross negligence or (in ( l ) ( b ) above) the mens rea appropriate to the u n la w ­
ful act, or both; Andrews v. D .P .P ., ante; R. v. Lam b, ante ; R . v. Low e, ante.
   (4) For the purpose o f ( l ) ( b ) above, an act w hich is unlaw ful by the m anner o f
its execution, e.g. dangerous driving, is not an “ unlawful a c t ” ; Andrews v. D .P .P .,
ante.
   See further at § 2 0-51 ,p o s t and the cases collected at § 2 0 - 5 5 , post.

“Gross negligence”
    (1)    It w ould have been satisfactory to have been able to say, as w a s suggested in
the 39th edition o f this work, that “ gross n e g lig e n c e ” was e q u iv ale n t to “ reckless­
n e ss” as defined in § 17—24, ante. Certainly a direction to this effect could only be


   6   See R . v. Pagelt (§ 20-5) where a conviction o f m an sla u g h ter was upheld; the a pp e lla nt
h ad used a w o m an as a shield against police fire a n d she was killed.
 criticised on the ground that it w as too favourable to the accused. T h e position
 how ever is not so sim ple, and it is necessary to refer to certain o f the authorities.
     (2) T h e le ading case is Andrews v. D .P .P . (1938) 26 C r.A p p .R . 34, H .L ., a case of
 “ m otor m anslaug hter.” H o ld in g , as w e h av e seen, that “ dangerous d r iving” was
 not an “ unlawful a c t ” for the purpose o f § 2 0 - 4 8 (1) (b), ante. Lord Atkin (in a
 speech concurred in by the rest o f the A p p ellate C om m ittee) said that in the pres­
 ent case it w as only necessary to consider m an sla u g h ter from the point o f view o f
 an unintentional killing ca used by negligence, that is, the om ission o f a d u ty to
 take care. H e cited from the considered j u d g m e n t o f the Court o f Crim inal Appeal
 in R . v. Batemen (1925) 19 C r.A pp.R . 8 the follow ing passage:
     “ In explaining to juries the test which they should apply to d eterm ine w hether
 the negligence, in the particular case, a m o u n te d or did not a m o u n t to a crime, the
J u d g e s have used m any epithets, such as ‘c u lp a b le ,’ ‘crim inal,’ ‘gross,’ ‘w icked,’
 ‘c le a r ,’ ‘c o m p le te .’ But, w hatever epithet be used and w hether an epithet be used
 or not, in order to establish crim inal liability the facts must be such that, in the
 opinion o f the jury, the ne glig en c e o f the accused went beyond a m ere m atter of
 com p en sation betw een subjects a n d sh ow ed such disregard for the life and safety
o f others as to a m o u n t to a crim e against the State and conduct deserving p unish­
 m e n t .”
     Lord Atkin w en t on to say: “ . . . the expressions used are not. indeed they were
 probably not intended to be, a precise definition o f the crime. I do not m y se lf find
 the connotation o f mens rea helpful in d istin gu ish in g between degrees o f negligence,
 nor do the ideas o f crime and p u n ish m e n t in them selves carry a jury m uch further
 in deciding w hether in a particular case th e degree o f negligence show n is a crime
an d deserves p u n ishm ent. B ut the su b stan ce o f the ju d g m e n t is m ost valuable, and
 in m y opinion is correct. In practice it ha s generally been adopted by ju d g e s in
 charging juries in all cases o f m an sla u g h ter by negligence, w h e th e r in driving
vehicles or otherwise. . . .
     Sim ple lack o f care is not e nough. For the purposes o f the crim inal law there are
degrees o f negligence, and a very high degree o f negligence is required to be proved
 before the felony is established. Probably o f all the epithets that can be applied,
 “ recklessness” m ost nearly covers the case. It is difficult to visualise a case o f death
 by dangerous driving caused by “ reckless” driving in the co n n ota tion o f that term
 in ordinary speech w hich w ou ld not justify a conviction for m anslaughter. But it is
probably not all em bracing, for “ reckless” suggests an indifference to risk, whereas
 the accused m ay have appreciated the risk and endeavoured to avoid it and yet
sh o w n such a high degree o f neg ligen ce in the m e an s ad o p ted to avoid the risk as
w ould justify a c on victio n .” T h e H o u se o f Lords has now decided that “ failure to
g ive any thought to the possibility o f this b ein g a risk” can a m o u n t to recklessness
 (see § 17-24, ante).
     It should be noted that in involuntary m a n slau gh ter by neglig en ce there must
 be both a duty to take care and a high degree o f negligence, which how ever need
not necessarily a m o u n t to recklessness.
     (3) In R. v. Lam b (1967) 51 C r.A p p .R . 417, C .A ., a strong Court o f A ppeal in a
considered j u d g m e n t said, obiter (at p. 424) that “ w h en the grava m en o f a charge is
crim inal negligence— often referred to as recklessness— o f an a ccu sed person, the
ju r v have to consider a m o n g other matters the state o f his m ind, and that includes
 the question o f whether he th ought that w h a t he w as doing w as safe. In the present
c a se ”— pulling the trigger o f a partly-loaded revolver in jest— “ it w ould have been
fully open to a jury, if properly directed, to find the accused guilty because they
considered that his view o f there being no danger w as fo rm ed in a criminally negligent way',
 but he was entitled to a direction that the ju r y should take into account that fact
that he had undisputelv formed this view an d that there was expert evidence of
 this being an understandable v ie w .”
     (T h e court held that there w as no evidence o f manslaughter as the result o f an
 unlaw ful act, because w h a t the accused had d o n e did not even a m o u n t to an
assault in the a b sen ce o f any hostile intent— see § 2 0 -5 1 2 , post.)
     (4) In R. v. Lowe (1973) 57 C r.A pp.R . 365, C .A ., the Court o f A ppeal appear to
 h ave equated “ recklessness” w ith the high standard o f negligence required, but
 this w as obiter an d the court were clearly in ten d in g to follow Andrews v. D .P .P ., ante.
     (5) In R . v. Cato (1976) 62 C r.A pp.R . 41, C .A ., on the question o f the degree o f
negligence required, the trial ju d g e had said that “ recklessness” m ust be proved,
without defining that word. T h e Court o f A p p ea l said (at p. 48) that definition was
unnecessary— “ After all, recklessness is a perfectly sim ple English w ord. Its m e a n ­
ing is well known and it is in com m on use.”
     (6) In i? , v. Dobinson (1977) C r.A pp.R . 186, 192, 193, C .A . the C ourt o f A ppeal
said that it was not necessary for there to be an appreciation by the accused o f the
risk o f death or serious injury. T h e y w e n t on to say that there must be a “ reckless
disregard o f danger to the health and welfare o f the infirm person. M ere inadver­
tence is not enough. T h e defendant m ust have been proved to have been indiffer­
ent to an obvious risk o f injury to health, or actu ally to h av e foreseen the risk but to
have determ ined nevertheless to run it.”
     In view o f the contrast in the above passage betw een “ indifference” an d “ actual
f o r e s ig h t” it is difficult to understand w hat distinction is being d r aw n between
“ inadvertence” and “ indifference.” T h e passage, how ever, is consistent with the
opinions o f the majority o f the H o u s e o f Lords in R . v. Caldwell an d o f all their
Lordships in R . v. Lawrence (§ 17-24, ante). In R . v. West London Coroner, ex p . Gray
a n d others [1987] 2 A ll E.R. 129, D .C ., W atkins L.J. identified the ingredients o f the
offence o f unlawful killing by neglect.

    (7) Collisions at sea. I f a charge o f m a n slau gh ter follow ing loss o f life in a collision
at sea, is to succeed, it is essential that the crow n should be able to prove clearly
and for certain every act w hether o f co m m issio n or om ission by those against
w hom that charge is brought and w hich is said not only to have c aused death but
to have been o f so grave a character that a conviction for m anslaughter should fol­
low. In such cases com parable directions on the law to those appropriate in motor
manslaughter cases should be given. In Seymour (1983) 77 C r.A pp.R . 215, H .L .,
the H o u se o f Lords held that the appropriate direction in motor m anslaughter
cases is the sam e as has been suggested in Lawrence (1981) 73 C r.A p p .R . 1 (see §
2 0 -2 7 4 ). T h u s the relevant questions are (i) D id the respective acts o f navigation
create an obvious an d serious risk o f causing physical d a m a g e to s o m e other ship
and thus to other persons w h o m ight h ave been travelling in the area o f the colli­
sion at the material time? I f so, did a n y o f the defendants by their respective acts o f
navigation so navigate either w ithout h a v in g given any thought to the possibility
o f that risk or, w hile recognising that the risk existed, take that risk: Kong Cheuk
K w a n v . R . (1986) 82 C r.A pp.R . 18, P.C.

    (8) Manslaughter charge as an alternative to causing death by reckless driving. T h e offence
o f causing death by reckless driving o f a motor v ehicle on a road is still m a n sla u g h ­
ter by the law o f E ngland even though it is also a statutory offence and has been
since 1956: Government o f U .S .A . v. Jennings (1982) 75 C r.A pp.R . 367, H .L ., (an
extradition case). T h e evidence to prove either offence is therefore the sam e.
■ In R . v. Seymour (1983) 77 C r.A pp.R . 215, H .L ., it w as held that where m a n ­
slaughter was charged and the circum stances were that th e victim w a s killed as the
result o f the reckless driving o f the d efendant on a public highw ay, the jury should
be directed as suggested in R . v. Lawrence (see § 2 0 - 2 7 4 , post), but it w ould be
appropriate to point out that in order to constitute the offence o f m an slau gh ter the
risk o f death being caused by the m an n e r o f the d e fe n d a n t’s driving m u st be very
high. Lord Roskill, with w h o se speech all but o n e o f the remainder o f their L ord­
ships agreed, said that there could be no justification for jo in in g both m a n s la u g h ­
ter a n d the statutory offence in the sa m e in d ictm en t and that if it w ere d o n e the
prosecution should be m a d e to elect upon w hich count they w ished to proceed.
The suggestion that a prerequisite for a m an sla u g h ter charge is that “ the risk o f
death must be very h ig h ” is quite inconsistent with Lawrence and is obiter.


D uty o f care
   T h is belongs m ore to the fields o f contract and tort than to this work. In prac­
tice, however, the question o f w hether the accused w as under a d u ty o f care
usually only arises in m anslaughter cases w h ere it is alleged that the accused had
undertaken the care o f a child or infirm person or the like. In other cases, such as
the m edical practitioner or driver o f a car or an engine, the duty is obvious.
   In R. v. Stone, R . v. Dobinson {ante), Stone an d D ob in so n were living together,
D obinson being S t o n e ’s mistress. S t o n e ’s sister, Fanny, the deceased, lodged in
their house and they had taken som e care o f her. It was argued for the appellants
that they had no duty o f care to the decea sed . Rejecting this, the Court o f A ppeal
(at p. 191) said:
   “ W hether F a n n y was a lodger or not she w as a blood relation o f . . . Stone; she
was occupying a room in his house; M rs. D o b in so n had undertaken th e d u ty o f
trying to w ash her, o f taking such food to her as she required. T h ere w as am ple
evidence that each accused w as aw are o f the poor condition she was in. . . . This
was not a situation analogous to the d r o w n in g stranger. T h e y did m ake efforts to
care. T h e y tried to get a doctor; they tried to discover the previous doctor. Mrs.
D obinson helped with the w a sh in g and the provision o f food. . . . T h e j u r y were
entitled to find that the d u ty had been a s su m e d . T h e y were entitled to conclude
that once F a n n y b e c a m e helplessly infirm. . . . the appellants were, in the circum ­
stances, obliged either to s u m m o n help or else to care for F a n n y th em se lv e s.”
   For further exam ples see the earlier cases collected at §§ 2 0 - 5 9 et seq., post.

“Unlawful A ct”
   (1) See ante § 2 0 - 4 8 . R easonable correction o f a child by a person in loco parentis
is not unlawful— see § 20—25, ante. For observations as to the proper direction
w hen such an issue arises see R . v. M ackie (1973) 57 C r.A pp.R . 353 and post,
§ 2 0 -5 8 . A s to injuries caused in lawful ga m e s an d contests, see post, § 2 0 - 5 6 .
   In R. v. Lam b, § 2 0 - 4 9 (3 ), ante, w h en the accused had pulled the trigger o f the
revolver in jest, the Court o f A ppeal pointed out that this was not an unlaw ful act
and therefore the prosecution could only have established m anslaughter by prov­
ing gross negligence.
   (2) In R . v. Cato, § 2 0 - 4 9 (5), ante, the C ourt o f A p p e a l held that injecting
another person with heroin w hich the defen d a n t had unlawfully taken into his pos­
session for that purpose, (he had exchang ed syringes with the other p erson), is an
unlawful act, and if death results the offence is m anslaughter, notw ithstanding
that the victim consented to the injection and provided the syringe and the heroin.
How ever, cf. R . v. D alby, ante, § 2 0 - 4 8 , (a person w h o supplies the drug w hich is
injected by the deceased h im s e lf is not guilty o f m anslaughter).
   (3) A n act calculated to harm A is m a n sla u g h ter if it kills B and it is immaterial
that there w as no physical contact betw een the assailant and B, see R . v. Mitchell,
ante § 2 0 - 4 8 a n d R . v. P agett ante § 2 0 - 5 .

   ( /) Counselling, (see also post, §§ 2 9 - 1 9 — 2 9 - 2 8 ) . A person can be indicted for
and convicted o f accessory before the fact to involuntary m anslaughter, but sem ble
not in the case o f voluntary m anslaughter (see ante, § 20—47): R . v. Creamer (1966)
49 Cr.A pp.R . 368, C .C .A ., {obiter on this point but following old authority).           *
   A t page 378 the Court said: “ A m an is guilty o f involuntary m anslaughter when
he intends an unlawful act and one likely to d o harm to the person and death
results which was neither foreseen nor intended. It is the accident o f d ea th which
makes him guilty o f m anslaughter as o p p ose d to som e lesser offence such as
assault or, in the present case, abortion. T h is can no d o u b t be said to be illogical,
since the culpability is the sam e, but nevertheless it is an illogicality which, runs
throughout the w hole o f our law, both the c o m m o n law and the statute law. . . •
Bearing that in m ind, it is quite consistent that a m an w ho has counselled and pro­
cured such an illegal and dangerous act from which d eath, unintended, results

                                                     IN T R O D U C T IO N

   1. O n 15 April 1989 a football m a tch to d ecide a semi-final ro u n d o f th e FA C u p c o m p etitio n was to be
played betw een the L iverpool an d N o ttin g h am Forest Clubs. T h e neutral v enue chosen was H illsborough
Football S tad iu m , Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. O nly six m in utes into the gam e, play was sto p p e d when it
was realised th a t sp ectato rs on the terraces beh in d the Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. In th e result,
95 d ie d a n d over 4 0 0 received hospital trea tm e n t.

  2. O n 17 April 1989 I was app o inted by you to carry o u t an In q u iry with the following term s o f reference:

      To in q u ire in to the events at Sheffield W ednesday football ground on 15 April 1989 a n d to make
      re c o m m e n d a tio n s ab o u t the needs o f crowd control a n d safety a t sports events.

   3. Two Assessors were ap p o in ted to assist me: M r Brian Jo h n so n Q P M , C h ie f C onstab le o f Lancashire,
and Professor L eo n a rd M a u n d e r O BE, BSc, P hD , ScD, FEng, FT M ech E, Professor o f M echanical
Engineering at the U n iv ersity o f N ew castle u p o n Tyne. T h e ir help has been invalu ab le a n d I a m very grateful
for th e ir e x p e n ad v ice an d wise counsels. W hile th e sole responsibility for this r e p o n is m ine, I am co m fo n e d
in th e know ledge th a t b o th Assessors agree w ith it.

  4. M r R o b e rt W halley was ap p o in ted Secretary to the Inquiry. He a n d his assistants h av e worked
prodigiously a n d skilfully to give m e all the advice an d su p p o rt I could have w ished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help I have received, as always, from m y clerk, M r E rnest Pott.

    5. T h e policing arran gem en ts for 15 April were in the h an d s o f the S o u th Yorkshire Constabulary. The
efficacy o f those arran g em en ts an d th e ir im p lem en ta tio n was from an early stage called in to q u estio n. It was
therefore d ec id e d th a t th e investigation o f th e d isaster a n d the gathering o f evidence for this In q u iry should be
c o n d u c te d by a n in d e p en d e n t police force. M r Geoffrey D e a r Q P M , C h ie f C onstable o f West M idlands
C onstabulary, u n d e rto o k this task. H e was m a d e responsible directly to me; he a p p o in te d A ssistant C h ief
C o n stable M erv y n Jo n es to take full-time charge o f the investigation. I a m deep ly in d e b ted to b o th o f them.

  6. O n 18 April I visited Hillsborough S tadium . I inspected the scene o f th e disaster o n the terraces and all
relevant parts o f the sta d iu m an d its approaches. M y Assessors an d I have m ad e fu rth e r visits durin g the
Inquiry. I also v isited Liverpool on 21 an d 29 April.

    7. T h e Lord M ayor an d the Sheffield C ity C ouncil kindly offered to m ake th e a c c o m m o d a tio n a n d facilities
o f Sheffield Town Hall available for th e hearing o fo ra l evidence. Th is offer was gratefully accepted an d I would
like to record m y th a n k s for those facilities and for the co -operation afforded to the In q u iry by the authorities
in Sheffield.

   8. O n 28 A pril 1 9 8 9 ,1 held a p relim in ary hearing to an n o u n c e the date w h en the oral eviden ce would begin,
to give so m e direc tio n s as to the procedure I in ten ded to follow an d to h ear ap p lica tio n s from th o se wishing to
b e rep resen ted at the hearing. I accorded represen tatio n to the following:
       (i)     T h o se bereaved o r injured as a result o f the disaster.
       (ii)    T h e Football Supporters’ Association.
       (iii)   T h e Football Association.
       (iv)     Sheffield City Council.
       (v)      Sheffield W ednesday Football Club together w ith the Football League, the C lu b ’s casual staff an d
                th e ir insurers, the Sun Alliance.
       (vi)     S o u th Yorkshire Constabulary.
       (vii) S o u th Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority.
Subsequently, d uring the hearing. 1 further accorded representation to.
      (viii) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire M etropolitan A m bula nce Service
             (SYMAS).
and   (ix)   D r W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield W ednesday Football Club.

    9. Since the circum stances o f the disaster raised urgent q uestions o f safety, especially at football grounds,
you indicated at the outset that you would w elcome any rec o m m e n d atio n s, even o f an in terim n ature, which I
might be able to give in advance o f th e new football season d u e to c o m m en c e in m id-A ugust 1 9 8 9 .1 therefore
a n n o u n c e d at th e preliminary- hearing on 28 April tha t I would co n d u c t an oral hearing with all possible
expedition as th e first phase o f the Inquiry to discover the facts a n d causes o f the disaster an d enable m e to
m a k e any im m e d ia te interim r e c o m m e n d a tio n s necessary in the short term .

   10. T h e West M idlan ds Police investigation began on 24 April. A “ F re ephone” n u m b e r was advertised to
enable m e m b ers o f the public, especially those w ho h ad a tten d e d the m atch, to offer the ir evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this num ber was available for three days on 28 different lines. T he response from the public
was such th a t the lines were c o n tin u ed for a fu rth e r three days by the en d o f which 2,666 calls h ad been
received. T here were also many w ritten offers o f help. S om e 440 West M idlands officers were deployed on the
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in B irm ingham , Liverpool an d
Sheffield a n d c o m p u te r technology was used to the full. In all s o m e 3776 s ta te m en ts were taken. T h ere were
also som e 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry a n d to m e personally all o f which I read. T h e police,
Sheffield W ednesday Football Club an d the BBC had video ca m e ra s filming at th e gro u n d on 15 April. In
aggregate, they recorded some 71 hours o f film covering the perio d before, during an d a fter the disaster. T h u s
the m aterial g athered a n d potentially available for presentation at th e oral hearing was enorm ous. From this
m ass it was essential to select only sufficient good a n d reliable evidence necessary to establish the facts an d
causes o f the disaster.

   11. W here it seem ed likely th a t any allegation o r criticism m ight be m a d e o f th e c o n d u c t o f any person o r
party, th e Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, w rote to the party concerned
setting o u t the likely grounds for com plaint. T his followed the practice established by the Royal C om m ission
on T rib u n als o f Inquiry (the S alm o n C om m ission).

   12. T h e hearing began o n 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding on 29 June. In
that period. 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. C ounsel’s subm issions were delivered in w riting on 7 July an d
on 14 July I hea rd their brief oral subm issions supplem enting th e w ritten argum ent.

   13. W itnesses were not sworn. Since this is a departm ental inquiry, there was no pow er to ad m in ister the
oath but th e re was no instance o f any witness giving evidence which I considered m ight have been different
h ad he or she been sworn.

   14. T h e w itnesses called were only a small fraction o f those from w hom statem ents were or could have been
taken. N evertheless, I am satisfied that they were sufficient in n u m b e r a n d reliability to enable m e to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called m ore would have prevented m e from presenting an interim report in the
req u ired tim e a n d would n o t have a d d e d significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been able to
take into a c co u n t m any written sta te m en ts in add itio n to oral testimony.

    15. A part from the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry which was draw n from statem ents taken by
the West M id la n d s Police a n d others volunteered by individuals, each o f the represented parties was given full
o p p o r tu n ity to put forward any witnesses they considered s hould be called. A final subm ission was m ad e by
C ounsel for the South Yorkshire Police tha t since the investigation by West M idlands Police is still continuing,
all the evidence has not been assem bled a n d it would be unsafe for m e to m ake findings o f fact. I should
therefore m a k e clear that th e investigation c o ntinues principally to furnish as m uc h detail as possible to H M
C o r o n e r for the City of Sheffield as to the cause o f death, the precise position at dea th a n d the care an d
m o v e m e n t o f each o f the 95 victim s individually. 1 am assured by C h ie f Constable D ear a n d A ssistant C h ie f
C onstable M ervvn Jones th a t it is m ost unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter o r a d d to
the h istory o f events which emerged at the hearing.

    16. I should like to thank all those who m a d e it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
event a n d for evidence to be efficiently presented an d tested so as to give a full an d fair a c co u n t o f w hat
h a p p e n e d in all its aspects w ithout irrelevancy or duplication. I pay tribute particularly to the West M idlands
Police for the ir speed an d dedication in gathering the evidence a n d to all those responsible for processing it.
The most eloquent trib u te to the fairness an d thoroughness o f the police investigation ca m e from the Secretary
o f the Football Supporters' Association. He said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to w h e th e r that
investigation w ould be fair an d objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness sta te m e n ts
themselves. Hav ing heard the opening statem ent by C ounsel to the Inquiry based u pon th e evidence gathered
by the police, he found that it accorded entirely with his A ssociation’s evidence a n d th e initial anxiety was
wholly dispelled.

   17. Before a n d d u rin g the Inquiry I derived great assistance on a wide range o f technical issues from the
Health an d Safety Executive who providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research an d L ab o rato ry
Services D ivision) w here tests were conduc te d a n d reports p repared swiftly a n d efficiently. This was done
in close consu lta tion with Professor M aunder. I am most grateful to the Director, D r A Jones, a n d to the
D eputy Director, D r C E N icholson, for the ir invaluable help.

   18. I wish to c o m m e n d C ounsel to the inquiry, M r A ndrew Collins Q C, M r Alan G oldsack a n d M r
Bernard Phillips for th e ir industry, care a n d fairness in selecting a n d presenting the necessary evidence; also.
Counsel for all those represented who tested th a t evidence fully b ut expeditiously. T his Interim R e p o rt could
not possibly have been p repared in so short a tim e h ad I not h a d the w hole-hearted c o-operation o f all those

   19. T h e second phase o f th e Inquiry will be directed to m aking final a n d long te rm re c o m m e n d a tio n s about
crowd control a n d safety at sports grounds. I need to consider in d epth inform ation, o p in io n s a n d argum ents
from a w ide range o f sources a n d c o ntributors both here and abroad. It was clear fro m the o u tse t that this
second p hase c ould n o t be carried to com pletion before the next football season. However, at an early stage o f
the oral hearing I invited evidence from all w ho w ished to c o n trib u te to it a n d specifically from m a ny sporting,
local authority, emergency service a n d police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked tha t subm issions
should be in w riting an d should be m a d e prom ptly so th a t the second phase o f the In q u iry could

                            TH E G R O U N D A N D PRE-MATCH A R R A N G E M E N T S

Fixing The Venue
   21. O n 20 M arch 1989. the Football Association (the FA) requested that their C up sem i-final between
Liverpool an d N o ttin g h am Forest be held on 15 April at H illsborough Football Stadium. T h e corresp o n d in g
sem i-final between the sam e two te am s had been held the re in April 1988. T he arrangem ents h a d been
successful in th e view both o f the police a n d o f the host club. Sheffield W ednesday (the Club) were therefore
willing to a c c o m m o d a te the 1989 m atch. South Yorkshire C onstabulary were prepared to police it b u t only if
the ticketing a rran g e m en ts were the sam e as those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
T h o se arran g e m en ts d id not please Liverpool o r its su p p o rters either in 1988 o r 1989. They th ought th e ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police re q u ire m e n t was
accepted a n d th e m a tch was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

The Ground
  22. T h e H illsborough S tadium is som e 2 I/: miles to the north-west o f central Sheffield in th e district o f
O w lerton. T h e ground was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river D on. T h e pitch lies
roughly east to west. A plan o f the ground a n d its im m ediate en virons is at A ppendix 1.

  23. T h e west end. with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. The
east e n d ab u ts on P enistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river D on a n d to the north a residential street,
Vere Road, which ru n s between Leppings L ane an d P enistone R o ad N orth.

   24. Alongside th e river is a private roadw ay giving access to th e south stan d, to the D irec to rs’ a n d players'
e ntrances, a n d to the ad m in istra tiv e block u n d e r the stand. T he roadw ay gives both vehicular a n d pedestrian
access betw een P enistone Road a n d Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut it o f f at each end. T here
is som e car parkin g along this roadw ay principally for Directors, players a n d em plo v ee so f the Club. T he south
sta n d d ates from 1914 a n d is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8.800. 5.500 o f those are
roofed over a n d 3,300 are uncovered.

  25. T h e n o rth sta n d is also all seating a n d acco m m o d ates a bout 9.700. B ehind it is a g y m n a siu m o r sports
hall. T h ere are also a first aid room a n d police room close by.

  26. T h e east en d is all terracing a n d is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged and roofed over in 1986 a n d
now a c c o m m o d a te s so m e 21.000 sta nding spectators. T here are crush barriers in the Kop r u n n in g parallel to
the goal line but n o dividing fences to prevent free m ovem ent from side to side.

   27. At the west o r Leppings Lane end o f the ground there is terracing closc to the pitch. B ehind it is the west
sta n d w hich provides covered seating a n d was built in 1965 for World C u p m atches, som e o f w hich were held
at H illsborough in 1966. T he covered sta n d ac co m m odates 4.456 seated spectators. The terracing in front o f it
e xtends higher in the corners between the stands and its total capacity was stated to be 10,100. At b o th the Kop
en d a n d the west en d access to the pitch is barred by p erim eter fencing. T h e fencing is ab o u t eight feet high
m o u n te d upon the low wall at the foot o f the terracing. At the top o f the fencing the wire r e tu rn s bac k at a sharp
angle for so m e 15 inches to m ake it difficult for anyone to clim b over tow ards the pitch. T h ere are gates at
intervals along th e perim eter fencing to afford access between terrace a n d pitch. These gates are less than a
m e tre w ide an d were designed to be o p en e d only from the pitch side for police p urposes o r in an emergency.
They are m a rk e d and n u m b e re d on the plan A ppendix 1.

   28. U nlike the Kop end. the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with th e goal line but radial
fences at right angles to it. d ividing the area into pens. T h is division was begun after an FA C u p semi-final in
1981 w hen crushing occurred due to overcrowding an d gates had to be opened. It proceeded in stages, the final
a rran g e m en t being shown on the plan A ppendix 1. T h e first section o f the west terracing m oving south to north
c o n ta in s gates 1 and 2 and is known as p ens 1 and 2 although in fact constituting only on e pen. N ext is pen 3
with o n e gate: next pen 4 with one gate: pen 5, which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
div id e pen 4 from pen 6. T his was to isolate h o m e an d away fans on occasions w hen b o th might be
a c c o m m o d a te d on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-w est corner. Pens 5 ,6
an d 7 each have a perim eter gate. At the back o f the pens, u n d e r the front o f the west stand, th e re is a gate in
e a c h radial fence. W hen those gates are open, the back row o f the terracing is intended to perm it access from
pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, w hen substantial n um bers are present, those gateways are not
readily \ isible o r accessible. The present layout o f th e pens, fences, crush barriers and gates has resulted from a
series o f piecemeal changes. The nature an d effect o f those changes m ust be considered later.

The Turnstiles
   29. Because o f the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north side o f the ground. Along
Penistone Road N o rth there are som e 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop and to the east
end o f the north stand. They are m arked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. T he 12 num bered 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the north sta n d but were not used for that p urpose on 15 April in o rd e r to segregate supp orters o f the
two team s as a p p e ars later. Two o f them , 7 7 and 78, were however used for access to the Kop.

  30. At the so u th side o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles (n u m b ered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
num bered 37 to 42 led to the K o p a n d the rest to the south stand.

  31. In sum m ary, the south and east sides o f the ground ac co m m o d a te d som e 29,800 w hose access o n the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. T he o th e r two sides o f the ground, north a n d west, with a capacity o f 24,256 were fed solely from the
Leppings Lane en tra n c e w here there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the Ground
  33. Most su p p o rte rs were expected to com e by road although rail transport was available. N ottingham
supporters travelling by train would arrive at the m a in line Sheffield M idland Station w hence they would be
directed a n d escorted northw ards by the police. T hey would arrive at th e ground along Penistone Road.
N ottingham s u p p o rters travelling by coach, m ini-bus o r car would approach Sheffield from the south m ainly
on the M 1. Again th e ir arrival at the ground would p red o m in an tly be via Penistone Road or H erries Road.

   34. Liverpool supp orters travelling by norm al rail service would arrive at Sheffield M idland Station just
like their N o ttin g h a m counterparts. T he police a im e d to segregate the rival fans and put th e m into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
catering solely for football supporters an d situated to the n o rth o f the ground. A police escort was available to
conduct them o n foot to the Leppings L ane entrance. T hose com ing from Liverpool by road would approach
Sheffield either via the M62 an d down the M 1 from the n o rth or across the Pennines from the north west. All
such routes w ould b ring them to the ground via on e o r o th e r lim b o f Leppings Lane as shown on A ppendix 1.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north an d west: arrivals from N ottingham
would be from th e south a n d east.

Allocation of Places and Tickets
  35. Experience in recent years has p roduced a policy o f segregation to prevent trouble between s upporters
of rival teams. T h e need for this policy to be m a in ta in e d was endorsed a n d em phasised by the Popplewell
Report following the Bradford City disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 semi-final the police decided
that sections o f the Hillsborough S tadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation o f
Liverpool and N o ttin g h a m Forest fans. T he section to be granted to each was d eterm ine d by the direction
whence each p re d o m in a n tly approached. Thus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides o f the ground
for which access was from Leppings Lane. N ottin g h am Forest were allotted th e s o u t h a n d east sides with access
from Penistone Road.

   36. The effect o f the decision was tha t for this all-ticket C u p Tie. Liverpool were allotted only 24,256 places
as against 29.800 for N ottingham Forest. This, although average atten d a n ce o f supporters at hom e m atches
was substantially higher at Liverpool th a n at N ottingham . Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 and seats at
£12. N ottin g h am Forest had 21.000 standing places co m p ared with Liverpool's 10.100. So. Liverpool’s
allocation was m o re expensive as well as smaller. U nderstandably. Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
o f places and tickets. T hey sought with some su p p o rt from the host club and the FA to have it changed in
1988. but the police were ada m a n t. To switch e n d s would, in their o p inion, have involved rival supporters
crossing each o th e r's paths when approaching the ground thereby frustrating atte m p ts at segregation and
creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989. w hen the sa m e plan was proposed. Liverpool again challenged it. The
police, however, m a in ta in e d their view, adding that those who had attende d in 1988 w ould be familiar w ith the
arrangements a n d tha t any change would lead to confusion.
Access from Leppings Lane
    37. As the plan A ppendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck o r forecourt at
a b end in Leppings Lane where, com ing from the north, it turns to the south-west and crosses a bridge over the
river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supp orters had been arranged north an d west o f the ground. They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs of Leppings Lane and w ould converge on the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line o f railings with six sets o f d o uble gates. Inside
those p erim eter gates is the short ap p ro a ch to the turnstiles. As shown in the p h otographs A ppendix 2. the
la tter are in two sections divided by a fence. T h e n orthern section consists o f turnstiles 1 to 16. N um bers 1 to
 10 gave access to the north stand. T h u s there were 10 turnstiles for the 9,700 with north stand seats. T heir
tickets were m a rk e d "E ntrance A” a n d were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above them an d brown b oards on the wall.

   38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for tho se w ith seats in the west stand. T h u s 4,456 were served by six turnstiles.
T hey were the next block to the right o f those m a rk e d A. However, instead o f these turnstiles and the west stand
tickets being m arked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were m arked C. T h e ir colour-code on
tickets an d b oards was red.

   39. O n the o th e r side o f the dividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
10.100 w ith tickets for the west terracing. T hose seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. T h is was because there
had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings L ane an d the sequential num b e rin g co n tin u ed from 19 upw ards
on the south side o f the ground. W hen the n u m b e r at Leppings Lane was brought u p to 23 the present
arran g e m en ts o f 1 to 1-6. A to G and then 19 upw ards was adopted to avoid re-num bering all r o u n d the ground.
However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. “ E ntrance B” also appeared on tickets for the west
terrace. T hus, the three blocks o f turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings L ane en d read from
left to right A. C, B. T he colour-code for west terrace tickets a n d the boards beside turnstiles A to G was mauve.
To the right o f turnstile G is a tubulai steel b arrier to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadw ay to the
south stand.

Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
  40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. T here is an exit gate (m arked A
on A ppendix 1) between turnstile 1 an d the adjacent housing.

  41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 an d 7 a n d the steps to the west stand. T here is a
wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It h ad been built to segregate hom e a n d away fans at a
tim e w hen the Club intended they sh ould share the west terrace. T h a t idea was not pursued but the wall
rem ained. T here was, however, a gateway in the wall which d id p ermit access between the two areas. An exit
gate (m ark ed B o n A ppendix 1) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

   42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse b o u n d e d on the left by the wall just
m e n tio n e d a n d on the right by the wall o f the private roadway coming from the south sta n d to Leppings Lane,
T h e re was an exit gate in the latter wall (m arked C on A ppendix 1) just inside turnstile G.

    43. All three exit gates. A, B and C, were o f concertina design. They could be open ed only from the inside
a n d were not in tended for entry o f spectators into the ground.

    44. T hose entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. T hey could by-
m oving to the right go round the south e n d o f the west s ta n d and gain entry into pens 1 a n d 2. T hey could go
through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse b ehind turnstiles 11 to 16 an d then round the north
e n d o f the west sta n d into pens 6 or 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting th e m to take either o f
those courses. T h e obvious way in was straight ahe ad o f the turnstiles w here a tunnel u n d e r the m id d le o f the
west sta n d gave access to pens 3 an d 4. Above its entrance in large letters was the word "S ta n d in g " an d a large
letter “ B“ . T h u s B ticket holders were draw n towards the tunnel.

   45. The length o f the tunnel is s o m e 23 metres. It rises slightly at first th e n levels oft but finally descends
tow ards the terraces at a gradient o f 1 in 6. As it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the radial
fence between pen 3 on the right an d pen 4 on the left. A short spur o f brick wall projects forward from each side
o f the tunnel at its m outh. Those em erging are thus guided straight forw ard rather than to either side. T he
p h o to g rap h at A ppendix 3 shows the west sta n d a n d terraces.

   46. As with the layout on the terraces, the configuration o f the Leppings Lane turnstiles a n d the areas inside
th e m was effected by a series of piecemeal changes. Again, it w ill be necessary to analyse th e ir resultant effect.


                                                            6
Policing A r r a n g e m e n t s
   4 7 . At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been u n d e r the control o f C h ief S up erin te n d en t Mole, then
C o m m a n d e r o t'F Division within whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 M arch 1989 when
the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over c o m m a n d o f F D ivision on 27 M arch to
S uperinten dent D u c k e n fie ld o n th e latter's p ro m o tio n to C h ie f S uperintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 M arch, but on 27 March M r Mole bowed out a n d M r D uckenfield took over. U n d e r h im were
Sector C o m m a n d e rs , all S uperintendents with m uch experience o f policing football m atches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular. S uperintendent Marshall was in charge o f the area outside the Leppings Lane
entrance a n d th e app roaches to it. S uperinten dent G reenw ood was in c o m m a n d inside the ground, b u t this
included the area between the turnstiles an d the perim eter fence. They thereby sw apped roles from the
previous year. U n d e r M r D uckenfield’s overall c o m m a n d were som e 801 officers an d men on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers an d others from D D ivision to deal w ith the influx o f supporters into the city centre.
In all. therefore, som e 1.122 police were deployed for this m atch am o u n tin g to a b o u t 38 per cent o f the total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the m o u n ted section o f 34 were officers from Liverpool an d N o ttin g h am to
assist respectively in m arshalling their ho m e supporters. T he total at the g r o u n d was d ivid ed into serials
consisting usually o f eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant a n d an Inspector. T h e serials were posted to duties
at various stations in an d aro u n d the ground in three phases: before, during a n d after the match. All o f this
was provided for in an O perational O rd er w hich followed closely the O rd e r d raw n up for the 1988 semi-final
an d took into account the force's “S tanding Instructions for the Policing o f Football G ro u n d s ” . T he O rd e r
described the duties o f each serial at each phase. It was supple m e nted by oral briefings before a n d on the day of
the match.

Sheffield Wednesday's Arrangements
  48. T he C lub provided 376 stewards, gatem en a n d turnstile operators for d u ty on 15 April. T he stewards
were briefed as to the ir duties on the m orning o f the m atch by police Inspectors a n d were allocated ro u n d the
ground. T hey wore yellow tabards. T he C lub's control room , situated below the south stand, could
com m un icate by V H F radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in their control room showing all th e turnstiles round the ground. A c o m p u terise d counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed o n to a screen in the Club control room the running total of
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end. there would be
separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). W hen the total for any section was w ithin 15 p e r c e n t of its p e rm itte d capacity a w arning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing tha t w arning w ould o ccur when the n u m b e rs were w ithin 15 per
cent o f the total terrace capacity of 10.100. W h a t the system could not d o was m o n ito r the distribu tion o f fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give n o w arning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications
   49. T he nerve centre for police control is the control room o r box situated at the south-west c o rn e r o f the
ground between the south s tand and pen 1 o f the west terracing. T he box is elevated an d reached by a n u m b e r
o f steps. It has windows c o m m an d in g views across the pitch a n d straight a k ng the line o f the west perim eter
fence. T he box is very small a n d has seats for only three officers. S u perinte ndent M urray was in control o f it
and was advisor to M r Duckenfield as he h ad been to M r Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
G o d d ard who o pera ted the radios. T he th ird seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone
and public address systems. At the back o f the box stood Police C onstable B ichard who was in control o f the
police closed circuit television system o p era ted by a row o f consoles on a bench in front o f him a n d b eh in d the
three seated officers.

  50. T here were five television screens showing views o f five roving cam eras fixed at high points on the
stands a n d directed both inside an d outside the ground. T here was also a m aster screen which flicked in
rotation from o n e cam era view to a n o th e r a n d w hich m a d e a video recording. T he cam eras have a zoom
facility to close in on any point o f interest. Specifically, there were good cam era views o f the west terracing, o f
the l.eppings Lane turnstiles a n d beyond them o f Leppings Lane itself.

  51. T he T annoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
ground an d o utside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed u n d er the police control box. to relay
music before the m atch, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
speakers or if a p p ro p riate to o n e area only.
     33.    R a d io contact at Hillsborough from control to serials o p era tin g both inside a nd outside the ground was
U H F on channel 25. There was a W1 FU portable base station in the control box an d if it failed there was a
stand-by station u n d er the o p e ra to r's bench. H an d sets w ere issued to all ranks o f Sergeant an d above.
C o m m u n ity C onstables o n duty would already have th e ir own. O th e r C onstables had no radio.
C o m m u n ic a tio n was on “talk th ro u g h ” i.e. any message from any source w ould be h eard by everyone tuned in
a n d if m ore th a n o ne source spoke messages could b ecom e garbled. Ear pieces were issued to som e officers in
an a tte m p t to o vercom e the loud crowd noise which m ade receipt o f signals very difficult. T h ere were other
r a d io channels open to Sergeant G o d d a rd : V H F to police H ea dquarte rs at Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI
S ub-divisional H eadquarters at H a m m e rto n Road a n d channel 19 used by CID. T here was also a set tuned to
Sheffield W e d n esd ay ’s radio system between its control room a n d the stewards.

Early Arrivals
   54. 15 April 1989 was a w arm sunny spring Saturday. T he m a tch was a sell-out, so 54.000 ticket holders
were expected. O thers would com e w itho ut tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain access otherwise.
T he following account concentrates, as d id the evidence, on the western approa che s an d the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. T h ey began to arrive in the H illsborough area qu ite early in
small num bers. Som e brought cans o f beer w ith them a n d were seen drinking as they walked; o th e rs took
advantage o f the w eather a n d sat ab o u t on walls a n d open spaces. W hen the public houses o pened, m any
resorted there, d rinking inside or spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane a n d its environs com p rise a
mixed shopping a n d residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house or off-licence. Many were asking for tickets or "spares’'. T here were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, som e o f the fans were using private gardens an d yards to urinate. As the m orning
wore on, n u m b e rs increased. Requests for tickets a n d trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevailing
mood was o ne o f carnival, good h u m o u r a n d expectation.

Public Houses
  55. T here were some 74 shops w ith off-licences in an d aro u n d Sheffield. In general, they o pened at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters did visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great a m o u n t o f alcoholic d rin k was
bought there.

  56. O pening tim e at public houses was in general 1 1 am . S om e rem a in e d closed all day. O f the others, some
72, mostly in the city, were frequented by local patro n s only. S om e 23 public houses, however, served over a
hundred Liverpool supporters each. A n o th er 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
many supporters d ran k enough to affect the ir m ood. At first ex citem ent: later frustration.

The Gathering Crowd
   57. Towards the en d o f the m orning, fans gathered on a n d a r o u n d the bridge n e a r the Leppings Lane
entrance. They seem ed reluctant to enter the groun d early. All turnstiles were open a t 12 noon a n d one o r two
as early as 11.30 am . Some 53 police had been deployed to opera te o utside the turnstiles an d in the Leppings
Lane area. T hey e nquired at ran d o m w h eth e r fans h ad tickets. T h o se w ho had not were advised to go away;
nevertheless, m any returned m ore than once. T hose who had tickets were guided in the right direction. T he
police tried to persuade them to enter the g ro u n d early. Officers, m ale a n d female, h ad been posted outside
each turnstile w ith the du ty o f searching e n tra n ts for weapons, d rin k o r drugs. O n ce through the turnstile, an
entrant was liable to be searched again by one o f a serial o f officers positioned ju st inside.

   58. At ab o u t 12 noon C h ie f Inspector C reaser asked S u p erin te n d en t M urray w h eth e r the pens on the west
terrace were to be filled oni by one successively, but was told th a t they shou1A i!' be available from the start an d
the fans should find their own level.

   59. By 2 pm it was a p p a ren t to those inside the ground an d those m onitoring events in the police a n d Club
control room s th a t the n u m b e r o f N ottin g h am fans in their places greatly o u tn u m b e r e d those from Liverpool.
T he Kop a n d the south stand were filling u p steadily, but the n o rth a n d west stands were half empty. It was
noted ab o u t tha t tim e that the turnstile figures showed only 12.000 h ad entered as against 20,000 at the same
time the previous year. On the west terraces, although pens 3 a n d 4 were filling, the wing pens 1 ,2 ,6 a n d 7 were
nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 a n d 4 to move forw ard an d m ake ro o m for
others.

  60. T here h ad been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. T his time, there was only one. It arrived
early, ju st before 2 pm. at Wadsley Bridge station. T he 350 passengers were m et by both m o u n ted a n d foot
police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. T hey were orderly and passed through
the turnstiles into the ground by a bou t 2.20 p m w ith o u t incident.

  61. By this tim e the police Traffic D ivision reported that th e Liverpool routes were clear, so the m ajority o f
Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. T he num be rs converging on the Leppings Lane en tra n c e were
increasing rapidly. Between the perim eter gates an d the turnstiles the crowd b ecam e congested. T h e re was no
longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole ap p ro a c h area. T he foot officers
outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone a n d had difficulty in searching even selectively.
M ou n te d officers in and outside the turnstile area were having difficulty m a noeuvring in such a dense crowd.
The police were beset by fans b em u sed by the ticket a n d turnstile labelling asking for directions. M any had
been d rinking but up t o a n d j u s t after 2.30 pm the m ood rem ained good.

   62.      S u p erin te n d en t Marshall was on foot am ongst the crowd. He becam e anxious about the num be rs
com ing d ow n Leppings Lane a n d spilling o u t on to the roadway w here buses a n d cars were moving. At 2.17
pm he r a d io e d to control to have m o to r traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. This was eventually d o n e at about
2.30 pm. U p to this time, despite the large m ass outside the turnstiles a n d the n u m b e rs still approaching, there
was still no panic in the crowd: no perception o f crisis by the police. In the control room M r Murray, w ho could
see Leppings Lane on the video, advised M r D uckenfield tha t they would get everyone in by 3 pm . Mr
D ucke n field reaffirm ed to him the policy ab o u t a delayed kick-off. It would be o rd e re d only if there was som e
m a jo r external factor such as fog on the Pennines o r delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely tu r n e d up
late even in large numbers.

    63. In the 20 m inutes from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm there were crucial developm ents both inside a n d outside
the ground. In pens 3 an d 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as m ore fans cam e through the tunnel to the
favoured area b eh in d the goal. By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree w hich caused serious
discomfort to m a ny well used to en d u rin g pressure on terraces. T he n u m b e rs at that tim e were clearly in excess
o f the m a x im u m d ensity stated by the H o m e Office G u id e to Safety at Sports G ro u n d s (1986 Edn) (the G reen
G uide) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the G reen G u id e has no statutory or legal force, it is the
only official advice available a bo ut safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1, 2. 6 an d 7. there was still
am ple room a n d bare patches o f concrete were visible.

  64. M eanw hile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As m ore arrived at the back the crush at the
front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles b ecam e m ore difficult. T h e ir efficiency w as im p aired a n d their rate
reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the b u ild -u p increased. T he foot
officers outside were u nable to function an d in danger them selves so they went through the turnstiles a n d o u t
again through gate C w here they d id w hat they c ould to relieve pressure by the t u b u lar barrier. T he m o u n ted
officers were s u rro u n d e d by th e d e n s e mass o f people and becam e ineffective. S u p erin te n d e n t M arshall was in
the m idst o f the turm oil. H e extricated h im self an d stood on a para p et o f the bridge to get a clear view. A
drunken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a m o u n te d officer. But these were isolated acts by
individuals', the m enace cam e from the massive n u m b e rs single-m indedly d eterm in e d to be in for the kick-off
with tim e r u n n in g out. At the back o f the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack o f progress as 3 o ’clock
approached. Some, mostly young m en who had been drinking, tried to push an d force their way forward. At
the front, people were ja m m e d together and against the turnstile walls. Some panicked as the pressure
intensified. Som e youngsters an d w om en were fainting a n d in distress. They were helped o u t through the
tubular barrier by tu m stile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans clim bed up a n d over the
turnstile building or on to the dividing fence. T h is was to escape the crush rather th a n to gain free entry since
most o f them had tickets.

   65. At 2.44 p m M r Marshall radioed for reinforcem ents, for the Tannoy to request the crowd to stop
pushing and for a vehicle w ith loudspeaker e q u ip m e n t to co m e a n d request the same. U nhappily, at ab o u t 2.40
pm, radio c o m m u n ic a tio n on channel 25 becam e defective. For a perio d o f two o r three m inutes th e control
room lost contact. A co m m u n ic a tio n s officer ca m e p ro m p tly a n d switched to the sta n d b y station. W ith the use
o f a handset at control, contact was restored. D espite this hiatus, two o f M r M arshall’s requests were received.
The Tannoy was used b u t with little effect. R einforcem ents, including m o u n te d officers from P enistone Road,
were sent. T h e th ird request, for a Landrover. was received direct by its driver PC Buxton w ho arrived at 2.46
pm an d urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. T h is was no m ore effective th a n the Tannoy. T he
m ounted officers besieged n ear the turnstiles c a m e outside the p erim eter gates. An a tte m p t was m a d e to shut
them against the crowd outside, to enable the th rong inside to be dispersed or a t least th in n e d through the
turnstiles. T h e pressure from without, however, open e d the gates again. M ounted officers, now reinforced to
greater num bers, form ed a cordon across the elbow o f Leppings L ane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
with the object o f reducing pressure inside the gates. T hey were successful in this for som e m in u tes despite
desperate in dividuals forcing their way under or between the horses. However, this exercise was overtaken by a
more d ra m a tic relief o f the pressure.

“Open the Gates"
   66. Between 2.40 pm an d 2.45 pm the crowd inside a n d ou tside the turnstile app ro a ch had swelled to
over 5.000. At the h ead o f the phalanx co nditions h ad b ecom e intolerable. T hose w ho got through were short
o f breath a n d sweating profusely. Many co m p lain ed to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
and asked th e m in forceful term s to d o something. Exit gates A an d B were being shaken. It was clear the crowd
could n ot pass through the turnstiles by 3 pm. Police C onstable B uxton rad ioe d from the L androver to control
asking that kick-off be postponed. T he suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

  67. S up erin te n d en t Marshall realised the crowd had becom e unm anageable. A lthough loth to d o so. since it
was contrary to basic police strategy, he d ecided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.
Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. O th e r senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
radioed control to p erm it the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm, whilst M r D uckenfield was considering the
request, gate C op en e d to eject a youth who h ad clim bed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
advantage a n d about 150 m anaged to get in before a m o u n te d officer enabled the gate to be closed again. M r
Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. H e repeated it a third time, adding that if the
gates were not opened someone was going to be killed. In the control room . M r Duckenfield had not m ade a
decision. M r M urray asked him "Are you going to o pen the gates?". M r Duckenfield gave the order and Sgt
G o d d a r d radioed to Mr Marshall “O pen the gates". N either the Club control room n o r any police officers
inside the turnstiles were told o f this ord er before or after it was given or o f any action it would require.

    68. At 2.52 pm. gate C was opened wide. Fans behind turnstiles A to G a n d from the concourse beyond
c a m e ro u n d to flow through it in large num bers.

   69. A bout two m inutes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gateman's
objection, for it to be opened. If it was not, he said, “ It’ll go a n d som eone will get killed” . Perm ission was given,
but this tim e reserve serials were alerted to m o n ito r the inrush towards th e n o rth stand. G a te B was also briefly
o p e n e d against the g atem a n’s wishes a n d ab o u t 200 o f those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
left.

   70. T he largest entry, however, was through gateC . In the five m inutes it was open ab o u t 2,000 fans passed
through it steadily at a fast walk. Some m ay have had tickets for the stands. N o d o u b t som e h a d no tickets at all.
T h e m ajority had tickets for the terraces. O f these, som e found their way either right to pens 1 an d 2 or left
through the d ivid ing wall to 6 an d 7. But a large pro p o rtio n h eaded straight for the tunnel in front o f them.

                                                   THE DISA STER

   71. T he initial influx through gate C. augm ented by e n tra n ts via the turnstiles, ca m e through the tunnel
with great m o m e n tu m . Fans spoke o f being swept through, feet o f f the ground. T he 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
their progress. U p o n reaching the crowded pens, som e wished to go back but were unable to d o so. The new
arrivals found them selves pushed forward a n d the pressure becam e intense. At 2.54 pm, shortly after this
influx began, the te am s cam e onto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. Many were now
acutely uncom fortable and some were in distress. T he m ass seethed ab o u t but voluntary m ovem ent by any
individual was difficult; hands down could not be raised a n d som e fans found it hard to breathe. Still the flow
continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. T here were shouts for help a n d for the gates to be
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the p erim eter track d id not im m ediately react. In the deafening noise
from chantin g a n d shouting they d id not at first recognise the problem. Realisation cam e at different m om ents
to d ifferen t officers in different places.

   72. G ate 3 sprang o pen u nder the intense pressure from within. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. T hose seeking to escape were urged a n d p ushed back. G ate
4 was open ed by a policem an who n oticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it a n d were directed
to the wing pens where there was still am p le room. M eanwhile, gate 4 was closed again a n d then re-opened. At
gate 3. a Constable, now alive to th e crisis, followed strictly his w ritten orders a n d radioed for perm ission to
open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon h im self to open it.

  73. Just before 3 pm . the m atch kicked off. At the sam e tim e, gate C. which h ad been closed at 2.57 pm.
was reopened a n d a steady trickle c o n tin u e d to enter through the tunnel.

   74. To escape the crush, fans began clim bing the radial fences out o f pens 3 a n d 4 into pens 2 a n d 5. O thers
tried to get over the front perim eter fence but were at first tu rn ed back by police w ho feared a pitch invasion.
Near the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the point o f collapse a n d in som e instances death but
they were held upright by pressure all round. F urther back, most were so preoccupied with the pain o f being
pressed against barriers an d with breathing p roblem s that they saw n o th in g o f the game. But at the rear there
were m any who. although cram ped, were watching the football unaw are o f the distress at the front.

  75. At 3.04 pm. Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. There was a roar from the
Liverpool fans a n d at the same tim e a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. T h e several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the pitch. T h e force b ec am e such as to twist
and break two spans o f a crush barrier towards the front o f pen 3. T h e evidence does not establish with
certainty w hen this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm. But l a m sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. W h en the b a rrier broke those w hom it had
supported were projected towards the perim eter fence. M any fell a n d the involuntary rush o f those behind
pressed them down. T he crushing force was tran sm itted a n d dispersed so tha t all along the front o f pen 3 fans
were pressed hard up against the low wall a n d the wire m esh o f the fence above it.

  76. In pen 4 no b a rrier broke. N evertheless those at the front were cru sh e d against wall a n d fence. Further
back, two barriers were bowed and som e individuals suc cum be d to the pressure a ro u n d them.

   77. Surges on terraces are co m m o n . Usually, they go forward, th e n recede. Here, with the weight o f
num bers, there was no receding. T he pressure stayed a n d for those crushed breathless by it. standing o r prone,
life was ebbing away. If n o relief c a m e in four m inutes there would be irreversible brain dam age; if longer,
death.

  78. In the control ro o m no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything am iss in pens 3 a n d 4 until the first
fans spilt out o n to the p erim eter track ju st before kick-off. T hen, the officers in c o m m a n d assum ed that there
was an atte m p te d pitch invasion. T hey called up reserve serials waiting in the g y m n a siu m a n d all available
officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was m a d e to H Q for dog handlers.

   79. S u p erin te n d en t G reenw ood, the G r o u n d C o m m an d e r, was by the players' tunnel at the kick-off. He
noticed fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As he approached, he d id not think the pens
overcrowded until he was very close a n d saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
situation " retrievable" if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. H e clim bed on the wall below the fence
and signalled w ith bo th hands to those beh ind to move back. O th e r officers jo in e d him . It was impossible.
Those fans w ho would have wished to com ply were powerless to do so. Behind them, there were still many
unaw are o f the crisis, watching the game. The football continued to jo v o u s s h o u tin g a n d singing round the rest
o f the ground while those crushed an d trappe d slowly expired.

  80.    W hen Mr G reenw ood's signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for th e m atch to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his a rm s tow ards the control
box. M r D uckenfield sent M r M urray down from the box to have the m atch sto pped via the linesm an, the
agreed em ergency drill. Before he could do so. Mr G reenw ood ran over the pitch to the referee w h o stopped the
game. It was 5/: m inutes past 3.

                                                  TH E AFTERM ATH

Rescue A ttempts
   81. From 3 o'clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and rem a in e d so. At first, fans had walked or staggered out
w inded an d faint. But the final surge at 3.04 pm . and the struggle to reach the o pen gates, caused a horrendo us
blockage o f bodies. T h e dead, the dying an d the desperate becam e interwoven in th e su m p at the front o f the
pens, especially by the gates. Those with strength left clam bered over others subm erged in the h u m a n heap an d
tried to clim b out over the fence. They were now helped by p o lic e a n d o th e r fans w ho hauled them up an d over.
N u m b ers o f fans were climbing over the radial fences into adjac en t pens. At the back, m any were hauled up
into the west stand to relieve the pressure.

   82. T he steps from the su m p at gateways 3 an d 4 were so congested with b odies live an d d e a d th a t each had
to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A n u m b e r o f individual
officers an d fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow that only tw o o r three
could get at the entw ined bodies Willing h ands got in one a n o th e r's way. M ore officers arriv ed from the
gym nasium a n d elsewhere in the ground. Many used their own initiative to help those laid o u t o n th e pitch, to
assist in getting others over the fencing an d to com fort the distressed. But som e stood in groups near the
perim eter fence not knowing what to do. The> had been s u m m o n e d in response to w hat was th ought to be a
threat to public order. W h a t they found was a hori ific scene o f carnage an d som e young officers were shocked
into im potence by w hat they saw.

  83. It was truly gruesome. The victims were blue, cyanotic, incontinent; the ir m o u th s open, vom iting; their
eyes staring. A pile o f d ea d bodies lay an d grew outside gate 3. Extending fu rth e r a n d further on to th e pitch, the
injured were laid down a n d attem pts m a d e to revive them . M ore a n d m ore walking survivors flooded out on to
the pitch as the players left. The scene was em otive a n d chaotic as well as g ruesom e. As th e e n o rm ity o f the
disaster was realised, m any o f the fans milling about were bitter a n d hostile to the police, b la m ing them for
w hat had happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat u p o n a n d even assaulted. A small n u m b e r o f
hysterical fans had to be subdued.

  84. A dding to the chaos, a n um ber o f press photographers dodged ab o u t am o n g rescue w orkers apparently
avid to secure photographs at point blank range o f those d ying th ro u g h the wire mesh a n d th o se laid on the
pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them. Police had to intervene.

   85. At a bout 3.12 pm . C h ief S up erin te n d en t Nesbit. C o m m a n d e r o f the Traffic D ivision, arrived on the
pitch. He took charge at gate 3 a n d organised a chain o f officers to sim plify a n d expedite the extraction o f
casualties from the pen. In the absence o f any mechanical m eans, police a n d fans together pulled an d worked
at the wire mesh with their bare h ands and their feet to breach the fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
enabling officers to get in an d fans to be got out.

   86. By now. som e officers of their own initiative w ent r o u n d from the pitch to the tunn el w here they met
other officers from the turnstiles and the west stand. Together, they tried to p ersuade fans at the rea r o f the pens
to go back through the tunnel. Som e com plied, but m any resisted, wishing to s tand their g round. Casualties
were brought out through the tunnel, a n d as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers w ere able to get
further in and bring out more casualties, dead and alive. T hey were laid on the ground in the concourse outside
the tunnel an d a ttem p ts were m a d e to revive them.

First Aid
  87. T he St John A m bulance Brigade had som e 30 p ersonnel posted ro u n d the ground for the m atch - 25
adults a n d 5 ju n io r cadets. They were quickly on the scene when the first casualties em erged a n d sought to
revive them. T heir D ivisional S uperinte nden t. M r Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help those pressed against the
fencing by feeding oxygen to them through the mesh until they could be got out.

  88. D r Purcell. Sheffield W ednesday's doctor, c a m e from his seat in the south sta n d a n d a tte m p te d
resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he m oved from p atien t to patient d o ing w hat he could,
but in most cases it was too late.

  89. At 3.13 pm a St John's am b u la n c e cam e on to the pitch at the north-east corner a n d drove to the
perim eter fence close to gate 3. T here was no call for doctors a n d nurses on the public ad dress system until
nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the m inu tes ticked past, some o f them ca m e onto the pitch to help o f their
own accord when they saw the casualties and the am bulance an d realised the gravity o f the situation. Ma
fans also worked prodigiously in atte m p ts to revive the dead an d the dying, in some cases th e ir own rclatn
and friends. Artificial respiration, m o u th to m ou th respiration an d cardiac massage were applied by the skill
a n d the unskilled but usually in vain. T hose capable o f survival mostly cam e round o f their own accord. T
rest were mostly d oom ed before they could be brought out a n d treated.

    90. T here was an urgent need to get casualties off the pitch a n d to hospital. T here were six stretchers in tl
first aid room and three in the St J o h n ’s am bulance. They were quickly brought into use. T h en the fai
im provised by tearing down the hoardings arou nd the edge o f the pitch an d against the stands so th a t lengths (
b o ard could be used as stretchers. Im provising in this way. parties o f fans a n d police ran repeatedly the lengt
o f th e pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A n u m b e r were d e a d on arrival there.

In the Control Room
  91. M r D uckenfield stayed in the control room. C h ie f Inspecto r M cR obbie was there in civilian clothes a
an observer. M r D uckenfield sent him dow n to the track to tell a policew om an at gate 1 to a d m it those
displaced from the centre pens. Mr D uckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw so m e o n e laic
on th e pitch. Even then, he d id not realise the nature o f the problem or its scale.

  92. M r M urray returned from his a tte m p t to stop the m atch and M r D uckenfield sent him down again to
clear the pitch a n d assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. This was
because M r D uckenfield could not from the control room see clearly what was h appe n ing for the milling and
increasing numbers.

   93. T h e Assistant C h ie f C onstable (Operations). M r Jackson, had atte n d e d the m atch in civilian clothes as
a guest o f the Club. He cam e from his seat in the south stand to ask what h a d h appe ned. M r D uckenfield was
unable to say: he did not tell M r Jackson that the exit gates h ad been opened o n his authority. M r Jackson went
dow n to th e pitch to discover the situation.

   94. At 3.06 p m Mr Duckenfield. still prim arily co ncerned ab o u t public order, caused a message to be sent
to H e a d q u a rte rs asking for O peration Support. T h at was a call for all available add itio n a l police resources to
co m e to the ground to strengthen the police presence.

   95. M r Jackson was told by M r G reenw ood that there were casualties an d returned im m ediately to control
to m a k e sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile. M r M urray had seen th e plight o f those b eh in d the
fence. H e radioed to control that a fleet o f am bulances was required. H e also asked for a Tannoy b roadcast to
those in th e pens to move back but there is no clear evidence that it was m ade,

   96. O nly when Mr D uckenfield received the request for a fleet o f am b ulances d id he realise the n a tu re and
gravity o f th e situation. Then, supported by M r Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting O peration
S u p p o rt into calls for the M ajor Disaster Plan.

N o Information
   97. A part from the message to clear the pitch an d the belated call for medical assistance about 3.30 pm. no
in fo rm a tio n or advice was broadcast on the public address system. M r D uckenfield feared that the crowd
might tu rn hostile or might all attem pt to leave together thereby ham pering the emergency services if they were
given in fo rm atio n about what h ad happened. T he result was tha t apart from tho se close enough at the west end
to see the terrible truth for themselves, the m ajority o f the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
N o ttin g h a m supporters in the Kop, still thought there had been a pitch invasion or o th e r m isbehaviour by
Liverpool fans. They co n tin u ed singing a n d chantin g incongruously. This infuriated som e Liverpool fans who
were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end. The police feared violence m ight result on
to p o f the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large n u m b e r o f officers to form a line across the
w idth o f the pitch at the Kop end and advance u p to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
m oved. T h ere the line stood as an insurance against diso rd er but d oing nothing. O th e r officers were posted to
th e p e rim e te r track facing the north stand for the sam e purpose. To those distressed and distraught who
w an te d urgent action, this large contingent of passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
intensified.

Misinformation
   98. A t ab o u t 3.15 pm, M r G ra h a m Kelly. C h ie f Executive o f th e FA. M r K irton also o f the FA a n d M r
G r a h a m Mackrell. Secretary o f Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for inform ation. M r

  99. A bout 3.30 pm there was a fu rth e r m eeting in the C lub's board ro o m . M r Duckenfield went there anc
met M r Kelly, the referee and representatives o f the three clubs. ACC Jackson was also there. Mi
Duckenfield indicated the match was likely to be a b a n d o n ed although no firm ruling was given. He added that
he did not want people to know it was to be a b a n d o n ed lest the dispersing crowd h a m p e r the em ergenc\
operations.

Public Announcements
   100. Later the managers o f the tw o team s were asked to go to the control room . They were invited there to
make a public a n n o u n c e m e n t to calm the crowd. M r Kenny Dalglish agreed to d o so. H e told th e crowd that
there were problem s and asked them to assist the police a n d those rendering first aid. H e asked for calm and his
message was well received. It was th e n 3.56 pm. At 4.10 pm it was a n n o u n c e d that the m atch w as ab andoned
for tha t day. Again that message was received calmly by the crowd most o f w h o m b ehaved responsibly as they
dispersed.

Fire Brigade
   101. M eanw hile the emergency services had been in action. At a b o u t 3.10 pm a request c a m e from the
perim eter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the w ire mesh. Sergeant G o d d a r d contacted the police garage
close by w ithout success. At 3.13 pm . PC Bichard requested H ea d q u arte rs to call the fire service to bring
hydraulic cutting e q u ip m en t to the Leppings L ane entrance.

   102. T here was n o arrangem ent for a fire officer to be present d u rin g th e m atch. However, the M ajor
Disaster Plan required all emergency services to be alerted. After ‘phone messages which m ust be described
later, fire appliances arrived at both Leppings Lane a n d Penistone Road at 3.22 pm . At both entrances their
arrival surprised police w ho were un in fo rm ed as to why they h ad been called o r where they should go.

   103. At Leppings Lane a police Inspector told Station O fficer Swain “ I d o n 't really think we need you".
A nother police officer then asked for m ore resuscitators as people were dying so M r Swain radioed for ten fire
appliances. Each carries oxygen and resuscitation e q u ip m en t.

   104. At the Kop end. Leading F irem an Housley arrived w ith an em ergency te n d er an d S tation Officer
Fletcher in a n o th e r appliance, each wnth a crew. T h e em ergency te n d er c a m e along the roadw ay by the south
stand but owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefore b acked o ut an d went to the Leppings
Lane e n tra n ce losing some eight m inutes. From there. M r Housley and his crew went on to the pitch with
resuscitation e q uipm ent. T hey rendered help there an d later at the gym nasium . M r Fletcher a n d his m en ran
along b eh in d the south stand carrying cutting e q u ip m e n t a n d oxygen cylinders. W hen they arrived at the
fence, the cutting eq u ip m e n t was not req u ired as by then the last o f the d e a d a n d injured were being removed
from the pens. M r Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area u n d e r the police box a n d firem en assisted in carrying
victims as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.

South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SY M A S)
    105. Before 1986 there had been no SYM A S representative routinely present at Hillsborough m atches. The
Club was content, as indeed are m any o th e r clubs, to rely upon the St John's A m bula nce Brigade a n d a 999 call
if necessary. From 1986 onwards, after representations, the C lub provided two seats in the south stand for
SYMAS staff at League matches. At one stage it was suggested they would be best placed in th e north stand
close to the gym nasium which had been d esignated as the casualty centre in the event o f a m a jo r incident. The
south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYMAS staff closer to the players' tunnel s h ould a player be
injured. These seats were, however, not available at C u p semi-finals. SYMAS representatives nevertheless
attended at the semi-finals by arrangem ent with the police in 1988 and again in 1989. T he SYMAS officers
stood on the r a m p leading to the pitch at the north-east corner. They had o n e am b u lan c e outside the ground
a n d one on standby.

   106. O n 15 April 1989. Officers Higgins an d Eason were at the ground w ith an am bulance a n d crew. They
noticed fans on the track and went to the Leppings Lane end whilst the game was still in progress. They began
to attend to casualties. Meanwhile, at 2.59 pm . there had been a call from Police C onstable Waugh a t police
H e a d q u arte rs to the H illsborough police control asking if am b u lan c es were required. This was on the
instruction o f C h ie f Inspector E d m u n d so n who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise an d snatches of speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no reports o f injuries but keep sta n d in g by, At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
ground that there might be injuries, police H ea dquarte rs notified SYM AS th a t am b u lan c es might be required.
T hen, seconds later. Mr M urray’s request for a fleet o f am b ulances was relayed to SYMAS. They reacted at
once. A m bulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entra n ce at 3.13 pm an d at the Penistone Road
en trance at 3.17 pm. In all. som e 42 am bulances attended. 31 o f th e m from SYM A S and 11 from
neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm, they had conveyed so m e 172 casualties to the N orthern G eneral
Hospital an d the Royal H allam shire Hospital.

G ym nasium
   107. T h e gym nasium had been in use for serving m eals to the police. W hen the M a jo r Disaster Plan was
o rdered, it was cleared a n d d iv id e d into two. O n e end b ec am e a te m po rary m ortuary; the o th e r was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed a n d im provised, b rought in more and m ore
casualties, the scene was initially a n d inevitably chaotic a n d harrowing. T h ere was intense distress am ongst
the injured a n d bereaved: relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead a n d sought to revive them. T here
were people looking for missing friends an d relations: there were recrim ination s, there were scuffles. Some o f
those involved were the worse for drink. D octors a n d nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to atte n d the injured as best they could in the adverse circum stances. T hose in most urgent need o f
hospital tre a tm e n t were taken to a m b u lan c es as they arrived, triage being em ployed to d eterm in e priorities.
D octors were requested by the police to exam ine each person thoug ht to be deceased to confirm a n d certify
d ea th . A police C onstable was detailed to atten d a n d g uard each o f the d ea d an d a p h o tograph o f each was
taken by a police pho tog rapher so that relatives com ing to identify bodies could be spared the ordeal o f
searching am ongst all who had died.

T h e D ead and the Injured
    108. O f the 95 w ho died, the evidence suggests that at least 16 a n d probably 21 cam e through gate C after it
o pen e d at 2.52 pm . T hat is established by the statem ents o f relatives a n d friends who ca m e through with them
b u t survived.

    109. By co m m e n d a b le hard work, a team o f pathologists h eaded by Professor U sh er com pleted
p o st-m o rte m e x a m in a tio n s on all the deceased within 48 hours. T h ey found that 88 o f the victim s were m ale
a n d seven female. Thirty-eight were u n d e r 20 years o f age. 39 wer? betw een 20 a n d 29 years a n d only three were
over 50. In virtually every case the cause o f death was crush asphyxia d u e to c o m p re ssio n o f the chest wall
against o th e r bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all but nine cases that was the sole cause.
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to ru p tu re the aorta; in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck o r chest: in the rem aining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. T hirteen o f those were rib fractures. However, o n e was a fractured fem ur, o n e a fractured
r a ^ 'u s a n d the rem aining three involved fractures o f bones o r cartilages round the voice box. These injuries
? . ■ st the victim s m ay have been tro d d en while on the ground.

    110. Blood sam ples were taken from the dead. N o alcohol was found in any o f the females. O f the males. 51
had no m ore th a n 10 milligrams p e r c e n t in their blood which is negligible: 15 had over 80 milligrams p e r c e n t
a n d six over 120 milligrams per cent.

  111. A lthough the great m ajority o f those who died were in pen 3. at least five were in p en 4. Most deaths
occurred at the front o f the pens but there were a few fatalities fu rth e r back.

    112. In all. som e 730 people co m p lain ed o f being injured inside the ground an d 36 ou tsid e it. O f the 730.
a b o u t 30% are thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm . T he largest category o f injury was
brursing. especially to the ribs a n d chest.

         113. 1 have given my findings as to the basic factual background an d the m ain sequence o f events in
       narrative form. There was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to som e tim ings a n d n um bers.
       Indeed, the consistency of th e evidence has been a rem arkable feature o f this Inquiry. T he experiences o f most
       witnesses were unforgettable a n d no d o u b t the early hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
       existence o f tim ed videos a n d photographs a n d o f logged a n d ta p ed messages provided reliable checks by
       which to p ro m p t a n d test witness recollection. Accordingly. I have not tor the most part b u rd en e d the narrative
       with citations from the evidence o f individual witnesses.

          114. However, there were several instances o f detailed evidence and assertions being highlighted by the
       media in d r a m a tic an d em otive term s during the hearing. Since s o m e o f those m uch-publicised incidents gave
       rise to unfair criticism, they ought to be the subject o f specific findings. I have therefore dealt with them
~      individually at A ppen dix 6.

                                 T H E LAYOUT AT T H E L E P P I N G S LA N E E N D

  118. 1 have already observed that the layout o f the turnstile area, o f the terraces and o f the concourse
between them was the result o f piecemeal changes. A b rief history o f these changes is now necessary'.


The History
   119. Before 1965. the Leppings Lane end consisted entirely o f terracing like th e Kop. In that year, the west
stand was built an d the terraces rem aining in front o f it were tru n ca te d to th e ir present depth, front to back. As
to width, they consisted o f a single standin g area with no dividing fences. D uring the early 19 7 0 ’s, hooliganism
and pitch invasions m a d e it necessary to prevent access to the playing area a n d the p e rim e te r fences were
therefore erected in 1977.


   120. Section 1 o f the Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Act 1975 em pow ered the Secretary o f S tate to designate a
sports sta d iu m having, in his opinion, a c co m m o d atio n for m ore than 10,000 as a sta d iu m requiring a
certificate from the local authority. Hillsborough was so designated with effect from 1 J a n u a r y 1979 by SI
1978/1091. In anticip atio n o f that date, Sheffield Wednesday instructed Eastwood and Partners, a firm o f
consulting engineers, to act on th eir b eh a lf especially in their dealings with the local authority. D r Eastwood,
the principal o f the firm , is a highly experienced civil a n d structural engineer a n d has adv ised several m a jo r
football clubs. H e rec o m m e n d ed that a n u m b e r o f a dditional crush barriers should be a d d e d since those
already in place were insufficient to com ply with the G reen G u id e (1976 edition). T hat w ork was approved
and carried out d u rin g 1979.


  121. T h e relevant local authority at the tim e was the South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council. It set up an O fficer
Working Party consisting o f representatives o f the police, the fire service, its own building surveyor’s division
and its own legal an d a d m in istra tio n d e p a rtm e n t. The Working Party m a d e inspections and consulted with the
Club an d D r E astwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 D ec em be r 1979 for an indefinite period. It has
remained in force ev e r since a n d has not been am ended.


   122. Schedule 3 o f the certificate sets out the m a x im u m crowd capacity for various areas in th e ground. T he
figure for the west terrace is 7.200 an d for the north-west terrace 2,900. T hese figures were intended to be in
accordance with the G reen G u id e (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided for a m a x im u m “p acking density" o f
between 54 a n d 27 p ersons per 10 square m etres d epe nding on the co ndition o f th e terrace. D r Eastwood had
calculated 8 ,000 for the west terrace on the basis o f 54 p e r 10 square metres. H e thought this a justified starting
figure in view o f his im proved system o f barriers. However, he reduced it to 7.200 because there were no
gangways on the terrace an d he did not th in k it feasible to provide any. So. the total figure for the Leppings Lane
terraces was a n d is 10.100.


The 1981 Semi-Final
  123. As already m e n tione d, there was crushing at th e C up semi-final in 1981. T he m a tch was between
Tottenham H o tsp u r a n d W olverham pton Wanderers. T he police debriefing m inutes afte r the incident
prophetically refer.


  “to the late arrival o f a large n u m b e r o f spectators who were still waiting to e n ter th e Leppings Lane
  enclosure when the m atch started. T he flash point occurred w hen T o tte n h am scored" (at th e K op end) “after
  only three m inutes. T h e spectators ju st entering pushed forward to see w hat was h appe ning an d caused a
  crush, which resulted in the injuries”.


   124. T hose being crushed called for the perim eter gates to be op en e d o n to the track. T here was no
im m ediate reaction, according to M r Vaux w ho was there, but fortunately a police Inspector gave instructions
and the gates were th e n opened. About 2 50 ca m e out o n to the track. There were broken arm s. legs and ribs an d
38 were treated eith er in hospital o r by the St J o h n A m bulance Brigade. It is clear from the d o c u m e n ts (a) that
the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure o f 10.100 had been exceeded by over 400 (b) th at the police
shut o ff further access to the terraces because o f crushing, and (c) the police view after the event was that the
capacity figure o f 10.100 in the Safety Certificate was too high. T h is latter view was c o m m u n ic ate d to the C lub
by the C hief S u perinte n dent then in c o m m a n d o f F D ivision but it was not pursued.
 T hree Pens
     125. A tter this incident in April 1981 the      police requested that the terrace should be d ivided into sections.
 T he object was to improve crowd control by          reducing sideways m ovem ent. Division would enable m ore even
 d istrib u tio n to be etfected w hen there was a    capacity crowd. It would also enable the west end to be used for
 both ho m e a n d away su pporters who could         be segregated in separate pens, if necessary with an em p ty pen
 between them .

    126. T h is proposal was agreed by the C lub an d the O fficer W orking Party a n d was approved by the local
 authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in N ov em ber 1981. They are the fence now separating pens
 2 an d 3 an d that now separating 5 a n d 6. The result was to d iv id e the whole terrace into three pens. Access from
 the concourse to the m iddle pen was through the tunnel a n d to the wing pens round the sides o f the west stand.
 D r Eastwood suggested an d illustrated an altered layout which would have provided separate access through
 separate banks o f turnstiles to the north stand, to each en d o f the west stand, a n d to each o f the three pens.
 W hilst the m a in object o f this was segregation, such a layout would have enabled each o f those areas to be
 m onitore d numerically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its m a x im u m capacity was not exceeded. T he plan was
 not a d o p ted . T h e m a x im u m capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at 2.200. but no alteration was
 m a d e to the Safety Certificate so to limit it n o r was there any m e an s mechanically o f counting the num be rs
 going into th a t pen.

 The 1985 Changes
      127. By 1985. Sheffield W ednesday had been p ro m o te d to the First D ivision a n d was draw ing larger
  crowds. T he im provem ent o f the Leppings Lane end was raised again by the Club a n d D r Eastwood p repared a
• n u m b e r o f drawings. These illustrated various schem es for achieving segregation by providing m ore turnstiles
  in separate b anks an d divisions o f the concourse. T h e police w an te d further division s o f the terrace itself,
  again to im prove control and segregation. T h ere was m uch discussion o f these schem es which included
  suggestions o f 29 an d even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, the following alterations were carried out in
   1985.

 N ew Radial Fences
     128. O n th e terraces, two m ore radial fences were fitted. O n e d iv id e d the existing central pen into the
 present pens 3 an d 4. G ates were fitted at the m o u th o f the tunnel to enable each o f those pen s to be closed off.
 T h e second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow'pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. Until
 those two fences were ad ded there existed only p e rim e te r gates 1 .2 .4 . 5 an d 6. T he creation o f pen 3 required a
 new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.

 Barriers
     129. T h e lines o f the new radial fences ran across existing crush barriers so that w ithout m odification those
 barriers would have run through the fencing. T h e police consid ered the barriers would be used by fans as
 convenient m o u n tin g points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their object. T hey therefore wished
 spans to be rem oved from the barriers. H ad th e ir wishes been met in full the result w ould have been an
 u n im p e d e d ru n in pen 3 from the m o u th o f the tu n n e l dow n the south side o f the new fence to the perimeter. D r
 Eastwood dug his heels in against that proposal w hich he rightly regarded as dangerous. H e d id however agree
 to som e m odific ation to the m iddle row o f barriers in the newly created pen 3. chiefly to facilitate access.
 Likewise in the new pen 5. T he 1985 m odifications to the pens are shown on the plan A pp endix 4.

 The Turnstiles and Concourse
     130. At the entrance, m odification but no increase in n u m b e r was m a d e at the turnstiles. T he b ank 1 to 16
 was d ivided from A to G by the metal fence now in place a n d tha t division was projected across the concourse
 inside the turnstiles in the form o f a brick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through that wall but
 was enlarged to its present size at the request of the police. T hose alterations were m a d e in the interests o f
 segregation. T h e m ore elaborate divisions which D r Eastw ood had suggested, giving se p arate access to each
 sub-division o f the ac com m odation, were not p u rsu ed for financial reasons. In M ay 1985 the Bradford
 d isaster occurred. T h e south stand at Hillsborough had w ooden decking a n d the Club realised it would have to
 un d erta k e expensive remedial works there. The cantilever ro o f o f the sam e stand was also discovered to
 require e x p e n s i v e repairs.

    131. In fact, shortly after the new dividing fence a n d wall h ad been built at the Leppings L ane entrance and
 concourse, the C lub, by agreement with C hief S u p erinte ndent Mole, ceased to a c c o m m o d ate h o m e supporters
 at the Leppings L ane end. T here was therefore no longer a ny need for segregation at that end, but the wall
 rem ained.
   1 32. Also in 1985. electronic c ounting eq u ip m en t was installed at all turnstiles. T h is conveyed the running
count tor each b ank o f turnstiles, for example A t o G . to a television screen in the C lub control room where the
figures were displaved. In 1986. an electronic eye was installed in each turnstile b ooth to catch and record
anyone who clim bed over the turnstile.

Barrier 144
   133. In Ju n e 1986. the police requested that the crush b arrier nearest lo the tunnel at th e entra n ce to pens 3
and 4 should be rem oved to assist the flow o f fans into the pens. T hey found it caused o b stru ctio n because it
was in a good viewing position and spectators liked to stand against it in num be rs thereby blocking access by-
others further into the pens. T he police also suggested it m ight h am p er effective eva cu a tio n through the tunnel
especially in an emergency. D r Eastwood considered the pros and cons o f this proposal a n d accepted the police
view. T he Officer W orking Party approved the proposal at a m eeting o n 7 August 1986 o n site. A uthority was
given then an d the re by M r Bownes on b e h a lf o fth e Sheffield City Council which h ad ta k en over responsibility
for the Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council on 1 April 1986. Two spans o f the barrier were
therefore rem oved, leaving only one sp a n in pen 4 as shown o n A ppendix 4.

Effects of the Layout
   134. T he result o f these changes was to divide the terrace into a n u m b e r o f small areas w ithout providing
any c om puterised or mechanical m e an s o f limiting entry num erically into any one area if all areas were open
for choice. Before the fences and pens had divided the terrace, the overall figure o f 10.100 could be m onitored
via the turnstiles a n d in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was not possible strictly to
ensure com pliance with Schedule 3 Part 1 o f the Safety C ertificate which prescribed a m a x im u m o f 2.900 for
the north-west terrace an d 7.200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 o f Schedule 2 o f the Safety Certificate
provides:

  ‘T h e n u m b e r o f spectators a dm itted to the S tadium and to the several areas o f spe cta to r a c co m m o d atio n
  within the S tad iu m shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1 o f S chedule 3".

  The Club had to rely upon visual m onitoring.

   135. T he situ atio n becam e worse however with the d ivision o f the west terrace into pens. N o t only were
there m ore an d sm aller discrete areas b ut some were likely to attract m ore th a n the ir a p p r o p r ia te share o f the
 10.100 total. It is well recognised that the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, th e position o f the
tunnel vis-a-vis the turnstiles A t o G . its labelling an d the absence o fsig n p o sts advertising th e wing pens would
draw to it those with terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely tha t pen s 3 and 4 would fill to capacity and
indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. H a d D r E astw ood’s p la n for separate tu rn stile access to
separate sections with separate toilet and refreshment facilities been im plem ente d, total co m p u te rise d control
could have been kept.
                                                       CHAPTER8

                                  LACK O F F IX E D C A P A C I T I E S F O R T H E P E N S

    136. In 1981. when the terrace was d iv id ed into three areas. Dr Eastwood gave the C lub the figure o f 2.200
capacit> for the centre pen. He based this on the Green G uide, making such allowances as he thought right. No
d o u b t the num bers could have been counted in via the turnstiles if only that pen was in use or if such pens as
were in use were filled sequentially, but not otherwise.

    137. After the 1985 changes. D r Eastwood did not h im self give any figures for the new pens 3 and 4.
S o m eo n e on his staff however split the figure 2,200 into 1.200 for pen 3 an d 1.000 for pen 4. T hose figures did
not even take account o f the fact tha t pen 5 had been carved o u t o f pen 4 which was bo u n d to h ave a reduci ng
effect on capacity. Nevertheless, th e figures o f 1.200 a n d 1.000 were put on a draw ing e m an a tin g from
Eastw ood a n d Partners an d the figures have been notionallv regarded since as applicable by the C lub and the
police. They are in fact too high.

   138. D r Nicholson, at the Research a n d Laboratory Services D ivision o f th e H ealth a n d Safety Executive,
h as calculated that the figures for pens 3 an d 4 respectively would be 1.01 5 an d 1.036 if the strength and
spacing o f the crush barriers had com plied with the G re en G uide. But they d id not.

Departures from the Green Guide
    139. In pen 3, four out o f five gaps in the lines o f crush barriers do n ot conform with p aragraph 115 o f the
G re e n G u id e (1986). In pen 4. nine o u t o f ten d o not conform . In particular, the spans taken out o f the barriers
in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess o f the m a x im u m o f 1.4 m e tres prescribed. O n e gap was 57% wider than
the G re e n G u id e m axim um . Moreover, that gap was in d ire c t diagonal line from the m outh o f the tunnel to the
b a rrie r which collapsed. D r Eastwood justified these larger gaps by the absence o f gangways. F ans had to be
able to get in an d out a n d sta ndard gaps tended to get blocked up. T h e effect o f his reasoning was that the
a bsence o f gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice o f a second safety feature,
nam ely gaps o f strictly limited width.

    140. Again, the removal o f barrier 144 was bound, as D r Eastwood conceded, to affect capacity. In fact it
d id m ore, as I shall indicate later.

    141. C apacity should also have taken account o f two fu rth e r d epartu res from the G re en G uide. If. as was
th e case, the perim eter gates were not regarded as exits, so m e 40% o f those in pens 3 and 4 were m ore than 12
m e tres from a n exit (and there was no gangway) contrary to th e aim o f paragraph 96. Four out o f fi\e o f the
crush b arriers in pen 3 a n d six o ut o f nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
w ere the old barriers which had been repaired an d plated w here their bases h ad corroded an d fresh concrete
h ad been applied, raising the level o f the steps. T he poin t is n o t a c ad e m ic since, in the event, m a ny fans were
b en t painfully over barriers u nder great pressure.

   142. D r N icholson calculated that w hen all relevant factor* regarding the configuration a n d the G reen
G u id e are taken into account, the m a x im u m capacity for pen . ilci have been 822 and for pen 4 .871.

Safety Certificate
   143. W hatever should have been the m a x im u m capacities for pens 3 a n d 4. the fact is th a t no figures at all in
respect o f th e m were put into the Safety Certificate. D espite all the changes in layout o f the fences a n d barriers,
the two figures, 2.900 for the north-west terrace a n d 7.200 for the west terrace, have rem a in e d as the only
m a x im a with which the Club has to comply.

   144. Section 2(1) o f the Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Act 1975 provides (so far as is relevant):

  “ A Safety Certificate shall contain such term s an d co n d itio n s as the local authority c o n sid er necessary or
  ex p e d ie n t to secure reasonable safety at the stadium w hen it is in u s e ..

  S ection 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):

  “ W ith o u t prejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety C e rtifica te -
  (a) shall specify the m a x im u m n u m b e r o f spectators to be a d m itte d to the stadium :
  (b) m ay specify the m a x im u m n u m b e r to be ad m itte d to different parts o f it:
  (c) shall include term s a n d c o n d itio n s-
  ... (iii) as to the number, strength a n d s ituation o f any crush barriers."


                                                              24
Section 2(2) was repealed by the Fire Safety an d Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987. section 19. which
gave power to the Secretary of State to lay down, by order, term s and conditions. No o rd er has yet been
made and guidance from the H om e Office has recom m end ed local authorities to a p p ro a ch their
function u nder section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See H om e
Office Circular 71/1987 dated 25 N ovem ber 1987. Annex A. paragraph 6.)

   145. It is clear that when the certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire C ounty Council went
further than sim ply to fix the m a x im u m n um be rs for the whole Stadium . They prescribed figures for
each part o f the ground not merely by the four points o f the com pass but by specified sections.

   146. Section 8(1) o f the 1975 Act requires the holder o f the certificate before carrying out any
proposals to alter or extend the stadium or any o f its installations w hile a Safety Certificate is in
operation to give n otice o f those proposals to the local authority. T h a t obligation is specifically
repeated in Sheffield W ednesday’s certificate at Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2). T he Club com plied with
the requirem ent. H aving received notice o f the alterations to the pens an d the barriers, the local
authority ought, in my view, to have a m en d e d the Safety Certificate accordingly. T hey did not do so.

Why was the Safety Certificate not Amended?
   147. Although D r Eastwood acknowledged that the various changes to the layout w ould have had
an effect on capacity, he did not take active steps to see that ap p ro p riate a m e n d m e n ts were m ade. He
says he m e n tio n e d from tim e to time th a t the alterations would have a n effect on capacity a n d that he
did not realise the Safety Certificate was not regularly updated. However. I find two m e m o r a n d a in
early 1987 highly significant. D r Eastw ood's assistant M r Strange was concerned with queries from
the FA as to H illsborough’s capacity for a semi-final. M r Strange recorded these q uestions in a
m em orandum :-

  " H a s a n y account been taken for alterations d o n e on Leppings Lane over th e last few seasons? Is the 10.200
  or so figure still correct? I said that in m y o p in io n it needs to be adjusted, b etter d o it now than later.”

  148. M r Strange’s next m em o (a few days later) records as follows:-

  " D r Eastwood says leave the capacity at Leppings Lane en d as it is. providing police have gates u n d e r West
  stand o pen so that people can distribute throughou t the terrace evenly.”

Although he says the last nine words d o not report him accurately. D r Eastwood accepts the rest o f that
message.

   149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought to have been reviewed and
altered. T h e u n happy situation is that the police believed even the overall figure o f 10.100 to be to o high as far
back        ' ? 1. T h a t was reported to the C lub but apparently not to D r E a s t v " ''- 1. Meanwhile, th at global figure
had b ^ . . rendered academ ic by the sub-division o f the terrace which was                    fir  -i in the ba\ety Certificate
at all. If p ro p er m a x im u m figures had been inserted in the certificate for each o f the pens, the C lub and the
police might well have been prom pted to find som e m eans o f lim iting the n u m b e rs entering those pens other
than by visual m onitoring. T his could have been d o n e by im plem enting one o f D r E astw ood’s plans for totally
separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It could have been d o n e by insisting on sequential filling o f pens at
all matches: alternatively, by counting fans into each viewing area.

The City Council
   150. T h a t the Safety Certificate was not a m e n d e d an d individual capacities not reviewed c a n n o t be laid
solely at D r Eastw ood's door. He was. after all. consultant engineer to th e C lub an d responsibility for the
certificate was that o f the local authority. W hen the South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council h a n d e d over to the
Sheffield City Council, the latter delegated all its powers a n d duties under the 1975 Act to its G eneral Purposes
Panel. A p p a re n tly therefore, the decision-m aking body on b eh a lf o f the Council was that Panel, although two
specific fun ctions were delegated to the H ea d o f A d m in istratio n and Legal D e p a rtm e n t - the power to issue a
prohibition u n d e r section lO o f th e 1 9 7 5 A c t a n d the power o f entry an d search u n d er section 11 o f the Act.

  151. In practice. M r Bownes. the C o u n c il’s C hief Licensing Officer in the A d m in istratio n an d Legal
D epartm ent, bore the b runt o f the C o u n c il’s duties u n d er the Act.



                                                               25
    152. The Officer Working Parly was superseded by a Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Advisory G roup, but
apart from the change of the nam e the system continu ed as before. M r Bownes atte n d e d the inspections
an d m eetings o f the Advisory G ro u p together with the representatives o f the police, the fire service, the
d e p a r tm e n t o f health and co n su m er services, and the building engineer's division of the Council. The
latter was an engineer and ought therefore to have been alive to the sam e issues as D r Eastwood.

  153. T he Advisory G roup seem s to have worked in a very inform al manner. A short passage from Mr
Bownes' evidence gives the flavour o f it:-

     “Q    W h o was taking the lead in the working party as you u n d ersto o d it?

      A    T h a t is a good question, sir. Leads were com ing from several different direction s really.

      Q    W h o chaired it. if anyone?

      A    N ob o d y as such. sir. It was an inspection rather than a m eeting as I understa n d it.

      Q    W h o decided what should be inspected?

      A    Effectively the group itself, sir. it seem ed to me. T h e re was also som e input from the Club
            representative as to. if you like, an elem ent o f direction as to what should be looked at.

      Q    A part from the inspections the working party m et. presumably, or d id                they only meet on
            inspections?

      A    No. sir. I have referred to three previous meetings.

      Q    W h o took the chair w hen it met?

      A    I suppose it could be said that I did. to som e extent.

      Q     T h ere is no point in having inspections unless you form conclusions as a result o f th a t inspection, is
            there?

      A    T h a t is correct.

      Q     T here must presum ably have been som e m eeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
            together and decided what, if anything, should be done.

      A    T here was not. to my recollection, no.

      Q    H o w d i d you decide w hat should be done, if anything needed l o b e done?

      A     T here were discussions on the site, particularly in relation to barrier 144. which took place at the
            time.

      Q     N o th in g more than th a t an d no record anyw here o f an y decisions that were m ade?

      A    No. sir."

T h e decision to remove barrier 144 was assented to on behalf o f the City Council by M r Bownes. It was not
referred to the G eneral Purposes Panel. W h e th e r M r Bownes strictly had any power to assent to it is to say the
least very doubtful. But he h im self ad m its that he was ill-equipped to do so. He knew very little ab o u t football
grounds. He had read the file passed on from South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council and assum ed all had been run
satisfactorily bv them.

  154. It was recorded, however, in a report which M r Bownes drafted that “the c o n d itio n s (in the Safety
Certificate) give som e cause for concern as they a p p e a r to be inadequate or inappropriate in som e areas” . T he
report to the G eneral Purposes Panel suggested that new Safety Certificate co nditions should be drafted.

   155. T h e task o f revising the Safety Certificate was begun in J u n e 1986. In July 1987, a draft was sent to the
fire serv ice to which they replied in August. In S eptem ber 1987, the Panel was inform ed th a t the redrafting was
ut    "progressing steadily" and should be subm itted to the Panel in October. The final draft was not circulated until
IS
      30 March 1989. 16 days before this disaster.
ic
ie       156. Meanwhile, the Safety Certificate has rem ained un am en d e d since 1979. The enlargem ent o f the Kop
      in 1986 increased its capacity to 21.000. Although this was known a n d agreed by the C ouncil it had not been
      the subject o f any change in the certificate which still showed the capacity o f the Kop as 16.850. M r Mackrell.
1r    Sheffield W ednesday's Secretary, raised the question o f am en d m e n ts to the Safety Certificate and in p articular
      with regard to the Kop in April 1987 with Eastwood a n d Partners but nothing resulted.

        157. Sheffield U nited Football Club was designated u nder the 1975 A c to n 3 July 1984. A Safety Certificate
      was about to be issued by South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council at the tim e it han d e d over to the Sheffield City
      Council on 1 April 1986. N o certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

         158. T he explanatio n given for these delays was pressure o f work. M r Bownes as C h i e f Licensing Officer
      was responsible for 32 other licensing systems w hen this o ne was a d d e d to his burden. H e had a sta ff o f only
      five. I fully accept that the addition o f further statutory responsibilities to the already heavy workload o f a local
      authority with curbs on its expenditure creates problem s. But it is clear that the atten tio n given to this
      important licensing function was woefully inadequate.
Jb
      Summary
         159. T he Safety Certificate contained no m a x im u m figures for individual pens. T here was therefore no
      sanction or provision focussing a ttention as to the need to limit entry to the pens by num bers. T h e layout at
      Leppings Lnne as it evolved m ade electronic or m echanical control over nu m bers entering individual pens
      impracticable if all pens were to be available. G iven an im portant m a tch an d a capacity attendance, fans were
      likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 an d 4. Those pens were likely to becom e overfull well before
      warning cam e from the turnstiles that num bers were approaching the terrace m a x im u m o f 10.100. Control
      over num bers an d the avoidance o f overcrowding therefore d ep e n d ed entirely on visual m onitorin g o f the
      crowd.

                        LACK O F EF F E C T I V E M O N I T O R I N G O F T H E T E R R A C E S

    160. M onitoring the spectators on the terraces so as to avoid overcrowding involves observing the num be rs
and their distribution in each area, m aking decisions as to w hen an area is ‘‘full”, taking steps to close it o ff
a n d m oving spectators from one area to another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problem s. 1) W ho
should carry it out? 2) W hen is an area “ full"? 3) F ear o f hooliganism.

Who should Monitor the Terraces?
   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? S hould it be the police? S hould it be b o th ? O r should it be by
arrangem ent, d epending upon the gro u n d o r section o f the gro und in q uestion?

   162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a m atch on its p rem ises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at tha t event. The G re en G u id e ( 1986) provides:

       “ 23. T he safety o f the public inside the ground is the responsibility o f those w ho stage the event and
             ad m in ister the ground in which it is held, ie the "m an a g em e n t". This responsibility applies in
             both normal and em ergency situations...

         195. ...there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. T h ese are:

               (a)   controlling o r directing m em bers o f the public w ho are entering or leaving the ground, to
                     help achieve an even flow o f people to the viewing areas an d safe dispersal o f spectators on
                     the terraces or viewing slopes:

               (b)    patrolling the gro u n d to deal w ith any emergencies, eg raising a la rm s or extinguishing
                      fires:

               (c)   m a nning entrances, exits a n d o th e r strategic points, especially exit d o o rs and gates w hich
                     are continuously open whilst the ground is in use:

               (d)    assisting police as ap p ro p riate o r as requested with crowd control; an d

               (e)   undertaking specific duties in a n emergency."

The Interim Popplewell Report
   163. T here was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry held by M r Justice Popplewell
in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report, M r Justice
Popplewell quoted from a report p rodu ce d for the M inister o f H ousing an d Local G o v e rn m e n t in 1969 as
follows:-

  ‘‘T h e responsibility for controlling crowd beha v io u r is d ivided between the police and the club operating the
  ground. T he b r o a d line o f division being that police are responsible for m ovem ent o f spectators in public
  thoroughfares an d from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the control o f
  spectators once they are on the club’s premises . . .”

M r Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with th a t view an d went on to observe tha t in practice the police
have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (parag raph 3.8):

  "It follows, therefore, that as a m a tte r o f practice, while the physical safety o f the building an d the
  m a in te n an c e a n d good housekeeping o f the ground m ust always be the responsibility o f the club, the police
  have to take the de facto responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all that entails, d u r in g the game . .

M r Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation o f the ground as a procedure in which only the police
could b ea r the responsibility o f supervising the organisation o f the crowd.

The Final Popplewell Report
  164. He h arked back to this subject in chapter 4 o f his Final Report. There, he cam e dow n more firmly in
favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “ Because, as a m a tte r o f


                                                           28
practice, police officers have regularly attende d in large num bers at football grounds, it has somehow been
assumed b> the clubs that the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed from
them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcem ent o f law and order. Those responsible
for organising a private function, however, have the p rim a ry an d continuing obligation a n d responsibility to
ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises." M r Justice Popplewell ended that
section as follows: “ It ca nnot be too strongly em phasised that it is upon the club, or the occupier o f the ground
who is p utting on the function, that the primary' and co n tin u in g obligation rests."

   165. T here rem ains, however, the question w hether there are som e g rounds or p a n s o f grounds where the
club may need to rely upon the police (w hom they pay to attend) to control filling o f pens a n d m o n ito rin g them
for overcrowding. In o th e r words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they may need,
and by agreem ent be entitled, to em ploy the police to act as their agents in certain circumstances. T his very
difficult an d grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed in greater d ep th at stage two
of this Inquiry.

Arrangements at Hillsborough
  166. W hat is clear, however, is that de fa c to the police at H illsborough had accepted responsibility for
control o f the pens at the Leppings Lane end. T he evidence o f the senior officers who had been concern ed with
policing at Hillsborough over the years was all one way on this point. Only M r D uckenfield. w ho had not
policed at Hillsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.

   167. M r Lock is now security officer at Sheffield W ednesday a n d was formerly a police S u p erinte ndent at
Hillsborough m atches occupying M r M urra y's role. He claim ed there had been a formal although unwritten
agreement between the Club and the police in about 1982. w hereby the police agreed to steward the Leppings
Lane end o f th e ground. Such a formal agreem ent is d en ied by o th e r senior officers an d 1d o not accept that any
formal agreem ent was reached. Nevertheless, a practice or arrange m ent did develop which was known and
accepted by both C lub an d police. Its effect was th at th ro u g h o u t the ground the stewards were responsible for
m anning exits and entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for assisting spectators to th e ir seats in the
stands a n d for helping to control the exits after the m atch. They were also responsible at the Kop end on the
terraces for keeping gangways clear an d helping to control the crowd w hich usually consisted o f hom e
supporters. At the Leppings Lane en d . however, there were no gangways on the terraces an d the crowd
consisted usually (and always since 1987) o f away supporters. M r Mole an d o th e rs e n io r officers accepted that
it would have been unreal and u nreasonable to expect stewards to go on to those Leppings Lane terraces. They
would not have been effective there: moreover, they could well have been in som e d anger from hostile away
supporters. T he police accepted, therefore, that the p roper filling o f the pens an d m o n ito rin g them for
overcrowding could a n d would not be carried out by stewards. M any stewards have tended to be either
extremely young o r som ew hat elderly. T hey are paid only a m odest su m (£9 at Hillsborough) an d they are not
suitable either by physique or by training to cope on a crowded terrace w ith no gangways.

Case for the South Yorkshire Police
  168. N o t - ithstanding the overw helm ing evidence from senior police as air;. Jy m e ntioned a n d from the
Club, Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police co n tin u ed throughout the h earing to contend tha t the Club and
not the police were responsible for filling a n d m onitoring the pens an d that this was well know n to b o th parties.
He m aintained that the police were there essentially to secure an d preserve law and order. Q u ite a p a rt from the
police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance o f the S outh Yorkshire Police has not always
been to that effect.

Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club Limited
   169. In M arch 1986. the South Yorkshire Police A u th o rity o bta ined a ju d g e m e n t against Sheffield U nited
Football Club for m oney due for police services provided at Sheffield U n ite d 's matches. T h e defence had been,
inter alia, that the police were not providing “special police services". T hey were d oing no more than
performing their n o rm al police duties o f securing a n d preserving law an d o r d e r am ongst a crowd. T he police
argument was that they had additional duties. In his ju dgem ent. Boreham J sum m arised the instructions for
policing as providing for:-

  "(a) the m a in te n an c e o f enforcem ent (?f law an d order:

   (b) the en force m ent o f the Club's ground regulations, m any o f which are concerned with law an d order;

   (c) the safety a n d com fort o f the spectators, officials an d p la y e r s ”
H e re ferred to th e a r g u m e n t o f C o u n s e l for th e S o u th Y o rksh ire Police as follows:-

  •'Thirdly, here the police were not discharging their own du ty to the public: the> were in fact discharging the
  C lub's duties to the spectators w hom the C lub invited to the ground. The Club chose to invite large n um bers
  to their private premises: it was the C lub's d u ty to provide for their safety, health and com fort. They could
  have em ployed a security firm as banks a n d others have to d o to protect their interests; they chose to request
  the police to perform those duties knowing that the police expected paym ent. Fourthly, th e police w ithin the
  ground provided services which it was n ot within the scope o f the ir public duty to perform . For instance,
  they assisted in crowd m a n agem ent and in the enforcem ent o f such ground regulations as refused entry to
  those w ho tried to enter w ithout paying o r prohibited spectators encroaching on parts o f the ground which
  the ir e n try fee did n ot entitle th e m to enter. It may be. subm its M r Bentley, tha t the m a intenance o f law and
  o rd er was the p red o m in an t aim but there were o ther services perform ed."

T he learned Judge found:-

  " ln a d d itio n to w hat may be called their law and o rd e r role the police were expected a n d did take part in
  crowd m a nagem ent, ensuring the safety o f spectators, the en force m ent o f the C lu b 's regulations an d to be on
  h and to assist in the event o f som e em ergencies such as fire or accidental injury.”

Police Practice at the Leppings Lane End
   170. At League m atches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to decide in ad v a n ce how many an d which
pens would be used. If a modest crowd was a n ticip ate d only one o r two pens might be needed. It was better to
confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent them ru n n in g ab o u t and (b) to reduce the n u m b e r o f police
required. T he practice was then to fill the pens one by one. T h is involved m aking a ju d g e m en t as to w hen a pen
was full. T here would then be a police decision to close that pen an d fill another. It was regarded as im practical
and unsafe for police officers (just like stewards) to go o n to the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
T his m eant tha t m onitoring the n u m b e rs in any pen had to be d o n e from vantage p oints outside it. Here, the
police were m uch better placed than the stewards. T h ere was a good view from the control box a n d the
television screens there. T here were officers on the p erim ete r track. N o stewards were placed there because
having b o th police a n d stewards interfered with the viewing. T h ere were also police in the west stand who
could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the police a good appreciation o f
the state o f the terraces. W hen it was necessary to shu t o ff access to the pens officers on the concourse could be
inform ed by rad io an d could take the necessary steps.

“Find Their Own Level”
   171. At C u p semi-finals, a different app ro a ch was ad o p te d . All the pens were opened from the start a n d the
policy was “to let the fans find the ir own level” . T his p hrase was repeated again an d again by police officers at
the Inquiry. W h a t it m eant was that no specific direction was given to fans e nterin g through the turnstiles.
T hey were free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. If they becam e un com fortable or wished for any
oth e r reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
the fans on the terraces would level them selves out an d that d istrib u tio n would be achieved w ithout police
intervention. O n these occasions, the gates at the top o f the radial fences were locked in the open position. It
was sought to argue, therefore, that there was freedom o f m ovem ent from one pen to a n o th e r enabling fans to
“find the ir level” .

   172. T h is argum e nt was b ad b o th in theory an d in practice. In theory, the whole object o f the radial fences
had been to achieve even d istrib u tio n by directing fans into desired positions. To say then tha t they could move
freelv from on e pen to a n o th er would defeat the object and en a b le fans to go from a less p opular to a more
p opular area w ithout inhibition. In practice this did n ot h ap p e n because the position and size o f the gates was
such that once a substantial n u m b e r o f spectators were in. the gates were unnoticeable and inaccessible
especially to those towards the front w ho might have m ost need o f them .

  173. T h e sam e argum ent was deployed to suggest tha t individual m a x im u m capacities for individual pens
need not be assessed since the presence o f the open radial gates still m eant tha t the terrace was one area. In
practice this simply was not so. T h e photograph at A ppendix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.59 pm shows
very clearly the congestion in pens 3 and 4 contrasted with the sparseness in pen 6. This gives the lie to the
suggestion tha t the f anscou ld, if uncom fortable, “ find th e ir own level” .

  174. T h e effect o f this policy was that whereas at League m atches the police had to m ake a positive decision
when to close one pen and open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was m uc h m o re likely, the police
left it to the tans themselves to 'find their own level". Effectivelv. they were left to m o n ito r their own com fort
and safety so as to a \ o id overcrowding. The police would only intervene when there was som e overt sign tha t an
area was ''full".

When is an Area “ Full"?
   175. O ver the years, spectators on terraces have com e to accept c o n d itio n s which are often very
uncom tortable and not infrequently dow nright dangerous. T hey are subjected to buffeting an d squeezing to
get in and out o f the terraces. T hey are packed tightly an d exposed to surging a n d swaying d u rin g the match.
They put up with these conditions because they are devoted to the gam e and because there is little they can do
about them. T hey believe the discom fort will pass and nothing very untoward will happen. Usually that is the
case and they are reassured by it. Most clubs have not. until very recently, consulted the ir supporters as to their
grievances or suggestions. T he practice has been to pack them in on the assum ption tha t if they are prepared to
put up with it the co n d itio n s must be tolerable. A lthough crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
in recent years, this has been d u e principally to the increased proportion o f seating as against standing
accom m odation. Terraces have still been packed.

   176. It is said that many fans enjoy these features o f terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
discomfort, w eathering sways and surges together and c ha nting the sam e songs an d slogans en m a sse d o evoke
good h u m o u r and have produced a spirit or cult o f the terraces which many enjoy. Equally there are m a ny who
simply e n d u re these things for the football, for a c h e ap ticket or indeed for the ch ance o f getting in at all. And
before Hillsborough most fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had not realised the narrow
margin o f safety between an uncom fortable crush and a fatal one.

    177. T h e G reen G u id e sought to im prove safety a n d com fort by laying dow n criteria for m a x im u m
capacity, ie defining what is "full". T he sta n d a r d set was 54 persons per 10 square metres in favourable
conditions but fewer, down to 27. in less favourable cond itions. T he tendency may have been to aim o ff too
little from the higher figure for shortcom ings in the layout. Certainly the figures considered ap p ro p riate in
pens 3 an d 4 at Hillsborough were too high, as already indicated.

   178. Even taking the highest figure suggested in the G reen G uide, the problem rem ained that those
supposed to be m onitorin g pens visually had and have little idea o f w hat 54 persons per 10 square m etres look
like. Mr D uckenfield’s opinion was that w hen a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be “ shoulder to
shoulder an d chest to back". T h at view may deriv e from seeing the sort o f density crowds regularly endure
without injury resulting. But it is much more dense than the G reen G u id e m a x im u m .

    179. T h e South Yorkshire Fire Brigade provided the Inquiry with photographs o f people standing in an area
o f 10 square m etres at various densities o f packing. Together with my Assessors a n d others. 1 took part in a
similar expe rim e nt at the Health an d Safety Executive's Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a ro o m o f measured
area at densities o f 54. 80 and 100 per 10 square metres. It was clear from the photographs a n d from our
experiment that the m a x im u m density set ou t in the G reen G u id e left considerably more room than those
m onitoring the terraces would have left before declaring an area “ full".

   180. T h e tendency has been to allow the pens to fill until the fans com plain o r show signs o f discom fort. If
the density at the front appeared less than at the back, the T annoy would invite th e fans to move forward to
make room for more. T h e evidence before the Inquiry an d m a n y anecdotal letters 1 have received clearly show
there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused
discomfort a n d som etim es, for b rief periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
eases and the incident passes unrecorded.

  181. After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final. Hillsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 1987.
There was evidence tha t the central pens were uncom fortably overcrowded on tha t occasion an d again at the
1988 C up semi-final, although entry to the tu nnel was blocked o ff by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
because the pens were deem ed to be "full".

Fear of H ooliganism
   182. O ver the last few years, hooliganism at an d associated with football m a tch e s has strongly influenced
the strategy o f the police. In their plans a n d m an ag e m en t they have concentrated on averting o r containing
threats to public order. T his is understand able and indeed co m m en d a b le . But it has led to an im balance
between the need to quell a m inority o f troublem akers and the need to secure the safety and com fort o f the
majority. In the police O perational Order, the em phasis was upon prevention o f d iso rd er an d in particular
prevention o f access to the field o f play. T here was no express requirem ent that officers on the p erim eter track
o r in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed, the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling the unruly since
the less room they had the less scope there was for misbehav iour.

Sum m ary
   183. Although the police had accepted de facto responsibility for m o nitoring the pens, their policy on the
day was to leave fans to “find the ir own level" and to concentrate the ir own attention on possible disorder.
Whilst in theory the police would intervene if a pen becam e "full", in practice they perm itted the test of
fullness to be w hat the fans would tolerate.

  184. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 a n d 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncom fortable. To allow any m ore into those pens was likely to cause injuries: to allow in a large stream was
courting disaster.
   was                                                        C H A P T E R 10

              185. T he decision to open gate C, an d subsequently gates A an d B too. was forced on to the police by the
i the    crowd condition s which developed outside the turnstiles. T he crush was so severe that injuries were being
rder.    s u f f e r e d and d ea th s were feared unless the pressure could be swiftly relieved. Why the crowd pressure had built
st o f   to such intensity was one o f the principal issues d u rin g the hearing. T he suggested causes m ust be considered in
         turn.

a ere    The Physical Layout
 was       186. I have already described a n d illustrated the a p p ro a ch to the turnstiles (A ppendices 1 an d 2). At
         Penistone Road an d at many o th e r grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced a n d with a
         sufficient waiting area for queues to form. N ot so at Leppings Lane. T h e b uilding line, the bridge over the Don
         and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to p erim ete r gates set in an arc. a n d across a short
         forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. T h e pairs o f turnstiles were close together a n d the forecourt, especially
         asdivided by the metal fence, prov ided little space f o r a waiting crowd.

         The Number of Turnstiles
            187. T h e decision to fill the whole o f the n o rth stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
         there to adm it 24,256 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G ) serving the terraces had to adm it
          10,100. ie an average o f just u n d e r 1,450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road end. 29.800 were
         served by 60 turnstiles, o r just u n d e r 500 per turnstile.

            188. T h e G reen G u id e recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which spectators can pass through
         turnstiles depends on a variety o f local circum stances but states “ in general based on observation and
         experience, it is unlikely that the m a x im u m n otional rate per tu rn stile would exceed 750 per h o u r ” . Since the
         semi-final was an all ticket match req uiring no cash transactions, th e C lu b considered that a higher rate of
         about 1.000 per h o u r per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assum es the turnstiles
         working at m a x im u m efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly 1 a hours to a d m it all those with terrace
         tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

            189. T he Green G uide provides (paragraph 44):-

           "Turnstiles should be o f such n u m b e rs as to a d m it spectators at a rate w hereby no unduly large crowds are
           kept waiting for adm ission

            190. T h e Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need, an d D r E astw ood’s various schemes, for
         improvement o f the turnstile arrangem ents. T h e m a th e m a tic s are elementary. Both the police a n d the Club
         should have realised that the Leppings Lane turnstiles a n d th e waiting area outside them would be u nder strain
         io ;K<mit all the Liverpool supporters in tim e. Success d ep e n d ed on the spectators arriving at a steady rate from
         an early hour an d upon the m a x im u m turnstile rate being m aintained. In fact neither o f these requirem ents,
         which are inter-linked, was fulfilled. T h a t they m ight not be so was in my view foreseeable.

          1he "Late” arrival of Liverpool Fans
            191. Between 2.30 pm a n d 2.40 p m the crowd waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5.000 a n d becam e
         unmanageable. T he case made for the police was tha t large num be rs o f Liverpool supporters arrived late; a
         high proportion o f them were d r u n k a n d unco-operative; a high p ro p o rtio n had no tickets; all o f them were
         lu ll-bent on getting in on time. T hey say this was unforeseeable and explains why they lost control.

             192. W hether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 p m were “ late" was m uch deba te d. T he ticket
          simply requested its holder “to take up [his] position 15 m inutes before kick-off'. T h a t m ay have been
          intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be unreasonable for a
          standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm a n d 2.40 pm . W hether they were "late" o r not,
          however, there was certainlv a large concentration o f Liverpool fans a rriv in g at ab o u t 2.30 p m a n d after.

          1raffic Delays
              193. It is unlikely that traffic c o n d itio n s had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
          1 l'erpool traffic routes. There were roadw orks on the M62 which was the r e c o m m e n d ed route. At various
          points the carriageway was reduced from four lanes or three lanes to two. out no serious delays were reported.


                                                                     33

Fine Weather and Drinking
   194. T h e likeliest ex planations for the sparse Liverpool atten d a n ce in the ground before 2.30 p m were four­
fold - the w arm weather, drinking, disinclination to enter the ground early and prolong the standing, an d a
tendency o f Liverpool supporters to cut it fine,

   195. T h e police em phasised that at the 1988 semi-final there was no co m parable build-up o f “ late" arrivals.
T hey claim , therefore, that they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988. although the weather
was fine, it was 11CF cooler than in 1989. 15 April was the sort o f fine spring day which tem pted fans to sit or
stand ab o u t in the sun with a drink. If you had a ticket it would seem m ore pleasant an d sensible to relax in that
way th a n to en ter the ground early a n d stand on the terrace for an extra hour. P re-m atch e n te rta in m e n t in the
ground had been advertised but did not take place. Even if it h ad , it m ay not have been an encouragem ent to
m any fans to enter so early.

Was Drunkenness a Major Factor in the Crisis at the Turnstiles?
    196. O f those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very m any had been drink ing at public houses or had
brought d rin k from hom e or an off-licence. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority
were not d r u n k n o r even the worse for drink. T h e police w itnesses varied on this. Some described a high
p ro p o rtio n as d ru n k , as "lager-louts" or even as “anim als". O th ers described a generally n orm al crowd with an
unco -operative m inority who had d ru n k too m uch. In my view s o m e officers, seeking to rationalise their loss
o f control, overestim ated the d ru n k e n elem ent in the crowd. T here certainly was such a n elem ent. T here were
youngsters influenced by drink an d b ravado pushing im patiently at the rear o f the crow d thereby exacerbating
the crush. But the m ore convincing police witnesses, including especially D etective S up erin te n d en t McKay
a n d C h ie f Inspector Creaser as well as a n u m b e r o f responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this elem ent as a minority. T hose witnesses a ttrib u te d the crush to the sheer n u m b e rs o f fans all
an x io u s to gain entry. T here was no criticism o f the crowd by any o f the witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
o r even 2.35 pm. W hat happen ed then was not a sudden d e te rio ra tio n in the m o o d or sobriety o f those
assem bled there. N o d oubt those com ing behind would have h ad m o re to d rin k a n d would have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd b ec am e packed into a confined
turnstile area an d its very density h am p ered its passage through th e turnstiles.

    197. S u p erin te n d en t Marshall a n d o th e r officers criticised th e crowd as unco-operative because police
e x h o rta tio n s to stop pushing a n d to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In that crush most people
had no control over their m ovem ents at all. Two incidents involving police horses illustrate th e point. O ne
horse was found afterw ards to hav e cigarette b urn s on its ru m p . Clearly tha t was the despicable work o f a
hooligan w hether in drink or not. However, there were also eyewitness accounts o f a horse being physically
lifted o ff its feet by the crowd. T h at occurred, as the police accepted, w ithout m alice o r intent but as an
involuntary consequence o f crowd pressure which those by the horse's flanks could not resist any m ore than the
horse itself.

Reduced Efficiency of the Turnstiles
   198. T h e labelling o f the turnstiles in the o rd e r A. C. B was confusing. A fan w ith a B ticket who went by
m istake to the wrong side o f the metal fence would have had the greatest difficulty in getting back a n d round to
the correct side. T he colour coding was inefficient because th e coloured w ooden panels were affixed to the
turnst ile walls so low that they were not easily visible through a crowd. T h e inform ation on the ticket printed by
Sheffield W ednesday Football C lub was m isleading an d its layout unhelpful, as M r Mackrell frankly conceded.

    199. T h e result was that in the early stages, police officers were pestered by fans for help as to where they
should go. Later, as the crowd becam e m ore dense, fans were presenting their tickets at the w rong turnstiles.
T h e re were also Liverpool supporters who had acquired tickets for the Kop end bu t sought entry at Leppings
Lane. T h ey caused delays in th e turnstile o p era tio n when entry was refused a n d after a while the police
instructed the o pera to rs to let them through. T here was further delay because the crush m a d e it difficult for
fans to get into the turnstile entrances. O nce there, th e pressure from beh ind was such as, on occasions, to ja m
th e m in the doorway o r against the paddle o f the turnstile. Finally, there were fans without tickets w ho sought
to e n ter by offering paym ent, by seeking to go over or u nder the paddle or by sliding through with a ticket
holder. All o f these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst period was only a b o u t 600 per
ho u r per turnstile. T h e waiting crowd therefore ex panded and as the m in u tes passed frustration grew. Visitors


                                                                                         34
who had paid tor tickets and travelled from afar realised they were m aking little forward progress. Frustration
increased pressure an d induced panic at the front. D eterm ination to get into the match was intensified by
determ ination to get out o f the crush.

Were Fans W ithout Tickets a M ajor Factor in the Build-L'p?
  200. It has becom e a fact of football life that fans do turn up at all-ticket m a tch e s without tickets. It is not
possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable estim ate o f the n u m b e r w ithout tickets on 15 April. Police
estimates varied from ab o u t 200 to ab o u t 2.000. T here were certainly frequent requests for tickets or “spares”
during the h ours before the build-up. M any o f those w arned off by the police were seen to re tu r n to the area.
Some were hanging ab o u t on the bridge. Again, however, th e police witnesses w ho m ost im pressed m e did not
consider the n u m b e r o f ticketless fans to be inordinately large. T his ac cords with two o th e r sources o f
evidence.

   201. First, there was a wide range o f witnesses who observed inside the gro u n d th a t the Liverpool end was at
a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 a n d 4. T he no rth stand still h ad m a ny e m p ty seats a n d the wing
pens were sparse. T he m atch being a sell-out. there were clearly m any ticket holders to com e a n d they could
account for the large crowd still outside the turnstiles. H ad the Liverpool a c c o m m o d a tio n b e e n full by 2.40
pm. one could have inferred that most or m uch o f the large crowd outside lacked tickets.

   202. Secondly, such figuresas are available from the C lub's electronic m o n ito rin g system a n d from analyses
by the HSE suggest tha t no great n u m b e r entered w ithout tickets. T hey show th a t the n u m b e r who passed
through turnstiles A to G plus those who entered through gate C roughly equalled the terrace cap ac ity figure o f
 10,100 for which tickets had been sold. T h e C lub's record showed 7.038 passed through turnstiles A to G .
However, the c ounting m echanism on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE d id a stu d y using the video film
and projecting figures from the oth e r turnstiles. T h is gave an assessm ent o f 7.494, with a m a x im u m o f 7,644
passing through A to G . Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the n u m b e r w h o entered the ground whilst
g ateC was o pen at 2.240 with a m a x im u m o f 2.480. Accordingly, the H SE ’s best es tim a te o f the total entering
through gate C a n d turnstiles A to G was 9.734 with a m a x im u m o f 10.124.1 recognise tha t these can only be
rough checks because, for example, som e with terrace tickets were allowed through turnstiles 1 to 16 a n d there
would be o th e r sim ilar factors which have not form ed part o f the assessm ent. Nevertheless, the figures d o
suggest that there was not a very significant body o f ticketless fans in the crowd w hich built up.

The “Conspiracy” Theory-
  203. O n b eh a lf o f S outh Yorkshire police, the theory was advanced that the “late” arrival o f so many
Liverpool supporters was planned to buck the system. T he suggestion was that fans w ithout tickets conspired
to arrive late an d create such trouble as would force the police to a d m it th e m to the m atch . T h e slender
evidence upon which this theory rested cam e from two sources: overheard c on versations in public h o u se sa n d
the antecedent history o f Liverpool supporters at away matches.

  204. O ne w itness said he heard three Liverpool supporters saving, in effect, that they would m anage to get
in without tickets by causing trouble so that police would o pen a gate, a n d tha t they had d o n e this before.
Another w itness heard tw o o f a group o f Liverpool supporters say they had no tickets, tha t they w ould go to the
ground just before kick-off. that no-one would stop them getting in an d that they h a d not been stopped yet.
Statements were put in relating to two other small groups talking in sim ilar term s.

Liverpool Supporters at Away Matches
  205. T h e S outh Yorkshire police prepared a d o s s i e r o f reports on the b eha v io u r o f Liverpool f a n s a t away
matches with the object o f showing a pattern o f troublesom e behaviour by large n u m b e rs either w ith o u t tickets
or with forged tickets. W ithout sett in g o u t the whole history, it can be sum m arise d as follows.

  206. O n three occasions Liverpool fans w ithout tickets were allowed into all-ticket m atches u p o n paym ent.
(At Watford on 13 F ebruary 1988. 1,500 were a d m itted ; at S o u th a m p to n on 24 S eptem ber 1988, 150 were
adm itted; at S o u th a m p to n again on 12 D ecem ber 1988. 750 were a d m itted .) At N orw ich on 1 April 1989,
Liverpool su p p o rters arrived w ithout tickets but 1,272 tickets had been returned a n d fans from b o th Liverpool
and Norwich were allowed to buy them for cash. A sim ilar situation occurred at W im b le d o n on 13 May 1989.
There were six o th e r occasions from 1986 to d ate, including the C up finals o f 1986 a n d 1989. when num bers o f
Liverpool supporters tu r n e d u p without t ickets or otherwise b ehaved badly.

   207. Four p oints m ust be noted, however. O n n o n e o f the occasions when ticketless fans were a d m itted for
 payment was the m atch a sell-out. T here was therefore room in the ground on each occasion. At a sell-out fans

No Conspiracy
   208. I have already found that there was n o t an abnormally large n u m b e r o f fans w ithout tickets on this
occasion. W ith one or two exceptions, the police witnesses them selves d id not subscribe to the " conspiracy "
theory. I am satisfied that the large conc en tra tio n at Leppings L ane from 2.30 p m to 2.50 pm d id not arrive
as a result o f any concerted plan. T h ere were. I accept, small groups w ithout tickets who were willing to exploit
any a d v e n titio u s chance o f getting into the ground. They, together with the m inority who had d ru n k too m uch,
certainly aggravated the p roblem faced by the police. But tha t m a in problem was sim ply on e o f large n u m b e rs
packed into the small area outside the turnstiles.

The Police Operation at Leppings Lane
  209. T he O perational O rd e r for 15 April followed closely tha t laid down for the 1988 semi-final. T h e
em phasis was on m ain tainin g law a n d order. Side roads were to be blocked o ff to prevent dam age in residential
areas. Pairs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent “clash o f ri val supporters". O fficers were to watch public
houses, shops a n d su perm arkets "w here looting c ould take place". O u tsid e the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
supporters en terin g did not have banners, weapons, missiles o r alcohol.

   210. Unfortunately, hooligan behaviour has m a d e all these steps necessary. But the only w ritten provision
a im e d at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was o n e enjoining officers “to ensure orderly q ueues are
form ed". T h e re was no provision for controlling the entry o f the crow d into the turnstile area.

    211. A s l o n g a g o a s 1924. the D epartm ental C o m m itte e o n C row ds stated:-

   “T h e control o f crowds should begin at a point som e considerable distance from the e n tra n ce to the ground.
   T h e advantages o f an arran gem ent o f this kind a r e ... in preven ting congestion at th e entrances to grounds."

T h is was particularly im portant at Leppings Lane w here the turn stile area was so small a n d awkwardly laid
out. I f a large crow d was p erm itted uncontrolled entry through the p erim ete r gates, the form ing o f queues at the
turnstiles an d control by officers, w hether on foot o r m ounted, w ould b ecom e im practicable. T hose waiting at
the turnstiles w ould becom e a single growing mass. O nce th at h appe ned, it would be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  212. W h e th e r steps were taken an d what steps to avoid this h ap p e n in g was left to oral briefing an d a d hoc
instructions o n the day.

Previous Experience
    213. T h e senior police officers said it had never h ap p e n ed before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two p revious occasions w hen the Leppings Lane terraces h ad been used to fill the w hole o f the n orth
a n d west sides o f the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987 a n d 1988. In 1987. the m atch was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 12 noon, an d kick-off was postponed for a q u a rte r o f an h o u r because o f late arrivals.

Policing in 1988
   214. As to 1988. there was a very large an d consistent b o d y o f evidence that, on the day. the police in
Leppings Lane c onduc te d an efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those w ithou t tickets a n d
control the flow o f fans towards the ground. I d o not believe tha t so m any witnesses w ithout either o p p o rtu n ity
or reason to put th e ir heads together could be m istaken ab o u t w hat they experienced o n that occasion. Yet, the
police m a in ta in th a t no filtering exercise o th e r than on a ran d o m basis was conducted in 1988 a n d that the ir
policy a n d practice then were no different from those o f 1989.

  215. T he answ er to this conflict m ust. 1 think, be that whilst the policy may have been no different, in
practice the policing in 1988 was m o te efficient and was not put to the sam e test an d strain as a year later. T here
was not so large a swell in n u m b e rs ap proa ching the gro u n d from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm as in 1989.
N evertheless, there had been w arning signs in 1988. D etective S u perintendent M cKay gave the following
evidence:



                                                                                             36

      "Q Were you aware ot a b uild-up o f n um bers last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles0

      ■\   V s.   T here was a huge build-up aro u n d 10 m inutes to 3 when many, m any Liverpool supporters
           cam e at that time. They had been drinking, the ones that I saw and there was quite a sizeable crush
           built-up - sizeable queue.

      Q    Q u eu e o r cru sh 9

      A    C o m p ac ted queue, built-up in the area by the turnstiles which I believe are m a rke d A to G. T h a t crowd
           reached back alm ost to the gates. It never got any bigger than that and the turnstiles operated relatively
           freely an d they dealt with that crowd. F ans were still arriving at about 10 past 3 but by then t h e . . .

      Q    This crowd tha t you have described o f th e late arrivals at a bout 10 to - was it an o rderly crowd?

      A    Oh no. No. T he orderly crowd had gone in. and w hen I say they were not an orderly crowd, obviously
           m ixed am ongst those people w e r e . . .

      Q    O f course, but taking it generally?

      A    But by an d large they had taken a lot o f drin k on b oard an d they were in such n um bers that excluding
           them from the ground was completely o u t o f the question.

      Q    Were they standing in an orderly queue o r was there som e pushing and shoving?

      A    T here was a lot o f pushing a n d shoving. T h ere was an urgency to get into the ground.

      Q    But fortunately it does not a p p e ar to have been in nearly such n um bers as this year.

      A    It w asn't.”

    Police Intelligence in Advance
      216. A part from that experience in 1988. the tendency o f Liverpool su pporters to arrive late was not
    unknown. W itnesses said that they get through the turnstiles at th e ir h o m e ground. Anfield. q u ite quickly an d
    tend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent tendency to p ostpone arrival was noted by the
    Sheffield C ity Council Adv isory G roup, with police present, on 23 M arch 1988. T h e m in u te reads:-

      “As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a p attern has developed o f people arriving som e 15 m in u tes
      before the start o f the gam e hoping to gain adm ission. T h is trend m ay b e d u e to th e b a n n in g o f alcohol at
      sports g roun ds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshm ent prior to the football m atch. As
      the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for th e m ajo rity o f the time, an d tha t the late arrival
      problem could perhaps only be dealt with by education o f the spectators" {sic).

      217. In so far as Liverpool supporters’ b ehaviour at away m a tch e s may have been indicative o f w hat police
    problems m ight arise on 15 April, most o f the facts should have been available at the pla nning stage. As in o th e r
    forces. South Yorkshire Police had a liaison officer whose jo b was to seek, receive an d collate relevant
    inform ation as to the visiting supporters. T h e Association o f C h ief Police Officers' G u id e to Policing Football
    highlights the im p o rta n ce o f such liaison:—

      “ It is im p o rta n t tha t the officer responsible for policing th e m atch determ ines the pre-m atch planning in the
      light o f the intelligence at hand. Whilst that intelligence can be o b ta in e d from a variety o f sources, the p rim e
      source for football intelligence is the Police N ational Intelligence System which is based on the netw ork o f
      police liaison officers. S u m m aries com pleted by police officers o f the h o m e club force are forw arded to the
      visiting clu b 's liaison officer m aking available intelligence a bout fans’ b ehaviour at both ho m e and away
      fixtures. T h is inform ation will be collated a n d m a d e available for future m atches involving that club” .

      218. The FA had also laid down in a m e m o r a n d u m issued in the 1985/6 season m easu res to be a d o p te d by
    the away club which included the following; -

      " It is the responsibility o f the away club to advise the ho m e club o f the recent beha v io u r o f their supporters
      at away m atches, irrespective o f w hether the behaviour has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
      Association or not".

      219. It d o es not seem tha t inform ation o f th is kind was passed to the Sheffield W ednesday Club o r played


                                                                37
any part in the South Yorkshire Police plans. H ad the latter been inform ed o f the history coniaincd in t h e
dossier an d s u m m arise d above it may well have influenced police strategy in Leppings Lane,

  220. T here is presently a proposal that a n ational com puter-based police football intelligence sy stem should
be set up to make the necessary inform ation readily available.

Police Intelligence on the Day
   221. T h e unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures for entry available from the
C lub's c o m p u te r an d observations on the v ideo screen should have enabled those in the control room m
m o n ito r th e n u m b e rs arriving an d still to arrive at Leppings Lane. R adio contact with m obile (Tango) patrols
detailed to m o n ito r licensed prem ises in the district could have indicated the num bers still to come. But at 2.30
pm when M r M urray told M r D uckenfield they would "get them all in by 3 o'clock" he seems not to have
appreciated tha t in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were many m ore still to com e. Certainly. Mr
Marshall ou tsid e the turnstiles was not told and could not otherw ise have known that there were still many
Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.

M r M arshall and Mr Greenwood
  222. T h e division o f co m m an d between these two officers did not help. M r Marshall was in charge o f the
serials o u tsid e the peri meter gates in the Leppings Lane area an d in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
inside a n d ju st outside the turnstile area. M r G re en w o o d 's area as G ro u n d C o m m a n d e r extended from the
pitch to the p erim ete r gates. He in fact stationed h im self n ea r the players' tunnel. He was wholly unaw are o f the
growing p roblem s at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers w ho were u nder
pressure there. N o-one in the control room thought to tell him.

Control Lost
   223. In the result, the large concentration o f arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrained into
the turnstile area through the p erim eter gates which were fully open. W hen that area was full, later arrivals
swelled th e crowd out to the forecourt and even into the road. As already recounted, the foot officers at the
turnstiles b ec am e trap p e d and endangered a n d retired through the turnstiles. T he m o u n te d officers could not
opera te a m id st such a dense crowd in a confined space. They ca m e o u t o f the turnstile area. T h e re were then
the belated a tte m p ts to close the p erim eter gates and prevent m ore f an sjo in in g the mass until it had a chance to
d im in ish through the turnstiles: still later the a ttem p t to put a cordo n o f horses across the entrance.

   224. D espite knowledge o f the difficult layout, the very large n u m b e r o f fans to be got through so few
turnstiles an d the tendency o f fans to arrive in the last h alf hour, no contingency plans were m a d e to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the day. the need to close Leppings L ane to traffic before 2.30 pm and the
o th e r available intelligence already sum m arised, should have p ro m p te d those in c o m m a n d to take precautions
against such a crush. If s o m e o f the p erim eter gates had been closed a n d c ordons o f m o u n te d a n d foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow o f fans into the turnstile area could have been
controlled before th a t i.^ea becam e engulfed. It was the crush itself w*';'-h produced the frustration and the
panic and brought out the worst in those who had d ru n k too m uch                 .. 'in control oi -.‘ntry would have
prevented the crush a n d m aintained the good m ood which had prevailed until 2.30 pm.

  225. It should moreov er have been obvious by 2.40 pm , if not earlier, that a large part o f the crowd could
not be a d m itte d until well after 3 pm . H ad a decision to p ostpone kick-off been m a d e an d a n n o u n c e d m uch o f
the frustra tion an d with it the im petus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A co m b in a tio n o f
controlled filtering an d a postponed kick-off would probably have o bvia ted the need to o pen th e gates.

Postponement of Kick-off
    226. At vario u s stages in his evidence. M r D uckenfield gave three accounts o f why he th ou ght it too late to
p o stp o n e kick-off. O n ce it was that o ne o f the team s had already com e o n to the pitch. T h en it was that a group
o f pho to g rap h e rs at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the te am s were com ing out. Finally, he did not
know whv he thought the teams were com ing out. They did not in fact co m e o n to the pitch until 2,54 pm, two
m in u te s after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a p ostpone m e nt o f kick-off before
gate C was opened. It should not, however, have needed a police C onstable in the thick o f the crowd (and there
were others o f like m in d ) to think o f postponing the kick-off. The need should have been clear in the control
room .

   227. T he truth was that M r Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed w ith M r Murray,
K ick-off would not be postponed unless there were so m e m ajor cause for delayed arrivals <■? a ja m on the
m o t o r w a y o r fog. 1 a c c e p t t h at t h e t h i n k i n g b e h i n d t h is p o l i c y w a s n o t c a l l o u s o r p u n i t i v e . I f k i c k - o f f is

Summary
   228.      The layout of the turnstiles an d the n u m b e r they were required to serve left no margin o f safety against
an uneven flow of fans. Because police strategy in advance and o n th e day did not cater for it. the arrival o f a
large n u m b e r o f supporters between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm created an unm anageab le crush. T he presence of
a substantial m inority o f fans who had d ru n k too m uch aggravated tha t problem . H aving lost control and
rejected the o p tion o f postponing kick-off. the police were faced with a serious d anger o f deaths o r injuries.
They were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gates. S u p erin te n d en t Marshall was right at that
stage to ask for it an d M r Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects o f so d ra m a tic a step required
other action.
                                                     C H A P T E R 11

                                  T H E B L U N D E R O N O P E N I N G T H E GATES

    229. T h e decision to order the opening o f the gates was not a c co m p an ie d o r followed by any o th e r ord er to
deal with the consequences. W hen gate C was opened, a steady stream o f about 2.000 fans p o u red through it
over som e five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground som ew here an d unless they were diverted
their likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. No w arning was issued from the control
room tha t the gate was to be opened. Serials o n the concourse were not alerted. N either the C lub control room
n o r the C h ie f Steward at the Leppings Lane end was warned. Not even M r G reenw ood, the G ro u n d
C o m m a n d e r, was inform ed. From 2.47 pm when M r M arshall m a d e his first request until 2.52 pm when M r
D uckenfield acceded to it. there were five m inu tes in w hich o rders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not done. In evidence. M r D uckenfield began by saying that n o officer m a d e any
w rong decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. H e said he did not consider w here the people
w ould go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, w hen he could s e e th e influx on the television screen, no
o rd e r was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. M r D uckenfield said it d id not cross his m in d to detail
officers on the concourse to shut o f f the tunnel. T hose officers could not have known from the ir position how
full pens 3 and 4 were. T hat was a m a tte r for the control room to m o n ito r from its own observations an d using
intelligence from aro u n d the ground.

  230. Since pens 3 a n d 4 were full by 2.50 pm . the tunnel should have been closed o ff w h eth e r gate C was to
be o p e n e d o r not. T h e exercise was a sim ple on e an d h ad been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel a n d divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
1988 closure seems to have been unknow n to the senior officers on d u ty at the time. It d id not figure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the p lanning for 1989.

   231. P lannin g apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room where there was a view o f the
pens a n d o f the crowd at the turnstiles tha t the tunnel had to be closed. I f orders h ad been given to tha t effect
w hen gate C was o pened, the fans could have been directed to the em pty areas o f the wings a n d this disaster
could still have been avoided Failure to give that order was a b lu n d e r o f the first m agnitude.

   232. Significantly, when perm ission was given to open gate A. M r D uckenfield did o r d e r serials to go to that
part o f the concourse to m o n ito r the influx towards the north stand. H e d id this because he feared that if fans
w ent to the north sta n d w ithout tickets, they would not get seats a n d . there b eing no p erim ete r fences at the
n o rth side, they might invade the pitch. T his illustrates again the preo c cu p a tio n with avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety a n d the risks o f overcrowding. Because those entering th rough gate C could n o t get onto the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to m o n ito r them . T h e possibility o f overcrow ding simply

                                             TH E BARRIERS IN PEN 3

Barrier 144
   233. T he removal o f barrier 144 in 1986 should have reduced the notional capacity o f pen 3 as already
m entioned. But it d id more. In the absence o f barrier 144. the influx o f fans after 2.52 pm met no retarding
structure as it c a m e into pen 3. T h e pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
the lowest line o f barriers. The pressure diagonally from the tunnel m o u th down to b a rrier n u m b e r 124a which
collapsed was unbroken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen
through the gap in the barrier above it created in 1985.

  234. Inspector Bullas, positioned in the west stand, described w hat he saw looking down on the pens
around 3 pm.

  "... I saw from the direction o f the tunnel a kind o f m ovem ent down the te rr a c in g ... the type o f thing that you
  see on the n atu re program m es, the m olten lead flowing down the side o f the m ountainside, the m olten l a v a ...
  a "river o f p eo ple” ... going directly towards the pitch but the re again s p r e a d in g ... o u t. ”

   235. D r Eastw ood co nceded in evid ence that th e removal o f b a rrier 144 was likely to have c o n trib u ted to
the collapse o f 124a. Later, he sought to resile from tha t answer, but I th in k his earlier adm ission was correct. It
was argued that if b a rrier 144 h ad rem ained, the influx from gate C would have built up fu rth e r back a n d the
tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel or might have b roken barrier 144 itself T h is is speculative a n d I
think unlikely. W h a t rem ained o f b a rrier 144 in pen 4 did not cause a build-up; n o r d id it collapse. But its
remaining in p osition m ay well have accounted for no barrier f u rth e r down pen 4 collapsing a n d for th e lesser
carnage in that pen.

When did Barrier 124a Fail?
  236. Counsel for the S outh Yorkshire Police sought to argue that this barrier collapsed or m ay have
collapsed at ab o u t 2,47 pm. His p urpose was to suggest that the opening o f g a te C was not causally linked with
the crushing an d fatalities resulting from tha t collapse. I have already found tha t whilst the evidence does not
permit the tim e o f collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 pm . I now give my reasons:

  fa) I have several tim es w atched the BBC video ta p e on which Counsel relied. I do not find the incident he
      identifies at 2.47 pm suggestive o f a collapse at that time:

  (b) the evidence o f fans who were near o r at the b a rrier was overwhelmingly to the effect tha t the collapse
      occurred at o r after 3 pm;

  (c) the biggest grou p o f witnesses was tha t which related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley’s
      "ne ar-m iss” at th e Kop end at 3.04 pm;

  (d) the a p p e ara n ce on video an d pho tographs o f fans in the area o f b arrier 124a after the incident at 2.47 pm
      a n d before the final crush is not consistent with it having collapsed so early:

  (e) it is highly unlikely that if so ca tastrophic an event had o ccurred as early as 2.47 pm . the police on the
      track a n d elsewhere would have taken until nearly 3 o'clock to realise som ethin g was seriously wrong.
      Indeed, if C ounsel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his tim in g o f the collapse, the failure o f
      the police to resp o n d for so long w ould expose th e m to even graver criticism than that m ade in this
      Report.

Dr Eastwood's Testing of the Barriers
   237. Two sections o f b arrier 124a in pen 3 collapsed as a result o f the overcrowding. T h a t collapse caused a
n u m b e r o f deaths. D r E astw ood an d his staff had u ndertaken the periodical testing o f crush b arriers required
by the G reen G u id e a n d by the Safety Certificate. Barrier 124a had been tested in July 1988 a n d passed.

  238. T h e test h a d been carried out in accordance w ith D r Eastwood's interpretation o f Annex C to the
Green G uide. T h a t requires an evenly d istrib u ted force o f 6 .0 k N /m etre w idth to be applied for 3 five m in u te



                                                             41
 periods, the interval between a pplica tions to be as short as possible. A record has to b e kept o f the am o u n t o f
d efo rm atio n d u ring each loading a n d o f the percentage o f recover). If the recoven, is l es s than 50% after the
third application o f force, the barrier has failed the test. If recovery is betw een 50% and 75%. there must be a
re-test. T he q uestion is: 50% o r 75% o f what? Is the recovery to be \n relation to the position o f the barrier
before the first application o f force o r before the third? If the former, a span o f 124a recorded 5 3% at the 1988
test an d should have been re-tested. I f the latter, it recorded 100% a n d passed. U nfortunately the G reen G uide
i s unclear as to the correct interpretation. D r Eastwood took the latter view an d so passed the barrier. He
ju stified his interpretation in evidence. H e said failure to recover to th e original position could be due to a
"sh ake-dow n" effect related to some giving in th e ashes u n d e r the concrete or to som e o th e r ex tra n eo u s factor
rath e r than to any defect in the m aterial o f the b arrier itself.

   239. I think, after consulting Professor M aunder, tha t safety ought to have dictated recovery should be by
reference to the position o f the b arrier before the first application o f force. I accept, however, th a t the Green
G u id e is am b ig u o u s and D r Eastw ood's interpretation is tenable. It has som e supp ort from the British
S ta n d a rd s tests on steel structures. Clearly, however, for the future. th e G r e e n G u id e should be clarified on this
point.

Corrosion
   240. Inspection o f barrier 124a. a n d indeed o th e r barriers at Hillsborough, by th e HSE showed
considerable corrosio n o f the metal at vulnerable points w here water could accum ulate. D r Eastwood agreed
th a t if a significant degree o f corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a barrier should be condem ned.

  241. The G re en G u id e does not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, in ter alia:

  “C rush barriers a n d balustrades should be ex a m in e d for deform ation o r any o th e r overt signs o f weakness".

P aragraph 6 o f A nnex C provides:

  “ If d u ring any test, even though the b a r r i e r ... satisfies the above loading requirem ents, d o u b t should arise
  for any reason (including such m atters as cracking o f the terracing o r d istortion o f connections) as to the
  safety o f the b a r r i e r ... a detailed investigation should be carried out. U nless the results o f this investigation
  rem ove the d o u b t as to safety o f the b a r r i e r ... (it) should be d eem ed to have failed the test".

  242. Since corrosion is a likely cause o f deterioration, a revision o f the G reen G u id e should m ake specific
reference to it.

Causation
  243. Tests d o n e by the HSE suggest that although barrier 124a passed th e loading test in 1988 a n d probably
would have been able to sustain a force which d id not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist the load
im posed u pon it by reason o f the n u m b e rs in pen 3. the excessive gap in the b arrier higher u p the pen a n d the
absence o f b a rrie r 144. C orrosion p robably played a part, b u t the effective cause o f the collapse was the
excessive an d u n an ticip ate d pressure to which the b arrier was exposed.

                                       THE CR U SH IN G NOT RE C O G N ISE D

Observation from Control Room
   244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in th e control room could be expected
to keep a close w atch on pens 3 an d 4, T h ey had a direct view o f them from an elevated position through their
window. A lthough they h ad no field-glasses, there was the zoom facility on the TV cam era. T he radio was by
then working again a n d although reception was difficult d u e to crowd noise a n d possibly excessive air traffic
on channel 25. a tte m p ts could have been m a d e to alert officers on th e p erim eter track to watch for
overcrowding a n d report thei r observations. In the event, pens 3 a n d 4 b ec am e m ore a n d m ore crow ded, surges
took place, fans were showing a n d signalling distress. N o n e o f this was seen o r recognised in the control room.

Officers on the T rack
  245. T h e 20 officers detailed to the perim eter track were distributed ro u n d the pitch so tha t som e five
officers were at the west end. Their w ritten instructions m a d e no reference to the avoidance o r d etection o f
overcrowding. T he sam e applied to the officers in the west stand. M r G re en w o o d a d m itte d tha t his oral
briefings also c o n tain e d no m ention o f m o nitoring the pens for overcrowding.

  246. T h e O perational O rd e r for 1988 h ad instructed officers to forbid any one “access to the track from the
terraces w ithout the con sent o f a senior officer (except to receive medical a tte n tio n )” . At the e n d o f the 1988
semi-final, there was a m in o r pitch invasion. Accordingly, th a t p rohibition was em phasised in the 1989
O perational O rd e r by bei ng put into capital letters. T he c o m b in atio n o f no in stru c tio n s as to overcrowding and
a strong p ro h ib itio n on openin g the gates was likely to m ake police recognition o f crushing slow a n d their
response reluctant. Small w onder th a t the growing pressure an d congestion betw een 2.50 pm a n d 2.59 pm
went u n h ee d ed o r certainly u nrem edied. Even w hen officers recognised there was a problem , the rule required
consent o f a senior officer before a gate could be opened.

  247. "S en io r officer" m e a n t an officer o f Inspector rank o r higher. T he Inspector in charge o f the 20 officers
on th e track was M r Darling. He stationed him self by the players' tunnel, the m ost central position for
supervising his m en. In evidence he said:

  “I would only take action if I thought crowding h a d got to such a stage th a t the fans were in danger. I'd then
  inform gro u n d control a n d I would expect som eone deployed to the back o f the stand."

  T h a t un derlines th e inhibition against o pening p erim ete r gates. So did th e evidence o f one C o n stab le who
said it had been so d r u m m e d into officers not to o pen the gates th a t when he saw distress in pen 4. he “ debated"
with h im self before opening the gate, thinking: “ If I'm wrong. I 'm going to get a right bollocking fo r this."
Naturally, one w ould hope th a t co m m o n sense a n d h u m a n ity would m ake som e officers cut through the rules
and open a g a te if fans were clearly in distress.

  248. T h is is w hat h ap p e n ed , but not until officers recognised the distress a n d even then not immediately.
Hence, gates 3 a n d 4. having been opened, were shut again before they were finally opened a n d at first those
seeking to climb o u t over the fence were pushed back. T his reaction o f the police d id not go on for as long as
some witnesses believed. T hey probably m isinterpreted the h an d m ovem ents from M r G reenw ood a n d others
aim ed at p ersuadin g fans to move back a n d relieve the pressure as a ttem p ts to stop those clim bing o u t at the
front.

  249. N evertheless, there was a period d u ring which the failure to recognise the p roblem a n d th e inhibition
against tackling it caused vital time to be lost.

T h e Officers in Com mand
    250. Even when realisation o f the problem ca m e to officers o n the track, it was som e m inutes before it
reached the control room. W hen spectators first a p p e are d on the track, the im m e d ia te a ssu m p tio n in the
co ntrol room was th a t a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning o f a m atch. It
becam e still less likely when those on the track m a d e no move towards the pitch. M r M otson, the BBC
c o m m en tato r, recognised an d said, well before the m atch was stopped , that the trouble seem ed to be
overcrow ding a n d not m isbehaviour. Still, th e assu m p tio n to the co n tra ry persisted in th e control room . U ntil
M r M urra y radioed for a fleet o f am bulances, ab o u t 3.06 pm, M r D uckenfield c ontinued to treat the incident
as a th rea t to the pitch a n d to public order. T h e message calling u p all available officers m e n tio n e d a pitch
invasion. O p eratio n S upport was initiated a n d dog handlers were requested.
    251. U ntil C h ie f S u perinte ndent N esbit arrived, there was no effective leadership e ith e r from control o r on
th e pitch to harness a n d organise rescue efforts. N o orders were given for officers to e n t e r the tunnel a n d relieve
pressure. S om e officers d id this on the ir own initiative. A part from the T annoy request to clear th e pitch, no
a tte m p t was m a d e to clear an d m a rk o ff a casualty area where first-aid could be given w ithout h in d ra n c e by
fans a n d photographers milling ab o u t between th e bodies. There was no co-ord inatio n o f the early provision o f
first-aid o r o f stretch er parties o r o f the rescue effort through gates 3 a n d 4. N o request for help was b ro ad c ast to
doctors a n d nurses in the crowd until a b o u t 3.29 pm w hen it was to o late. Probably, th e re was little th a t could
have been achieved in m ost cases however soon doctors h ad been su m m o n e d , but t h e re were m arginal cases
where earlier a tte n tio n might have m a d e a difference.
   252. T he plight o f those b eh in d the fencing a n d the existence o f injuries were know n to officers at the scene
from 3 pm . But the M a jo r D isaster Plan was not started until 3.06 p m at earliest w h en the am b u la n c e service
was called. N o request for cutting gear o r for the fire brigade was m a d e u ntil 3.13 p.m . Again, it is unlikely that
these services could have saved lives if they h ad been called promptly, but it is possible.
Police on the Pitch
    253. D espite the initial lack o f leadership, m any officers did all they hum anly could to rescue a n d revive the
victims. M any su pporters who gave evidence paid trib u te to these efforts. It is also fair to say th a t th e n u m b e r
o f officers who could at first be usefully involved at the two open gates was necessarily limited.
   254. C h ie f S u p erin te n d en t N esbit’s action in deploying a line o f officers across th e m id d le o f th e pitch has
already been m e n tio n e d . I can well u n d ersta n d the resentm ent it caused. However, th e police assertion that a
rush by som e fans towards the Kop en d raised fears o f conflict are well b o rn e o u t by t h e v id e o tape. In my
ju d g e m en t. C h ie f S u p erinte n dent N esbit was well ju stified in using so m e o f the m a n y officers called up
p u rsu an t to O p eratio n Support to prevent possible violence. T o have h a d o p e n fighting in a ground where
som e 90 spectators already lay dea d w ould have been an u n th in k a b le a n d obscene develo pm ent.
F ans on the Pitch
   255. M any fans who escaped on to th e pitch alive were in a sta te o f collapse o r close to it. M ost o f those who
retained the ir strength strove magnificently to assist the victim s. T hey helped pull th e m d e a r ; they helped with
first-aid; they helped carry th e im provised stretchers.
   256. T h ere were fans, however, w ho were distraught, angry, d ru n k , o r all three. T h e i r co n d u c t in abusing,
assaulting a n d spitting at the police was disgraceful, the m ore so since earlier police failures h a d little to do
with those officers now doing the ir best for the injured. In ad d itio n , there were abuse a n d assaults on
a m b u lan c e m en a n d firemen in the course o f th e ir rescue work. T his was probably because th e ir sim ilar
uniform s caused them to be m istaken for police. However, alth ough the abuse was w idespread, th e n u m b e r o f
assaults a n d spittings was on the evidence com paratively small. In deploring th e m , o n e m ust recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience which those responsible had j u s t suffered an d were still suffering.
False Reports
    257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reported in the press, a n d said t o have e m an a te d from
police officers present at the m atch, o f “m ass d runkenne ss". It was said tha t d ru n k e n fans u rin a te d o n the
police while they were pulling the d e a d an d injured out, that o th e rs had even urin ated o n the bodies o f the dead
a n d stolen th e ir belongings. N ot a single witness was called before the Inq u iry to support any o f those
allegations although every o p p o rtu n ity was afforded for any o f th e represented parties to have any witness
called w h o m they wished. As soon' as the allegations I have m e n tio n e d were m a d e in the press, M r Peter
W right. C h ie f C onstable o f South Yorkshire, m a d e a dignified statem ent dissociating h im se lf fro m such grave
a n d em o tiv e calum nies. T h o se who m a d e the m , a n d those w h o dissem inated the m , w ould have d o n e b etter to
hold their peace.

                                                               44
                                                              C H A P T E R 15

                                      THE PER IM ETER GATES WERE T O O SM A LL

   258. T he p erim eter gates in the pens were not designed as exits. They were in te n d e d to afford access by the
police to cope w ith any local disorder or w ith an emergency. T he kind o f em ergency co n tem plated was not
massive crushing but. for example, the collapse o r illness of an individual. Emergency evacuation o f the pens
had been considered by the Officer Working Party. A lthough fire risk was m inim a l since the terraces, west
stand a n d tunnel were o f concrete construction , the fire brigade were the principal arbiters o f evacuation
procedure. They aim ed to be able to em p ty the pens in six m inutes. T h e plan was to evacuate spectators Wathe
tunnel. I f for any reason th a t option b ecam e im practicable, f g d u e to a bo m b threat, then the a ltern a tiv e route
would be along the back o f the terraces, through the gates in the radial fences a n d roun d the sides o f the west
stand. T h e fire brigade were satisfied tha t each o f these routes w ould enable the pens to be evacuated in less
th a n six m inutes, w ithout relying on the gates to the pitch. T h o se gates would also be available, b u t their use
was excluded from the calculation o f evacuation time.

  259. T h e need to provide for speedy a n d large scale evacuation from the front o f the pens to th e pitch was
not an ticipated. T h e G reen G u id e (1986) provides as follows:

  “ 209. Access to the pitch m ust be m a d e as difficult as possible in norm al circum stances while at the same
  tim e ensuring tha t th e police have effective access to th e terraces for the purpose o f crowd control an d
  enabling the pitch to be used (where a p p ro p riate) in the event o f serious em ergency . . .

  214. . . . at som e m a jo r soccer stadia, w here restriction on crowd m ovem ent form s a necessary part o f the
  safety measures, it m ay be necessary to have a fence which prevents access to the p itch in norm al
  circum stances . . . but allows for access in emergency.

  215. For most m ajor stadia, w hether used for association football o r o th e r sports, the pitch p e rim e te r fence
  will be required e ither to prevent access to the pitch as m e n tio n e d above, o r at least to discourage attem pts
  by spectators to enter the playing area. G ate s o r other access points ( m in im u m w idth 1.1 m etres) should
  nonetheless be provided for use in an em ergency . . . Provision o f such gates o rac ce ss points is particularly
  im p o rta n t to allow full access to the playing area (or track) w here it is likely to be used as a place o f safety in
  an emergency.            Such gates o r access points should be properly stewarded a n d                           clearly
  m a rk e d so tha t im m ed iate access to the playing area o r p e rim e te r track can be ensured".

  260. G a te 3 was .82 m etres in w idth: gate 4 was .79 m etres in w idth. T here were therefore c lea r departures
from the G reen G u id e standard.

   261. T he Safety Certificate provided (by Schedule 2 P aragraph 24) as follows:

   T he (club) shall arrange for the S tadium to be inspected by a suitably qualified C hartered E n g in e e r . . . at
   least once each period o f 12 m o n th s . . . a n d . . . shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
   the . . . Council a Certificate by the said C h a rte re d Engineer as to the current com pliance or non-com pliance
   with . . . the ap p ro p riate p ro v isio n sa n d rec o m m e n d a tio n s o f th e (G r e e n ) G u id e o fall structural p a r ts o f the
   S tadium . . .

   262. It was argued that there was no breach o f the Safety Certificate since the G reen G u id e specifically
provides for flexibility. However, in my view the Safety C ertificate ca nnot a n d certainly should not be
in terp re ted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic req u irem en ts as the size o f exit gates to the total
discretion o f the club a n d its advisers. O n e o f the matters for con sid eratio n at stage two o f this inquiry will be
whether, a n d in w hat respects, the G reen G u id e needs to be clarified a n d toughened.

  263. D r Eastwood explained the small width o f the gates by reference to the d ile m m a facing th e police. They
w anted a gate sufficient for its in tended purpose ie police access a n d small scale emergencies. O n the o th e r
han d , they did not w ant a flood gate o f such size as to en d a n g e r the p rim e principle o f preventing pitch
invasions. In the light o f Hillsborough, this is perhaps the m ost p oignant exam ple o f the difficulty o f achieving
a balance betw een stopping hooliganism a n d ensuring crowd safety.

   264. Even if the w idth of gates 3 an d 4 had com plied w ith the present G reen G u id e s ta n d ard , they would
 have   been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure an d release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
G re e n G u id e says nothing ab o u t the n u m b e r o f gates req u ired for a pen o f given size. W hilst the Club,

  265. T he im m ed iate cause o f the gross overcrowding a n d hence the d isaster was the failure, when gate C was
opened, to cut off access to the central pens which were already overfull.

  266. They were already overfull because no safe m a x im u m capacities had been laid dow n, no a tte m p t was
m ade to control entry to individual pens num erically a n d there was no effective visual m o n ito rin g o f crowd
density.

   267. W hen the influx from gate C entered pen 3. the layout o f the barriers there afforded less protection
th a n it should a n d a b a rrier collapsed. Again, the lack o f vigilant m onitoring caused a sluggish reaction an d
response when the crush occurred. T he small size a n d n u m b e r o f gates to the track retard ed rescue efforts. So.
in the initial stages, d id lack o f leadership.

    268. T he need to o pen gate C was due to d angerous congestion at the turnstiles. T h at occurred because, as
both C lub a n d police should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope w ith the large n um bers
d e m a n d e d o f it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy p eriod. T h e O p eratio n al O rd e r a n d police tactics on
the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival o f large n u m b e rs should tha t occur in a short
period. T h a t it might so occur was foreseeable an d it did. T he presence o f an unruly m inority who h ad d ru n k
too m uch aggravated the problem . So did the C lu b ’s confused a n d in a d eq u a te signs an d ticketing.
                                                        C H A P T E R 17

                                           T H E FA s C H O I C E O F G R O U N D

    269. T he FA were strongly criticised by the Football Supporters' Association an d others for having
im posed the H illsborough venue on Liverpool fo r a second year running. The Liverpool supporters h ad to
travel m uch fu rth e r to Sheffield th a n th e ir N o ttin g h am rivals. T h e police required that if the m atch was to be at
Hillsborough at all, Liverpool would have to have the west a n d n orth side a c co m m o d atio n . T he disadvantages
o f th a t a n d the d isp a ra te n u m b e rs o f h o m e supporters o f the two clubs have already been set out. Liverpool had
had to knuckle u n d e r to the a rran g e m en t in 1988, T hey resented having it im posed in 1989. To hold the m atch
at O ld T rafford w ould have been a perfectly good a n d acceptable alternative. Indeed, the FA n o m in a te d O ld
Trafford as the v enue for the replay should there b e a d raw at Hillsborough.

   270. M r Kelly, th e FA’s C h ie f Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring Hillsborough, but the only one
which seem ed to have any validity was th a t the 1988 m atch had been considered a successfully m anaged event.
H e a d m itte d that a telephone call from the C h ie f Executive o f the Liverpool C lub protesting a n d putting
L iverpool’s case had n o t been m e n tio n e d to th e FA c o m m itte e w hich finally d ecided th e venue. M r Kelly
frankly conceded th at “ there was an elem ent o f unfairn ess" to Liverpool in choosing Hillsborough f o ra second
tim e. I think the decision was ill-considered. N o d o u b t in future the FA will be m ore sensitive a n d responsive
to reasonable representations.

  271. However, it was not suggested tha t the choice o f venue was causative o f this disaster. T h e only basis on
which that could be said w ould be th a t, because o f its layout, the Leppings Lane e n d was incapable o f being
successfully policed for this semi-final. I d o not believe tha t to be so.

Choice o f Ends by the Police
   272. T here was m uch bitterness am ongst Liverpool supporters that they h ad to make d o again for the
second year with the Leppings Lane end. But, cogent as the ir com p lain ts were, they a m o u n te d to reasons for
choosing a different ground altogether. G iven Hillsborough as the venue. 1 think the police were right to
allocate the sections o f the ground as they did. T he directio n o f arrival a n d '.he need for segregation m ade it
sensible a n d to reverse the 1988 arrangem ents w ould have m a d e for confusion. As with choice o f venue, I do
not consider choice o f ends was causative o f the disaster. H ad it been reversed, the d isaster could well have
occurred in a sim ilar m a n n e r but to N o ttin g h a m supporters.

Police Planning
  273. T h e O perational O rd e r for 1989 left m uch unsaid. A p a rt from th e lack o f any provision for late or
congested arrivals, o r any provision for the avoid an c e o f overcrow ding on th e terraces, there was a n u m b e r of
other om issions. For exam ple, there was no specific dep lo y m en t o f officers to m a n the p erim eter gates. The
O rd e r d id n ot detail the duties of the m o u n te d officers deployed at the L eppings L ane entrance, w ho included
Liverpool officers to assist in m arshalling the ir own fans. T he duties o f S up erin te n d en ts (especially M r
G reenw ood a n d M r M arshall) were not defined so as to achieve clarity a n d efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision requiring m obile (Tango) patrols to assist the em ergency services was o m itte d from the text.

   274. T he 1988 O rd e r was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the n u m b e r o f officers deployed in
shopping areas a n d to em phasise in capital letters the em bargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
w ith the 1988 event led to complacency. T h a t som e th ought the pens overfull in 1988 a n d tha t the tunnel was
closed o f f on th a t occasion d id not figure in o r influence the plan for 1989.

   275. M r D uckenfield was prom oted a n d pu t in charge o f F D ivision only 21 days before this semi-final. The
pre-planning was already in progress u n d e r M r M ole w ho h a d been in c o m m a n d both in 1987 a n d in 1988. It
might have been wiser to have left M r M ole in charge o f this operation. O n th e o th e r han d , it is quite
u n d ersta n d ab le th a t M r D uckenfield sho uld have been expected to take c o m m a n d o f events in h is Division
from the d ate o f his prom otion. In view o f his lack o f experience at H illsborough a n d o f a semi-final match,
however, it was im perative tha t he be fully briefed a n d th a t he should also b r ie f himself.

  276. H e was n o t inform ed o f the c rushin g incident in 1981 n o r did he m ake inquiries w hich w ould have
revealed it. H e d id not know the arran g e m en t as betw een C lu b a n d police for m onitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces. He d id not visit a n d tour the g r o u n d before approving the O p eratio n al O rder. A lthough he atten de d a
m atch on 2 April, there was only a small crowd p resent a n d he left control o f the gam e to the S uperintendents.

Policing on the Day
   277. O n e o f the regrettable features o f the football scene as it has developed is the e n o rm o u s expenditure o f
money, tim e a n d effort in employing large n u m b e rs o f police all over the c ountry to guard against the sort o f
d iso rd e r a n d m isbehaviour which have b ecom e endem ic. Pol ice m a n ag e m en t o f a gam e o f football has becom e
a m ilitary operation. T h e problem s faced a n d the responses received m u s t be disheartening a n d may have
te n d e d to h ard e n police attitu des to su p p o rters in general.

   278. It is fair to state th a t over m any years the S outh Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
public. T hey have handled crowd problem s sensitively a n d successfully at a large n u m b e r o f football games
including m a jo r m atches, during strikes in the coal in d u stry a n d the steel industry, a n d in o th e r contexts.
U nfortunately, the ir policing on 15 April broke down in the ways already described an d , although there were
o th e r causes, the m ain reason for the d isa ste r was the failure o f police control.

   279. In all som e 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I m u s t report t h a t for the most
part th e quality o f the ir evidence was in inverse p ro p o rtio n to the ir rank. T h ere were m any young Constables
w ho as witnesses were alert, intelligent a n d open. O n the day, they a n d m a n y others strove heroically in ghastly
circum stances aggravated by hostility to rescue a n d succour victim s. T hey inspired confidence a n d hope.

   280. By contrast, w ith som e notabje exceptions, the senior officers in c o m m a n d were defensive a n d evasive
witnesses. T h e ir feelings o f grief a n d sorrow were o bvious a n d genuine. N o d o u b t those feelings were
intensified by th e knowledge tha t such a disaster h ad occurred under th e ir m anagem ent. But, n eith er their
h an d lin g o f problem s on the day n o r the ir account o f it in evidence showed the qualities o f leadership to be
expected o f the ir rank.


                                                             49
   281. M r D uckenfield leant heavily on Mr M urray's experience. Between them they misjudged the build-up
at the tu r n s tile s a n d did little about it until they received M r M arshall's request to open the gate. They d id not.
for exam ple, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check with Tango units as to the
n u m b e rs still to come. They did n ot alert M r G reenw ood to the situation at the fringe o f his area of c o m m a n d .
T hey gave no instructions as to the m a nagem ent o f the crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they declined to
p ostpo ne kick-off.

   282. W hen M r M arshall's request cam e. M r D u ck e n field ’s capacity to take decisions an d give orders
seem ed to collapse. H aving sa nctioned, at last, th e opening o f the gates, he failed to give necessary
consequential orders o r to exert a n y control w hen the disaster occurred. H e m isinterpreted th e em ergence o f
fans from pens 3 a n d 4. W hen h e was unsure o f the problem , he sent others down to "assess the situ a tio n ”
ra th e r th a n descend to see for himself. H e gave no inform ation to th e crowd.

   283. M ost surprisingly, hegave Mr Kelly a n d others to think tha t there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
fans forcing open a gate. This was n o t only untruthful. It set o f f a w idely reported allegation against the
su p p o rters which caused grave offence an d distress. It revived against football fans, a n d especially those from
Liverpool, accu sations o f hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationw ide but from E urope too. 1 can
only a s su m e th a t M r D uckenfield’s lack o f c a n d o u r on this occasion was o u t o f character. H e said his reason for
n o t telling th e tru th was tha t if the crowd becam e aware o f it the re might be a very hostile reaction a n d this
m ight im p ed e rescue work. He d id not wish to divulge w hat had h ap p e n e d until he had spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell M r Kelly the tru th d id not req uire th a t he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
although A ssistant C h ie f Constable Jackson was at han d . M r D uckenfield d id not disclose the truth to him
until m uc h later.

  284. T h e likeliest explanation o f M r D uckenfield ’s co n d u c t is th a t he simply could not face the en o rm ity of
the decision to open the gates a n d all tha t flowed therefrom . T h at w ould explain w hat he said to M r Kelly, what
he d id n o t say to M r Jackson, his aversion to addressing th e crowd a n d his failure to take effective control o f the
disaster situation. H e froze.

The Police Case at the Inquiry
   285. It is a m a tte r o f regret th a t at the hearing, a n d in th e ir subm issions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
p rep a re d to concede they were in any respect at fault in w hat o cc u rre d . M r D uckenfield. u n der pressure o f
cross-exam ination, apologised for b lam ing the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But. tha t a p a rt, th e police
case was to blam e the fans for being late a n d d ru n k , an d to blam e the C lu b for failing to m o n ito r the pens. It was
argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx th rough gate C but was d u e to barrier 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to w h eth e r lessons have been learnt. It would
have been m o re seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility h ad been faced.

   286. T he perfo rm an c e by the C ity Council o f its duties in regard to the Safety Certificate was inefficient a n d
dilatory. T he failure to revise or a m e n d the certificate over the period o f three years preceding this disaster,
despite im p o rta n t changes in the layout o f the ground, was a serious b rea ch o f duty. T here were, as a result, no
fixed capacities for the pens. The certificate took no a c co u n t o f the 1981 a n d 1985 alteratio ns to the ground.

  287. A n u m b e r o f breaches o f G reen G u id e s ta n d a rd s were p erm itte d a n d persisted eg the spacing o f the
crush barriers, the w idth o f perim eter gates a n d the gradient in the tu n n e l (1 in 6 as against th e G reen G u id e
m axim um o f 1 in 10).

  288. T h e A dvisory G ro u p lacked a p ro p er structure; its p rocedure was casual a n d unbusinesslike. Its
accountability to the G eneral Purposes Panel was ill-defined, D ecisions'w ere taken inform ally a n d too m uch
was left to M r Bownes, In particular, the decision to rem ove barrier 144 was not referred to the P a n e la n d ought
not to have been m ade.




                                                              51

    289. It should be recorded th a t in general th e Club has over the years ad o p ted a responsible an d
conscientiou s a p p r o a c h to its responsibilities. It reta in e d the services o f D r Eastwood as co n su lta n t engineer
a n d a b id e d by his advice. For his part, D r Eastwood is skilled a n d experienced in this field, as already
indicated, a n d he sought I have no d o u b t to act efficiently a n d professionally in his advice a n d practical work.
T h e C lub also reta in e d M r Lock w ho h ad acquired great experience a n d knowledge o f H illsborough during his
police service. A n u m b e r o f witnesses described H illsborough as a very good ground, “on e o f the best in the
cou n try ". T h e police agreed tha t relations between th e m an d th e C lub were good. O ver the last four years, the
C lub h ad spent so m e £ 1'k million on ground im provem ents.

   290. N evertheless, there are a n u m b e r o f respects in which failure by the Club co n trib u te d to this disaster.
T hey were responsible as occupiers a n d invitors for the layout a n d stru ctu re o f the ground. T h e Leppings Lane
en d was unsatisfactory an d ill-suited to a d m it the n u m b e rs invited, for reasons already spelt out. T he Club was
aw are o f these prob lem s an d discussed solving th e m in various ways betw een 1981 a n d 1986. In the result,
there r em a in e d th e sa m e n u m b e r o f turnstiles, a n d the sam e p ro blem s o utside a n d inside th e m . T h e plan for
this semi-final, involving as it did th e loss o f 12 turnstiles for the n o rth sta n d a n d large n u m b e rs to be fed in
from Leppings Lane, was o n e agreed between th e Club a n d the police. T h e Club knew best w hat rate o f
adm ission the turnstiles could m an age a n d ought to have alerted th e police to the risks o f the turnstiles being
sw am ped.

   291. T h e a ltera tio n s inside the turnstiles and on th e terraces clearly affected capacity, b u t no specific
allowance was m a d e for them. In that respect, b o th D r Eastwood a n d the C lub should have taken a m ore
positive a p p ro a ch . E ither a schem e such as one o f those D r E astw ood put forward should have been a d o p ted
giving m o re turnstiles an d total se paration o f areas o r at the very least th e capacity o f the new pens a n d o f the
terraces as a w hole should have been treated m ore cautiously. T h e police view in 1981 th a t 10.100 was too high
a figure was know n to the Club (although D r E astw ood says not to him ). Yet, despite th a t a n d the sub-division
into pens, th e figure remained.

   292. A lthough th e police had assu m e d responsibility for m o n ito rin g th e pens, the C lub h ad a duty to its
visitors a n d the C l u b ’s officials ought to have alerted the police to th e grossly uneven d istrib u tio n o f fans on the
terraces. T h e C lub operated a n d read the closed circuit television a n d the c o m p u te r totaliser. Liaison between
C lub a n d police on the day failed to alert the latter to th e n u m b e r o f Li /erpool s upporters still to come. T he
o nus here was on the Club as well as on the police.

   293. T h e rem oval o f barrier 144 was th e responsibility o f th e Club although it clearly acted on the advice o f
D r E astw ood a n d the Advisory G ro u p w hich in this instance was misguided.

  294. Likewise, th e breaches o f the G reen G u id e w ere m a tte rs "■ *-1 :h m e C lub should have appreciated a n d
rem edied.

    295. Lastly, as already indicated, th e p oor signposting on th e concourse te n d ed to p ro d u ce under-filling o f
the wing pens a n d over-filling o f pens 3 a n d 4. Poor signposting outside the turnstiles a n d the unhelpful form at
o f the tickets also led to confusion aggravating the b u ild -u p in the tu rn stile area.

    No Fault by the Emergency Services
       296. I say at the o utset o f this c h a p te r that no valid criticism can be m a d e o f the response by the St John
    A m bulance Brigade, by SY M A S or by the fire b rig ad e o n 15 April. Indeed, no represented p arty v entured any
    criticism o f the m . T h e only attack on SY MAS cam e from two Liverpool doctors. O n e claim ed that am bulan ces
    did not arrive swiftly o r w ith sufficient eq u ip m e n t and that there was a lack o f triage. H e was proved to be
    wrong in all three respects. U nfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April w hen he said m ore
    lives could have been saved if staff and e q u ip m e n t had arriv ed earlier. A part from being proved w rong in fact
    as to the tim es o f arrival o f am bulances, he conceded in eviden ce th a t it was not possible to say w h eth e r lives
    could have been saved. H is c o m m en ts on television were irresponsible. T h e o th e r d octor co m p la in e d o f the
    absence o f defibrillators. I a m satisfied on overwhelming evidence that to a tte m p t to use a d efibrillator on the
    pitch with p eople milling ab o u t would have been highly d angerous owing to the risk o f injury' from th e electric
    charge.

      297. I find th a t all three o f th e emergency services n a m e d above responde d prom ptly w hen alerted, that
    they brought a p p r o p ria te e q u ip m e n t a n d th a t their personnel operated efficiently.

      298. It w ould be unrea sonable to expect, at any sports stadium , m edical facilities capable o f dealing with a
    major disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuseitators, stretchers, other
    eq uipm en t a n d m edical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

      299. W h a t is required is a basic level o f prov ision for first aid, for professional m edical a tte n tio n a n d for
    am bulance attendance, together with a system o f co-ord inatio n w ith the em ergency services w hich will bring
    them to the scene swiftly in w hatever n u m b e rs are required. W h a t will a m o u n t to an ap p ro p ria te basic
    provision for the future    the eq u ip m en t in a first aid room , requires expert evaluation a n d advice.

       300. O n the day, th e re was no clear un derstanding between the Club a n d D r Purcell as to his role. He
    believed he was prim arily there to a tten d to th e players. T he C lub regarded h im also as the “ physician available
    to a tte n d at the first a id room if r e q u ir e d ", as laid down in the Safety Certificate.

      301. T h e re was insufficiently close co-operation between the police a n d the emergency services. It is clear
    that SYMAS a n d th e fire brigade should have been called earlier th a n they were. However, in view o f the nature
    and extent o f the crushing, the tim e w hen police rescue began a n d the pathetically short perio d for which those
    unable to breathe c ould survive, it is im probable that q uic ker recourse to the emergency services w ould have
    saved m ore lives.

      302. Finally, th e re was evidence that an advertising b o a rd h ad to be k n o r ‘ ^ down at th e north-east corner
    of the ground to allow an am bulance onto the pitch a n d th a t at the to p o           r?m p leading to the pitch the
    access for am b u la n c e s was inadequate. T here was also evidence th a t the pre-m atch a rran g e m en t for
    ambulances to use th e two gates from Penistone Road at th e north-east en d o f the gro u n d as in a n d o u t routes
    was frustrated by t h e presence o f vehicles ju st inside the g round. In the event, none o f these m a tte rs affected
    operations. T h e h o ard in g was quickly knocked down. T h e difficult access to the ram p was negotiated an d
    ambulances used o n e e n tra n ce satisfactorily by backing out w hen loaded.




                                                                 53

    303.       O ne problem which im peded police control and the gathering o f intelligence was the in term itten t
failure o f c o m m u n ic a tio n by radio. There was the period o f two o r three m inutes w hen the control room was
out o f rad io contact. Even when that was rem edied, it was only by using a h an d set in the control room . This
meant th a t control could not override any o th e r messages. N o effective radio c o m m u n ic a tio n seem s to have
reached control from the p erim eter track at the relevant tim e. M r G re e n w o o d ’s request for the m atch to be
stopped an d various messages from Constables reporting the distress in the pens d id not register. Likewise,
c o m m u n ic a tio n from Leppings Lane to control was unreliable. U ndoubtedly these breakdow ns m a d e it more
difficult for those in c o m m a n d to m ake p ro p er assessm ents a n d exercise effective co m m a n d .

Limited Objectives
  304. It is im p o rta n t to stress the limited objectives of the interim r e c o m m e n d atio n s 1 can m ake in this
Report. My p u rp o se is to propose instant m easures capabie o f being im plem ented forthwith an d where
possible before th e co m m e n c e m e n t o f the 1989/1990 season. T hey are designed to prevent overcrowding an d
crushing on terraces in the short term a n d to im prove safety procedures. They d o not a n d ca nnot m eet all the
problem s or address all th e issues o f post-H illsborough football. W ider issues such as m e m bership schemes,
identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia a n d long term r e c o m m e n d a tio n s fall to be considered in m y Final
Report. So d o a n u m b e r o f o th e r specific m atters such as a co m pre hensiv e review o f the G reen G u id e, the
problem o f excessive pre-m atch drinking, fans w ithout tickets a n d ticket touts. I m ention these m a tte rs lest it
be thought I have d ec id e d no rec o m m e n d atio n s need be m a d e co ncerning them . I have not. But before
deciding w hat if any rec o m m e n d atio n s to m ake ab o u t these a n d o th e r m atters, more evidence a n d stud y is
required.

  305. Accordingly, the m ain thrust o f these interim r ec o m m e n d atio n s, as a holding exercise, is to reduce
num be rs o n the terraces, to increase vigilance a n d to achieve a p ro p e r balance in crowd control between
prevention o f d i s o r d e r a n d m aintenance o f safety.


Perimeter Fences
  306. It w ould be im practical an d unwise to r e c o m m e n d works o f co nstru c tion o r radical structural changes
now. before com pleting th e extensive study a n d c o n su lta tio n w hich will form stage two o f this Inquiry. Hasty
interim r e c o m m e n d a tio n s o f that kind m ight well prove to be ill-judged afte r further study a n d require to be
changed in a m a tte r o f m onths.

   307. In particular. I d o not at this stage m ake any re c o m m e n d a tio n as to rem oving perim eter fences or
replaci ng th e m with structures o f different design. U nderstandably, there was a wave o f p o p u la r feeling against
such fences in th e im m ed iate afterm ath o f H illsborough. T h e horrify ing spectacle o f people being crushed
against the fencing focussed blame for th e disaster on the fences themselves. T here were pleas to dism antle
them a n d em o tiv e references to the fans being trea te d like "caged an im a ls” . S om e clubs removed th e ir fencing
straightaway. It was therefore very te m p tin g to consider at a n early stage m a k in g a r e c o m m e n d atio n tha t the
fences should be rem oved. I confess to being so tem pted.

  308. Regrettably, only a m onth after Hillsborough, th e re were incidents which showed th a t violence and
hooliganism are still liable to erupt at football grounds. O n 13 May at Selhurst Park. B irm in gham City
supporters invaded the pitch an d fought with supporters o f the h o m e club. Crystal Palace. Five police officers
and 16 s upporters were in j-r e d and required tre a tm e n t at a local hospital. O n th e sam e day at a m a tc h between
Bristol City a n d Sheffield I nited. s p e c ta to r s spilt o n to th e pitch a n d ihere ' ;uii> u g o n tln : ;;rraces. At the
C up Final between Liverpool and Everton on 20 May. there was a pitch invasion, albeit a com paratively
benign one.

   309. Even th e Football Supporters' A ssociation (FSA) felt it necessary to say in th e ir final s ubm ission.

        "W ith som e reservations, the FSA accept tha t p erim ete r fences are necessary for crowd control."

   310. Bearing in m in d those m a t t e r s , a n d the need to consider fu rth e r expert evidence. I have d ec id e d tha t it
would be unw ise a n d p re m a tu re for me to m ake any r e c o m m e n d a tio n s now either to remove o r to preserve or
to alter the structure o f peri meter fences. 1 shall make rec o m m e n d a ti 3ns a b o u t them in my Final Report.

   311. For the present. I would em phasise that, although th e fencing prevented escape, the real cause o f the
 Hillsborough d isaster was overcrowding a n d it is against th a t d an g e r th a t my interim r e c o m m e n d a tio n s are
 prim arily directed. W hilst declining to r e c o m m e n d the rem oval o f the fences. I d o consider th a t the gates to the
 pitch should be kept open whilst the terraces are occupied. T h is will have. I hope, three beneficial effects.
 Obviously, an open gate is a more ready escape route th a n one which has to be locked. Secondly, th e sight o f
 open gates w ill be reassuring to spectators on the terraces. Thirdly, the existence o f gaps in the fencing by
 reason o f the o pen gates will concentrate the m inds o f police officers or stew ards on the track to th e need for
 careful m o n ito rin g o f those on the terraces.


                                                                55
   312. It will o f course be necessary to have a police presence sufficient to prevent pitch invasion for im proper
reasons through the o pen gates. However. I am encouraged to think that th is is not an insuperable problem by
the fact that, for e x a m p le at Anfield, Liverpool's ground, there were no gates in the p erim ete r fencing before it
was taken down. T h ere were instead gaps o r "access p o in ts” as they are called in the G reen G u i d e (paragraph
215). T heir existence did not, so far as I am aware, prevent the authorities from m aintaining order. Also, th e
gates were open th ro u g h o u t the replay o f this ill-fated semi-final at O ld T rafford on 7 May 1989.


Reduced Numbers
   313. In the assessm ent o f figures for capacity, the criteria in C h a p te r 16 o f the G reen G u id e were not at
H illsborough, an d m ay not elsewhere, have been applied w ith sufficient rigour. Therefore, in addition to
rem in d in g a n d e n jo in in g local authorities a n d clubs to m a k e all necessary d e d u c tio n s w hen assessing th e
figure for m a x im u m capacity in accordance w ith the G re en G uide. 1 r e c o m m e n d reducing th a t figure by a
fu rth e r 15% as an in terim measure.


Safety Certificate
   314. T h e Safety Certificate procedure should, if it is properly ad m in iste re d a n d enforced, go far tow ards
achieving crowd safety. W h e th e r it succeeds d e p e n d s u p o n the vigilance a n d c o m m itm e n t o f the local
au th o rity issuing th e Certificate. I do not know w h eth e r the poor p erfo rm a n c e o f th e local authority at
H illsborough was typical. A rgum ents have been put to m e suggesting th e need for som e n ational oversight or
inspection o f local au th o rity certification procedures. T h is raises com plex issues w hich I shall w ant to consider
fu rth e r at stage two o f the Inquiry. For the present. I m a k e r e c o m m e n d a tio n s as to the co n ten t o f Safety
C ertificates a n d a rran g e m en ts for issuing, m onitorin g, enforcing, reviewing, a m en d in g a n d renewing the m .
                                C H A P T E R 24 - T H E R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S

   315. T h e r e c o m m e n d a tio n s which follow are the m in im u m necessary to ensure tha t existing football
grounds can for the present be safely used, based upon th e evidence which I have heard at Sheffield a n d o th e r
info rm atio n 1 have received. They com plem ent the r ec o m m e n d atio n s w hich M r Justice Popplewell set out
after his inquiry at Bradford.

   316. T h o se w hich are asterisked should be carried out before th e 1989/90 season starts. T h e rest should be
started forthw ith an d com pleted as soon as possible.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
*      1. W here a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
    should specify the maximum number o f spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

    A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained" notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
    another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

*     2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
    Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

    (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range o f maximum figures specified
        in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

    (b) after assessin g “the Green Guide figure", a deduction o f 15% should be made to improve the safety
        margin.

*      3. Arrangements should be made:-

    (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
★      4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
     responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
     ,/h e r terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
     variation of the agreement in respect o f an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

★      5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
     area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
     sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
     period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
     or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
     below, and by radio to the control room.


Fences and Gates
       6. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
     duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
     crowd densities, to the recognition of signs o f distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
     demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
     different crowd densities.

★      7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
     different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency Exit”.



                                                           57
★     8. W here there are perim eter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open du rin g the period
    w hen spectators are on the terrace.

★     9. T here should be in respect of each gate in a perim eter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer au th o rised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a g a te to relieve overcrowding.
    T he officer so au th o rised in respect of each gate should be identified for each m atch and known to be so by all
    stew ards and police officers in that vicinity’. H e should be able to m ake radio contact with the control room
    either him self o r via an officer close at hand.

★     10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal o f enough fencing to release numbers o f spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
    brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W'het her to use it should be a decision of a
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
★      U . All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs o f corrosion. Any barrier found
    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

       12.     The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessm ent of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the club in respect of w hich the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority . Such a review should include an inspection o f the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions o f the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, mi Uoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the local authority's rules.

       17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
    of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group's terms of
    reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written reports for consideration by the local authority.


Duties of each Football Club
★     18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate o f flow measured. Thereafter, regular
    inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
    anticipated.


                                                           58
★       19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
      as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
      turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
      accordingly.

★       20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
      reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
      operators for this purpose.

        21. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, w ithin
      concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

★       22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
      reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
      and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
      area.

★       23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, sim ple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
      the information provided in respect o f each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
      should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

★      24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
      by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
      admitting spectators to the ground.

        25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
      entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
★       26. T he C hief Constable o f each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
      should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management o f each football club and local authority
      concerned in respect of the safety and control o f crow ds.

★       27. T he Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing o f all
      officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance o f preventing any overcrowding and, if any
      is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

★       28. T h e Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
      any foreseeable pattern in the arrival o f spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
      sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

★       29. T he option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
       Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

          30.     There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
       monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record o f any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
       at turnstiles or o f numbers admitted to any area o f the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
       in the interpretation and use of these data.


    Communications
         31.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
       received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
       priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the sam e channel. Additional channels should be
       used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
       sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.




                                                           59
          32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
        with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

          33. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
        areas outside and inside the ground, with groups o f areas or with the whole ground. Important
        announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
        noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for even
        match.

          34. U se should be made where possible o f illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
        Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers o f a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
        the control room the existence o f certain emergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
★          35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
        liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★         36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
        ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
        spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
        concerning the control or movement o f the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
        rooms o f each of the emergency services.

★         37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium o f emergency vehicles from all three
        services should be reviewed. They should include routes o f access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
        within the ground itself.

★         38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency’ plans for
        the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
        they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
★         39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
        club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

          40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
        equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority- after taking professional
        medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

★         41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at es>ch match and available to deal with
        any medical exigency at the ground. H e should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
        present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
        match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
        contactable.

    ★     42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
        attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

           43. The number o f ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
         be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
         requirement o f the Safety Certificate.

                                                 SPECIFIC IN C ID E N T S

M r H ick s' Evidence
    1. Mr a n d Mrs Hicks' two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived early en fam ille bu t h ad tickets
for d ifferent sections. T h e two daughters had standing tickets: they went into pen 3. M rs Hicks h ad a seat in the
n o rth stand. M r Hicks to ok up a standing position in pen 1 ju st below a n d to the west o f the police box a t ab o u t
2 .1 5 p m F ro m there, he h ad a view o f the centre pens. H e kept an eye on th em as they filled up since he knew his
d aughters to be there.

    2. His evidence was th a t by 2.50 p m he cou ld see people were in distress. At a b o u t 2.55 p m he a n d others
called to a senior police officer at the top o f th e steps to th e control box to draw his a tte n tio n to the crushing. Mr
Hicks was only a b o u t 10 feet from the officer. He described him as wearing a flat cap w ith gold o r silver braid
a n d a light coloured anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officer w ho stop p ed th e m atch . M r G reenw ood, who
d id stop the m atch , was certainly not wearing a light coloured an o rak , as can clearly be seen on th e video.

   3. M r H icks says th a t he a n d others shouted several tim es to this officer in a tte m p ts to alert h im to the
distress in th e pens. T h ere was no reaction although M r Hicks believes the officer m u st have been in earshot.

   4. T h a t officer d escen d ed from the steps a n d two ca m e ra m e n w hom M r H icks believed were from
television cam e a n d a p p e a re d to direct their cam eras tow ards the pens. A n oth er se n io r officer ap p e a re d two
steps dow n from the p latform . He was a stocky figure; he also wore a flat cap b u t w ith black braid. M r Hicks
says that he a n d two or three others tried several tim es to cap tu re this officer’s a tte n tio n w ith ou t success. Then
M r Hicks says he sh o u te d “ For C hrist's sake! C a n ’t you see w hat’s going on? We can, a n d you have ca m e ra s” . T he
officer is said to have replied dismissively “S h u t your fucking p ra ttle ” .

  5. W h en the disaster occu rred the two H icks girls were crushed. V ictoria was p u t in an a m b u lan c e a n d M r
Hicks a c c o m p a n ie d h er to hospital where she was found to be dead . Sarah died at th e ground.

  6. M r H icks was an im pressive witness an d , desp ite his grievous loss, rem a rk a b ly stoical. H e gave his
evidence clearly a n d w ith o u t rancour. He was certainly m istaken a b o u t M r G re en w o o d being one o f those on
the steps a n d it has n o t been possible to identify eith er officer from M r Hicks’ des crip tio n s . H e m ay well also
have been im precise as to timings. Nevertheless. I see no reason to d o u b t that w hat h e d escribed d id o cc u r in
relation to two officers. As M r Hicks generously said himself, the dism issive ab u se from th e second officer
(although reprehensible) m ay have been d u e to his being preoccup ied with trying to see w hat was h ap p e n in g at
pens 3 a n d 4 ar o u n d kick-off time.

The Goalkeeper and Gate 4
   7. M r B am b ro ck , a L iverpool supporter, said he w ent through th e tunnel. H e w ould have liked to have
tu rn ed bac k when he saw how crowded the p ens were. H e went wi: a his fa*u °r a n d i 3 year old bro th er Stephen
towards th e front o f pen 4. H e saw the team s com e onto th e pitch. C ondi! ri’-.s a t the fro nt were, he said, alright
until a b o u t 2 m in u tes to 3. T h en the pressure in the pen increased a n d he an d his father b ecam e se p arated . His
feet cam e o ff the ground. H e shouted to police officers through the fence to get th e m o u t an d help th e m . T h e
police d id n o t react. T h e Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce G ro bbelaar, spoke to a po licem an on the track. T h e gate
was then o p en e d by a b lo n d e policew om an a n d ab o u t 25 to 30 people went th ro u g h it. They in c lu d ed the
witness’s fath er a n d his b ro th er Stephen w ho h ad a broken arm . A police C o n stab le sh ut the gate. It was then
reopened by th e sa m e policew om an, the w itness thought, a n d he got out.

  8. M r Eccleston. a m ale nurse an d an im pressive witness, was sitting in the n o rth stand. He n o ticed pen s 3
and 4 were full a n d realised som ething was wrong when fans started com ing over th e p erim ete r fence b u t did
not invade th e pitch. H e said the Liverpool goalkeeper ap p e are d to notice this too.

  9. M r G ro b b e la a r was o u t o f the cou n try d u rin g th e Inquiry a n d was th erefore n o t called. However, he
m ade a sta te m e n t w hich was pu t in as his evidence. In th e course of it he said:—

   “ K ick-off h a p p e n e d a n d we got into our stride pretty quickly - we forced a co rn e r pretty early on a n d th e ball
   cam e dow n to my en d - 1 rolled it out to the full back o nce a n d play went on until P eter Beardsley hit the
   crossbar o f the N o ttin g h a m Forest goal from a co rn e r a n d ca m e back into play. I rem e m b e r ju st after that
   there were shouts a n d scream s from the crowd ju st beh in d me. it was different; no t the o rd in ary crow d noise
   and 1 tu rn e d a r o u n d to look. W hat am az ed m e first was the con cen tratio n a n d squash o f fans in th e centre
section, the en d areas still had plenty o f space. It was only then 1 becam e conscious th a t the crowd was
squash in g forw ard a n d wasn't able to go sideways an d th a t’s when I noticed the fencing alongside them
h oldin g them in. 1 saw- fans being pulled up into the stand above the terraces. I saw fans clim bing over in to the
em p ty areas at the side a n d 1 saw fans clim bing o u t over the front o n to the pitch which was particularly
d ifficult because o f the spikes on the to p o f the fencing but they were getting out.
    "P lay was still going on a n d I was in a terrible position trying to co n c en tra te on play an d having my
a tte n tio n taken by w hat was happening b eh in d me. T h e ball cam e down to o u r end and N o ttin g h am Forest
won a corner, it was taken an d we cleared ou r box area a n d as play was going forward over the centre line 1
h ea rd a shout, ‘Bruce - please help’ - a desperate shout from a fan sq u ash ed up against the fencing to the
right o f my goal as I looked at Leppings L ane terraces. H e scream ed, ‘Please get the fucking gate open - Help,
h elp’. All the people w ho could speak were pleading for help. T here were tw o policem en n ea r the gate right
alongside the fan w ho h ad shouted to m e a n d so I sh o u ted to them , ‘G e t the gate o pen’. I was still try in g to
c o n c en tra te on play a n d was still having m y atten tio n taken by w hat was h ap p e n in g b eh in d m e - there were
lots o f fans on the pitch b eh in d the goal area by th em too. I called again to the policem en, ‘O pen the fucking
gate’ a n d on e ju s t tu rn e d away from m e a n d looked back at the crowd b u t th e o ther went to th e gate a n d
o p e n e d it a n d it was like taking the to p o ff a shaken coke b ottle - people were everywhere on th e play area
aro u n d my goal. Play was still going on a n d it cam e dow n tow ards me again for the left h a n d com er. It was
a N o ttin g h a m Forest throw-in, away to m y left, the ball was out o f play a n d a fan cam e up to m e on the
pitch a n d said. ‘Bruce, th e y ’re killing us’. I said ‘W h o ’s killing you?’, a n d he said ‘T h ey ’re crushing us-our
fans’. I said ‘G o a n d get som e help’, a n d then a p o licem an cam e on a n d spoke to this fan. I don’t know
w ho th e fan was, a n d th en he led h im off. It was ab o u t this tim e I saw a policem an ru n n in g o n to th e pitch
from my right across my box an d to the referee w ho blew up. recovered the ball an d told all players to clear
th e p itc h .”
   10. It is clear from the video that M r G ro b b e la ar’s recollection o f the sequence o f events, even with regard
to the game, is in accurate in a n u m b e r o f respects. For exam ple, the two N o ttin g h am Forest c o m e r kicks
occ u rre d m in u tes before Beardsley struck the bar. Further, it seem s highly pro bab le from o th e r evidence th a t
gates 3 a n d 4 were o pen continuously well before M r G ro b b e la a r says th e fan asked him to get the gate open. It
seem s su rprising too th a t with all the noise M r G ro b b e la ar would hear th e precise words o f an in d iv id ual fan,
let alo n e resp o nd twice to th e m , whilst the game was in progress.
    11. As to M r B a m b ro c k ’s account, th e evidence o f PC Fiona R ich a rd so n was th a t she was th e only
policew o m an on th e trac k in the early stages although o th ers cam e from the seated area as the incid en t
d eveloped. P C R ich a rd so n began a t gate 1 a n d , although she did go a n d help people o u t th ro u g h gate 3, she
d id n o t go to gate 4, a n d d id n o t open it twice or even once. T h e two officers who spoke o f o p en in g gate 4 were
b o th male.
    12. 1 th in k M r G ro b b e la ar did b ec o m e conscious o f distress in the crow d b eh in d h im a n d d id speak to a
police officer at so m e stage, p robably earlier th an he now thinks. N ot to reach that b ro ad conclusion would
involve a ttrib u tin g his whole account to invention o r fantasy a n d I see n o grounds for d o in g so. However, his
d etailed ac co u n t was not tested in cro ss-exam ination a n d its inconsistencies a n d errors w h en c o m p a re d with
o th e r inco ntrov ertib le evidence would m ake it unsafe to deriv e more th a n th e bro ad conclusion stated above.
T h e in c id en t shows how ho nest witnesses can becom e confu sed and th e ir evidence flawed w hen recollecting
ev ents experienced u n d e r tension o r em otion.
   13. As to th e o p en in g o f gate 4 th e re was a n ap p a re n t conflict o f evidence. P C Illingworth said th a t ab o u t
five m in u tes to 3 he o p en e d it and guided fans em erging through it to gate 5. P C H o oson said th a t it was he
w ho o p en e d gate 4 ju st before kick-off. I a m satisfied from th e evidence o f a n u m b e r o f fans th a t, like gate 3,
gate 4 was o p en e d m o re th an once. T he probability is. therefore, that whilst PC Illingworth was shep h erd in g
fans to gate 5. gate 4 h ad been closed again until it was re-opened by PC H o o so n two o r th ree m in u tes later.

   14. It was alleged bv a d o cto r th a t an oxygen cylinder pro v ided to h im on the p itch was empty. D r Phillips, a
Liverpool supporter, h ad been in p e n 3 w ith his brother a n d others. H e cam e un d er pressure a n d clim bed into
pen 2. W h en the d isaster occurred a n d gate 2 was o p ened, he went through it, injuring his h ea d as he d id so. He
ca m e o n to the p itch so m e tim e after 3.10 p m an d sta rted resuscitation procedures. H e was given a n oxygen
cvlinder. H e believes this was from St Jo h n Am bulance. It was, he th ought, too early to be th e fire service. T he
cv lin d er was sw itched on b ut Dr P h illips says it gave no oxygen since it was empty. T h ere was o n e oxygen
cy lin d er on the St Jo h n ’s am b u lan ce w hich cam e to the scene. M r Wells, the D ivisional S u p e rin te n d e n t o f St
Jo h n , too k th a t cylin der o n to the pitch. H e said it was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a p atien t being
trea te d bv D r Phillips a n d says th a t oxygen was flowing into that p atien t. Moreover, M r Wells tested the
cy lin d er afterw ards a n d fo u n d it was still h a lf full. It has a capacity th a t will last for 5 hours 4 0 m in u tes on a
high setting.
   1 5. T h ere was evidence from Assistant C h ief Fire O fficer H orn sb y th a t a M a x am a n resuscitator had failed
lo work properly. It was delivering an oxygen flow a p p ro p riate to a “ch ild ” setting rath e r than a full " a d u lt"
flow. O n ex a m in a tio n , it was found that a retaining nu t in the control kn o b had w orked loose, possibly d u e to
vib ratio n in transit, a n d this h ad affected the flow o f oxygen. T h e device had last been tested on 10 April 1989.
   16. 1 accept the evidence o f M r Wells th a t the St Jo h n A m bulance cylinder was charged with oxygen and
w orking properly. In my view, D r Phillips may have been m istaken as to the cylinder o f w hich he co m plain s
being empty. H e agreed he was u n d er great pressure, in an aw kw ard situ atio n ; his h ea d was injured a n d he
b ecam e very angry at w hat he regarded then as wholly th e fault o f the police. H e co nceded th a t if the cylin d er
was not em p ty there was a possible altern ativ e - that the m aster ta n k top valve was shut. It seem s unlikely that
he could have been referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was clear th a t the b o ttle he received was a
sim p le piece o f e q u ip m e n t not designed to breathe for the patient bu t merely to supply oxygen.
  17. I conclu de th a t on a balance o f probabilities the evidence do es no t ju stify a find in g th a t a n em pty
cylin der was brou gh t to the scene.
C allin g the F ire Service
    18. P C B ich ard ’s call to police H e a d q u arte rs at 3.13 p m for the fire service to b rin g hydraulic cuttin g
e q u ip m e n t to cut m etal fences (see parag rap h 101 supra) was heard by C h ie f Insp ecto r E d m u n d so n . H e went
into th e ad jac en t o p e ra tio n s ro o m to give in structions for the message to be passed to the fire service. T h e re , a
te m p o rary co n tro l ro om assistant was already speaking to the fire service a b o u t a ho u se fire. M r E d m u n d so n
in terru p te d the call a n d asked the assistant to tell th e fire service th a t cu ttin g e q u ip m e n t was w a n te d at
H illsborough. T h ere followed a conversation between the assistant a n d M iss D avies at th e fire service in the
following te rm s :-
  Police              C a n we have cutting gear for Hillsborough, please - straight away?
  F ire C o n tro l   Ju st a m inute. Right - w h at’s the address?
  Police              C u ttin g eq u ip m en t for H illsborough football g ro un d - straight away.
  F ire C on tro l    H illsborough football ground?

  Police              Yes, H illsborough football ground.
  F ire C o ntrol     W h a t road is that on? D o you know?

  Police              T h ere has been a m ajo r accident, all th e am b ulan ces are up there.

  F ire C o n tro l   W h a t ro ad is it on?

  Police              I have no idea; H illsborough football ground.
  F ire C o n tro l   W h a t ro ad is it on? D o you know?

  Police              “ H illsborough football g round - w hat road is it o n ?” (this was said to so m eone in Police
                      Force C ontrol) - “ Penistone R o a d ” (to Fire Control).

  Fire C o n tro l    P enistone Road.

  Police              Penistone Road, OK.

  F ire C o n tro l   Penistone Road, ju st a m i n u t e - w h a t ’s exactly involved?

  Police              It's football, a big m atch , L iverpool v N o tts Forest.

   Fire C o n tro l   Yes, b u t why d o you w ant us; you said it was an RTA [R oad Traffic Accident].

   Police             No, no, no; m ajo r incident inside th e ground.

  F ire C o n tro l   M a jo r incident inside - do you know exactly w h at it is?

   Police             N o, 1d o n ’t: they want all the cuttin g gear.

   Fire C o n tro l   For what - do you know?

   Police             H an g on a sec.
    At th a t p o in t C h ief Inspector E d m u n d so n intervened an d spoke for the police. T he conversation
c o n c lu d e d :-

   Police             (M ale voice) - Hello!
   Fire C o n t r o l   Hello! N o w you wnt s o m e c u t ti n g g e a r - w h a t exac tly is it for9

   Police               T h ere has been a m ajor accident at H illsborough football gro u n d w here the sem i-final is;
                        th e crowds have forced th e ir way in, they have broken fences and gates down. 1 d o n ’t know
                        exactly what it is but there are people trapped.

   Fire C o n tro l     Right! O K - leave it w ith us.

   T h a t con v ersatio n took 1 m inute 13 seconds. It was pub lish ed in a n u m b e r o f newspapers w ith strong
critical c o m m e n t m ostly against the fire service. T h e th ru st o f th e criticism was th a t valuable tim e was w asted
by the fire serv ice asking unnecessary q u estio ns as to where a n d w hy cu ttin g e q u ip m e n t was required.

   19. T h ere was a m eeting o f th e em ergency services in August 1988 to discuss p ro ced u re in th e even t o f a
m a jo r d isa ste r at Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. It was p o in ted o u t an d m in u te d th a t “ It was im p erativ e that
the Police C o n tro l give the exact location o f any fire or in cid en t a n d as m u c h d etail as possible. N o sen io r fire
officer is on du ty at the m atch. . . Fire service will a tte n d via P en iston e R o ad or Leppings L ane as d irec te d by
the police.”

   20. T h e m essage from P C Bichard co n tain e d all th e necessary in fo rm atio n - L eppings Lane e n d , hydraulic
cu ttin g eq u ip m e n t, to cut m e tal fences. Regrettably, it was no t passed on by H e a d q u a rte rs in those term s. Miss
Davies h ad rightly been tra in e d to require a precise location a n d n eeded to know the problem w hich w ould face
the fire service so th a t the a p p ro p riate response could be m ade. In fact, th e re are several football g ro u n d s in the
H illsborough district altho u g h clearly Sheffield W ed n esd ay ’s gro u nd is the p rin cip al one. In th e result,
although C h ie f Insp ecto r E d m u n d so n clarified, to an extent, th e n atu re o f th e p roblem , the locus which
em erged in th e course o f the conversation (Penistone Road) was n ot th a t co n tain e d in the original message
from g ro u n d co n tro l (ie “ L eppings L ane e n d .”) W hilst on the face o f the conversation th e fire service m ay seem
to have been slow in the u p ta k e or p erh ap s p ed an tic, in my view the police ought to have been m o re specific.
T hey h a d th e necessary in fo rm atio n to be so.

   21. I a m satisfied, however, that the delay o f 1 m in u te 13 seconds over th e call, a n d even th e delay
occasio n ed by th e cu ttin g eq u ip m en t going to Penistone R o ad rath e r th a n Leppings Lane, d id n o t affect the
o u tco m e. Even h ad those w ith cuttin g e q u ip m e n t gone directly after a briefer ’p h o n e call they w ould n o t have
arrived at a stage early en ou g h to m ak e cuttin g th e fencing a helpful exercise.

M r Kenny D alglish
   22. W hen th e Liverpool m anager w ent to the control ro o m a n d agreed to m ake the a n n o u n c e m e n t
bro ad cast at 3.56 p m , he says in a sta te m e n t th a t he could n o t get th e T annoy to work. Spectators co u ld see
h im trying to ad d re ss th e m a n d in d icated to h im m anually th a t n o th in g cou ld be heard. An o fficer pressed
b u tto n s on the m a ch in e a n d M r Dalglish says he tried again w ith sim ilar lack o f success. He w as th e n taken
u n der th e police box to th e ro o m used by th e disc jockey to b ro ad c ast p re-m atch m usic. T here, th e m icro p h o n e
w orked a n d he b ro ad c ast his message.

   23. M r Dalglish was n o t called. T h ere was no oth e r ev idence ab o u t this incident. I accept it o cc u rred as he
described. W h y th e Tannoy could n o t at th a t tim e be successfully o p e ra te d from th e police b o x is, however,
strange a n d un exp lain ed. U nlike th e rad io , it h ad o p era ted satisfactorily from the police box a t th e critical
tim es save th a t its messages may no t always have been h eard above th e prevailing noise. It had w orked a t abo u t
3.30 pm w hen it called for m edical staff. I can see no g ro u n d s for criticising the police in regard to this in cident
an d ce rtain it is th a t the b rie f delay in relaying M r Dalglish’s message can have had n o significant effect.

    7. ACTIONS AFTER DEATH

   Introduction

      At common law a person's death extinguished all rights of action that he
   m ight have had. In particular, if the death was a result of the tortious acts of
   another, the deceased's family would have no right of action in respect of
   the death.13 The position is now governed by statute.
      If a person dies as the result of the tortious acts of another there are two
   ways in w hich an action m ight be brought. First, by reason of the Law
   Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934, certain causes of action w hich
   were vested in the deceased at the tim e of his death survive for the benefit of
   his estate. Secondly, certain "dependants" of the deceased now have a right
   of action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976.


   Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934

     By section 1(1) of the 1934 Act it is provided that all causes of action, w ith
   the exception of actions for defamation and seduction w hich were vested in
   a person on his death shall survive for the benefit of his estate.
     It is expressly provided, by section 1(2)(a) that the damages recoverable for
   the benefit of the estate "shall not include any exemplary damages." Where
   the person's death has been caused by the act or omission w hich gives rise


   12 [1979] Q.B. 722.
   13 Admiralty Commissioners v. SS. Amerika [1917] A.C. 38.



to the cause of action the damages recoverable for the benefit of the estate
shall be calculated w ithout reference to any loss or gain to his estate conse­
quent on his death, except that a sum in respect of funeral expenses may be
included.14 Damages for "loss of expectation of life" and for the "lost years"
cannot be recovered if the death occurred after January 1, 1983.15
  It follows that an action can be brought by the estate of a person who died
as a result of police misconduct. Compensatory and aggravated damages can
be recovered by the estate.
The Fatal Accidents Act 1976

   The 1976 Act gives a right of action to "dependants" of a deceased person
whose death was caused by any "wrongful act, neglect or default" such as
would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the person injured to recover
damages.16
   Dependants are defined in section 1(2) and include spouses, parents and
grandparents, children and grandchildren, nephews nieces and cousins and
any person who had been living w ith the deceased in the same household
for a period of at least two years im m ediately before death as husband or
wife and any person treated by the deceased as a parent or as a "child of the
family."
   A husband or wife or th e parents of an unmarried m inor are entitled to
damages for "bereavem ent"17 in the sum of £3500.18 O ther damages are
awarded as are proportionate to the injury resulting from the death to the
dependants respectively. Such damages are assessed on the basis of the
"value of the dependency," in other words, the dependants are entitled to
th at sum of money that will replace the "m aterial benefits" provided to
them by the deceased.19
   It should be noted that the dependants cannot recover if the deceased
earned his living by crime, because their claim would be defeated by the
defence of ex turpi causa.20
   The damages recoverable can be reduced.to take into account any "co n ­
tributory negligence" by the deceased.21
   The dependants of anyone killed as a result of police wrongdoing will,
therefore, have an action against the police under the Fatal Accidents Act.


8. LIMITATION

  All the causes of action discussed in this chapter are "founded on tort."
The basic tort lim itation period of six years "from the date on w hich the
cause of action accrued" therefore applies.22

14 s.l(2)(c).
15 Administration of Justice Act 1982, s.l.
16 s.l(l).
17 s.lA.
18 s.lA(3).
19 See generally, Kemp a) Kemp on the Quantity of Damages, Vol. 1.
20 Burns v. Edman [1970) 2 Q.B. 541.
21 s.5.
22 See Limitation Act 1980, s.2.
    The cause of action accrues at the m om ent at which the plaintiff could
 first sue. When a tort is actionable per se, tim e will run from the m om ent at
 which the wrongful act was committed. Thus, a cause of action in libel will
 run from the m om ent of publication and w ill be time-barred six years later.
 On the other hand, where damage is essential to the cause of action and it
will only arise w hen the damage actually occurs. Thus, a cause of action in
negligence, misfeasance in a public office or conspiracy will only arise w hen
the plaintiff actually suffers loss or damage as a result of the defendant's
breach of duty or misfeasance. In the case of a breach of statutory duty the
date of accrual of the cause of action will depend on w hether the statute is
construed as giving a cause of action w hich is actionable per se.23 If a statute
does give rise to a breach w hich is actionable per se then tim e will run from
the date of th e breach, otherwise tim e w ill ru n from the date on w hich
damage takes place.
    Where the action is "in case” the cause of action will accrue w hether or
not the plaintiff knows that the damage has taken place.24 Thus, for
example, if property is damaged by negligent police action tim e will run
from the date of damage, not the date w hen the plaintiff discovers that it has
happened.
   Where the damages claimed by the plaintiff "consist of or include
damages in respect of personal injuries25 to the plaintiff or any other per­
son" then the applicable lim itation period is three years.26 In such a case the
tim e period runs from either the date on w hich the cause of action accrued
or the date of knowledge (if-later) of the person injured 27 T he court has a
discretion to extend the lim itation period under section 33 of the Limi­
tation Act 1980.28
   If the person injured dies before the expiration of the three year lim itation
period then the lim itation period for a cause of action surviving for the ben­
efit of the estate under section 1 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Pro­
visions) Act 1934 is three years from the date of death or the date of the
knowledge of the personal representative, whichever is the later.29 If the
person injured dies after the expiry of th e lim itation period th en his per­
sonal representatives can ask the court to override the lim itation period.30
   An action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 cannot be brought if the
death occurred w hen the person injured could no longer m aintain an action
in respect of the injury, w hether because the action is time-barred or for any
other reason.31 Where the action would have been barred by the three year
tim e limit in respect of personal injuries there is no statutory discretion to
override the tim e lim it under section 33.32 N o action under the Fatal Acci­
dents Act can be brought after the expiration of three years from the date of
death or the date of knowledge of the person for whose benefit the action is

brought, whichever is the later.33 If the action was maintainable at the date
of death then the court does have discretion to extend time under section
33 34
   Where any fact relevant to the cause of action is deliberately concealed by
the defendant the period of lim itation does not begin to run u n til the plain­
tiff discovered the concealment or could, w ith reasonable diligence have
discovered it.35
1   Fatal Accidents Act 1976

The Fatal Accidents Act 1976 allows dependants to claim against anyone who
causes death by their wrongful act, neglect or default, provided the wrongful

act, neglect or default would have been such as to allow the person who died to
have made a claim if they had not died. In other words the act, neglect or
default must constitute a civil wrong; if the police would have had a good
defence to the civil wrong, the claim for the death also fails.

 Who can sue?
M ost members of the family of the dead person can sue, including:
(a) spouse;
(b) parents or grandparents;
(c) children or grandchildren;
(d) siblings, uncles and aunts, and all their descendants;
(e) common-law spouse of two years’ standing (lesbian and gay relationships
    are therefore excluded);
(f) anyone treated as a child o f the family following a marriage;
(g) anyone treated as a parent.

 Wrongful act, neglect or default o f the police
It has to be shown th at the wrongful act, neglect or default o f the police caused
the death .93This may be fairly straightforw ard if, say, the death resulted from
a deliberate assault or from a road accident caused by a police officer’s
negligent driving. It is less clear-cut if the death arose partly from the act of the
person who died, say in the case o f som eone who died from alcohol or drugs.
The police have a detailed C ode o f Practice (see Appendix Two) on the
treatm ent of people in their custody concerning such matters as the conditions
of detention, the treatm ent of detained persons and medical treatm ent. While
a breach of the Code does not o f itself render any individual officer liable to a
separate civil action, a breach o f the Code might be evidence o f negligence.94
    A problem might arise where som eone dies because the police fail to act to
prevent the death. This might occur where the police arrest som eone who is ill
or someone becomes ill after an arrest and the police fail to call a doctor. In the
o rdinary law of negligence a “ pu re om ission” to act, such as where a passer-by
fails to call an am bulance after a ro ad accident, does not m ake the passer-by
liable. However, the position is different if the person who fails to act has a
legal duty of care:95 police custody officers are under a statutory duty to ensure
th at anyone detained at a police station is treated in accordance with the
Police and Criminal Evidence A ct and the Codes of Practice.96 U nder the Act,
failure on the part of an officer to comply with any provision of the Codes does
not o f itself render that officer liable to any civil proceedings.97 However, it
seems that the special duty to take care of people in police custody existed
before the Act was passed98 so this provision should not defeat a claim based
on an act o f omission by the police. Even if the courts decided it was an
obstacle, it seems only to p ro tect the officer who failed to comply with the
Codes. A claim against the chief officer of police should therefore still succeed,
s ee pl Ol .
   A further problem may arise where someone commits suicide in police
custody. If the suicide was induced by a wrongful act o f the police, a claim can
still succeed even though the person who died took their own life.99 There
m ust, however, be a clear link between the wrongful act an d the suicide, such
as where a person is falsely imprisoned or assaulted and becomes depressed
and suicidal as a result. If the police have a good defence to the false
imprisonment or assault allegation, the claim for damages arising from the
death would also fail.
   It is arguable that a claim can be made if the police negligently fail to
prevent a suicide. This might arise where the police take into custody someone
they know to be prone to suicide,100 and then fail to prevent them harming
themselves by, for example, failing to keep them under regular and frequent
observation.101 It is impossible to say with certainty that this is the law, as it
appears that there has never been a reported case directly on the point, in
England. However, in a case which decided that it was justifiable to force-feed
a suffragette on hunger strike, the Lord Chief Justice said “It was the duty,
both under the rules and apart from the rules, of officials to preserve the health
and lives of the prisoners, who were in the custody of the Crown”.102 This
however does not deal with the crucial problem that in the general law of
negligence if someone consents to a risk, such as consenting to a surgical
operation, their claim fails. Normally a person who carried out an act
themselves would be taken to be clearly consenting to the risk. The question
that remains to be decided is whether someone of unsound mind can be said to
“consent”.

2   Damages

Damages are only awarded for:
(a) bereavement; and
(b) the loss of reasonable expectation of financial benefit.
Damages for bereavement are a fixed amount, currently £3,500.103 They are
only awarded to the spouse of the deceased or the parents of someone under 18
who never married.
   Damages for reasonable expectation of financial loss can include such
things as loss of a parent’s financial support, or loss of a son’s voluntary gifts
during a period of employment104 or loss of free services as where a wife who
was killed acted as a housewife.105However, if the person who died earned his
or her income from a life of crime, the dependants are not allowed to claim for
loss of the benefits of crime.106

              § 4.1. T H E D E F I N I T I O N O F N E G L I G E N C E

I n t e n t i o n is clearly a mental state, and a type of legal fault. Another
type of legal fault, not necessarily involving a mental state, is
negligence.
    Some accidents (or other events) are so unexpected that when they
happen we can only say that they were unavoidable— in legal language,
"inevitable." We cannot think of anything that a careful person would
have done to avoid the evil result, if he had been in the shoes of the
defendant.
    Other accidents happen because of the neglect of some precaution that
a reasonable man would have used. (The reasonable man is sometimes,
and better, called a prudent man.) Such accidents are the products of what
w'e call negligence, or carelessness.
    Negligence, then, is failure to conform to the standard of care to w'hich
it is the defendant's duty to conform. It is failure to behave like a
reasonable or prudent man. in circumstances where the law requires such
reasonable behaviour. (In this context, of course, as nearly always in law.
the word “man” includes '‘woman.”) An employer may for example be
negligent as to whether safety precautions are being used by his
workpeople.

You mean the defendant was thoughtless?
   Yes. or incompetent in a job (such as driving a car) in which he should
have been competent. Or. worse still, he may actually have seen the
danger and "chanced his arm." In the latter case he is advertently
negligent, or in other words reckless. If he did not advert to the danger,
or in other words realise there was a risk, when he ought to have, he is
inadvertently negligent. Negligence means forbidden conduct where the
defendant's liability depends on the fact that he failed to realise (foresee/
know) what he ought to have realised, and failed to conform his conduct
accordingly, or. a fortiori, that he did realise it and yet failed to conform
his conduct as he should.
   The test of negligence in terms of the prudent man is called an
"objective” standard, because it does not depend upon a finding of what
passed in the defendant's mind.
Why do you bring in the prudent man in defining negligence? Is it because
otherwise the standard would vary for everyone?
  There would be no standard at all. Every judgment of a man's conduct
implies judgment measured against a standard external to him.
Who is this “ prudent man” ? Is he the man in the street?
   The man in the street, that legendary combination of sage and
ignoramus, does not quite represent the idea. The "prudent man” or
"reasonable man” of the lawyer's imagining is the exemplary man: the
cautious, circumspect, anxiously calculating paragon who is held up by the
judges as a model of behaviour. Sometimes, it is true, he is described as
the ordinary man. or the average man. But little effort is made at trials to
find how ordinary men behave; and it would not be a cast-iron defence to
a charge of negligence to show that other people are prone to do exactly
as the defendant did. (At least, that is the position in the law of tort.)
H o m o juridicus is the ideal man. the moral man. the conscientious man—
not setting the standard so high that life becomes impossible in ordinary
terms, but nevertheless requiring the most careful consideration to be
given, so that harm is avoided and the law obeyed.
Why not eliminate talk of reasonable men by asking simply whether the
harm was probable?
   Probability is a matter of varying degree. Negligence consists in taking
a risk of harm with such a degree of probability as to be socially
unacceptable. This depends on what it is that is at stake. A surgeon may.
if there is no other way of alleviating his patient’s suffering or prolonging
his life, perform an operation that carries a very high risk of killing his
patient, without being adjudged negligent. An employer who. in order to
increase production and profits, takes what is. statistically, a much smaller
risk with the lives of his workpeople may well be held to be so.
What should a prosecutor do to prove negligence?
  In an action in tort for negligence the plaintiff must give particulars of
the alleged negligence in his statement of claim. For example, in a running-
down case he will say that the defendant drove too fast, on the wrong side
of the road, without keeping a proper look-out, and so on. There are no
similar pleadings in criminal cases, but the prosecutor who alleges
negligence must be prepared to say what the defendant could and should
have done (or refrained from doing) in order to avoid the accident or other
occurrence.

Do I gather that when considering negligence you entirely ignore the
defendant’s state of mind?
   That would be going too far. One can imagine circumstances where an
ordinary driver would not be careless in running a blind man down, if he
did not know he was blind and had no reason to suppose he would proceed
as he did. But a driver who knew that the man w'as blind might on such
facts be guilty of careless driving.

Is negligence a form of mens rea?
   Some judges assume this, but there are substantial arguments the other
wav.

• Negligence is not necessarily a state of mind, so it is not properly called
     m ens rea.
• The most serious and severely punishable crimes are defined to require
  intention or recklessness. If it were allowed that negligence is mens rea.

      the judges might extend the concept of recklessness to cover negligence
      (which some of them are in any event strongly inclined to do), and might
      hold that all crimes at common law can be committed negligently (which
      would result in a great increase of severity). The argument does not
      involve saying that negligence should not be punished: only that it
      should not generally be punished on a par with crimes requiring a mental
      element.-''



 § 4.2. THE JUSTIFICATION OF PUNISHMENT FOR NEGLIGENCE

The reason for punishing negligence is the utilitarian one. that we hope
thereby to improve people's standards of behaviour.

Isn’t the question one of moral wrong? It is wrong not to exercise
consideration for others.
   If inadvertent negligence results from not caring about other people, it
is a defect of character and may be regarded as morally wrong. But what
law'yers call inadvertent negligence is not always of this kind. Negligence
may be just a slip by a w'ell-disposed person, and whether that should be
accounted morally wrong is open to debate.

Even though the offender did not realise the danger on the occasion in
question, he would have realised it if he had taken due precautions. So he
was morally to blame.
   I do not dissent; but we should keep our eyes open to the facts. Apply
what you say to the particular case of a forgetful person. A man with a bad
memory can often take steps to remedy his deficiency—by keeping a diary
of his engagements and consulting it frequently, and so on. But his memory
may be so bad that one day he forgets to look in his diary, or forgets an
item recorded in it. Perhaps, to overcome this risk, he takes additional
steps, such as asking his wife to remind him of a particular engagement.
But one day he forgets to ask his wife. Is he to think of another device to
remind him to look at his diary or to ask his wife to remind him? Is it moral
fault not to do so? What we are faced with is the plain fact that on the
particular occasion the thought of the engagement never comes into his
mind. That is a deficiency in his mental make-up which he cannot help. To
search back into his past for the purpose of finding some defect in the
arrangements he made to remedy his failing, and blaming him on that
account, often wears the appearance of being an unrewarding exercise in
moralism.

   It is not only a question of memory. Many studies have been made of
accident proneness: and it has been found that large categories of people
are more accident prone than others. Old people are worse than younger
people, men worse than women, unmarried people worse than married.1
But some individuals are particularly accident prone. They are born
negligent, so to speak, or become so through their experiences. A person
has an innate temperament, which may in course of time be modified by
many circumstances over which he has no control. The result may be that
he is impulsive, unable to stop and consider the consequences of what he
is doing, or too dull in mind to imagine them; that he is selfish, preferring
his own convenience to the safety of others; that he is clumsy, unable to
control his own movements (or those of a machine he is using) with due
precision, or with a slow reaction-time in case of emergency.

If. as you say, the individual is unable to help these aspects of his mind or
body, how can he be said to deserve punishment?
   This objection to imposing liability for negligence appeals particularly to
those who take the "determinist” position, according to which all events
(including human acts) are governed by pre-existing events which are their
causes. Everything we do is the product of our genetic constitution and
personal history.
   We need not go into the                voluminous arguments for and against
determinism. Sufficient to say that the determinist philosophy, though it
may be true, is of little interest either to the lawyer or to the moralist. The
question in law and morals is whether the offender could have acted
otherwise if he had willed. If he could, he is morally and legally
responsible.2 The further question "Was he able to will?" may be
speculated on by philosophers, but is eschewed in law and morals for a
pragmatic reason. The object of the law and of a moral system is to
influence our wills in a socially desired direction. Once this simple point is
grasped, the apparent difficulty of reconciling the philosophy of
determinism with ordinary moralattitudes               disappears. However,
malfunctioning of the will is given moral and legal significance when it is
associated with childhood or is regarded as a symptom of mental disorder.

   Liability for negligence is a way of sanctioning (punishing) common
sense rules that in themselves have no legal force. There are well-known
rules of prudence relating to the management of firearms, that one should
never leave them loaded, or point them at anyone even though believed to
be unloaded, and so on. Again, it is only a rule of prudence, not explicitly
one of law. that one should not pass on a blind corner (except that there
is a law on the subject of not crossing double white lines). Failure to
observe these rules (which will generally be an intentional or reckless
failure) will readily be held to be negligence, founding a charge of careless
driving or of manslaughter.

The reason why drivers do not pass on blind corners is because they
apprehend a consequence much more immediate and terrifying than what
may afterwards happen in a court of law.
   That is true, but the law of reckless and careless driving can add to the
pressure to make bad drivers change their habits and in the last resort to
give up driving.
   Carelessness with firearms is in a different legal position from careless
driving. Such carelessness is not an offence in itself, and it is not an offence
even if it causes severe injury, the reason evidently being that accidents
with firearms are too uncommon to attract particular attention from the
law. However, if the victim dies, a charge of manslaughter may be brought.

When comparing the physically handicapped (blind, maimed, etc.)
defendant with the reasonable man, we suppose that the reasonable man
suffers from the same handicap. The defendant need only do his best with
the body he has. But it would generally be negligent for a handicapped
man to undertake something that could be done safely only by an ordinary
man, if he has the opportunity not to do it.

What if the defendant is substandard in abilities?
  The reasonable man is not imagined to be substandard in intelligence or
foresight.

But wouldn’t it be more just to have different standards of care for experts
at one end of the scale and people of poor intelligence at the other?
   We were all born green. Some people remain that colour, but even
dullards are not immune from the conditioning processes of life, including
the law.

10. Negligence and
Other Civil Actions


1. INTRODUCTION

   In Part II of this book the "traditional tort actions" against the police were
considered. These actions are by far the most important. They cover the
areas where citizens will be most concerned with unlawful police activity:
assault, unlawful arrest and imprisonment, interference with land and
goods and unjustified prosecutions. Nevertheless, the law provides a wide
range of other causes of action which may be relevant to the citizen's pos­
ition in relation to the police. This chapter deals with six areas: negligence,
breach of statutory duty, defamation, conspiracy, misfeasance in public
office and actions after death.


2. NEGLIGENCE

Introduction

   The common law action in negligence has, in recent decades, become of
central importance to the law of tort. Large areas of tortious liability have
been gradually redefined and assimilated to it. Nevertheless there have been
very few attempts to fix the police with liability for negligence in relation to
their "operational policing" functions. Complex and difficult questions
arise concerning matters such as the existence of a duty of care, the policy
limitations on such a duty, and the intervening acts of third parties.


The elements of the tort

  The elements of the tort of negligence are clear and well established.
There must be:
     (1)   a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff-
     (2)   a breach by the defendant of this duty;
     (3)   damage to the plaintiff;
     (4)   which is caused by the breach of duty.
(1) Duty of care. The generally accepted test1 to be applied to establish
whether or not a duty of care is owed by the plaintiff to the defendant is set
out in the speech of Lord Wilberforce in A n ns v. M erton 2:
      "the question has to be approached in two stages. First one has to ask
      whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who has suf­
      fered damage there is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neigh­
      bourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of the former,
      carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter, in
      which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly, if the first ques­
      tion is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider whether there
      are any considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit
      the scope of the duty or the class of person to whom it is owed or the
      damages to which a breach of it may give rise."
Thus, if it is forseeable that the plaintiff will be damaged by the defendant's
lack of care, a duty of care will arise unless there are policy considerations
which restrict or negative the duty. Policy considerations may "negative" a
duty of care if it is not "just and reasonable” that a duty be imposed.3

(2) Breach of duty. The defendant will be in breach of his duty if he fails to
take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances. The standard of care
is that of the reasonable man. This is a matter of law and the court will take
into account matters such as the degree of risk if the duty is not fulfilled,
the seriousness of the risk, the utility of the defendant's acts and the cost of
avoiding the harm.4 In police cases the standard of care will often not be a
high one, because the police act under considerable pressure, with compet­
ing demands on their resources, often in situations of some danger.5
Whether the defendant is in breach of his duty in a particular case is a ques­
tion of fact and degree.
(3) Damage. Because negligence is an action on the case, there will only be
a complete cause of action if the plaintiff can show some "special damage"
such as personal injury, nervous shock or economic loss. If economic loss is
the only damage caused then there are strict "policy limitations" on recov­
ery. The plaintiff can only recover for "pure economic loss" if he can show a
"very close proximity" to the defendant.6 In general, the plaintiff can only
recover for damage which is "reasonably foreseeable."7
(4) Causation. Even if the plaintiff was damaged and the defendant was in
breach of a duty owed to him, there will be no action unless the damage was
in fact caused by the breach. The defendant will not be liable if, on a proper

understanding of events, the plaintiff's damage was not in fact caused by the
negligence of the defendant but by some intervening "new act” [novus
actus in teiven ien s ). Human action does not, of itself, sever the connected
sequence of events.8 The basic rule was summarised by Greer L.J. in the
leading case of H aynes v. H arw ood9 as follows:
      "If what is relied upon as a novus actus interveniens is the very kind of
      thing which is likely to happen if the want of care which is alleged
      takes place, the principle embodied in the maxim is no defence."
In police cases the first element will often be the most difficult to establish.
Special considerations may arise if the police are acting under "statutory
powers."10 Even if the plaintiff can establish a prima facie duty of care this
may well be negatived by "policy considerations." When it is alleged that
there has been a negligent failure to carry out proper investigations special
difficulties arise concerning liability for the acts of independent third par­
ties.


Negligence liability and independent third parties

  Difficult legal issues arise when the plaintiff's claim is based on damage
caused by an independent third party who, it is said, was placed in a position
to cause the damage by the defendant's negligence. It is clear that the simple
fact that the-damage was caused by a third party:
      "does not, of itself, preclude success of the claim, since breach of duty
      on the part of the person against whom the claim is made may also have
      played a part in causing the damage."11
Nevertheless, the situations in which such an action may succeed have
been strictly limited although the precise basis and extent of this limitation
have been unclear.
  There is no doubt that there will be liability if there is a "special relation­
ship" between the defendant and the third party by virtue of which the
defendant is responsible for controlling the actions of the third party.12
There will also be liability if the defendant negligently causes or permits a
source of danger to be created in a situation where it is reasonably foresee­
able that third parties may interfere with it.13
  There have been, however, considerable difficulties as to liability in cases
where there is no "special relationship" or situation of danger.14 The auth­
orities revealed two different approaches with different practical conse­
quences. These can be called the "policy" and the "foreseeability"
approaches.
  The first approach treats the limitation as a question of policy. On this

view, policy excludes liability in the absence of a special relationship or
other special circumstances. This was the analysis of Lord Denning M.R. in
L am b v. C a m d e n 15 and was partially supported by Oliver L.J. (as he then
was).16 In P. Perl (Exporters) v. C a m d e n 17 Goff L.J. (as he then was) applied
Lord Wilberforce's test in Anns18 and suggested that "policy consider­
ations" negatived a duty of care in the absence of a special relationship
between the defendant and the third party. More recently, Lord Goff has
refined his analysis of the absence of a duty of care in this area stating that
the fu n d a m en tal reason for it is "that the common law does not impose
liability for what are called pure omissions."19
   The second approach treats the question as being a matter of foreseeabi­
lity: if the third party intervention is foreseeable with a sufficiently high
degree of probability there will be a duty of care. In Dorset Yacht v. H om e
Office 20 Lord Reid said that there would be liability if the "intervening
action" of the third party was "very likely" (or perhaps just "likely")21 to
happen. In subsequent cases it has been suggested that the defendant may
be liable where third party intervention is "likely or very likely to
happen,"22 that there must be a "very high degree of foreseeability/'23 per­
haps "amounting almost to inevitability.'24
   This conflict was resolved by the decision of the House of Lords in Sm ith
v. L ittlew o o d s 25 when this second approach was endorsed by a majority. It
was said that "mere foreseeability of damage is certainly not a sufficient
basis to found liability."26 Nevertheless, as Lord Mackay (with whom Lord
Keith and Lord Griffiths agreed, Lord Brandon taking a similar approach)27
said:
      "what the reasonable man is bound to foresee in a case involving injury
      or damage by independent human agency, just as in cases where such
      agency plays no part, is the probable consequences of his own act or
      omission, but that, in such a case, a clear basis will be required on
      which to assert that the injury or damage is more than a mere possi­
      bility."28
The result must be "highly probable or very likely" and the needle that

measures the probability of a particular result must be "near the top of the
scale."29 It is submitted that this is the correct approach and is in line with
the older authorities which deal with the problem as one of causation. As
Greer L.J. put it in a passage which has often been approved:
    "it is not true to say that where a plaintiff has suffered damage occa­
    sioned by a combination of the wrongful act of a defendant and some
    further conscious act by an intervening person, that of itself prevents
    the court coming to a conclusion in the plaintiff's favour if the accident
    was the natural and probable consequence of the wrongful act."30
The fact that the third party's acts are unlawful is no objection to liability.
As Lord Reid has said:
    "Unfortunately, tortious or criminal action by a third party is often 'the
    very kind of thing' which is likely to happen as a result of the wrongful
    or careless act of the defendant."31
It is submitted, therefore, that in the absence of "special relationships," a
person will be liable for the tortious acts of third parties if these are reason­
ably forseeable consequences of his own negligence. Liability will depend
on the facts of each particular case.
9. GENERAL DEFENCES


Introduction


  There are a number of general defences which are potentially applicable
to all the tort actions considered in this chapter. The most important of
these are as follows:
        (1)   contributory negligence;
        (2)   consent;
        (3)   necessity;
        (4)   the plaintiff is a wrongdoer.



Contributory negligence


  At common law contributory negligence was a complete defence to an
action in negligence or breach of statutory duty but does not seem to have
been applied to any other cause of action.36 The position is now governed by
the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945. If a plaintiff in an
action for negligence suffers damage "as the result partly of his own fault"
his damages are reduced "to such an extent as the court thinks just and
equitable having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the
damage 37
  The position when the plaintiff's claim is a tort other than negligence or
breach of statutory duty is unclear. "Contributory negligence" will only be
a defence to an action for defamation, conspiracy or misfeasance if it can be
shown that the defendant's acts were themselves tortious,- mere "careless­
ness" by the defendant will not be sufficient.38

 Consent

   The maxim volenti non fit injuria, that to which a man consents cannot
be considered an injury, is of general application in the law of tort.39 The
defence of consent takes two forms: as consent to the invasion of interests
or the willing assumption of risk of injury.40
   No action will lie in respect of acts which were authorised by the plain­
tiff. The defendant must establish that the plaintiff's consent was fully and
freely given. This form of the defence applies to intentional torts such as
trespass to land or goods. It also applies to actions for defamation41 and pre­
sumably to misfeasance and conspiracy.
   The defence of volenti also applies in "non-intentional torts" when the
plaintiff has agreed to "assume the risk" of suffering damage. The scope of
the defence of consent as "assumption of risk" has been considerably
restricted by judicial decision. It is necessary for the defendants to show
that:
      "the plaintiff voluntarily and freely with full knowledge of the nature
      of the risk he ran impliedly agreed to incur it."42
It is not enough that the plaintiff had knowledge of the risk; he must be
shown to have consented not to hold the defendant liable:
      "The plaintiff must agree, expressly or impliedly, to waive any claim
      for any injury that may befall him due to the lack of reasonable care by
      the defendant."43
The defence must be specifically pleaded.44
  The defence of volenti is very rarely successful in actions for breach of
statutory duty or negligence.40 Although it was held to be applicable in A s h ­
ton v. Turner.46 This was a negligence action by one of two burglars who
had been drinking against the other who had injured him by crashing their
getaway car. It was held that no duty of care was owed by the driver to the
passenger in that situation but that the action failed, in any event, because
the passenger had assumed the risk of such injury by taking part in the bur­
glary and attempted escape.


Necessity

  There is no doubt that "necessity" is a defence to an action in trespass,
especially when human life is at stake.47 The defence probably applies to
"intentional torts." It will apply if the defendant takes "reasonable

measures" to deal with a "real and imminent danger."48 The police may be
able to rely on it to justify taking reasonably necessary steps to prevent
crime.49 The defence will not, however, be available if the necessity has
arisen from the defendant's own negligence.50
   In the case of R igby v. Chief C on stable 51 the police successfully relied on
this defence to an action for trespass when they had set the plaintiff's gun
shop alight by firing CS gas canisters into it to "flush out" a dangerous
armed psychopath. Although the trespass was justified by necessity it was
no defence to an allegation of negligence in making arrangements to deal
with the consequences of the intrusion. The defendant was, therefore,
found guilty of negligence for firing the gas canister when no fire fighting
equipment was on hand.52


The plaintiff is a wrongdoer

   This defence has been discussed in relation to trespass to the person53 and
interference with goods.54 Its scope remains unclear but it seems that the
plaintiff's wrongdoing may, in some circumstances extinguish any right of
action in reliance on the maxim ex turpi causa non oritur a c tio ; an action
does not arise from a base cause. In the case of Thackw ell v. Barclay's
B an k30 Hutchison J. suggested that the Court should consider whether
there was any illegality of which the court should take notice and whether,
if there was, giving relief to the plaintiff was contrary to public policy
because it would be indirectly assisting or encouraging him in his criminal
act.
   The fact that the plaintiff was engaged in a criminal act may mean that he
cannot recover for damage caused by the defendant's tortious conduct. In
M urphy v. Culhane56 it was held that a man who takes part in a criminal
affray may be said "to have been guilty of such a wicked act as to deprive
himself of a cause of action."57
   On the other hand, the plaintiff's wrongdoing may mean that the defend­
ant's acts were not, in the circumstance, tortious. In the case of A sh ton v.
Turner58 Ewbank ]. held that:
      "The law of England may in certain circumstances not recognise the
      existence of a duty of care by one participant in a crime to another parti­
      cipant in the same crime, in relation to an act done in connection with

    the commission of that crime. The law is based on public policy, and
    the application of the law depends on a consideration of all the facts."
He went on to find that, on the facts, no duty of care existed between the
plaintiff and the defendants.
   This defence is, however, limited in scope and "Cases where an action in
tort has been defeated by [it] . . . are exceedingly rare."09It is submitted that
it will only succeed in two situations:
     (1) where, to establish his cause of action the plaintiff has to rely on
         criminal activity to found his claim60;
     (2) where, by giving the relief sought the court would be "indirectly
         assisting or encouraging" him in his criminal act.61
Thus, for example, a claim that the police had not shown proper care in
looking after a person in police custody, would not be defeated simply
because the person being held was being held for admitted wrongdoing. On
the other hand, a plaintiff who was injured following a negligent failure by
the police to deal with his 999 call in relation to a criminal affray which he
had instigated would not succeed in a negligence claim.

Negligence and police activities


    There is no doubt that in many spheres of activity the police are liable for
 negligence and that no special principles of law apply. One example which
 lies outside the range of this book concerns "accident at work" negligence
 actions brought by serving police officers. Such actions are common and are
 governed by the same principles which cover ordinary negligence actions by
 employees.
     Similarly, actions against the police in respect of negligent driving are
 common and usually uncontroversial in law. It has been held that police
 drivers, acting in the course of their duties owe the same duty of care as all
 other road users.46 This applies even when they are answering emergency
 calls.
    The fact that the police are engaged in "policing" activities does not
 exempt them from ordinary duties of care. These duties of care are not
 "negatived" just because the police are engaged in difficult or dangerous
work—but the nature of the work is taken into account in assessing the
 applicable "standard of care." The principle is clearly illustrated by the case
 of Marshall v. O sm o n d 47 which involved injury to a suspected criminal at
 the end of a chase by a police car. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial
judge on the law and held that a police officer owed the same duty of care to
a criminal he was pursuing as to anyone else, namely a duty "to exercise
such care and skill as is reasonable in all the circumstances."48 They went
on to support the trial judge's conclusion and held that the officer was, in
fact, not in breach of this duty.
    If police conduct, in all the circumstances, falls below the standard
expected of "reasonable police officers" the courts will impose negligence
liability. Thus, in the case of K n ightley v. Johns 49 the police had been called
to an accident in a tunnel. The police inspector in charge, in contravention
of standing orders, had forgotten to close the tunnel to traffic. He therefore
ordered the plaintiff, a police motorcyclist, to ride back down the tunnel,


45   [1985] 1 W.L.R. 1242 a t 1251A.
46   See G a y n o rw . A l l e n [1959] 2 Q.B. 403; W o o d s v. R ic h a rd s [1977] R.T.R . 20.

49   [1982] 1 W.L.R. 349.
against the flow of traffic, to close it to traffic. The plaintiff collided with a
car and the Court of Appeal held that the Chief Constable was vicariously
liable for the inspector's negligence. The case raised complex questions con­
cerning novus actus interveniens but the point to note is that there was no
discussion as to whether the police should be held liable for a negligent per­
formance of their duties. The Court assumed that, if the inspector did not
come up to the standard of the "reasonable police officer" (and there was no
novus a c tu s ) then negligence liability followed.
   In general then, when the police are acting (as opposed to failing to act)
they will owe a duty of care to people who are likely to be directly affected
by their actions. No policy considerations will "restrict or negative" this
duty of care. This is illustrated by four cases in which such a duty of care
was accepted.
   The briefly reported case of Bryson v. N orthum bria Police A u th o rity 50
concerned a young man who had been arrested for drunkenness, kept in a
cell to sober up for some time and then released at 4.55a.m. In the cell he
had been vomiting and it seems unlikely that he had fully recovered by the
time of his release. Wandering home in the wrong direction he was killed in
an accident on an urban by-pass. In those circumstances Reeve J. held that
the police, in exercising their discretion whether to release or detain an
arrested person owe him a duty of care, but that, on the facts they had dis­
charged that duty. No policy considerations appear to have limited the duty.
   A similar approach was adopted by Taylor J. in the case of R igby v. Chief
Constable of N o rth a m p to n .3l This involved police attempts to "flush" a
psychopath out of a gun shop. They did this with CS gas which was gener­
ated by a canister which got very hot and which the police knew was likely
to cause a fire. The police originally had a fire engine on hand but it left and
they made no attempt to replace it. A CS canister was then used with no fire
fighters at the scene. The canister did in fact cause a fire which destroyed
the plaintiff's shop. In these circumstances he was able to recover damages
for negligence. No "policy considerations" limited the duty of care.
   The county court case of Charles Wilson A u to m o b ile Engineers v. C hief
C onstable of Greater M anchester 52 involved a claim for the negligent
release of a car from police custody. The police stopped the car and arrested
the occupants on suspicion of theft. Although the occupants were of no
fixed abode, with no documents and were not the registered keepers of the
car they were released two hours later with the car and they disappeared.
The judge held that:
      "a police officer owes a duty to the owner of goods which he has seized
      to take reasonable care for their safety, to make such enquiries as may
      be reasonable to ascertain their ownership and to take reasonable steps
      to return them to their owner if that is possible."53
The duty owed by the officer was said to be "to take such care as is reason­
able in all the circumstances."34 As the judge said:

         "One has to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case
         including, for example, the difficulty of any problem facing the officer,
         the nature and extent of the information available to him, the need in
         some circumstances perhaps to make a swift decision and the myriad of
         other considerations which may arise in any particular case."53
On the facts, it was held that the police were negligent.
   The Scots law in this area is the same as that in England and the Court of
Session case of Allan (or W ilson ) v. Chief Constable of Lothian et) Borders
Police56 provides a useful illustration of the applicability of ordinary negli­
gence principles to the police. The pursuer (plaintiff) was a widow whose
husband had died of hypothermia in a field after having been taken away in
a police car. The police had been called after a domestic dispute in the
middle of the night. The deceased had been drunk and aggressive and the
police were removing him from the place where he had been causing
trouble.
   Although Lord McCluskey was not prepared to hold that the police had
"deliberately decided to teach . . . (the deceased) a lesson by depositing him
in the remote outskirts of Edinburgh"37 he was of the view that:
         "there is no escape from the fact that had the police officers given any
         thought to the weather conditions, the deceased's condition, the
         deceased's clothing, the remote location in which they left him, the
         conditions underfoot they would have been bound to realise that he
         was a danger to himself."38
He held that the police had a choice, whether to release the deceased or to
hold him and:
         "In deciding how to exercise that choice they had a duty to exercise a
         reasonable care to have regard to the reasonably foreseeable conse­
         quences of his being released."39
Although it was not reasonably foreseeable that the deceased would die of
hypothermia the damage suffered by him was of a "reasonably foreseeable
type"—that is harm by adverse weather conditions—and could, therefore,
be recovered for.60
  The judge concluded that "the police failed in their duty to take reason­
able care for . . . (the deceased's) safety"61 and his widow was, therefore,
awarded damages of £62,537 calculated on ordinary "fatal accidents" prin­
ciples.62
  In summary when police officers act in a negligent way they will in
general be liable according to ordinary principles. However, they will not be
subject to high standards of care in situations in which there is an important
discretionary element in the activity in question.

1. The Legal Status
and Organisation of the
Police


1. INTRODUCTION

   The legal status of the British police is complex and suffers from many
obscurities. Modem statutes governing the position have, according to the
familiar pattern, been constructed on common law assumptions which have
never been fully clarified. Despite the central importance of the police in the
legal system there are considerable doubts as to such fundamental matters as
their precise duties, the legal status of the organised "police force” and the
extent to which they are obliged to follow the orders of police authorities.
   Many civil actions against the police turn on the extent of their powers.
These powers flow partially from statute and partially from their status as
"constables" at common law. An understanding of the "office of constable"
and the duties which flow from it remains fundamental to any analysis of
the legal position of the police. The powers which the law gives to the
police are, almost always, vested in individual constables. It is important to
distinguish between the different types of powers involved. These areas
dealt with in the first section of this chapter.
   Although the law has taken very little direct cognisance of the fact that
the police operate in "forces" an understanding of police organisation and
hierarchy is.sometimes of great importance in considering the civil law pos­
ition of police officers. In the second section of this chapter, therefore, the
organisation and structure of the police is considered. This involves not
only the organisation of individual police forces but the relationship of
forces to police authorities and to the Home Secretary. The police are regu­
lated by a tri-partite system designed by the Police Act 1964. The present
constitutional arrangement is that the police (outside London) are super­
vised by an ill-defined co-ordination of chief constables, police authorities
and the Home Secretary.
   The relationship between police officers can give rise to practical problems
in relation to "vicarious liability." Difficult and unresolved questions arise
concerning the circumstances in which chief constables are liable for the torts
of officers in their force and the precise legal relationship between officers.
These questions are considered in the fourth section of the chapter. In the final
section police ranks, appointment and promotion are briefly discussed.
2. THE CONSTABLE: OFFICE, DUTIES AND
POWERS


Introduction

   From the point of view of most citizens the police appear to be one more
branch of the government. They seem to be a nationally organised, hier­
archical and disciplined body of men, under the ultimate control of the
Home Secretary. In strict law, however, their position is very different.
Although they are public servants in the broadest sense, they have a unique
legal status. A police constable is an officer of the Crown and holds a public
office. He is said to exercise an original discretion in keeping the Queen's
peace which derives from the office of constable and the swearing of the
constable's oath. He is said to be answerable to the law and to the law alone.
   The position of chief constables and the Metropolitan and City of London
Police Commissioners is also unique. The conventional view of their pos­
ition is that they have complete "operational independence" from national
and local government. It is said that the responsibility for maintaining law
and order belongs solely to chief officers and no minister of the Crown or
locally constituted police authority is entitled to interfere with the way in
which they carry out these functions. This doctrine is discussed and criti­
cised in Chapter 13.1
   The roots of the unique constitutional status of the police are to be found
in the gradual evolution of the common law system of part-time, unpaid,
"parish constables" into the modem professional police force. The first
organised "police force" along modem lines was, of course, established in
London by the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829. This force was always
under the ultimate direction of the Home Secretary although the precise
limits of his powers over it have never been clearly established.2 Outside
London, local authorities were empowered to set up police forces by the
Municipal Corporations Act 1835 (in the boroughsI and the County Police
Act 1839 (in the counties). The next century saw the slow development of
the present policing system with the number of police forces declining
(from 237 in 1856 to 43 today), chief constables gradually asserting their
"operational independence" and the Home Office taking on an increasing
range of regulatory and supervisory functions.3 The modem policing system
was substantially in place after 1945 and was confirmed and regularised by
the Police Act 1964. Although this legislation clarified the relationships
between police authorities, chief constables and the Home Office4 the basic
"element of policing" is the same as it has been for many centuries: the
common law constable. Despite the increasing numbers of statutory func­
tions given to the constable over the past 150 years, there has been no com­
prehensive statutory definition of his duties. His basic legal status is still
defined by the common law.

The office of constable

  The 1929 Royal Commission5 described the police in the following
terms:
     "The police of this country have never been recognised either in law or
     tradition as distinct from the general body of citizens. Despite the
     imposition of many extraneous duties on the Police by legislation and
     administrative action, the principle remains that a Policeman, in the
     view of the common law is only "a person paid to perform, as a matter
     of duty, acts which if he were so minded he might have done volun­
     tarily."6
Although these remarks are often quoted they do not recognise crucial dif­
ferences between the common law powers of constables and those of private
citizens. At common law a constable could arrest a person whom he had
"reasonable and probable cause to suspect" was guilty of treason or felony
(both of which at common law were capital offences). Furthermore, the
common law also gave constables, but not ordinary citizens, a range of
powers of entry and search.7
   Although the distinctive role of the individual police constable was recog­
nised by the common law, the police force as an organisation of constables,
was not. Thus, H a lsb u ry ’s Laws of England states that:
     "notwithstanding that the police have numerous statutory powers and
     duties, in essence a police force is neither more or less than a number of
     individual constables whose status derives from the common law,
     organised together in the interests of efficiency."8
  A member of the police force when carrying out his duties as a constable
acts as an officer of the Crown and a public servant.9 Consequently, as a
public officer, a constable commits a common law offence if he wilfully and
culpably neglects to perform any duty which he is bound to perform (either
at common law or by statute) unless the discharge of the duty would
involve greater danger than a man of ordinary firmness and authority might
expect to encounter.10
  By virtue of the office itself, a constable acts on his own responsibility
when exercising his powers (unless executing a lawfully issued warrant).11
Therefore, although a chief constable commands his force, he cannot give
an officer under his command an order to do acts which can only be lawfully
done if the officer himself forms a suspicion on reasonable grounds.12

Similarly, he cannot divest policemen of their powers of arrest and any
attempt to do so would be unlawful.13
  A distinctive feature of the "office of constable" is the swearing of the
constable's oath. Every constable upon his appointment must be attested as
a constable by making a declaration that he does—
      "solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that . . . (he) will well and
      truly serve Our Sovereign Lady, the Queen, in the office of constable
      without favour or affection malice or ill will; and that . . . (he) will to
      the best of his power cause the peace to be kept and preserved and pre­
      vent all offences against persons and properties of Her Majesty's sub­
      jects; and while . . . [he] will to the best of his skill and knowledge,
      discharge all the duties thereof faithfully according to the law."14
The declaration must be made before the Commissioner or Assistant Com­
missioner of the Metropolis or in any other case, a justice of the peace with
jurisdiction within the police area.13 The Royal Commission on the Police
suggested that the constable's claim to be independent from outside control
is reflected in the terms of the constable's oath.16 However, it is difficult to
see how such a suggestion can be supported by an examination of the words
of the attestation itself.17


The “independence" of the constable

  Lustgarten has suggested that the precise nature of the constable's "orig­
inal authority" and "independence" can be subjected to further analysis.18
He argues that "discretion" plays a central role. Perhaps the most important
aspect of a constable's discretion is whether or not to invoke the criminal
law in the first place.19 Yet, the obvious dangers inherent in selective law
enforcement have not troubled the courts. In A rrow sm ith v. Jenkins10 the
Divisional Court dismissed such a complaint. Lord Parker C.J. said:
      "I think the defendant feels that she is under a grievance because—and
      one may put it this way—she says: 'Why pick on me? There have been
      many meetings in this street from time to time. The police, as on this
      occasion have attended these meetings and assisted to make free pas­
      sage, and there is no evidence that anybody else has ever been pros­
      ecuted. Why pick on me?' That of course has nothing to do with this
      court. The sole question here is whether the defendant has contravened
      [the statute].21"

  It is also entirely within the constable's discretion what particular legal
power he exercises and what particular charge he arrests for, where several
are available to him.
  At the same time the constable works within an organisational hierarchy
which imposes substantial limitations on his "independence." He is subject
to numerous standing orders which he is bound to obey as duly arising out
of the chief constable's power and obligation to control the police force.22
His decision to arrest is reviewed by his superiors who may reject his
charge. It has, therefore, been argued that the only sense in which the police
constable is "independent" is that he alone must assess whether or not the
factual pre-conditions for making an arrest exist.23



The duties of the constable


   The duties of constable derive from his office and have long been thought
to be common law duties. However, in George v. G arland 24 it was held that
the obligations of a police officer had become statutory duties because they
are now expressed in the form of delegated legislation.25 In any event, the
question of whether the constable's duties are statutory or exist at common
law is irrelevant for the purposes of enforcing them by way of judicial
review.26 The House of Lords made it clear in C.C.S.U. v. M inister for the
Civil Service 27 that judicial review will apply to a power derived from the
common law or the royal prerogative just as much as it does to a statutory
power.
   The primary function of the constable is the preservation of the Queen's
Peace.28 The leading case of Glasbrook Bros. v. Glamorgan C ou nty Coun­
cil29 concerned the payment of the police by colliery owners during a coal
miners strike. Viscount Cave stated that
       "No doubt there is an absolute and unconditional obligation binding
       the police authorities to take all steps which appear to them necessary
       for keeping the peace, for preventing crime or for protecting property
       from criminal injury."30
   In Rice v. Connolly31 Lord Parker C.J. described the duties of the police as
follows:
        "it is part of the obligations and duties of a police constable to take all
        steps which appear to him to be necessary for keeping the peace, for

      preventing crime or for protecting property from criminal injury. There
      is no exhaustive definition of the powers and obligations of the police
      but they are at least these and they would further include the duty to
      detect crime and to bring offenders to justice."32
Thus, it is a constable's duty to prevent breaches of the peace that he
reasonably apprehends33 but not to protect an individual against "a mere
apprehension of future crime."34 He is under a general duty to protect life
and property33 and to execute in his area a warrant issued by a justice of the
peace.36
  There is an important discretionary element in these duties. As Sir John
Donaldson M.R. has put it:37
      "There is no doubt about the duty of the Chief and other Constables to
      keep the peace and enforce the law . . . However, Chief Constables
      have the widest possible discretion in their choice of the methods
      whereby they will discharge this duty [R. v. C om m issioner of Police for
      the Metropolis, ex. p. Blackburn [1968] 2 Q.B. 118)."3S

Cases such as Glasbrook Bros. v. Glamorgan County Council 39 and Rice v.
C onnolly 40 express this discretion in subjective terms: a constable must do
what appears to him to be necessary. Nevertheless, it has been established
by a number of important judicial review cases over the past two decades
that, however subjective a discretion is, its exercise is subject to objective
principles. The discretion must be exercised bona fide in accordance with
the law, relevant matters must be taken into account and irrelevant matters
must be excluded.41 Purthermore, in the Scottish case of Wilson v. Chief
Constable of Lothian e) Borders 42 it was held that, in exercising their dis­
cretion, the police owed a duty of care to someone who would, foreseeably,
be affected by its exercise.
  In general, a constable's duties:
      "must be carried out in a fair and even-handed manner. Because his
      resources are finite he will not be able to provide perfect protection for
      all. Even if he has available resources his public duty is not boundless.
      He has a duty to protect against crime or threatened crime, particularly
      threatened violent crime. It is not his public duty to protect against the
      mere apprehension of possible crime. There is no absolute standard of
      duty and no definition of the exact amount of police protection to

       which an individual is entitled. Each case must depend upon its own
       circumstances."43



 The nature of police powers


   In order to be able to carry out their various duties in an effective manner
the law gives constables a number of special "powers." Under these powers
the police are "authorised" to do things which would otherwise be unlaw­
ful. If an ordinary citizen attempted to stop and search people in the street,
to arrest them on suspicion of having committed crimes, or to enter and
search their houses he would usually be liable to civil action. Police powers
provide constables with a defence of "lawful justification" against civil
actions in respect of actions carried out in pursuance of their duties.
   In invoking their powers the police are seeking to justify activity which
is, prima facie, an unlawful interference with another's interests.
   As a general principle of statutory construction, statutes which justify
such activity must be strictly construed against those seeking 10 reply on
them. To cite the words of Lord Diplock:
      "if the statutory words relied upon as authorising the acts are ambigu­
      ous or obscure, a construction should be placed upon them that is least
      restrictive of individual rights which would otherwise enjoy the protec­
      tion of the common law."44
The comments of Lord Scarman on the importance of express statutory pro­
vision are also relevant here:
      "it is not the task of judges, exercising their ingenuity in the field of
      implication, to go further in the invasion of private rights and liberties
      than Parliament has expressly authorised. The importance of express
      provision is that it affords the citizen the opportunity, if he chooses to
      use it, to read and understand the extent to which his rights and liber­
      ties have been curtailed."43
  Police powers are of three basic types: common law powers, without war­
rant powers and with warrant powers. Different considerations apply to
defences of "lawful justification" based on different types.

(1) C o m m o n l a w p o w e r s . Despite increasing trends towards the statutory
codification of police powers the common law position remains of crucial
importance in many cases. This is in part due to parliament's strange reluc­
tance to abolish common law powers, even when enacting statutory powers
covering the same ground. An example of this is the failure of the Police and

Police powers at common law have been refined and adapated by judicial
decision over the centuries. The courts continue to play a creative role in
this field. The most recent example being the extension of the M areva juris­
diction to the police.47 As a matter of general principle such extensions
should be limited in scope because the powers in question represent
invasions of the common law rights of citizens.
   Common law police powers are usually such that they can only be exer­
cised if certain preconditions of fact and belief are fulfilled. Thus a constable
has a common law power to arrest someone whom he sees breaking the
peace or who so conducts himself that he causes a breach of the peace to be
reasonably apprehended. If no breach of the peace has taken place and none
is reasonably apprehended then the constable has no common law power of
arrest and any arrest made will be unlawful.

(2) W i t h o u t w a r r a n t p o w e r s . Many of the most important police powers
of arrest, search, entry and seizure are statutory "without warrant" powers.
In other words, they can only be exercised if particular preconditions of fact
or belief laid down by the statute are fulfilled. The majority of such powers
are now to be found in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. If the
preconditions of fact or belief laid down by the Act are not met then an
arrest, search or entry will have been done without "lawful justification"
and an action in tort will lie. It is important to note that the lawfulness of
the exercise of a police power must be justified at the time of its exercise, "It
cannot be made lawful or unlawful according to what happens after­
wards."48
   The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 contains a number of "proce­
dural safeguards" in relation to "without warrant" powers. It is submitted
that the proper approach when examining such provisions is as follows:
   (a) It is first necessary to consider whether the police conduct at the tim e
they are obliged to follow a particular provision is prima facie tortious: are
they detaining or searching a person, entering land or holding goods at that
time? If not then no action in tort will lie simply for a breach of the proce­
dural safeguards. A failure to carry out a procedure that must be followed
after the prima facie tortious conduct has occurred will not retrospectively
render otherwise lawful actions unlawful.49 Thus, for example, the police
will not be guilty of false imprisonment solely because they fail to comply
with a duty which arises after the suspect has been subjected to a "stop and
search.'00

50 See, e.g., C hap. 5 at p. 131, below .
   (b) If the conduct is prima facie tortious it is necessary to identify the
police power in the Act which "justifies" the conduct and consider whether
the police have acted "in accordance" with it;
   (c) If the police have not acted in accordance with their statutory power it
is necessary to consider whether or not, on a true construction of the stat­
ute, the provision casts a m a n d a to ry d u ty on the police. A procedural safe­
guard which gives the suspect an entitlement but which places the police
under no duty to implement it will not render them liable in tort if they fail
to do so (although an action for breach of statutory duty may lie).31
  (d) If the police were acting in a way which was prima facie tortious and
are in breach of a mandatory duty laid down by the statute then, it is sub­
mitted, they will be deprived of the defence of "lawful justification" and an
action in tort will lie.32
  Under section 66 of the 1984 Act the Secretary of State has a duty to issue
codes of practice in connection with "searches of premises by police offi­
cers" and "the seizure of property found by police officers on persons or
premises."33 Any breach of the provisions of these codes of practice will
render a police officer liable to disciplinary proceedings.34 But, by section
67(10) a failure of a police officer to comply with any provision of a code
"shall not of itself render him liable to any criminal or civil proceedings."
Nevertheless, it is provided by section 67( 11) that
       "In all criminal and civil proceedings any such code shall be admissible
       in evidence,- and if any provision of such a code appears to the court or
       tribunal conducting the proceedings to be relevant to any question aris­
       ing in the proceedings it shall be taken into account in determining that
       question."
In other words, the provisions of a code can be taken into account in civil
proceedings. They will, it is submitted, be relevant to the "reasonableness"
of police conduct in particular situations. Rather like the Highway Code
they will not be definitive of this but will provide a basic framework within
which reasonableness can be assessed.35

(3) “With warrant” powers. Police arrests, entries, searches and seizures
are often conducted under the authority of a legal authorisation or "war­
rant."36 A warrant gives the person to whom it is issued lawful authority to
do acts which would otherwise be unlawful. A warrant provides a complete
defence to a civil action in respect of things done "in obedience to it." Even
if a warrant is, in fact, invalid the police will have a statutory defence under
the Constables Protection Act 1750 provided they act "in obedience" to it.37

was because police constables were not "servants" of the watch committee
or the chief constable but independent "officers of the Crown." The pos­
ition was summarised as follows:
      "A constable . . . when acting as a peacc officer, is not exercising a dele­
      gated authority, but an original authority, and the general law of agency
      has no application."12
   It is submitted that, on the narrow question of whether police officers are
"servants" of their watch committees or police authority this conclusion
was legally sound.13Nevertheless, it gave rise to considerable practical diffi­
culties as members of the public would bring civil actions against individ­
ual constables who had no right to recompense from public funds against
awards of damages. The practice seems to have been to give financial sup­
port on an ad hoc case by case basis. The use of public funds by the Home
Office to settle a civil action in 1959 gave rise to stormy parliamentary
debates and was one of the factors which led to the setting up of the Royal
Commission on the Police.14
  The Royal Commission recommended that statutory provision be made
for vicarious liability and this was enacted by section 48(1) of the Police Act
1964. This provides that the chief constable of a particular police force (or,
in London, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner) is vicariously liable—
      "in respect of torts committed by constables under his direction and
      control in the performance or purported performance of their functions
      in like manner as a master is liable in respect of torts committed by his
      servants in the course of their employment."
If the officers committing the tort were being "lent" by one police force to
another under the provisions of section of the Police Act 1964 then, by sec­
tion 14(3) they are deemed to be under the direction and control of the chief
officer to whom they are lent.
   If a chief officer is found to be vicariously liable for a tort committed by a
constable under his direction and control then damages are payable out of
the police fund.1;> If an action against a chief officer is settled then the
damages are payable out of the police fund only if the settlement is
approved by the police authority.16
   The provisions of section 48 give rise to a number of potential practical
problems. First, it applies unclear common law provisions to the vicarious
liability of chief constables without dealing with possible differences
between police officers and ordinary employees. Secondly, instead of deem­
ing constables to be servants for all purposes it confines this to actions in
tort. This may give rise to difficulties in questions of vicarious responsi­
bility outside the law of tort. These problems are considered in the next two
sections.

Vicarious liability and the law of tort

   The effect of section 48 is to fix a chief constable with liability in all situ­
ations in which a "master is liable in respect of torts committed by his ser­
vants in the course of his employment." The situations in which a master is
so liable depend on the very considerable case law in this area. Only the
briefest of guidelines can be given here.17
   The question to be asked in all vicarious liability cases is whether, at the
time the tort was committed, the servant was "acting within the scope of
his employment."18 This does not mean that the servant must, in fact, be
acting in performance of his master's purposes in an authorised way. If a ser­
vant is doing an authorised act then the master will be liable even if it is
being done in an unauthorised manner.19 If a servant is doing an act which
is expressly forbidden by his master then the master will still be liable if the
prohibition deals with conduct within the sphere of his employment. If, on
the other hand, the prohibition limits the sphere of employment itself then
the master will not be liable in respect of the prohibited acts.20 The com­
mon law position is explicitly recognised in section 48 by the words "in the
purported performance of their functions."
   It is submitted that if a constable is on duty and is bona fide purporting to
carry out policing functions then there is no doubt that his chief constable
will be vicariously liable for any torts committed by him. If, however, a con­
stable is acting so outrageously that it could not possibly be thought that he
was "purporting to perform policing functions" then his chief may be in a
position to deny vicarious liability. Thus, for example, if a police officer
goes shoplifting whilst on duty it is difficult to see how his chief officer
could be vicariously liable for wrongful interference with goods. As in all
such cases liability will depend on all the circumstances of a particular case.
  A difficult which is peculiar to the vicarious liability of police officers
concerns torts committed by "off duty" police officers. In ordinary master
and servant cases there can be no question of vicarious liability if the ser­
vant is not actually working for the master at the time the tort is commit­
ted. The position in relation to the police is less clear.
   Police constables hold office under the Crown and it can be argued that
they continue to have responsibilities of such office whether or not they are
formally on duty. This is a problem which must often arise in practice in
relation to the criminal offence of "assaulting a constable in the execution
of his duty" contrary to section 51(1) of the Police Act 1964: is a person who
assaults an off-duty constable guilty of the offence? Surprisingly enough,
there is no direct authority on this point. The indirect authorities point in
different directions. In the case of M cLoiie v. Oxford 21 Donaldson L.J. treats
an officer's being on duty as a necessary condition for his acting "in the
execution of his duty."22 On the other hand, the defendant in the case of

A l b e it v. Lavin 23 was convicted of the section 51 offence in relation to an
off-duty police officer. Although the point was not explicitly considered by
either the Divisional Court (which included Donaldson L.J.) or the House of
Lords the conviction was upheld.
  It is submitted that, in strict law, police constables are always on duty.
Thus, a chief constable will be liable for any torts committed by a police
officer "in purported performance of" policing functions whether or not the
officer was on duty for police pay purposes at the time.
  Although there are a number of potential difficulties in this area there is
no reported case in which a chief officer has sought to contend that he was
not vicariously liable for the actions of one of his constables.


Agency and the police

   The case of Fisher v. O ld h a m 24 not only denies that constables are "ser­
vants" of watch committees but goes on to hold that they exercise "original
authority" and are that the "law of agency has no application."23 If this
were correct then it would mean that one police officer, exercising his func­
tions as a "peace officer," could never be regarded as "acting on behalf" of
the chief constable and senior officers who were giving him orders. This
could have some impact on civil actions where questions of police knowl­
edge are at stake.
   It is submitted, however, that police officers must now be regarded as
agents of their chief officer. The contrary dicta in Fisher v. O ld h a m 26 are,
strictly, obiter as the case was directly concerned only with the relationship
of master and servant. In any event, the position has now, arguably, been
altered by the effect of section 5 of the Police Act 1964 which places a police
force under the direction and control of the chief constable. Such direction
and control suggests a subordination of the original authority of individuals
constables to that of the chief constable.27 This contention is supported by
the case of H a w k in s v. Bepey 28 in which it was held that a police officer
instituting a prosecution was, in effect, doing so "on behalf of" his chief
constable.
   It is submitted, therefore, that police officers are properly regarded as
agents of chief officers of police. It would follow that the usual principles of
the law of agency apply. In particular, information which is given to a police
officer within the scope of his authority is effective as if it were given to his
principal, the chief officer. Matters which are known by any constable
would therefore, be deemed to be known by the chief officer, and hence by
all officers under his command as his agents.
   The impact of this conclusion in police cases is limited by the fact that
many police powers depend on the state of knowledge of the individual con­
stable concerned. In deciding whether an arrest is lawful the knowledge and
beliefs of the arresting officer (or the officer who supplied the information

for arrest)29 must be considered. A chief officer cannot direct a constable to
make an arrest.30 The lawfulness of continued detention depends on what
was known to the custody officer.31 Whenever a statute requires a
con stable to have reasonable grounds then principles of agency will be irrel-

     POT.TCF DIJTTFS AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

The basis of present day police duties and responsibilities lies in the
requirement of each individual officer to uphold the the fundamental
principles contained in the statutory declaration taken upon enrolment This
is required by Section 18 of the Police Act 1964 and defined by schedule 2
to that Act as follows;


  Ji— — of..,..— do soienmiyandsincere/y dec/areanda/firm tiiat/ wiff
  “

The composition of this oath indicates a duty to Sovereign, state, people
and custom in accordance with the dictates of the law.


A police officer’s authority, therefore, arises from his having sworn to serve
the Crown and when on duty he acts as an officer of the Crown and a
public servant- His powers are exercised by virtue of his office and on his
own responsibility.
                                      1
 Chief Constables and senior officers are not liable, except under certain
statutes, for the actions of their subordinates and constables are not
employees of police authority or Crown.


This unique position must be considered when looking at the responsibi­
lity of the police collectively or as an organsiation.


The precise constitutional position of the constable is still somewhat
ambiguous and little is written on the subject in government and
constitutional commentaries.


In 1959 a disagreement between the Nottingham Watch Committe and
the Chief Constable led to detailed debate about the constitutional
relationship between police authorities and police acting as law
enforcemnet officers. The Watch Committee dismissed the Chief
Constable but his re-instatment was secured by the Home Office. Their
view was that chief officers of police, as constables at common law,
exercise a discretionary authority in keeping the peace and are not subject
to control or instructions by watch committes whilst performing their
law enforcement function.


The original office of constable was held at common law and later
enlarged by the Statute of Wincester. It is debatable if, at that time, any
independence of action or freedom from control, was envisaged. The
status of constable was subject to variance and by the eighteenth century
had diminished to that of servant of the local Justices.
The supposition of the individuality of the powers of a constable is based
upon an interpretation of statute law which asserts that powers are
conferred on a constable as ” original ” and not " delegated ” from any
other authority.


This position has not arisen as a result of any judicial enquiry neither is
there any principle in English public law on which it is based.


The only time when the position of the constable has been subject to
judicial review has been in the area of civil liability and in particular the
general rule that there is no master and servant relationship between
constables and their police authorities.


A man took an action against Oldham Corporation after being wrongly
arrested on a warrant.


His case was based on the fact that he considered the defendents were
acting through their watch committee and were the police authority for the
County Borough of Oldham and thus the employers of the police for the
borough.


The mans counsel was unable to cite any English decision in which civil
liability of a police authority for the actions of its constables had been
determined.


Judgement examined the relevant provisions of the Municipal Corporations
Act 1882 which provided watch committes with the ability to make
regulations to ensure borough constables were efficient in the discharge of
their duties. However, this authority was complicated by the Police Act
1919 which gave the Home Secretary, as central police authority, power to
make regulations as to the government, pay, allowances, conditions of
service etc.
From these considerations and the common law view o f the status of a
constable, it was clear that the police were fulfilling their duties as public
servants and officers of the Crown and the corporation were not
answerable in law for their actions. Judgement was given for the
defendents.


fis h e r v 0/c//???n? Corporatfo/? { J93P jL


The effect of the judgement was to make it plain that the powers of a
police officer, whether conferred by common or statute law, are exercised
by him by virtue of his office and cannot be exercised on the responsibility
of any person but himself.


A number of Royal Commissions, public enquiries etc, have reviewed this
general principle but it remains essentially intact.


Following a Royal Commission in 1960, the Police Act 1964 made Chief
Constables responsible in law for torts committed by his officers.


Further cases have confirmed the independence of the constable and the
position at present can be summarised by words from the judgement in R
v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis ex parte Blackburn ( 1968 ).


” Every constable in the land should be and is independent of the executive.
No minister of the Crown can tell him he must or must not keep
observation on this place or that he must or must not prosecute this person
or that, nor can any police authority tell him to do so. ”
The actual position of the police as an independent authority has never been
stated.


The cases quoted clearly indicate the thoughts of the judiciary but there is
evidence that this position is otherwise regarded by the executive. One such
example is contained within the Customs and Excise Management Act
1979, where customs and excise, being a revenue gathering service of the
government, have power conferred by the legislation to demand police
assistance.


We see then that each invidual within the police has a duty and responsibi­
lity to disharge his duties according to the law and is responsible for his
conduct.


The police as an organisation have a duty to enforce prohibitions created by
the legislature. When a law is passed it will, if required, grant a power to
the police to enable enforcement.


Inherent in the power granted is the requirement of its use, and therefore, a
duty or responsibility to use it as circumstances dictate.

Many laws actually require a course of action by the police or chief
constables as with firearms control, immigration or licensing, and no
discretion is available in many instances.
Other laws within the criminal field are intentionally defined vaguely to
give the police discretionary powers. Threatening and abusive words or
behaviour under the Public Order Act or obstrucing free passage along the
highway under the Highways Act are such examples which allow the
police to control a situation using their judgement, they cannot be
understood as acts against which the police are instructed to proceed.


The law and the criminal justice system do not influence the police by
direct means or instructions. They define a set of opportunities and
constraints. The powers conferred by the law are resources that the police
may use in pursuing their objectives.


It may be said that the police have a duty to enforce all laws equally and
not attempt to change the rules by non enforcement of selected legislation.


The legislature may, of course, wish to define limits of conduct and set out
codes of behaviour for the police, such as The Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984, again the police have a duty to obey.


It would be pointless to list all those statutes individually which give
powers and responsibilities to the police, any act dealing with criminal law,
traffic law, control of licensed premises etc will by its very nature
empower the police to act as regulatory body.

CORPORATE
 LIABILITY
(7) Vicarious liability
   (1) Apart from the criminal liability o f corporations, dealt with at §§ 17-11 el
seq., vicarious liability rarely arises in trials on indictm ent, as it is usually confined
to sum m ary offences. In som e cases however, these can be tried on indictment
w h en the defendant has the right o f election.
    W here an offence has been held to be an absolute offence, in that mens rea as
defined above is not required, “ the person on w h om a duty is thrown is respon­
sible, w hether he has delegated or w hether he has acted through a servant": R. y

    In Portsea Island M u tu al Co-operative Society L td. v. Leyland [1978] Crim L.R. 554,
the Divisional Court held that where a milk roundsm an, contrary to his

on his round, the em ployers were not guilty o f an offence under section 21 of the
Children and Young Persons A ct 1933. T h e Court held that on the authorities the
rou n d sm an ’s em ployers w ould only be liable if there w as clear evidence that thev
em ployed the child or that a servant, for exam ple a personnel m anager, who was
em ployed to take on staff, em ployed him,
    (2) In the class o f cases, where a duty is thrown on a particular category of per­
sons, e.g. licence holders, it has been held that if that person has delegated his
responsibilities to another the mens rea of the delegate will be im p u ted to the princi­
pal so as to make the latter criminally liable. T h is form o f liability has been termed
“ vicarious liability.” T h e leading case appears to be Linnett v. Metropolitan Polic;
Commissioner [1946] K .B . 290, D .C . There a licensee o f a public hou se w as held to
have been rightly convicted o f “ know ingly perm itting disorderly c o n d u c t” where
he had absented h im self from the premises and had left control to another man
w h o him self had know ingly perm itted the disorderly conduct, th ou gh the licensee
defendant was unaw are o f it.
   Lord Goddard C.J. said: “ T h e point does not, as I say, depend merely on the
fact that the relationship o f m aster and servant exists; it depends on the fact that
the person w ho is responsible in law as the . . . licensee o f the house has chosen to
delegate his duties, pow ers and authority to so m e b o d y else . . . . I do not wish it to
be thought that I am saying that where a statute provides that in any business a
certain act perm itted by the m anager shall be an offence on the part o f the
m an ager if it is d o n e w ith his know ledge, that if the act takes place whilst the
manager h im self is carrying on that business and is in charge o f the business but
w ith ou t his k now ledge, so that he was powerless to prevent it, that person necess­
arily com m its the offence. But if the m anager choose to delegate the e a r n in g on of
the business to another, w hether or not that other is his servant, then what that
other does or w hat he know s m ust be im puted to the person w ho put the other into
that position.”
   (3) C onsiderable doubts were cast upon this doctrine o f “ vicarious liability by
d elegation ” in Vane v. l ’iannopoullos [1965] A .C . 486, H .L . T h e doctrine however
w as reaffirmed and applied by the Court of A ppeal in R . v. Winson, ante , where fanr
v. Yiannopoullos w as considered. In R . v. Winson the licensee w as absent from the
premises, and the know ledge o f the manager w as im puted to the absent licensee.
T h e doctrine w as applied in H ow ker v. Robinson [1973] 1 Q .B . 178, D.C . and
extended to the case w here the licensee was on the premises but had delegated the'
control of a particular bar to the barman. T h e b a r m a n ’s k now ledge was imputed
to the licensee. It is subm itted that it is at least doubtful w h eth er the House of
Lords would approve o f any extension of this doctrine to offences where it had not
already been applied before the decision in Vane v. Yiannopoullos.
   N oth in g said above affects the liability o f a defendant w h o has counselled, pro­
cured, aided or abetted another to com m it an offence, see p o st , § 2 9 - 3 et seq.
(8) O ffences by corporations
   (1)    T h e question o f w hich offences can be charged against corporations is con­
sidered in § 1—29 ante. It is proposed now to consider for w hose acts, intention,
know ledge etc., a corporation is held responsible. T h e authorities are mainly con-
c e rn ed with limited com panies, but it is subm itted that they will apply to all
  bodies corporate.
     Where absolute or vicarious liability exists the sam e principles apply as to the
  liabilitv of a personal defendant for the acts o f its servants, or its agents in cases
 suc h as Linnett v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, ante.
     (2) A corporation aggregate m ay be indicted, by its corporate n am e, for
 b re a c h e s o f public duty, w hether in the nature o f nonfeasance or o f misfeasance,
 such as the obstruction o f a highw ay by a railway com pany, in a m anner not auth­
 orised by their Act o f Parliament: A tt.-G en . v. London & North Western R y. [1900] 1
 Q.B. 78. It w ould seem , also, that a corporation m ay be indicted bv its corporate
 name, and fined, for a libel published by its order. See Pharmaceutical Society v. Lon­
 don & Provincial Supply Association (1880) 5 A p p .C as. 857, 870; Triplex Safety Glass
 Co. v. Lancegaye Safety Glass Co. ( 1934) Ltd. [1939] 2 K .B . 395.
     (3) Apart from such cases, the principle seem s to be m ost clearly expressed by
 Lord Diplock in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd. v. N attrass [1972] A .C . 153 at 199: “ T h e
 natural persons w h o are to be treated as being the c o m p a n y for the purpose o f acts
 done in the course o f its business are those natural persons w h o by the m em o ra n ­
 dum and articles o f association or as a result o f action taken by the directors, or by
 [he company in general m eetin g pursuant to the articles, are entrusted with the
 exercise of the powers o f the c o m p a n y .”
     (4) In other cases difficult questions have arisen in d eciding w hich o f the officers
 or servants o f a corporation are to be identified with it so that their guilt is the guilt
 of the corporation. It m ust be a question o f la w whether, once the facts have been
 ascertained, a person in doing particular things is to be regarded as the corpor­
 ation or merely as the corporation’s servant or agent. In Bolton ( Engineering ) Co. v.
 Graham [1957] 1 Q .B . 159, 172, Lord D e n n in g M .R . said: “ A com p a n y m ay in
 many ways be likened to a h u m a n body. It has a brain and nerve centre w hich
 controls w hat it does. It also has hands w h ic h hold the tools and act in accordance
 with directions from the centre. S om e o f the p eople in the c o m p an y are mere ser­
 vants and agents w h o are nothing more than hands to do the work and cannot be
 said to represent the m ind or will. O thers are directors and managers w ho rep­
 resent the directing m ind and will o f the com pany, and control w hat it does. T h e
state of m ind o f these m anagers is the state o f m ind o f the com p an y and is treated
 by the law as s u c h .” In Tesco Supermarkets L td . v. N attrass [1972] A .C . 153, Lord
 Reid at p. 171, w hile generally approving the above-m entioned statem ent o f Lord
 Denning added: “ T here have been attem pts to apply Lord D e n n in g ’s words to all
servants o f a c o m p an y w h ose work is brain work, or w h o exercise som e m anagerial
discretion under the direction o f superior officers o f the com pany. I d o not think
that Lord D e n n in g intended to refer to them . H e only referred to those w ho rep­
resent the directing m ind and will o f the c o m p a n y and control w hat it does. I think
that is right. . . . T h e board o f directors m ay delegate s o m e part o f their functions
of m anagem ent giving to their delegate full discretion to act independently o f
instructions from them. I see no difficulty in holding that they have thereby put
such a delegate in their place so that within the scope o f the delegation he can act
as the com pany. It is not always easy to draw the line, b ut there are cases in w hich
the line m ust be d r a w n .” H e cited with approval the speech o f Lord H a ld a n e L.C.
in Lennard’s Carrying Co. L td. v. A siatic Petroleum Co. [1915] A .C . 705, 713 and
expressed the view that R . C. H am mett L td . v. Crabb 95 J .P . 180 and R . C. H am mett
Ltd. v. London County Council 97 J .P . 105 and Series v. Poole [1969] 1 Q .B . 676 were
wrongly decided and that in R . v. 1. C. R . H aulage L td. [1944] K .B . 551 the prin­
ciples relating to the liability o f a com p an y for its agent had been too w id ely stated.
Lord Morris o f Borthy-y-G est, at page 180, said that there had been no feature o f
delegation in the case to a store manager, w h o did not function as th e directing
mind or will o f the com pany, but was, so to speak, a cog in the m achine w hich had
been devised; it w as not left to him to devise it, nor w as he within w h a t had been
called “th e brain area” o f the com pany. Lord Pearson, at page 192, em phasised
that the shop m anager could not be identified w ith the c o m p a n y ’s ego nor was he
an alter ego o f the com pany, but an em ployee in a relatively subordinate post. Lord
Diplock, at page 199, laid d ow n the principle set out in (3) ante.
    (5) In R . v. Andrews Weatherfoil L td. and others (1971) 56 C r.A pp.R . 31, in w hich
 Tesco Supermarkets L td. v. Nattrass, ante, was followed, the Court o f A p p ea l stated^
that it was not every “ responsible a g e n t” or “ high executive” or “ agent acting oh
b e h a lf o f a co m p a n y ” w ho could by his actions make the c o m p a n y crim inally]
responsible, and that it was necessary to establish whether the natural person or'-i
persons in question had the status and authority w h ich in law m ade their acts in$
the matter under consideration the acts o f the com p an y so that the natural person^
w as to be treated as the com pany itself; and that it was necessary for the ju d g e tol"i
invite the jury to consider w hether or not there were established those facts which.!*
the ju d g e decided as a matter o f law were necessary to identify the person con-?i
cerned w ith the com pany.
    (6)       There is authority for the proposition that a corporation m a y be liable for j
the act o f its servant even though that act w as done in fraud o f the corporation -
itself. T h u s in Moore v. I. Bresler [1944] 2 All E.R. 515 the subm ission by officers of ■
a com p an y o f false returns o f good s sold (required for assessm ent o f purchase tax)
w as held sufficient to render the c o m p an y liable, although the returns had been *
m ad e to conceal from the c o m p an y the fact that sales in fraud o f the com p a n y had .
been made. See also R. v. S t. M a rga ret’s Trust L td. [1958] 1 W .L .R . 522; 42
C r.A pp.R . 183. T h e se decisions have been the subject o f criticism by writers of
text books and it is doubtful w h e th e r they w ould now be followed.                    u

MISFEASANCE IN PUBLIC OFFICE
6. MISFEASANCE IN A PUBLIC OFFICE

Introduction

   A police constable holds a “public office."82 One consequence of this is
that a constable who wilfully neglects to perform his duty is guilty of a
crime at common law.83 It also entails potential civil liability in the ancient
tort of misfeasance in public office.
   The action for misfeasance in public office can be traced back at least to
the eirly eighteenth century. In the famous case of A s h b y v. W hite,84 the
House of Lords upheld an action for damages by an elector who had been
wrongly refused a vote in parliamentary elections. The elements of the tort
were clarified and developed in a number of nineteenth century cases.
Nevertheless, for reasons which are not entirely clear, it appears to have fal­
len into disuse in England for a considerable period85 and the leading text­
books in the law of tort either ignore it entirely or classify it as being
"doubtful."
   Such a view is now plainly untenable. In the Privy Council case of D u n ­
lo p v. Woollahra M unicipal C ouncil86 Lord Diplock refers to the "well-
established tort of misfeasance by a public officer in the discharge of his
public duties." In the case of Bouigoin SA v. M in istry of A gricu ltu re87 Mann

an analogous cause of action in Scotland was confirmed by the case of
M icosta SA v. Shetland Islands C ou ncil.89


The elements of the tort

  The precise "elements” of the tort do not appear to have been set out sys­
tematically in any case or textbook. There are, it is submitted, four of them.
The tort is committed when:
       (1)   a public officer,-
       (2)   causes damage;
       (3)   to a "foreseeable" plaintiff;
       (4)   by acts or omissions which are a "malicious abuse" of his office.

(1) “A public officer.” This term covers:
      "everyone who is appointed to discharge a public duty, and receives
      compensation in whatever shape, from the crown or otherwise."90
There can be no doubt that a police constable is a "public officer" in this
sense. In L ew is v. C a ttle 91 Lord Hewart C.J. said that "a police officer is a
person who holds office under His Majesty." The point was conceded in R.
v. D y th a m 92 In the important Australian case of Farrington v. Thomson &)
B ridgland93 a sergeant of police was held to be the holder of a public office.

(2) Damage. This is required because misfeasance is an action on the case.
Any kind of damage will be sufficient, including, it is submitted, not only
financial damage, but loss of liberty or damage to reputation.94

(3) A foreseeable plaintiff. This element involves the issue of limitation
of the class of potential plaintiffs. In many of.the old cases the defendant's
acts were "aimed at " a particular person for malicious reasons. There was,
therefore only one potential plaintiff and no "limitation" issue arose. In the
Bourgoin case it was unsuccessfully argued that "intent to injure the plain­
tiff” ("targeted malice”) was an essential ingredient of the tort. It was held
that a plaintiff would be entitled to sue in either of two situations:
       (1) if damage was caused to him by a malicious act which was aimed at
           him,-
       (2) if the defendant had deliberately done an act which he knew he did
           not have power to do—with knowledge of its consequences—and
           the plaintiff had suffered damage as a result.9S

On this view, the class of potential plaintiffs would embrace any claimant
who in fact suffers damage, provided that damage was foreseeable. The
"limitation" issue was not expressly considered in the Bourgoin case but
the class of potential plaintiffs seems dangerously large, bearing in mind the
numbers of people who may be affected by the actions of public officers
such as police constables. It could be argued that one possible limiting prin­
ciple would be to confine plaintiffs to the class of those to whom injury
from an unlawful administrative act is reasonably foreseeable. The test
would, then, be the same as in negligence.
   Another possibility was suggested in the Australian case of Tam pion v.
A n d erso n .96 It was held that the plaintiff must show that:
      "he was a member of the public or one of the members of the public to
      whom the holder of the office owed a duty not to commit the particular
      abuse complained of.”
Thus, it might be argued that if a police officer stood by and allowed
someone to be injured by attackers (as in the D y th a m case], the person
injured (or, as in D y th a m , his estate or dependants) could sue but, for
example, his employer, could not.
  The whole question of "limitation” of the class of potential plaintiffs to
whom the duty to behave properly in a public office is owed awaits further
judicial clarification.

(4) A ct or omission. The fourth elem ent is some act or omission, by the
public officer, which constitutes a "malicious abuse” of his office. It is now
clear that there does not need to be a "positive act" or "misfeasance” to pro­
duce liability. An omission, by which the officer fails to perform a public
duty will be sufficient.97 An important question arises when a police officer
orders someone to do something when he has no power to do so. Is such an
order an "act” for the purposes of this tort? In an Australian case a police
officer ordered a hotel owner to close his hotel, knowing that he had no
power to do so. It was held that this was sufficient to found liability in m is­
feasance.98


Malice

   Malice has always caused the most difficulty in relation to this tort. It has
often been argued that whenever damage is caused by a public officer doing
something beyond his powers an action for damages should lie. This argu­
ment has been rejected in the large majority of cases.99 The position is dif­
ferent, however, if the act is knowingly invalid. There is now no doubt that
in such a case tortious liability will arise. In the Bourgoin case (in an analy­
sis accepted by all the judges in the Court of Appeal)1 Mann J. put the point
like this:


96 [1973] V.R. 715 a t 749.
97 See H e n ly 's case (1828) 5 Bing. 91 a t 107.
98 See Farrington v. T h o m s o n &) B rid g la n d [1959] V.R. 286 a t 293—294.
99 See D u n lo p v. W o o lla h ra M u n c ip a l C o u n c il [1982] A .C . 158; a n d T a k a r o Proper­
   tie s v. R o w lin g [1978] 2 N .Z .L .R . 314.

       “There is no sensible distinction between the case where an officer per­
       forms an act w hich he has no power to perform with the object of injur­
       ing 'A' (which the defendant accepts is actionable at the instance of 'A')
       and the case where an officer performs an act which he knows he has no
       power to perform with the object of conferring a benefit on 'B' but
       which has the foreseeable and actual consequence of injury to 'A'."2
Thus, a "misfeasance" or "malicious abuse" is committed by the police in
one of two circumstances:
        (1) where a police officer does something for a "malicious motive"
            which causes damage to the plaintiff;
        (2! where damage is caused by a police officer “knowingly" doing
            something which he has no power to do.

(1) I m p r o p e r m o t i v e s . The first alternative requires "malice." As in mali­
cious prosecution cases "malice" does not simply mean "ill will" or spite.
As Lord Campbell C.J. said to the jury in Tozer v. C h ild (a direction upheld
by the Court of the Queen's Bench)
       "malice might be proved, not only by evidence of personal hostility or
       spite, but by any evidence of any other corrupt or improper motive."3
Any "wrongful motive" will, therefore, be sufficient "malice" for these pur­
poses. Thus, it will be a "malicious abuse of office" for a police officer to
request a person to wait for him at a police station in a deliberate attempt to
harm his business or to relieve him of the burden of conducting immediate
inquiries to enable him to go home early. The latter motive is a "wrongful"
one in law, even though no spite or hostility are involved.
   If the actions of a police officer are "malicious" in this extended sense
they do not have to be ultra vires his powers to attract liability.4 In other
words, there will be liability in damages for any loss caused by police acts or
omissions based on wrongful motives. Thus a police officer who lawfully
seizes goods which he has reasonable grounds for believing are evidence of
an offence which it is necessary to seize to prevent them being concealed
w ill be liable for misfeasance if his motive in seizing the goods is not the
collection of evidence but some wrongful motive such as causing damage to
the owner's business. Despite the lawfulness of his acts he w ill be liable
because of the maliciousness of his motive.
   The mere presence of a wrongful motive is not, in itself, sufficient to
found liability. Such a motive must be determinative of the act or omission
in question. The criminal case of R. v. Llewellyn-fones,3 provides useful
guidance here. The case involved a County Court Registrar w ho was
accused of making an order in relation to funds under his control "in the
expectation that he would gain personal advantage from the making of such
an order." The trial judge ruled that:
       "if the registrar of a county court when exercising his power to order
       payment out of court of money held on behalf of a beneficiary were to
       make an order in expectation of some personal benefit he hoped to

        obtain and in circumstances where, had it not been for the personal
        benefit, he would not have made the order, that would be an example of
        misconduct in a public duty . . . but I would not be prepared to say that
        it would be misconduct for this purpose for a registrar to make a
        decision which did affect his personal interests, merely because he
        knew that his interests were so involved, if the decision was made
        honestly and in a genuine belief that it was a proper exercise of his juris­
        diction."6

 (2) Knowing invalidity. The second alternative way that a police officer
can "abuse" his office is by doing something which he knows he has no
power to do. Thus the unlawfulness of his actions is a necessary precondi­
tion to liability. Under this second alternative motive is entirely irrelevant.
He may act out of the best of motives but, if he knows that he has no power
to act in that way then he will be liable in tort for damage caused.7 It is clear
that "actual knowledge" of invalidity is necessary. "Constructive knowl­
edge" will not be enough.
   The most famous of all recent misfeasance cases was under this second
head. It concerned an order given by the prime minister and attorney-
general of Quebec to a liquor licensing authority. He ordered the cancel­
lation of the plaintiff's restaurant licence because the plaintiff had stood
bail for various Jehovah's Witnesses w ho were at that time responsible for
serious public order problems in Quebec. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court
of Canada found that the defendant had abused his office and awarded the
plaintiff damages of $33,123.®
   An important example is the case of Farrington v. Thom son et) Bridg-
la n d .9 The plaintiff was the licensee of a hotel which the police ordered him
to close down because they believed his licence to be forfeit. It was estab­
lished that the police, in giving such orders were "intentionally purporting
to exercise a power to give binding orders to the plaintiff which they were
fully aware, at the time, that they did not possess."10 It was held that this
was sufficient to found a misfeasance action. Smith J. also decided that the
fact that the plaintiff had obeyed the order was not sufficient to make the
resultant damage too remote.11


Applicability to police cases

   The tort of misfeasance in public office is, it is submitted, a well-estab-
lished cause of action which is plainly applicable to the police. In many
situations it will overlap with established torts. Thus if a police officer
arrests a plaintiff knowing that he has, in fact, no power to do so he will be
liable in false imprisonment as well as misfeasance. Given the fact that the
burden of justifying false imprisonment is on the police the former would
obviously be the simplest cause of action to pursue.

   Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which misfeasance may be the
only available cause of action. Thus if a constable makes a lawful arrest
with a malicious motive an action in false imprisonment will not be avail­
able but there w ill be a cause of action in misfeasance. To take another
example, if the police give a person orders which they know they have no
power to give and the person obeys and as a result suffers loss then there
will be no action in trespass. There will, however, be an action in misfea­
sance as Farrington’s case illustrates.
  It would seem that if a police officer brings a prosecution against someone
with a malicious motive but with reasonable and probable cause then, if the
prosecution terminates in that person's favour, an action for misfeasance
will lie.
  If a person is caused damage by a police policy decision which is known to
be ultra vires then damages can be recovered in misfeasance. If a policeman
knowingly or maliciously neglects to carry out his duties then an action
may be brought. In R. v. D y th a m ,11 the police constable was accused of
"wilfully omitting to take any steps to preserve the Queen's peace or to pro­
tect the person" of a man he saw being attacked. The man died and the con­
stable was convicted of the offence of wilful neglect of his duty. It is
submitted that the deceased's estate could have recovered damages in m is­
feasance.

BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY
3. BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY

Introduction

  The police have a large number of specific statutory duties under legis­
lation such as the Police Act 1964 and the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984. It has been held that the general duties of the police as constables
are now “statutory duties."90
  In line with general tort principles it is possible that a breach of some of
these duties may give rise to an action in damages for "breach of statutory
duty." In particular, such an action may be the only possible remedy for a
lawfully arrested and detained suspect who is denied his rights under Part
IV of the 1984 A ct.91

 The right of action


    An action for breach of statutory duty will only lie if the statute is one
 which in fact confers a right of action for damages. This is, fundamentally, a
 question of policy: should the breach of a particular statutory provision be
 compensated in damages’ The court must consider whether or not the stat­
 ute in question intended to give a right of action in tort.92 There are "indica­
 tions which point with more or less force to the one answer or the other."93
    The first "indication" is whether there is, in the statute, an alternative
method of enforcing compliance or penalising non-compliance.94 The
absence of any other sanction creates a presumption that there is an action
for breach of the statute.95
   The second "indication" is whether or not the duty is imposed for the
benefit of a particular class of persons.96 If the duty was imposed to benefit a
particular class an action is more likely to lie.
   The third "indication" which may point to the absence of a right of action
is a lack of precision in the definition of the statutory right which it is
sought to enforce.97
   When a statute casts duties on a public authority such as the police, diffi­
cult questions arise as to which of the duties are "public law" ones and
which give rise to "private rights." A distinction has been drawn between
"decision-making" functions, which are a matter of public law, and "execu­
tive" functions which may give rise to private law rights and obligations.98
If the public authority makes an "unlawful" decision—because the proper
procedures were not followed, because an incorrect view of the law was
applied or for general W e d n e sb u ry reasons99 this must be challenged by the
"judicial review" procedure. N o action for breach of statutory duty can
arise. Once the decision has been made, however, private law rights do arise
and may be enforced by an action for breach of statutory duty—provided
that, on a true construction of the statute, such an action is available. The
precise limits of this distinction remain to be worked out. The mere fact
that "public law ” questions arise concurrently to a "private law" right of
action will not prevent a plaintiff from bringing an action for breach of
statutory duty."3

The elements of the tort

   Even if it can be established that the statute is one which confers a right
of action, three other things must be established in order for a plaintiff to be
entitled to recover damages for breach of statutory duty:

(1) The duty m ust be owed to the plaintiff.1There is unlikely to be any
difficulty in cases brought by suspects for breaches of duty under the Police
and Criminal and Evidence Act 1984. This requirement may, however,
cause considerable problems if a plaintiff seeks to base an action upon
general duties cast upon the police by statutes such as the Police Act 1964.

(2) The defendant m ust be in breach of the statutory duty. This a
question of fact and, of course, depends on the precise wording of the rel­
evant statutory provisions. The burden of proof will be on the plaintiff.

(3) The harm m ust be of the kind that the statute was designed to
prevent.1 Difficulties under this head are unlikely to arise in actions for
breach of statutory duty under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
as the statute is designed to prevent damage of all kinds to people who are
suspected of offences.
   Although an action for breach of statutory duty is an action on the case3 it
is not always necessary to prove damage as part of the cause of action.
Whether or not damage is a necessary ingredient of the cause of action has
been said to depend on the construction of the statute involved. Thus:
     "Where, from its context, it is clear that the statute created alright in
     the plaintiff so absolute in its content that the plaintiff was to be pro­
     tected against violation, even though it caused no damage, then the tort
     is actionable per se. "4
The following rights have been held to give rise to a breach actionable per
se: the statutory right to vote,3 the right to receive a statement of how
wages were made up,6 a person's right to have his suitability for a living as a
minister of religion determined.7 A person's rights under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 should be actionable per se as the interests
protected by the statute—interests in receiving information and assistance
while under police investigation—do not usually generate "special damage"
if they are violated. As Street says:
     "The courts are most likely to interpret in this manner a statute which
     protects an interest of the plaintiff other than his interest in his person
     or his goods."8

Applicability to police cases

   The availability of this cause of action to police cases depends on the par­
ticular statutory provision which is being relied upon. The Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 gives rise to a number of rights to information
and assistance. N o remedies for breach of these provisions is provided by
the statute. It should be noted that by section 67( 10) it is expressly provided
that a failure to comply with any provisions of the Codes of Practice issued
under section 66 "shall not of itself render him liable to any . . . civil pro­
ceedings." The only liability that this section can be seeking to exclude is
that for breach of statutory duty. It is significant that the statute does not
seek to exclude liability for breach of the provisions of the Act itself, as
opposed to the Codes. So, an action for breach of statutory duty must then
lie if the police fail to comply with the "information and assistance" pro­
visions of the 1984 Act. The following sections would appear to give rise to
potential actions:

(1) Section 56: Right to have someone informed when arrested. This
section provides that:
      "Where a person has been arrested and is being held in custody in a
      police station or other premises, he shall be entitled, if he so requests,
      to have one friend or relative or other person who is know n to him or
      who is likely to take an interest in his welfare told, as soon as is practi­
      cable except to the extent that delay is permitted by this section, that
      he has been arrested and is being detained there."9
The section permits delay only in the case of serious arrestable offences10 if
it is authorised by an officer of at least the rank of superintendent.11 Delay
may only be authorised where there are reasonable grounds for believing
that12 telling the named person of the arrest:
      "(a) will lead to interference with or harm to evidence connected with a
      serious arrestable offence or interference with or physical injury to
      other persons; or
      (b) will lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having com­
      mitted such an offence but not yet arrested for it, or
      (c) will hinder the recovery of any property obtained as a result of such
      an offence."13
If a delay is authorised the detained person must be told the reason for it and
the reason should be noted on his custody record as soon as is practicable.14
Once the reason for authorising delay ceases to exist there may be no
further delay in permitting the exercise of the right.15 Similar consider­
ations apply to the duty to inform the "person responsible for the welfare"
of a child or a young person that he is in police detention under section 57.

13 s .56(5).
14 s .56(6) a n d (7).
15 s .56(9).
 (2) Section       58:   Access to legal advice. This section provides that:
       "(1) A person arrested and held in custody in a police station or other
       premises shall be entitled, if he so requests, to consult a solicitor
       privately at any time . . .
       (4) If a person makes such a request, he must be permitted to consult a
       solicitor as soon as is practicable except to the extent that delay is per­
       mitted by this section."
The section permits delay only where the person is in detention for a
serious arrestable offence and the delay is authorised by an officer of at least
the rank of superintendent.16 Such delay may only be authorised where the
officer has reasonable grounds for believing17 that the exercise of the right at
the time the person desires to exercise it:
      "(a) will lead to interference with or harm to evidence connected with a
      serious arrestable offence or interference with or physical injury to
      other persons; or
      (b) will lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having com­
      mitted such an offence but not yet arrested for it; or
      (c) will hinder the recovery of any property obtained as a result of such
      an offence."
If a delay is authorised the detained person must be told the reason for it and
the reason must be noted on his custody record.18 Special provisions apply
to persons detained under the terrorism provisions.19 It is difficult to see
how, in the large majority of cases, a private consultation with a solicitor
could lead to the results which would justify the delay.

(3) Section 21: Rights to access and copies. The section gives the per­
son who had custody or control of something seized by the police the right
to apply for access to it20 or the right to obtain photographs or copies.21 This
right is subject to a number of statutory limitations.22
   The "indications" point towards there being a right of action against the
police for breach of the provisions of all these sections. The only remedy
provided by the A c t for breach is disciplinary action against the officers
involved. This does not give any right to damages to the person deprived of
his statutory entitlement. The sections are designed to protect specific
classes of people, namely, those in police custody or whose property has
been seized. Finally, the duties under all the sections are defined with preci­
sion. It is further submitted that breaches of sections 5 6 , 5 7 or 5 8 will be
actionable per se.23
   It would follow that a detainedpersonwho wasdenied his rights under
section 5 6 or section 5 8 will have rights of action against the police for
breach of statutory duty. His damages for this breach would be "at large"24

and he would also have a potential claim for aggravated and exemplary
damages. Furthermore, any “reasonably foreseeable" special damages could
also be recovered. A person who was denied access to property held by the
police or copies of documents would also have a right of action for breach of
statutory duty under section 31.
  In an unreported case23 two firms of solicitors applied for injunctions to
restrain the police from breaching their statutory duty in refusing to allow
them access to clients held'in police custody. Rose J. refused the application
saying:
    “I am not persuaded that I have jurisdiction. Assuming I did have juris­
    diction were I to make the Order sought it would be unreasonable, a
    hindrance to police inquiries may be caused."
It is submitted that there was, in fact, no jurisdiction to make the order as
the proper plaintiffs were not the solicitors but the prisoners who, in the
nature of the case, could not give instructions to make the application. The
prisoner would, however, have an action for damages after his release. It is
further submitted that in such a situation the solicitors would have locus to
apply for an order of mandamus to compel the police to discharge their
statutory duties under section 58.26

                                      §16.1.            KILLING IN HOMICIDE

The  common law definition of murder, and similarly that of manslaughter,
requires that the defendant should have “killed" his victim, and that the
death should follow within a year and a day (§ 11.1).
  A ’‘killing” can take place bv any means. There need be no direct
physical act. If the victim asks his way on a dark night, and the defendant,
intending to cause his death, directs him to a path that he knows will bring
him to the cliff edge, and the victim suffers a fatal fall, this is clearly
murder, though the defendant has done nothing more than utter words. So
we may say that "killing" means conduct causing death in any way that the
law regards as sufficient.1 What these ways are has to be considered.

What o f accelerating the victim ’s death?
  This is a "killing” in law. Since we are all fated to die at some time, every
instance of killing is an instance of accelerating death: and even if death is
hastened by as little as five minutes it is still a criminal homicide. So it is
no defence to a person who stabs another to death to show that the victim
was already dangerously ill.2 All the same, as we shall see. there are some
cases where the courts will ignore minimal causation ( § .5).

W hy require that the death must follow within a year and a day?
   In origin the rule was perhaps dictated by the desire to limit difficult
problems of causation.3 The CLRC proposed the continuation of the rule
on the ground that it would be wrong for a person to remain at risk of a
charge of homicide for a long time.4 He may have been convicted and
sentenced for causing serious injury: if the victim then dies from the injury,
it would be undesirable to have a fresh trial for murder.

Do problems of causation arise only in homicide cases?
  These are the most important in practice, but a causal question is
capable of arising in other offences, particularly those against the person

or property. For example, the offence under section 18 of the Offences
acainst the Person Act is of causing grievous bodily harm. The wording of
sections 20 and 47 is different: the one speaks of inflicting grievous bodily
harm and the other of occasioning actual bodily harm, but these verbs,
also, imply a requirement of causation.
   Similarly, the offences under the Criminal Damage Act 1971 imply that
the act of the defendant has caused the damage.
  The notion of causation may also appear in general penal legislation,
where the context may give the word a special meaning. ''Causing"
something to be done sometimes bears the narrow meaning of giving an
order or direction to do it.3



                                         § 16.2.             BUT-FOR CAUSATION
An important distinction must be taken. The question of causation, as it is
generally used in the law. involves both a problem of causation sine qua
non. and a problem of imputability.1
  A convenient English equivalent of the term causation sine qua non is
but-for causation (properly speaking, but-for . . . not causation). For a
factor to be a but-for cause, one must be able to say that but for the
occurrence of the antecedent factor the event would not have happened.
Surely the notion of but-for causation is ridiculously wide, because it takes
us back to Adam and Eve. The criminaPs mother is a but-for cause of his
crimes, and so is his grandm other, and all his ancestors to infinity.
   That is perfectly true, but two factors limit the judicial enquiry. First,
one starts with the defendant who is charged; his mother does not come
into it, much less Adam and Eve. Secondly, but-for causation is only half
the story; the defendant who was the but-for cause of the harm is not
responsible unless his conduct was also the imputable cause. We still have
to deal with imputable causation.
Is the notion of but-for cause a useful one? Where the cause is a positive act,
isn’t it too obvious to be worth stating? If D shoots V and V drops down
dead, surely you d o n ’t have to prove that the bullet entering V ’s heart
caused him to die?
  When but-for causation is obvious (as it usually is), it is not discussed.
Certainly the answer to your last question is in the negative. But
occasionally an issue of this kind may require expert assistance.
       D may administer poison to V, who may die shortly afterwards, yet an
       autopsy may reveal that V died not of the poison but of heart disease.
       There will then be medical evidence at D ’s trial to the effect that the
       poison did not cause the death, meaning that V would in any case have
       died at the time and in the way he did, and that the poison did not play
       any contributory part. If the jury believe this evidence, or, rather, if

           they are not sure that it is untrue, they must acquit of murder—though
           D may. of course, be convicted of the attempt.
   We may summarise, then, by saying that but-for causation is of legal
interest only in the comparatively rare cases where, notwithstanding
appearances, it is absent; that when it is alleged to be absent, this raises a
question of fact for the jury, who may decide by ordinary experience but
may have to be assisted by expert evidence; and that the burden is on the
Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant’s act (or
omission) was a but-for cause.2
   T h e last point occasions some difficulty in respect of expert evidence, because an expert
may not be willing to commit himself to more than the statement that the result would
''p r o b a b ly ” not have h appe ned as it did apart from the defendant's act or omission.
Notw ithstanding tha t the expert will not commit himself to more, the jury (somewhat
strangely) are entitled to draw a sure inference of causation from the evidence.3 Nevertheless,
they should be reminded that they themselves must be sure; and the hesitation or reserve of
the expert should surely be a factor leading the appeal court to scrutinise a conviction with
care.

The courts assume in m anslaughter cases like Stone (§ 12.3) that an
om ission can be a cause. But surely a non-event cannot be a but-for cause
of an event.
  Whatever the philosophical view may be, the courts certainly assume,
and must assume, that an omission can be a cause (just as lack of oxygen
or food is commonly regarded as a cause of death).4 (However, a court
can, and should, say that a reference to causation in a statute does not
cover omissions, in the absence of express words or necessary implication:
§ 7.3 n. 10). That is not a rule of causation but a question of the legal
import of words.
  The application of the usual burden of proof to the issue of causation is
of considerable importance in cases of omission, and sometimes gives the
court the opportunity of arriving at a merciful conclusion.5 On any charge
involving causation by omission it behoves the defence to go into the
evidence of causation most carefully.

W hat about two but-for causes contributed by different defendants? D oesn’t
your definition imply the paradox that if two persons independently cause
an event, neither causes it?

  To provide for this, an exception for cases of multiple causation has to
be inserted into the definition. It is possible for two sufficient causes, Cl
and C2, to be present together, so that E follows both, when usually it

the particular situation one or other (as the case may be) was not necessary
to be present. An example is where two fatal wounds are given
independently at the same time. See more in § .9.

Suppose that D l’s shot entered the lung and would have caused the victim’s
death in an hour, but D2’s entered the heart and killed him instantaneously?
  Then, of course, only D2 has killed him. D1 is guilty of an attempt.
  The but-for cause is sometimes referred to as the factual cause, or the de
facio cause, or the scientific cause. The important thing is to distinguish it
from cause in another sense, the “imputable-’ (or “legal” or “effective” or
"direct” or “proximate”) cause, to which we now turn.




                                 § 16.3.          IMPUTABLE CAUSATION

When causation is in issue, the defendant’s act (or omission) must be
shown to be not only a but-for cause but also an imputable or legal cause
of the consequence. Imputable causes are some of the but-for causes. In
other words, the defendant’s act, being a but-for cause, must be sufficiently
closely connected with the consequence to involve him in responsibility.
The lawyer is interested in the causal parentage of events, not in their
causal ancestry. The Model Penal Code expresses the principle by stating
that a person is not criminally responsible for a result if it is “too remote
and accidental in its occurrence to have a just bearing on the actor's
liability or on the gravity of his offence.”1
   Several a t te m p ts have b e e n m a d e to find a su itab le n am e for this s e c o n d n o ti o n o f cause.

 What are the principles governing imputable causation?
   Hitherto the judges have made little progress in establishing such
principles. Generally, of course, no problem arises. Where causation is
obvious, the judge may give no direction upon it. even in a homicide case,
and even though the burden of proof of causation is supposed to rest on
the prosecution. “In homicide cases.” said Robert Goff LJ, “it is rarely
necessary to give the jury any direction on causation as such.”4 Even when
a direction is given, it is usually in very general terms, without so much as
distinguishing between factual and legal causation. The judge will use one
of the adjectives already mentioned, telling the jury that the defendant’s
act must have been the “efficient” or “direct” or “proximate” or
“substantial” cause of the result, or something beyond a trivial cause, or
that the result must not have been too "remote” Or he may tell them that
in law the defendant’s act need not be the sole cause, or even the main
cause, of the result, it being enough that the act contributed “significantly”
to that result.' This is good enough if the defendant's act was clearly an
imputable cause, and it may be good enough in cases where no precise rule
can be formulated. It is unsatisfactory in some of the cases to be discussed
in this chapter, where the proper result may seem doubtful to the layman
and a vague direction may produce discordant verdicts w'hich could have
been avoided if more specific guidance had been given.
   The direction to the jury should distinguish, where necessary, between
the two kinds of causation, and the jury should be informed with some
precision of any rules of law that are involved. If the issue is one of but-for
causation, it should be enough to ask the jury whether the defendant’s act
(or omission) was a cause of what happened, explaining that this means:
would the event have happened in any case? There is no need to talk about
“substantiality.-’6 But if the issue is whether the alleged cause was an
imputable cause, and if the proper view is that for some specific reason the
alleged cause was not or may not have been an imputable cause in law, it
should be a misdirection to instruct the jury no more fully than this.7

   Similarly,  if th e proper legal v iew is that the d efe n d a n t's act was a cau se
  in law. the ju d g e sh ould be en titled to tell th e jury so.
     This was the practice during the 19th century. Courts would robustly tell
  the jury whether or not the defendant was responsible for the conse­
  quences on given facts. There are now indications that the judges will again
  do this, if the facts are sufficiently strong.
            In Pagett8 the defendant was a gunman who shot at armed police,
            using a girl as a shield. The police returned his fire in self-defence, and
            accidentally killed the girl. Pagett, charged with the murder of the girl,
            was acquitted by the jury of murder but convicted of manslaughter,9
            and his appeal against conviction was dismissed.

    The case will be discussed later as an application of the principles of
 causation. At present we are concerned with it only as an instance of the
 judge's function. On the question of causation the trial judge had directed
 the jury that it was for him to decide as a matter of law whether the
 defendant caused the death. On this the Court of Appeal commented: "‘No
 legitimate criticism can be made of the judge's direction. Strictly speaking
 it was for him to direct the jury on the applicable principles of law, reaving
 it for them to decide as a question of fact, on those applicable principles,
 whether the necessary causal link had been established. In practical terms
 that was precisely what the judge did.'’
    The first of these sentences seems to deny criticism of the judge, while
 the second sentence seems to express some faint criticism. Perhaps the
 court means that it is best for the judge not to say frankly that the causation
 question is for him, but that all the same he may instruct the jury in such
 terms that where the facts are clear they have no causation issue to decide.
 There is no virtue in such hair-splitting.
    The theoretical problem may be clarified if we distinguish between cases
 where there is and is not a relevant rule of law on the subject of imputable
causation. If no satisfactory rule can be formulated, and it is a matter of
  "gut reaction,” the proper verdict on the point being subject to legitimate
doubt, the jury can be told that they must decide whether in fairness the
result should be attributed to the defendant. (The direction is
unnnecessary if it obviously is imputable to him.) If a rule can be
formulated, which ought to govern all similar situations (which was the
case in Pagett ), the judge should be entitled to announce it firmly to the
jury, and where necessary to exclude irrelevant evidence.
   The last proposition is supported by another recent case, M a lc h e re k ,10
where the control of the trial judge was emphasised.

          was convicted. On appeal the defence sought to introduce evidence to
          suggest that the doctor had switched the machine off prematurely, but
          the court refused to hear the evidence. In such circumstances, the
          court declared, where a doctor decides "that the patient is for practical
          purposes dead,"’ and switches off. this does not in law prevent the
          assailant from being responsible.

   Granted, then, that rules of imputable causation are rules of law, we
must consider what these rules are. Subject to what is to be said in § .9 as
to the new intervening act, no problem generally arises when the defendant
has intentionally produced the consequence.11 The chief difficulties relate
to unintended consequences. It may be suggested that five rules are
supported either by authority or by common sense:

—       the rule that negligence must be relevant (§ .4);
—       the minimal causation principle (§ .5);
—       the ordinary hazard principle (§ .7);
—       the reasonable foresigh.t principle (§ .8); and
—       the principle of the new intervening act (§ .9).



                            § 16.4.            CAUSATION AND NEGLIGENCE

Where negligence (or recklessness) is in issue, a limiting rule straddles the
divide between but-for and imputable causation. The rule is that the
negligence proved against the defendant must be negligence in a relevant
respect. The case must be such that the accident would not have happened
if he had not been negligent. In other words, the defendant is not liable for
an event that is not causally connected with the feature of his conduct that
was negligent. The rule has some applicaton to manslaughter and causing
death by reckless driving.
         An illustration in the reports is D a l l o w a y } The driver of a horse and
         cart let the reins lie loose on the horse's back. This was of course a
         negligent way of driving. A child ran across the road, and was knocked
         down and killed. Erie J directed the jury that if the driver by using the
         reins could have saved the child he was guilty of manslaughter but
         that if they thought he could not have saved the child by pulling the
         reins they must acquit him.
            In other words, the question was this. Assuming that the defendant
         had been driving carefully, holding the reins, would the death have
         occurred? A defendant is not guilty of causing a death by negligence
         if the victim ran out at a moment when no one—not even a person
         who had been behaving carefully throughout—could have pulled up.

                   § 16.5.            THE DEFENCE OF M IN IM A L CAUSATION
Of the assorted adjectives mentioned in § .3, "substantial'' currently finds
the greatest favour: and if this word is used in instructing the jury a
conviction is pretty safe from being upset on appeal. However, the Court
of Appeal regards it as being too favourable to the defendant.1 The
preferred direction is to tell the jury that they can convict the defendant if
his conduct (for example, his reckless driving) was “a cause” of the death,
being something more than a purely trivial cause (a de m inim is
contribution, as it is ungrammatically termed). The reference to "a cause'’
is presumably to but-for causation, while the reference to minimal
contribution seems to express the idea that imputable causation is lacking.
This direction at least gives the jury some pointer to the fact that they are
entitled to use common sense (or moral instinct) on questions of causation.
   It may have been a notion of minimal causation that was in the mind of
Devlin J in A d a m s .2 As we have seen (§ .1), the acceleration of death is
supposed to be enough for criminal liability, so that the defendant is not
normally allowed to say that the victim would in any event have died
before long. But in A d a m s Devlin J directed the jury that when health
cannot be restored a doctor “is still entitled to do all that is proper and
necessary to relieve pain and suffering even if measures he takes may
incidentally shorten life.” The passage as a whole seems to imply the view
that what the doctor does by way of approved medical practice is not a
cause in law. It plays such a minor part in causing the death that it can be
excluded from consideration. A more satisfactory reason would be the
doctrine of necessity, at which Devlin J perhaps glanced in his use of the
word “necessary.”3 But we may applaud his attitude without enquiring too
closely into its legal basis.



                                       § 16.6.             THE UNEXPECTED TWIST
Most problems of causation relate to what may be called the unexpected
twist, which is to occupy the rest of this chapter. Subject to what is to be
said later, an unexpected twist in the 'outcome of conduct does not

necessarily put the end result outside the mental element, or mean that the
conduct is not the imputable cause of the result.
          For example, D attacks V intending to stab him in the arm. but V
          jumps back, falls and cracks his head. Assuming that both the harm
          intended and that suffered are grievous bodily harm, there is no
          difficulty from the point of view either of m ens rea or of causation in
          convicting D of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, under
          section 18 of the OAPA. The legal category is “grievous bodily
          harm.” and it does not matter that Ithe defendant intended one form
          and did another.1
   Such facts are very similar to transferred intention, except that here the
intention takes effect upon the person intended, and the only variation is
in respect of the way in which it takes effect or in respect of the precise
description of the injury. The unexpected twist principle does not supplant
the primary requirement of a mental element for the particular crime. In
a crime of intention, the ultimate result must be as intended by the
defendant2; but the mode by which the intended result occurred need not
have been intended/

                      § 16.7.           THE ORDINARY HAZARD PRINCIPLE

This is a narrow principle and has not come before the English courts, but
it seems obvious. ,
         D attacks V intending to stab him to death; V runs away, and in his
         fight is struck by lightning and dies. One would say that D is not guilty
         of murder, though he is guilty of attempted murder. Why is he not
         guilty of murder? Because it was not he that killed V, but the
         lightning? But if V had jumped over a cliff or into a river in an effort
         to escape, or to commit suicide in despair, or had accidentally fallen
         over the cliff or into the river in his flight, D would have been
         accountable for the death, and we should not have said that it was not
         D who killed V but the water or the hard ground. What is it that
         makes us feel that the lightning is different?

   The most obvious answer is that being struck by lightning is an ordinary
risk of life that people do not seek to avoid. One is no more subject to
being struck by lightning when one is running away from an attacker than
when one is taking a walk. The attacker has not substantially increased the
victim’s risk.
   A n o t h e r e x a m p le o f t h e o r d i n a r y h a z a rd principle is w h ere the victim o f an a t ta c k die s in
a traffic a cciden t w h en he is b e in g c o n v e y e d by a m b u la n c e to h o sp ital, o r dies as a re sult of

by his w e a k c o n d i tio n , th e a t t a c k e r is n o t guilty of it, b ecause t h e effect of th e a tta c k was
merely to pla ce th e victim in a geographical p o sition w h ere a n o t h e r agency p r o d u c e d his
d eath . T h e a tta c k d id n o t substantially inc rease th e risk of the fatal result, b e c a u s e a n y o n e
may die in a traffic accident o r e p i d e m i c .1 O f c o u r s e , a re a s o n a b le m a n mulling o v e r all the
possible c o n s e q u e n c e s o f an a t ta c k might th ink o f th e s e possibilities: b u t th e y w o u ld n o t be
possibilities r e n d e r e d a n y m o r e likely by th e fact o f th e attack. E v e n if it c o u ld be sh o w n th a t
there w>as slightly m o r e risk o f d yin g o f fever in h o spital th an e l s e w h e r e ( p e r h a p s b e c a u s e of
the p res en ce in h o spital o f re sistant b a c t e r ia ) , this would p r o b a b l y b e a c c o u n t e d to o
insignifcant to affect the decision.
  C o n tra s t th e case w h e re the victim died o f h o spital fever, but a c o n t r ib u t o r y fa c to r was the
w eak ness ca u se d b v his in ju ries, so th a t h e w’o u ld n o t have died if it h a d n o t b e e n for his
w eakness. P r o b a b l y the a t ta c k e r w ould th en b e guilty of crim inal h o m icid e ( m u r d e r or
m a n sla u g h te r), for o n th ese facts th e r e is a m e d ic a l ( a n d not m e re ly a fo r tu ito u s) c o n n e c t io n

causing d e a t h , w h e r e the w o u n d in g is clearly th e cau se o f d eath.

  In the absence of English authority, the ordinary hazard principle is a
matter of theoretical speculation. In most but not all applications it can be
regarded as a particular application of a test of reasonable foresight, on
which decided cases can be found.

                   § 16.8.               THE REASONABLE FORESIGHT PRINCIPLE

 To say that a consequence, to be imputed to the defendant, must be within
 the risk that would be apprehended by a reasonable man is much wider
 than the ordinary hazard principle. Under the name of the “risk principle”
 it has been discussed by writers on the tort of negligence, and it also makes
 an appearance in the criminal case of R o b e rts .1
            Roberts was driving a girl from a party, and. according to the view of
            the facts that (in the opinion of the Court of Appeal) the jury must
            have taken, he pestered her with advances, held her coat and told her
            that he had beaten up girls w'ho had refused him. She jumped out of
            the moving car and suffered injury. The chairman of Sessions directed
            the jury that on these facts Roberts would be guilty of an assault
            occasioning actual bodily harm under OAPA s.47. He was convicted,
            and the conviction was affirmed on appeal. The court said: ‘‘The test
            is: Was it [the injury] the natural result of what the alleged assailant
            said and did, in the sense that it was something that could reasonablv
            have been foreseen as the consequence of what he was saying or
            doing?”2

   In previous cases of similar typeJ the test laid down had generally been
whether the victim acted reasonably in his endeavour to escape. R oberts
widens the area of liability and also puts it on a more intelligible footing.
Whether it is prudent for a woman to jump from a rapidly moving car to
avoid rape is a question on which opinions may differ, but at any rate it is
fully understandable, and the possibility of it could well have been foreseen
by the attacker.

  An event m a y be re a s o n a b ly fo reseeab le as p a r t o f a g e n e ric risk, ev en t h o u g h it is
improbable in its details. This o b serv atio n is illustrated by an o ld a n o n y m o u s case, generally
known as the h a rlo t's case ( 1560)6.

      " A h arlo t w o m a n was d eliv ered o f a child. She iaid it a w ay , alive, in a n o rc h a r d ; an d

Doesn’t the risk principle, as applied to crimes requiring intention,
contradict that requirement?
  The objection overlooks the fact that rules of causation cannot make the
defendant guilty of a crime of intention unless he intended the event
specified in the law (such as the death of a human being). All that the rules
do is to settle the question of liability where the event occurs in an
unexpected way. The foreseeability rule is a limitation upon the general
principle relating to the unexpected twist.

How does the rule in manslaughter excluding the victim’s special sensitivity
from consideration square with the risk principle?
  The special sensitivity rule is an exception from the risk principle, but it
can be justified on special grounds.
    T h e s e special g ro u n d s start fr om the o b se r v a ti o n th a t th e risk princip le d o e s not o p e r a t e
to negativ e liability if the e v e n t h a p p e n e d precisely as the d e f e n d a n t in t e n d e d . Su p p o se that

of ra n g e : b u t he h o p e d to hit the victim a n d by s o m e freak did so. T h e d e f e n d a n t is clearly
re s p o n sib le for hitting th e victim. Q u e s ti o n s o f f o reseeab le risk arise o n ly w h e n th e re is s om e
slight shift fro m the ev en ts th a t the d e f e n d a n t in te n d e d .

to th e case ju s t put o f the victim being o u t o f n o rm a l range o f the w e a p o n . H o w e v e r , it is not

Does the risk principle apply to the doctrine of transferred intention?
  Apparently not. No case decides that it does, and one suggests that it
does not.8 It may be thought that in G o re (§11.5 n. 1) the defendant could
not reasonably have foreseen that the apothecary would be poisoned, yet
her intention was transferred.



                                 § 16.9.         NEW INTERVENING ACT
An extreme view of criminal responsibility might be that a man is under
a duty to act in such a way that others are not led to cause harm, so that
in some circumstances he would be responsible for harm that is
directly caused by others, even though without his authorisation or
encouragement. This does not represent the criminal law. The legal
attitude is that a man is primarily responsible only for what he himself does
or incites. The fact that his own wrongful conduct provided the background
for some consequential wrong act by another, and that he should have
foreseen this act, does not make him responsible for it.

 fo resees that D l will d o the killing, so th a t th e r e q u i r e m e n t o f fo reseeability is satisfied: but
 still D 2 is not a p e r p e t r a t o r o f the crim e.

      A l t h o u g h a n o v u s actus rule is reco gnised in th e law o f tort, it differs fro m the c rim inal rule
 in th a t if A in stigates B to c o m m i t a to r t, b o th A a n d B are r e g a r d e d as causing th e re sult as

 c rim in al law does.

    The n ovu s actus principle is so potent that it can even rescue a defendant
 from strict liability.
           In Im press (Worcester) L td. v. R ees 9 the appellant company's fuel
           store leaked oil into the Severn, after an unknown person had
           tampered with the valve. Normally (it was assumed) the leak would
           have been an offence of strict liability,10 but the Divisional Court held
           that the company was not liable, because the intervening act of the
           stranger was an “intervening cause of so powerful a nature that the
           conduct of the appellants was not a cause at all but was merelv part
           of the surrounding circumstances.”
   The pollution of the river was, of course, factually caused in part by the
circumstance that the company had accumulated fuel near the river. But
this was merely the background of the matter; in law, the only operative
cause was the act of the mischief-maker. The distinction is between
something operating directly to produce the result and something
operating only indirectly through the wrongful intervener.
   The n ovu s actus principle was expressly recognised, for the law of

                     §16.10.              THE NON-RESPONSIBLE INTERVENER
We have seen, in discussing the subject of complicity, that if D incites an
innocent agent to commit a criminal act, and the innocent agent does so.
D is regarded as perpetrating the crime. Put in terms of causation, the rule
is that if D has done the last act that he intended to do (instructing the
innocent agent), he causes the result notwithstanding that the immediate
cause was the act of another (the innocent agent), if there was no
subsequent criminal volition of another. This principle is wider than the
simple doctrine of innocent agency, as M ichael 1shows.
          Michael, a single woman, had an illegitimate baby boy a few months
          old whom she boarded out with a foster-mother. Intending to murder
          the infant she bought a bottle of laudanum, told the foster-mother that
          it was medicine, and directed her to give the infant a teaspoonful every
          night. The woman gave none, but put the bottle on the mantelpiece.

         where a few days later her own small boy, aged about 5. being left
         alone with the infant, took the bottle down and administered half its
         contents to the infant, who died. Michael was convicted of murder,
         and the conviction was affirmed by the Court for Crown Cases
         Reserved.
   No clear reason was given by the court for holding Michael responsible,
but we may rationalise as follows. Michael intended to poison her baby
with laudanum administered bv the hand of another, and this verv thing
                                                       «■                                                  o

happened. The fact that she intended the killing process to be spun out was
immaterial. (The trial judge in directing the jury assumed that it was
necessary for the prosecution to show that a single teaspoonful of the
liquid— the dose directed by Michael—was enough to kill the baby; but
nowadays this would be regarded as too lenient a direction. Even if the
dose of a teaspoonful each night would have killed only by reason of having
a cumulative effect, the variation whereby half the bottle was administered
at once would have been immaterial.)
   The more striking deviation from Michael's plan was the intervention of
a different, and unforeseen, ‘actor. The small boy was innocent, being
under the age of criminal responsibility, and Michael was responsible for
the result that he helped to bring about, even though he was not Michael’s
intended tool. Michael had done the last act that she intended to do. and
there was no affront to the sense of justice in saying that the variation in
the chain of causation was immaterial.
    T h e negative rules we are now stu dying are c u m u la tiv e in effect. It is n o t en o u g h to show

T h is ty p e of p ro b le m w as discussed in §.6.

   Two decisions mentioned previously provide further examples of the
non-responsible intervener: M alch erek2 and P a g e tt .J The judgment in the
latter case proceeds on the basis that the police were acting in self-defence,
but the more obvious justification was that they were entitled to kill if
necessary in the course of trying to make an arrest or to prevent violent
crime or the escape of a violent offender. On any view the police were
acting under the pressure caused by the defendant, and so were not
exercising the unfettered volition presupposed by the novus actus rule.
             § 16.12.            CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF VICTIM

The principle is that the victim's contributory negligence is no answer to a
charge of crime.1In other words, it is generally no defence that the victim
laid himself open to the act, or was himself guilty of negligence bringing it
about.
   This rule can have strange results. Suppose there are two burglars
engaged together in blowing a safe in a grossly negligent way. If one is
killed the other is presumably guilty of manslaughter, even though the
victim participated throughout in the act of negligence. It can be argued
that there should be a defence of negligent joint enterprise, but the courts
have not hitherto recognised it.

(2) Involuntary manslaughter
   T his is unlawful killing without intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm: R.
v. Taylor (1834) 2 Lew. 215 and see Stephen Dig.Cr.L. 9th ed. p. 221. Apart from
the intent required the elements o f the offence are the sam e as in murder (see
§§ 2 0 - 3 — 20 -13, and §§ 2 0 -1 5 — 20 -2 7, ante). T he rules as to causation,0 time
limit o f a year and a day, self defence etc., therefore apply though it must be
remembered that provocation and dim inished responsibility only apply to murder
and so as to reduce that crime to manslaughter.

   T h e difficulty is to identify the elements w hich m ay make the killing unlawful:
see Andrews v. D .P .P . (1937) 26 C r.A pp.R . 34 per Lord Atkin. T he law has gone
through a process o f developm ent. It was formerly held that there was a doctrine
o f constructive m anslaughter whereby death resulting from any unlawful act,
whether intrinsically likely to injure or not, was manslaughter, but this has long
ceased to be the law.
   T h e authorities on involuntary m anslaughter are difficult to reconcile, but the
following propositions appear to be established:
    (1) T h e killing is m anslaughter if it is either
   (a) T he result o f a grossly negligent (though it m ay be otherwise lawful) act or
        omission on the part o f the accused (see § 20 -4 9 , post); or
   ( b) T he result o f his unlawful act (though not his unlawful om ission), where
        the unlawful act is one, such as an assault, which all sober and reasonable
        people would inevitably realise m ust subject the victim to the risk o f some
        harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm, whether the accused
        realised this or not: Andrews v. D .P .P ., ante ; R . v. Larkin (1944) 29

        (Injecting another person with heroin which the defendant had unlawfully
        taken into his possession for that purpose, is an unlawful act and if death
        results the offence is m anslaughter notwithstanding that the victim con­
        sented and the heroin is only one o f the causes o f death, i.e. a cause o f death
        outside the de minimis range— drug addicts had prepared a strong solution
        o f heroin and injected each other with it: R. v. Cato [1976] 1 All E.R. 260,

        the supply did not cause any direct injury to him— conviction for man­
        slaughter quashed).

        following point but refused leave: “ whether in order to constitute the
        offence o f manslaughter the unlawful and dangerous act must first, be

           tried to force his w a y into a queue) and hit X who fell ag ainst an 89 year old
           w o m a n . H er femur was broken and an operation w a s performed to replace
           her hip joint. She died subsequently, the cause o f de a th being pulm onary
           e m b o lism caused by thrombosis o f the leg veins w h ich in turn w as caused
           by fracture o f the femur. T h e court could see no reason o f policy for holding
           that an act calculated to harm A could not be m an slau gh ter i f it in fact
           killed B. T h e fact that there was no physical contact b etw een the defendant
           and the victim w as im material. In D .P .P . v. N ew bury, ante, the H o u se o f
           Lords approved the follow ing dictim in R . v. Larkin [1943] 1 All E .R . 217,
           219: “ W h ere the act w h ich a person is engaged in perform ing is unlaw ful,
           then if at the sam e tim e it is a dangerous act, that is, a n act w hich is likely
           to injure another person, and quite inadvertently he causes the death o f
           that other person by that act, then h e is guilty o f m a n sla u g h te r.” It is
           unnecessary to prove that the accused knew that the act was unlaw ful or
           dangerous: D .P .P . v. Newbury. In ju d g in g w hether the act was dangerous,
           the test is not did the accused recognise that it was dangerous, but w ou ld all
           sober and reasonable p eople recognise its danger: ibid. T h e practice o f
           d irecting juries other than in accordance w ith the principles set out above
           should cease: ibid.b

(2) Risk o f "harm” : meaning o f “h arm ”
    “ H a r m ” m ea ns physical harm. A ccordingly, if, for e xa m p le , robbers so frighten
a person b y their ap pearance and conduct that in c on seq u en ce that person suffers
a heart attack from w hich he later dies, a proper direction to the ju r y w ould
involve telling them that the requisite harm was caused if the unlawful act so
shocked the victim as to cause him physical injury', see R . v. D awson, Nolan and
 Walmsley (19 85) 81 C r.A p p .R . 150, C.A.
   D alby, P agett and M itchell were considered in R . v. Goodfellow (1986) 83
Cr.A pp.R . 23, C .A . It w as subm itted o n b eh a lf o f the a p p e lla n t that D a lb y w a s
authority for the proposition that in the case o f “ unlaw ful a c t ” m anslaughter the
action o f the defendant m ust have been directed at the victim . T his subm issio n
was based on the following passage from W aller L .J .’s j u d g m e n t in D alby — (1982)
74 C r.A pp.R . 348, 352— “ where the charge o f m anslaughter is based on an u n la w ­
ful and dangerous act, it m ust be an act directed at the victim and likely to cause
im m ediate injury, how ever slig h t.” Lord L a n e C.J., delivering the ju d g m e n t o f the
court in Goodfellow, having quoted this extract, continued: “ H ow e v er , w e do not
think that he was suggesting there must b e an intention on the part o f the d e fe n d ­
ant to harm or frighten or a realisation that his acts were likely to harm or frighten.
Indeed it w o u ld have been contrary to the dicta o f Lord S a lm o n in D .P .P . v. N e w ­
bury [(1976) 62 C r.A p p .R . 291] if he was. W h a t he w as, w e believe, intending to
say wras that there m ust be no fresh intervening cause b e tw e e n the act and the
d eath ” (at p. 27). His Lordship referred to Pagett and M itch ell as supporting this
interpretation o f D alby.
   (3) Mens rea is essential to m anslaughter but it can consist o f either (in ( l ) ( a )
above) gross negligence or (in (1) (b) above) the mens rea a p propriate to the u n la w ­
ful act, or both; Andrews v. D .P .P ., ante; R . v. L am b , ante; R . v. Lowe, ante.
   (4) For the purpose o f ( l ) ( b ) above, an act w hich is un law fu l by the m a nner o f
its execution, e.g. dangerous driving, is not an “ unlawful a c t ” ; Andrews v. D .P .P .,
ante.
   See further at § 2 0 -5 1 , post and the cases collected at § 2 0 - 5 5 , post.

“Gross n e g lig e n c e ”
   (1)    It w o u ld have been satisfactory to h a v e been able to say, as w as suggested in
the 39th edition o f this work, that “ gross n e g lig e n c e ” w as eq u iv a le n t to “ reckless­
n ess” as defined in § 17—24, ante. Certainly a direction to this effect could only be


    6    See R. v. Pagett (§ 2 0 - 5 ) w h e r e a conv iction o f m a n s l a u g h t e r w a s u p h e l d ; th e a p p e l l a n t

  criticised on the ground that it w as too favourable to the accused. T h e position
  how ever is not so sim ple, and it is necessary to refer to certain o f the authorities.
      (2) T h e le ading case is Andrews v. D .P .P . (1938) 26 C r.A pp.R . 34, H .L ., a case o f
  “ m otor m anslaughter.” H o ld in g, as w e h a v e seen, that “ dangerous d r iv in g ” was
  not an “ unlawful a c t” for the purpose o f § 2 0 - 4 8 (1) (b), ante, Lord A tk in (in a
  speech concurred in by the rest o f the A p pellate C om m ittee) said that in the pres­
  ent case it w as only necessary to consider m anslaughter from the point o f view o f
  an unintentional killing caused by negligence, that is, the o m ission o f a duty to
  take care. H e cited from the considered j u d g m e n t o f the C ourt o f C rim inal Appeal
  in R . v. Batemen (1925) 19 C r.A p p .R . 8 the follow ing passage:
      “ In explaining to juries the test which they should apply to determ ine w hether
  the negligence, in the particular case, a m o u n te d or did not a m o u n t to a crim e, the
 J u d g e s have used m a n y epithets, such as ‘c u lp a b le ,’ ‘crim ina l,’ ‘gross,’ ‘w ick ed ,’
  ‘clear,’ ‘c o m p le te .’ But, w hatever epithet b e used and w hether an epithet be used
 or not, in order to establish crim inal liability the facts m ust be such that, in the
 opinion of the jury, the negligence o f the accused w ent beyond a mere m atter o f
 com pensation betw een subjects and sh ow ed such disregard for the life a n d safety
 o f others as to a m o u n t to a crime against the State and co n d u ct deserving punish­
 m e n t .”
      Lord Atkin w en t on to say: “ . . . the expressions used are not. indeed they were
 probably not intended to be, a precise definition o f the crime. I do not m y s e lf find
 the connotation o f mens rea helpful in d isting uishin g betw een degrees o f negligence,
 nor do the ideas o f crime and p unishm ent in them selves carry a jury' m u c h further
 in deciding w hether in a particular case the degree o f negligence show n is a crime
 and deserves punishm ent. B ut the substance o f th e j u d g m e n t is m ost va lua ble, and
 in m y opinion is correct. In practice it has generally been adopted by ju d g e s in
 charging juries in all cases o f m anslaughter by negligence, whether in driving
 vehicles or otherw ise. . . .
      Sim ple lack o f care is not enough. For the purposes o f the criminal law there are
 degrees o f n egligence, and a very high degree o f negligence is required to b e proved
 before the felony is established. Probably o f all the epithets that can be applied,
 “ recklessness” m ost nearly covers the case. It is difficult to visualise a case o f death
 by dangerous driving caused by “ reckless” driving in the connotation o f that term
 in ordinary speech which w o u ld notju stify a conviction for m anslaughter. But it is
 probably not all em bracing, for “ reckless” suggests an indifference to risk, whereas
 the accused m ay h a ve appreciated the risk and endeavoured to avoid it and yet
 sh o w n such a high degree o f n egligence in the m ea ns adopted to avoid the risk as
 w ould justify a co n v iction .” T h e H o u se o f Lords has now decided that “ failure to
 g ive any thought to the possibility o f this b e in g a risk” can a m o u n t to recklessness
 (see § 17-24, ante).
     It should be noted that in involuntary m an sla u g h te r by negligence there must
 be both a d u ty to take care and a high degree o f negligence, w hich ho w e v e r need
 not necessarily a m o u n t to recklessness.
     (3) In R. v. Lamb (1967) 51 C r.A pp.R . 4 1 7 , C .A ., a strong C ourt o f A p p e a l in a
 considered j u d g m e n t said, obiter (at p. 424) that “ w hen the gravam en o f a charge is
 crim inal negligence— often referred to as recklessness— o f an accused person, the
jury' have to consider a m o n g other matters the state o f h is m ind, and that includes
 the question o f w hether he th ought that w h a t he w as doing was safe. In the present
 c a s e ”— pulling the trigger o f a partly-loaded revolver in je st— “ it w'ould h a v e been
 fully open to a jury, if properly directed, to find the accused guilty because they
 considered that his view o f there being no danger w a s form ed in a criminally negligent way,
 but he was entitled to a direction that the ju r y should take into account that fact
 that he had undisputely formed this view and that there w as expert evidence o f
 this being an u n derstandable v ie w .”
     (T h e court held that there w a s no evidence o f m anslaughter as the result o f an
 unlaw ful act, because w hat the accused had do n e did not even a m o u n t to an
 assault in the absence o f a n y hostile intent— see § 2 0 -5 1 2 , post.)
     (4) In R. v. Lowe (1973) 57 C r.A pp.R . 3 6 5, C .A ., the Court o f A ppeal a ppear to
 h ave equated “ recklessness” with the high standard o f negligence required, but
 this was obiter and the court were clearly intending to follow Andrews v. D .P . P . , ante.
    (5) In R. v. Cato (1976) 62 C r.A pp.R . 41, C .A ., o n the question o f the degree o f
negligence required, the trial ju d g e had said that “ recklessness” m ust be proved,
without defining that word. The C ourt o f A p p e a l said (at p. 48) that definition w as
unnecessary— “After all, recklessness is a perfectly s im p le English word. Its m e a n ­
ing is well known and it is in com m o n u se .”
   (6) In R . v. Dobinson (1977) C r.A pp.R . 186, 192, 193, C.A. the Court o f A p p e a l
said that it was not necessary for there to be an appreciation by the accused o f the
risk o f death or serious injury. T h e y w ent on to say that there m ust be a “ reckless
disregard o f danger to the health and welfare o f the infirm person. M ere inadver­
tence is not enough. T h e defendant must have been proved to h a ve been indiffer­
ent to an obvious risk o f injury to health, or actually to have foreseen the risk but to
have determ ined nevertheless to run it.”
   In view o f the contrast in the a bove passage betw een “ indifference” and “ actual
foresight” it is difficult to understand w h a t distinction is being draw n betw een
“ inadvertence” and “ indifference.” T h e passage, how ever, is consistent with the
opinions o f the majority o f the H o u s e o f Lords in R . v. C aldwell and o f all their
Lordships in R . v. Lawrence (§ 17—24, ante). In R . v. West London Coroner , ex p . Gray
and others [1987] 2 All E .R . 129, D .C ., W atkins L.J. identified the ingredients o f the
offence o f unlawful killing by neglect.

    (7) Collisions at sea. I f a charge o f m anslaughter follow ing loss o f life in a collision
at sea, is to succeed, it is essential that the crown sho uld be able to prove clearly
and for certain every act wheth-er o f co m m ission or om ission by those against
w hom that charge is brought and w hich is said not o n ly to have caused death but
to have been o f so grave a character that a conviction for m anslaughter should fol­
low. In such cases com parable directions on the law to those appropriate in m otor
m anslaughter cases should be given. In Seymour (1983) 77 C r.A p p .R . 215, H .L .,
the H o u se o f Lords held that the appropriate direction in m otor m anslaughter
cases is the sam e as has been suggested in Lawrence (1981) 73 C r.A p p .R . 1 (see §
2 0 -2 7 4 ). T h u s the relevant questions are (i) D id the respective acts o f navigation
create an obvious and serious risk o f causing physical da m ag e to som e other ship
and thus to other persons w ho m ig h t have been travelling in the area o f the colli­
sion at the material time? I f so, did any o f the defendants by their respective acts o f
navigation so navigate either w ith o u t hav ing g iven any thought to the possibility
of that risk or, w hile recognising that the risk existed, take that risk: Kong Cheuk
K w an v. R . (1986) 82 Cr.A pp.R . 18, P.C.

    (8) Manslaughter charge as an alternative to causing death by reckless driving. T h e offence
o f causing death by reckless driving o f a m otor v ehicle o n a road is still m a n s la u g h ­
ter by the law o f E ngland even though it is also a statutory offence and has been
since 1956: Government o f U .S .A . v. Jennings (1982) 75 C r.A pp.R . 367, H .L ., (an
extradition case). T h e evidence to prove either offence is therefore the sam e.
    In R . v. Seymour (1983) 77 C r.A pp.R . 215, H .L ., it w as held that w here m a n ­
slaughter was charged and the circum stances were that the victim w as killed as the
result o f the reckless driving o f the defendant on a p u b lic highw ay, the ju r y should
be directed as suggested in R . v. Lawrence (see § 2 0 - 2 7 4 , p ost), but it w ould be
appropriate to point out that in order to constitute the offence o f m a n sla u g h ter the
risk o f death being caused by the m anner o f the d e fe n d a n t’s driving m ust be very
high. Lord Roskill, with whose speech all but one o f the rem ainder o f their Lord­
ships agreed, said that there could be no justification for jo in in g both m a n sla u g h ­
ter and the statutory offence in the sam e indictm ent and that if it w ere don e the
prosecution should be m ade to elect upon w hich c o u n t they w ish ed to proceed.
T h e suggestion that a prerequisite for a m an slau gh ter charge is that “ the risk o f
death m ust be very h ig h ” is quite inconsistent with Lawrence and is obiter.


D uty o f care
   T h is belongs m ore to the fields o f contract and tort than to this work. In prac­
tice, however, the question o f w hether the accused was under a duty o f care
usually only arises in m anslaughter cases where it is alleged that the accused had
 undertaken the care o f a child or infirm person or the like. In other cases, such as
the medical practitioner or driver o f a car or an engine, the duty is obvious.
   In R. v. Stone, R . v. Dobinson (ante), Stone and D o b in so n were liv in g together,
D o b in son being Stone’s mistress. S to n e ’s sister, Fanny, the deceased, lodged in
their house and they had taken so m e care o f her. It w as argued for the appellants
that they had no duty o f care to the deceased . Rejecting this, the C ourt o f A ppeal
(at p. 191) said:
   “ W hether Fanny was a lodger or not sh e w as a blood relation o f . . . Stone; she
w as occupy ing a room in his house; M rs. D o b in son had undertaken the dutv o f
trying to w ash her, o f taking such food to her as she required. T here was am ple
evidence that each accused was aware o f the poor condition she was in. . . . This
was not a situation a nalogous to the d r o w n in g stranger. T h e y did m ake efforts to
care. T h e y tried to get a doctor; they tried to discover the previous doctor. Mrs.
D o b in so n helped with the w ash in g and the provision o f food. . . . T h e j u r v were
entitled to find that the duty had been a ssum ed. T h e y were entitled to conclude
that once Fanny becam e helplessly infirm. . . . the appellants were, in the circum ­
stances, obliged either to s u m m o n help or else to care for F anny th em se lv e s.”
   For further exam ples see the earlier cases collected at §§ 2 0 - 5 9 et seq., post.

“Unlawful Act”
   (1) See ante § 20 -48 . R easo n a b le correction o f a child by a person in loco parentis
is not unlawful— see § 2 0 - 2 5 , ante. For observations as to the proper direction
w h en such an issue arises see R . v. M ackie (1973) 5 7 C r.A pp.R . 353 and post,
§ 2 0 -5 8 . A s to injuries caused in lawful ga m es and contests, see post, § 2 0 - 5 6 .
   In R. v. Lam b, § 2 0 - 4 9 (3), ante, w h en the accused had pulled the trigger o f the
revolver in jest, the Court o f A p p ea l pointed out that this w as not an unlawful act
and therefore the prosecution could only have established m anslaughter by prov­
ing gross negligence.
   (2) In R . v. Cato, § 2 0 - 4 9 (5), ante, the Court o f A p p ea l held that injecting
another person with heroin w hich the d e fenda nt had unlaw fully taken into his pos­
session for that purpose, (he had exch a n g ed syringes w ith the other person), is an
unlawful act, and if d eath results the offence is m anslaughter, notw ithstanding
that the victim consented to the injection and provided the syringe and the heroin.
H ow ever, cf. R . v. D a lb y, ante, § 2 0 - 4 8 , (a person w ho supplies the dru g w hich is
injected by the deceased h im s e lf is not guilty o f m anslaughter).
   (3) A n act calculated to harm A is m anslaughter if it kills B and it is immaterial
that there w as no physical contact betw een the assailant an d B, see R . v. Mitchell,
ante § 2 0 -4 8 and R. v. P agett ante § 2 0 -5 .
   (4) As to death resulting from an unlawful act done with intent to procure mis­
carriage, see § 2 0 -2 0 , ante.

   ( /) Counselling, (see also post, §§ 2 9 - 1 9 — 2 9 - 2 8 ) . A person can be indicted for
and convicted o f accessory before the fact to involuntary m anslaughter, but semble
not in the case o f voluntary m anslaughter (see ante, § 2 0 - 4 7 ) : R. v. Creamer (1966)
49 C r.A pp.R . 368, C.C. A ., ( obiter on this point but follow ing old a u th o r ity ). ■<
   A t page 378 the Court said: “A m an is guilty o f involuntary m anslaughter when
he intends an unlawful act and one likely to do harm to the person and death
results w hich w as neither foreseen nor intended. It is the accident o f d ea th which
m akes him guilty o f m an slau gh ter as o p p o sed to s o m e lesser offence such as
assault or, in the present case, abortion. T h is can no d o u b t be said to b e illogical,
since the culpability is the sam e, but nevertheless it is an illogicality which, runs
throughout the w hole o f our law, both the c o m m o n la w and the statute law . . • •
Bearing that in m ind, it is quite consistent that a m an w h o has counselled and pro­
cured such an illegal and dangerous act from which death, unintended, results
should be guilty o f being accessory before the fact to m an slau gh ter .”
   T h e C ourt’s dictum that a person canno t be indicted as an accessory before the
fact to voluntary m anslaughter w a s based on the old authorities referred to in the

   1. O n 15 April 1989 a football m a tc h to decide a semi-final round o f the FA C up c o m p etitio n was to be
played between th e Liverpool an d N o ttin g h a m Forest Clubs. T h e neutral v enue chosen was Hillsborough
Football S tad iu m , Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. Only six m in u tes in to the game, play was sto p p e d when it
was realised that spectators on the terraces beh ind the Liverpool goal h a d been severely crushed. In the result,
95 d ie d a n d over 4 00 received hospital treatm ent.

  2. O n 17 April 1 9 8 9 1 was app o in ted by you to carry out an Inquiry w ith th e following term s o f reference:

      To in q u ire into the events at Sheffield W ednesday football gro u n d on 15 April 1989 a n d to m ake
      re c o m m e n d a tio n s abou t the needs o f crowd control a n d safety at s p o rts events.

   3. Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: M r Brian Johnson Q P M , C h ie f C onstable o f Lancashire,
and Professor L eo n a rd M a u n d er OBE, BSc, P h D , ScD, FEng, F I M ech E, Professor o f Mechanical
E ngineering at th e U niversity o f N ew castle upon Tyne. T h e ir help has been invaluable a n d I am very grateful
for th e ir expert ad v ice a n d wise counsels. W hile the sole responsibility for this report is m ine, I a m com forted
in th e know ledge tha t b o th Assessors agree w ith it.

  4. M r R obert W halley was a p p o in te d Secretary to the Inquiry. H e a n d his assistants have worked
prodigiously a n d skilfully to give m e all the advice an d support I could have wished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help I have received, as always, from my clerk, M r Ernest Pott.

   5. T he policing arrangem ents for 15 April were in the h a n d s o f th e S outh Yorkshire Constabulary. T he
efficacy o f th ose arrangem ents a n d the ir im p lem enta tion w as from a n early stage called into question. It was
therefore d ec id e d tha t the investigation o f the disaster and the gathering o f evid ence for this I n q u iry should be
cond uc te d by an in de pende n t police force. M r Geoffrey D ea r Q P M , C h ie f C onstable o f West M idlands
Constabulary, u n d e rto o k this task. H e was m a d e responsible directly to me; he a p p o in ted Assistant C h ie f
C onstable M ervyn J o n e s to take full-tim e charge o f the investigation. I a m deeply indebted to b o th o f them.

  6. O n 18 A pril I visited Hillsborough Stadium . I inspected the scene o f the disaster on the terraces a n d all
relevant p a r ts o f th e stadium a n d its approaches. M y Assessors a n d I have m a d e fu rth e r visits during the
Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool on 21 an d 29 April.

    7. T h e L ord M ayor a n d the Sheffield City Council kindly offered to m a k e the a c c o m m o d a tio n a n d facilities
o f Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing o f oral evidence. T his offer was gratefully accepted an d I would
like to record my th a n k s for those facilities an d for the co-operation afforded to the In q u iry by th e authorities
in Sheffield.

   8. O n 28 April 1 9 8 9 ,1 held a p relim inary hearing to an n o u n c e the d a te w h en the oral evidence would begin,
to give som e direc tio n s as to the p ro cedure I intended to follow a n d to h ea r a pplica tions from th o se wishing to
be represented at the hearing. I acco rd e d representation to the following:
       (i)     T h o se bereaved or injured as a result o f the disaster.
       (ii)     T h e Football S upporters’ Association.
       (iii)    T h e Football Association.
       (iv)     Sheffield City Council.
       (v)      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club together with the Football League, th e C lu b ’s casual sta ff a n d
                th e ir insurers, the Sun Alliance.
       (vi)     S outh Yorkshire Constabulary.
       (vii) S outh Yorkshire Fire a n d Civil Defence Authority.
Subsequently, during the hearing. 1 further accorded representation to:
      (viii) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire M e tropolitan A m bulance Service
             (SYMAS).
and   (ix)   D r W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield W ednesday Football Club.

    9. Since the circum stances o f the d isaster raised urgent q u es tio n s o f safety, especially at football grounds,
you ind icated at the outset that you would w elcome any rec o m m e n d atio n s, even o f an interim n atu re , which 1
might be able to give in advance o f the new football season d u e to co m m e n c e in mid-A ugust 1 9 8 9 .1 therefore
a n n o u n c e d at the prelim inary hearing on 28 April that 1 w ould conduct an oral hearing with all possible
e xped ition as the first phase o f the Inquiry to discover the facts a n d causes o f the disaster a n d enable m e to
m ake any im m e d ia te interim rec o m m e n d a tio n s necessary in the sh o rt term .

   10. T h e West M idlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A “ F re ep h o n e” n u m b e r was advertised to
enable m e m b ers o f the public, especially those who had atte n d e d the m atch, to offer their evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this n u m b e r was available for three days on 28 different lines. T h e response fro m the public
was such th a t the lines were co n tin u ed for a further three days by the en d o f w hich 2,666 calls h ad been
received. T h ere were also m any w ritten offers o f help. Some 4 40 West M id lan d s officers were deployed on the
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in B irm ingham , Liverpool an d
Sheffield a n d c o m p u te r technology was used to the full. In all so m e 3776 sta te m en ts were taken. T here were
also s o m e 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry a n d to m e personally all o f which I read. T h e police,
Sheffield W ednesday Football Club a n d the BBC had video ca m e ra s film ing at the ground o n 15 April. In
aggregate, they recorded som e 71 hours o f film covering the perio d before, d u rin g a n d after the disaster. T h u s
the m aterial gathered an d potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enorm ous. From this
m ass it was essential to select only sufficient good and reliable evidence necessary to establish the facts an d
causes o f th e disaster.

   11. W he re it seem ed likely that any allegation o r criticism might be m a d e o f th e conduct o f any person o r
party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the p a rty concerned
setting o u t the likely grounds for com plaint. T his followed the p ractice established by the Royal C om m issio n
on T rib u n als o f Inquiry (the Salm on C om m ission).

   12. T h e hearing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding on 29 June. In
that period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel’s subm issions were delivered in w riting on 7 July a n d
on 14 July I h ea rd their brief oral subm issions supplem enting the w ritten argum ent.

   13. W itnesses were not sworn. Since this is a d epartm ental inquiry, there was no power to ad m in iste r the
o ath but there was no instance o f any w itness giving evidence which I considered might have been different
had he o r she been sworn.

   14. T h e w itnessescalled were only a small fraction o f those fro m w hom s ta te m en ts were o r could have been
taken. N evertheless, I am satisfied that they were sufficient in n u m b e r a n d reliability to enable m e to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called m ore would have p revented me from presenting an interim report in the
req u ired tim e an d would not have a d d e d significantly to the relevant evidence, I have, however, been able to
take into ac count m any w ritten statem ents in add ition to oral testimony.

    15. A part from the evidence called by Counsel for the I n q u iry which was draw n from s tatem ents taken by
the West M id la n d s Police an d others volunteered by individuals, each o f the represented parties was given full
o p p o r tu n ity to put forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final subm ission was m a d e by
Counsel for the S outh Yorkshire Police that since the investigation by West M id la n d s Police is still continuing,
all the evidence h as not been assem bled a n d it would be unsafe for m e to m ake findings o f fact, I should
therefore m ake clear that the investigation continues principally to furnish as m uch detail as possible to H M
C o r o n e r for the City o f Sheffield as to the cause o f death, the precise position at death a n d the care a n d
m o v e m en t o f each o f the 95 victim s individually. I a m assured by C h ie f C onstable D ear a n d Assistant C hief
C o n stab le M ervvn Jones that it is most unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter o r ad d to
the history o f events which em erged at the hearing.

     16. I should like to tha nk all those w ho m a d e it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
 event a n d for evidence to be efficiently presented and tested so as to give a full an d fair account o f what
 h a p p e n e d in all its aspects without irrelevancy o r d uplication. I pay tribute particularly to the West M idlands
 Police for th e ir speed and dedication in gathering the evidence an d to all those responsible for processing it.


                                                             2
The most eloquent tribute to the fairness a n d thoroughness o f the police investigation ca m e from the Secretary
o f the Football Supporters' Association. He said there h ad been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to w h e th e r that
investigation would be fair an d objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness sta te m en ts
themselves. H av in g heard the opening statem ent by Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered
by the police, he found that it accorded entirely with his A ssociation’s evidence a n d the initial an x iety was
wholly dispelled.

   17. Before an d d u rin g the Inquiry I deriv ed great assistance on a wide range o f technical issues from the
Health a n d Safety Executive who providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research and L aboratory
Services D ivision) where tests were conducted a n d reports p repared swiftly an d efficiently. This was done
in close c onsulta tio n with Professor M aunder. I a m most grateful to the Director, D r A Jones, a n d to the
D eputy D irector, D r C E Nicholson, for the ir invaluable help.

   18. I wish to c o m m e n d Counsel to the inquiry, M r A ndrew Collins Q C, M r Alan G oldsack a n d M r
Bernard Phillips for th e ir industry, care a n d fairness in selecting a n d presenting the necessary evidence; also.
Counsel for all those represented who tested tha t evidence fully but expeditiously. T his Interim R e p o rt could
not possibly have been p repared in so sho rt a tim e h ad I not had the w hole-hearted co-operation o f all those
m e n tio n e d a n d m any others.

   19. T he second phase o f the Inquiry will be directed to m aking final an d long term r e c o m m e n d a tio n s about
crowd control a n d safety at sports grounds. I need to consider in d e p th inform ation, o p in io n s a n d argum ents
from a w ide range o f sources an d c o ntributors both here and ab road. It was clear from the outset that this
second p hase could n ot be carried to com pletion before the next football season. However, at an early stage of
the oral hearing I invited evidence from all w ho w ished to c ontribute to it a n d specifically from m a n y sporting,
local authority, em ergency service an d police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked that subm issions
should be in w riting a n d should be m a d e pro m p tly so tha t the second phase o f the I n q u iry could
follow im m ed iate ly afte r the first. I shall now proceed to co nsider the large body o f w ritten evidence which has
been su b m itte d . I shall w ant in some instances to have further oral evidence or discussion in conju n ctio n with
my Assessors. We will also need to m ake a n u m b e r o f visits a n d inspections.

  20. I now present m y Interim Report a n d R ecom m endations. I shall prepare my Final Report and
R e co m m en d a tio n s as soon as reasonably possible.

Fixing T h e Venue
   21. O n 20 M arch 1989, the Football Association (the FA) requested that the ir C up semi-final between
Liverpool a n d N o ttin g h am Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium . T he c o rresponding
semi-final between the same two te am s h a d been held there in April 1988. T h e arrangem ents had been
successful in the view both o f the police a n d o f the host club. Sheffield Wednesday (the C lub) were therefore
willing to a c c o m m o d a te the 1989 m atch. S outh Yorkshire Constabulary were prepared to police it but only if
the ticketing arrangem ents were the sam e as those for 1988. O therw ise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
T h o se arrangem ents d id not please Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 o r 1989. T hey th o u g h t the ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirem ent was
accepted an d the m a tch was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

T he G round
  22. T h e H illsborough S tadium is som e 2 1': miles to the north-west o f central Sheffield in the district o f
O w lerton. T he ground was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river D on. T h e pitch lies
roughly east to west. A plan of the ground a n d its im m e d ia te environs is at A ppendix 1.

  23. T he west en d. w ith which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is know n as the Leppings Lane end. T he
east en d abuts on Penistone Road, the A 61. To the so u th is the river D o n a n d to the n o rth a residential street.
Vere Road, w hich runs between Leppings Lane and P enistone R oad North.

   24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the D irec to rs’ a nd players'
entrances, a n d to the adm inistra tive block u nder the stand. T h e roadway gives both vehicular a n d pedestrian
access between P enistone Road an d L eppings Lane, bu t there are gates which can shut it o ff at each end. T here
is som e car parking along this roadw ay principally for Directors, players an d employees o f the Club. T he south
sta n d d ates from 1914 an d is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8.800. 5.500 o f those are
roofed over an d 3.300 are uncovered.

  25. T h e n orth sta n d is also all seating a n d ac com m odates about 9.700. Behind it is a gy m n a siu m o r sports
hall. T here are also a first aid room a n d police room close by.

  26. The east en d is all terracing a n d is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged an d roofed over in 1986 and
now a c c o m m o d ates s o m e 21.000 standing spectators. T here are crush barriers in the Kop ru n n in g parallel to
the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free m ovem ent from side to side.

   27. At the west o r Leppings L ane end o f the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. B ehind it is the west
stand which provides covered seating an d was built in 1965 for World C up matches, som e o f which were held
at Hillsborough in 1966. T he covered sta n d acco m m o d ates 4.456 seated spectators. T h e terracing in front o f it
extends higher in the corners between the stands a n d its total capacity was stated to be 10.100. At both the Kop
end a n d th e west end access to the pitch is barred by p erim ete r fencing. T h e fencing is ab o u t eight feet high
m o u n te d upon the low wall at the foot o f the terracing. At the top o f the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
angle for som e 15 inches to m ake it difficult for anyone to clim b over towards the pitch. T h ere are gates at
intervals along the perim eter fencing to afford access between terrace an d pitch. T hese gates are less than a
m e tre w ide a n d were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes o r in an emergency.
They are m a rk e d a n d n um bered on the plan A ppendix 1.

   28. U nlike the Kop end. the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radial
fences at right angles to it. d ividing the area into pens. This division was begun after an FA C u p semi-final in
1981 w hen crushing occurred d u e to overcrowding an d gates had to be opened. It proceeded in stages, the final
arrange m ent being shown on the plan A ppendix 1. T he first section o f the west terracing m oving south to north
con tain s gates 1 and 2 and is known as pens 1 an d 2 although in fact constituting only o n e pen. Next is pen 3
with one gate; next pen 4 with one gate: pen 5, which is extremely narrow, was in tended as a sterile area to
d iv id e pen 4 from pen 6. T his was to isolate ho m e and away fans on occasions w hen both might be
a c c o m m o d a te d on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west com er. Pens 5 ,6
a n d 7 each have a perim eter gate. At the back o f the pens, u n d e r the front o f the west stand, there is a gate in
each radial fence. W hen those gates are open, the back row o f the terracing is intended to p erm it access from
p e n to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial n u m b e rs are present, those gateways are not
readily \ isibleor accessible. T he present layout o f the pens, fences, crush barriers a n d gates has resulted from a
series o f piecemeal changes. T he n atu re an d effect o f those changes m ust be considered later.

The Turnstiles
   29. Because o f the housing in Vere R oad there is n o access from the north side o f the ground. Along
Penistone Road N o rth there are som e 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop an d to the east
en d o f the north stand. They are m arked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. T he 12 num bered 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the north stand b ut were not used for that p urpose on 15 April in o rd e r to segregate supporters o f the
two team s as appears later. Two o f them . 77 an d 78. were however used for access to the Kop.

  30. At the south side o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles (n u m b e re d 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
num bered 37 to 42 led to the Kop a n d the rest to the south stand.

  31. In sum m ary, the south and east sides o f the gro u n d a c c o m m o d a te d som e 29.800 whose access on the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. T he other two sides o f the ground, north an d west, with a capacity o f 24,256 were fed solely from the
Leppings Lane entra nce where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the G round
  33. Most supporters were expected to com e by road although rail transport was available. N o ttin g h am
supporters travelling by train would arrive at the m ain line Sheffield M id lan d Station w hence they would be
directed a n d escorted northw ards by the police. T hey would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
N ottingham supp orters travelling by coach, m ini-bus or car would app ro a ch Sheffield fro m the south mainly
on the M 1. Again their arrival at the ground would p red o m in an tly be via Penistone R oad or H erries Road.

   34. Liverpool supporters travelling by norm al rail service would arrive at Sheffield M idland Station just
like their N o ttin g h am counterparts. T h e police aim ed to segregate the rival fans and put th e m into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel bv special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
catering solely for football supporters a n d situated to the north o f the ground. A police escort was available to
conduct th e m o n foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. T hose com ing from Liverpool by road would approach
Sheffield either via the M62 and dow n the M 1 from the n orth or across the Pennines from the n orth west. All
such routes would bring them to the g ro u n d via one o r o th e r lim b o f Leppings Lane as shown on A ppendix 1.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the no rth a n d west; arrivals from N ottin g h am
would be from the south a n d east.

Allocation o f P laces and Tickets
   35. Experience in recent years has p roduced a policy o f segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
o f rival teams. T h e need for this policy to be m a in ta in e d was endorsed a n d em phasised by the Popplewell
Report following the Bradford City disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 semi-final the police decided
that sections o f the Hillsborough S tadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation o f
Liverpool and N o ttin g h am Forest fans. The section to be granted to each was d eterm in e d by th e direction
whence each p red o m in an tly approached. T hus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides o f the ground
for which access was from Leppings Lane. N ottin gham Forest were allotted the south a n d east sides with access
from Penistone Road.

   36. T he effect o f the decision was th at for this all-ticket C u p Tie. Liverpool were allotted only 24.256 places
as against 29.800 for N ottin gham Forest. This, although average atte n d a n c e o f supporters at h o m e m atches
was substantially higher at Liverpool th a n at N ottingham . Moreover, w ith standing tickets at £6 a n d seats at
£12. N ottingham Forest h ad 21.000 standing places co m pared with Liverpool’s 10.100. So. Liverpool’s
allocation was m ore expensive as well as smaller. U nderstandably. Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
o f places and tickets. T hey sought with som e support from the host club an d the FA to have it changed in
1988. but the police were ada m a n t. To switch ends would, in their o p in io n , have involved rival supporters
crossing each o th e r's paths when approaching the ground thereby frustrating attem pts at segregation and
creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989, when the sam e plan was proposed. Liverpool again challenged it. T he
police, however, m a in ta in ed their view, adding that those who had a tten d e d in 1988 would be fam iliar with the
arrangem ents an d tha t any change would lead to confusion.
Access from Leppings Lane
  3 7 . As the plan Appendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck o r forecourt at
a ben d in Leppings Lane where, com ing from the north, it tu rn s to the south-west an d crosses a bridge over the
river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north and west o f the ground. They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs o f Leppings Lane an d would converge on the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across tha t forecourt is a line o f railings with six sets o f d ou ble gates. Inside
those perim eter gates is the short app ro a ch to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs A ppendix 2. the
latter are in two sections divided by a fence. T he n orthern section consists o f turnstiles 1 to 16. N u m b ers 1 to
 10 gave access to the north stand. T hus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9.700 with north stand seats. T heir
tickets were m ark e d "E ntrance A" an d were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above them an d brown b oards on the wall.

   38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in the west stand. Thus 4.456 were served by six turnstiles.
They were the next block to the right o f those m a rke d A. However, instead o f these turnstiles a n d the west stand
tickets being m ark e d B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were m a rk e d C. T h e ir colour-code on
tickets an d b oards was red.

   39. O n the o th e r side o f the dividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
10.100 with tickets for the west terracing. T hose seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. This was because there
had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential nu m bering continued from 19 upwards
on the south side o f the ground. W hen the n u m b e r at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the present
arrangem ents o f 1 to 1-6. A to G an d then 19 upw ards was ad o p ted to avoid re-num bering all round the ground.
However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. "E ntrance B” also appeared on tickets for the west
terrace. T hus, the three blocks o f turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane en d read from
left to right A. C. B. T he colour-code for west terrace tickets an d the boards beside turnstiles A to G was mauve.
To th e right o f turnstile G is a tubulai steel barrier to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadw ay to the
south stand.

Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
  40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. T here is an exit gate (m arked A
on A ppend ix 1) between turnstile 1 an d the adjacent housing.

  41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 a n d 7 a n d the steps to the west stand. T h ere is a
wall d ividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It h ad been built to segregate hom e a n d away fans at a
tim e when the Club intended they should share the west terrace. T h at idea was not pursued but the wall
rem ained. T here was. however, a gateway in the wall which d id perm it access between the two areas. An exit
gate (m ark ed B on A ppendix 1) was pro vided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

   42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse b o u n d e d on the left by the wall just
m e n tio n e d a n d on the right by the wall o f the private roadway com ing f r r m the south stand to Leppings Lane.
T h ere was an exit gate in the latter wall (m ark ed C on A ppendix 1)just inside turnstile G.

  43. All three exit gates. A. B a nd C. were o f concertina design. They could be opened only from the inside
and were not intended for entry o f spectators into the ground.

  44. T hose entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could by
moving to the right go round the south end o f the west stand an d gain entry into pens 1 an d 2. T hey could go
through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse b ehind turnstiles 11 to 16 a n d then round the north
end o f the west stand into pens 6 or 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either o f
those courses. T he obvious way in was straight a head o f the turnstiles where a tunnel u n der the m id d le o f the
west stand gave access to pens 3 an d 4. Above its entrance in large letters was the word "Standing a n d a large
letter “ B". T hus B ticket holders were draw n towards the tunnel.

   45. T he length o f the tunnel is some 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels oft'but finally descends
tow ards the terraces at a gradient o f 1 in 6. As it emerges on to the terrace, the way ahe ad is bisected by the radial
fence between pen 3 on the right an d pen 4 on the left. A short spur o f brick wall projects forward from each side
o f th e tunnel at its mouth. T hose em erging are th us guided straight forward rather than to either side. The
p h o tograph at A ppendix 3 shows the west stand an d terraces.

    46. As with the layout on the terraces, the configuration o f the Leppings Lane turnstiles a n d the areas inside
 th e m was effected by a series o f piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary to analyse their resultant effect.

Policing A rrangem ents
   4 7. At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been u nder the control o f C hief S up erin te n d en t Mole, then
C o m m a n d e r o f F D ivision within whose area Hillsborough lies. H e was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
the FA broac h ed the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over c o m m a n d o f F D ivision on 27 M arch to
Superintendent D ucken field on the latter’s p ro m o tio n to C hief S uperintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 March, but on 27 March M r M ole bowed out and M r D uckenfield took over. U n d er h im were
Sector C o m m a n d e rs , all S uperintendents with m uc h experience o f policing football m atches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular. Superintendent Marshall was in charge o f the area outsid e the Leppings Lane
entrance a n d the approaches to it. S up erintendent G reenw ood was in c o m m a n d inside the ground, but this
included the area between the turnstiles an d the perim eter fence. T hey thereby sw apped roles from the
previous year. U n d e r M r D uckenfield’s overall c o m m a n d were som e 801 officers an d m en on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers an d others from D D ivision to deal with the influx o fsu pporters into the city centre.
In all. therefore, som e 1.122 police were deployed for this m atch a m o u n tin g to a b o u t 38 per cent o f th e total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the m o u n te d section o f 34 were officers from Liverpool an d N o ttin g h am to
assist respectively in marshalling their hom e supporters. T he total at the ground was divided into serials
consisting usually o f eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. T he serials were posted to duties
at various stations in an d around the ground in three phases: before, during an d after the match. All o f this
was p rovided for in an O perational O rd e r which followed closely the O rd e r draw n up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into account the force's “Standing Instructions for the Policing o f Football G ro u n d s ” . T h e O rd e r
described the duties o f each serial at each phase. It was supplem ented by oral briefings before an d on the day o f
the match.

Sheffield Wednesday's Arrangements
  48. T he Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile o perators for d u ty on 15 April. T h e stewards
were briefed as to their duties on the m orning o f the m atch by police Inspectors a n d were allocated ro u n d the
ground. T hey wore yellow tabards. T he C lu b ’s control room , situated below the south stand, could
com m unicate by V H F radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in the ir control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A c o m p u terise d counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed o n to a screen in the C lub control room the running total o f
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. T hus, at the Leppings Lane end. there would be
separate ru n n in g totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), an d turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). W hen the total fora ny section was w ithin 15 per cent o f its p erm itte d capacity a w arning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing tha t w arning would o ccur when the n u m b e rs were within 15 per
cent o f the total terrace capacity o f 10.100. W h a t the system could not d o was m o n ito r the distribution o f fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no w arning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications
   49. T he nerv e centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west corne r o f the
ground between the south s tand and pen 1 o f the west terracing. T he box is elevated a n d reached by a n u m b e r
o f steps. It has windows c o m m an d in g views across the pitch a n d straight aii ng th e line o f the west p erim eter
fcnce. T he box is very small an d has seats for only three officers. S u p erinte ndent M urray was in control o f it
and was advisor to M r D uckenfield as he had been to M r Mole the year before. N ext to him sat Sergeant
G oddard who operated the radios. T he third seat was for Police C onstable Ryan who o perated the telephone
and public address systems. At the back o f the box stood Police Constable Bichard w ho was in control o f the
police closed circuit television system operated by a row o f consoles on a bench in front o f him a n d b eh in d the
three seated officers.

  50. T here were five television screens showing views o f five roving cam eras fixed at high points on the
stands an d directed b o th inside an d outside the ground. T here was also a m a ste r screen which flicked in
rotation from one cam era v i e w to an other a n d which m a d e a video recording. T h e cameras have a zoom
facility to close in on any point o f interest. Specifically, there were good camera view's o f the west terracing, o f
the Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them o f Leppings Lane itself.

  51. T h e Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
ground an d outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed u n d e r the police control box, to relay
music before the match, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
speakers or if ap p ro p riate to one area only.
    53.      R a d io contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and o utside the ground was
L H F on ch annel 25. There was a W1 FU portable base station in the control box an d if it failed there was a
stand-by station u n d e r the o p era to r's bench. H a n d sets were issued to all ranks o f Sergeant and above.
C o m m u n ity C onstables on du ty would already have their own. O th e r C onstables had no radio.
C o m m u n ic a tio n was on “talk th r o u g h ” i.e. any message from any source would be heard by everyone tune d in
a n d if m o re th a n one source spoke messages could becom e garbled. Ear pieces were issued to som e officers in
an a tte m p t to overcom e the loud crowd noise which m ade receipt o f signals very difficult. There were other
radio channels open to Sergeant G oddard: V H F to police H ea d q u arte rs at Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI
Sub-divisional H eadquarters at H a m m e rto n R oad an d channel 19 used by C1D. T here was also a set tuned to
Sheffield W ed n esd ay ’s radio system between its control room and the stewards.

                                      15th A PR IL : T H E B U IL D -l P T O 2.30pm

Early Arrivals
   54. 15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday. T he m atch was a sell-out. so 54.000 ticket holders
were expected. O th ers would come without tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain access otherwise.
The following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. T hey began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in
small num bers. Som e brought cans o f beer with them a n d were seen drinking as they walked; others took
advantage o f the w eather and sat about on walls a n d open spaces. W hen the public houses opened, m any
resorted there, d rink ing inside or spilling out into the sunshine. L eppings Lane an d its e nvirons com prise a
mixed shopping a n d residential area. Local residents saw- groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house or off-licence. Many were asking for tickets o r "spares”. T here were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, som e o f the fans were using private gardens an d yards to urinate. As the m orning
wore on, n u m b e rs increased. Requests for tickets an d trespass to u rin ate also increased. Still the prevailing
mood was on e o f carnival, good h u m o u r an d expectation.

Public H ouses
  55. T here were som e 74 shops with off-licences in a n d around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters did visit them but the evidence d id not suggest a great a m o u n t o f alcoholic d r in k was
bought there.

  56. O pening tim e at public houses was in general 11 am . Some r e m a in e d closed all day. O f the others, some
72, mostly in the city, were frequented by local patro n s only. Som e 23 public houses, however, served over a
hundred Liverpool supporters each. A nother 51 served m ore than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
many supporters d ran k enough to affect their m ood. At first excitem ent: later frustration.

The G athering Crowd
   57. Towards the end o f the m orning, fans gathered on an d a r o u n d the bridge n e a r the Leppings Lane
entrance. T hey seem ed reluctant to enter the grou nd early. All turnstiles were open at 12 noon a n d o ne or two
as early as 11.30 am . Some 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles a n d in the Leppings
Lane area. They enquired at ran d o m w hether fans had tickets. T h o se w ho h ad not were advised to go away;
nevertheless, m any returned m ore than once. T hose w h o had tickets were guided in the right direction. T he
police tried to persuade them to enter the g round early. Officers, m ale an d female, had been posted outside
each turnstile with the d u ty o f searching entrants for weapons, d r in k o r drugs. O nce through the turnstile, an
entrant was liable to be searched again by one o f a serial o f officers p ositioned just inside.

   58. At about 12 noon C h ief Inspector C reaser asked S u p erin te n d e n t M urray w hether the pens on the west
terrace were to be filled ont by one successively, but was told that th e y s h o u H al' be available from the start and
the fans should find their own level.

  59. By 2 pm it was app a rent to those inside the gro u n d a n d those m o n ito rin g events in th e police a n d Club
control room s that the n u m b e r o f N o ttin g h am fans in their places greatly o u tn u m b e re d those from Liverpool.
The Kop an d the south stand were filling u p steadily, but the n o rth a n d west stands were half empty. It was
noted about that tim e that the turnstile figures showed only 12.000 h ad entered as against 20,000 at the same
time the previous year. O n the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filling, the wing pens 1 ,2 ,6 a n d 7 were
nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 a n d 4 to move forward an d m ake room for
others.

  60. T here had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. T h is tim e, there was only one. It arrived
early, just before 2 pm. at Wadsley Bridge station. T h e 350 passengers were met by both m o u n te d an d foot
police officers w ho escorted them in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly an d passed through
the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm w ithout incident.

  61. By this tim e the police Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the m ajority o f
Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. T he num be rs converging on the Leppings Lane entra n ce were
increasing rapidly. Between the perim eter gates an d the turnstiles the crowd becam e congested. T h ere was no
longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole approach area. T he foot officers
outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.
M o u n te d officers in and outside the turnstile area were having difficulty m a no euvring in such a dense crowd.
T he police were beset by fans b em u sed by the ticket an d turnstile labelling asking for directions. Many had
been d rinking but up to an d just after 2.30 p m the m ood rem a ine d good.

    62.     S u perin te n d en t Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd. He becam e anxious ab o u t the n u m b e rs
c o m in g down Leppings Lane an d spilling o u t onto th e roadway where buses an d cars were moving. At 2.17
pm he rad ioed to control to have m o to r traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. T his was eventually d on e at abo u t
2.30 pm. U p to this time, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles a n d the n um be rs still approaching, there
was still no panic in the crowd; no perception ofcrisis by the police. In the control room M r Murray, w ho could
see Leppings Lane on the video, ad vised M r D uckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. M r
D uckenfield reaffirmed to him the policy abo u t a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there was som e
m a jo r external factor such as fog on the Penn ines or delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely tu rn ed up
late even in large numbers.
                                                       CHAPTER 3

                                        T H E C R I S I S AT T H E T U R N S T I L E S

    63. In the 20 m in u te s from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm there were crucial developm ents both inside an d outside
the ground. In pen s 3 an d 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as m ore fans came through the tun nel to the
favoured area b eh in d the goal. By 2.50 p m these pens were already full to a degree w hich caused serious
discomfort to m a n y well used to end u rin g pressure on terraces. T h e n u m b e rs at that time were clearly in excess
o f the m a x im u m density stated by the H o m e Office G u id e to Safety at Sports G ro u n d s (1986 E d n )( th e Green
G uide) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the G reen G u id e has no statutory or legal force, it is the
only official advice available about safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1. 2, 6 a n d 7. there was still
am ple room an d bare patches o f concrete were visible.

   64. Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As m ore arrived at the back the crush at the
front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles becam e m o re difficult. T h e ir efficiency was im p aired a n d their rate
reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. T h e foot
officers outside were unable to function a n d in danger themselves so they went through the turnstiles a n d out
again through gate C where they d id w hat they could to relieve pressure by the tubular barrier. T h e m o u n ted
officers were s u rro u n d e d by the dense m ass o f people a n d becam e ineffective. S up erin te n d en t Marshall was in
the m idst o f the turm oil. He extricated h im self an d stood on a parapet o f the bridge to get a clear view. A
drunk en fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a m o u n te d officer. But these were isolated acts by
individuals: the m e n ac e cam e from the massive n u m b e rs single-mindedly d e te rm in e d to be in for the kick-off
with tim e ru n n in g out. At the back o f the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack o f progress as 3 o ’clock
approached. Some, mostly young m en w ho had been drinking, tried to push a n d force th e ir way forward. At
the front, people were ja m m e d together an d against the turnstile walls. Som e panicked as th e pressure
intensified. Som e youngsters an d w om en were fainting a n d in distress. T h ey were helped out through the
tubular barrier by turnstile G o r were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans clim bed u p a n d over the
turnstile building or on to the dividing fence. T his was to escape the crush rather th a n to gain free entry since
most o f them had tickets.

    65. At 2.44 pm M r Marshall radioed for reinforcements, for the T anno y to request the crowd to stop
pushing a n d for a vehicle with lo udspeaker e q u ip m en t to com e a n d request the same. U nhappily, at abo u t 2.40
pm, radio co m m u n ic a tio n on channel 25 becam e defectiv e. For a period o f two or three m in u te s the control
room lost contact. A c o m m u n ic atio n s officer cam e p ro m p tly a n d sw itched to the standby station. W ith the use
o f a handset at control, contact was restored. Despite this hiatus, two o f M r M arshall's requests w ere received.
The Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcem ents, including m o u n te d officers from Penistone Road,
were sent. T h e th ird request, for a Landrover. was received direct by its d riv er PC Buxton w ho arrived at 2.46
pm an d urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. T his was no m ore effective th a n the Tannoy. The
m oun ted officers besieged near the turnstiles cam e o utside the p erim eter gates. An attem p t was m a d e to shut
them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed or at least th in n e d through the
turnstiles. T h e pressure from without, however, open e d the gates again. M ou n te d officers, now reinforced to
greater num bers, fo rm e d a cordon across the elbow o f Leppings Lane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
with the object o f reducing pressure inside the gates. T hey were successful in this for som e m in u tes despite
desperate individuals forcing their way u n d e r or between the horses. However, this exercise was overtaken by a
more d r a m a tic relief o f the pressure.

"O pen the G a te s"
   66. Between 2.40 pm an d 2.45 pm the crowd inside a n d outside the turnstile a p pro a ch h a d swelled to
over 5.000. At the head o f the p halanx con d itio n s had becom e intolerable. T hose w ho got thro ugh were short
o f breath a n d sweating profusely. M any co m plained to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
and asked th em in forceful term s to d o something. Exit gates A a n d B were being shaken. It was clear the crowd
could not p a s sth ro u g h the turnstiles by 3 pm . Police C onstable Buxton radioed from the L and rov er to control
asking that kick-off be postponed. T h e suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

  67. S u p erin te n d en t Marshall realised the crowd had becom e u nm an ageable. Although loth to d o so. since it
was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be o pened to relieve the pressure.
Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. O ther senior officers ou tside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
radioed control to p erm it the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm, whilst M r Duckenfield was considering the
request, gate C o p e n e d to eject a youth w ho had clim bed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
advantage an d ab o u t 150 managed to get in before a m o u n te d officer enabled the gate to be closed again. M r
Marshall repeated his request. Still n o response from control. He repeated it a third time, a d d in g that if the
gates were not o pen e d som eone was going to be killed. In the control room. M r Duckenfield had not m ade a
decision. M r M urray asked him “ Are you going to open the gates?". Mr D uckenfield gave the o rd e r a n d Sgt
G o d d a r d radioed to M r Marshall "O pen the gates". N either the Club control room n o r any police officers
inside the turnstiles were told o f this o rd er before or after it was given or o f any action it would require.

  68. At 2.52 pm. gate C was open ed wide. Fans b ehind turnstiles A to G a n d from the concourse beyond
cam e r o u n d to flow through it in large num bers.

   69. A b o u t two m inutes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gatem a n’s
objection, for it to be opened. If it was not, he said, "It’ll go a n d som eone will get killed” . Permission was given,
but this tim e reserve serials were alerted to m o n ito r the inrush tow ards the north stand. G ate B was also briefly
open e d against the gatem an’s wishes a n d a b o u t 200 o f those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
left.

   70. T h e largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five m inutes it was open a bout 2,000 fans passed
through it steadily at a fast walk. Some may have had tickets for the stands. No d o u b t som e had n o tickets at all.
T h e m ajority had tickets for the terraces. O f these, som e fo und their way either right to pens 1 an d 2 o r left
through the dividing wall to 6 an d 7. But a large prop o rtio n h eaded straight for the tunnel in front o f them .

   71. T he initial influx through gate C. augm en te d by e n tra n ts via the turnstiles, cam e through the tunnel
with great m o m e n tu m . Fans spoke of being swept through, feet o f f the ground. T he 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
their progress. U p o n reaching the crowded pens, some wished to go back bu t were unable to d o so. T he new
arrivals found them selves pushed forward an d the pressure becam e intense. At 2.54 pm, shortly after this
influx began, the te am s came onto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. M any were now
acutely uncom fortable an d som e were in distress. T he m ass seethed abo u t but voluntary m ov e m en t by any
individual was difficult: hands down could not be raised a n d so m e fans found it h ard to breathe. Still the flow
continued through the tunnel causing fu rth e r surges forward. T h ere were sho u ts for help an d for the gates to be
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the p erim eter track d id n o t im m ediately react. In the deafening noise
from chanting a n d shouting they did not at first recognise the problem . Realisation cam e at different m om ents
to different officers in different places.

   72. G ate 3 sprang open u n d er the intense pressure from w ithin. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. T hose seeking to escape were urged a n d pushed back. Gate
4 was open e d by a policem an who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it a n d were directed
to the wing pens where there was still am p le room. Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again a n d then re-opened. At
gate 3. a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his written o rders a n d radioed for perm ission to
open th at gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon him self to o p e n it.

  73. Just before 3 pm . the m atch kicked off. At the sam e tim e, gate C. which h ad been closed at 2.57 pm.
was reopened a n d a steady trickle con tin u ed to enter through the tunnel.

   74. To escape the crush, fans began clim bing the radial fences out o f pens 3 a n d 4 into pens 2 a n d 5. Others
tried to get over the front perim eter fence but were at first tu r n e d back by police w ho feared a pitch invasion.
Near the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the po int o f collapse a n d in some instances death but
they were held upright by pressure all ro und. F u rth e r back, most were so preoc cupie d with the pain o f being
pressed against barriers a n d with breathing problem s that they saw n othing o f the game. But at the rear there
were m any who. although cramped, were w atching the football unaw are o f the distress at the front.

  75. At 3.04 pm. Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. T here was a roar from the
Liverpool fans a n d at the same time a powerful surge forw ards in pen 3. T h e several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens to w ards the pitch. T h e force becam e such as to twist
and break two spans o f a crush barrier towards the front o f pen 3. T he evidence does not establish with
certainty w hen this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm . But I am sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. W hen the b a rrie r broke those w horn it had
supported were projected towards the perim ete r fence. M any fell an d the involuntary rush o f those behind
pressed them down. T h e crushing force was tran sm itted a n d dispersed so th a t all along the front o f pen 3 fans
were pressed h ard up against the low wall an d the wire mesh o f the fence above it.

  76. In pen 4 no barrier broke. Nevertheless those at the front were crushed against wall a n d fence. Further
back, two barriers were bowed and some individuals suc cum b e d to the pressure a ro u n d them.

   77. Surges on terraces are c o m m o n . Usually, they go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight o f
numbers, there was no receding. T he pressure stayed a n d for those crushed b reathless by it. s tandin g or prone,
life was ebbing away. I f no relief came in four m in u tes there would be irreversible brain dam age; if longer,
death.

  78. In the control ro o m no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything am iss in pens 3 a n d 4 until the first
fans spilt ou t o n to the perim eter track ju st before kick-off. T h en , the officers in c o m m a n d a ssu m ed that there
was an a tte m p te d pitch invasion. They called up reserve serials waiting in the gym nasiu m an d all available
officers elsew here to go to the pitch. A request was m ad e to H Q for dog handlers.

   79. S u p erin te n d en t G reenwood, the G ro u n d C o m m an d e r, was by the players' tunnel at the kick-off. He
noticed f a n s o n the track and went to the west end b ehind the goal. As he approa ch e d, he d id not th in k the pens
overcrowded until he was very close a n d saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
situation ” retrievable" if those higher u p the pen relieved the pressure. He clim b e d on the wall below the fence
and signalled with b oth hands to those beh in d to move back. O th e r officers jo in e d him . It was impossible.
Those fans w ho w ould have wished to com ply were powerless to do so. B eh in d them, there were still many
unaw are o f the crisis, watching the game. T he football continued to jo y o u s shouting an d singing round the rest
o f the ground w hile those crushed and trappe d slow ly expired.

   80.   W hen M r G reenw ood's signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for the m atch to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arm s towards the control
box. M r D uckenfield sent M r Murray down from the box to have the m atch stopped via the linesman, the
agreed emergency drill. Before he could do so. M r G reenw ood ran over the pitch to the referee w ho stopped the
game. It was 5 /; m inutes past 3.

                                                 T H E AFTERM ATH

Rescue Attempts
   81. From 3 o'clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and remained so. At first, fans had walked or staggered out
winded an d faint. But the final surge at 3.04 pm. an d the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a h o rre n d o u s
blockage o f bodies. T he dead, the dying a n d the desperate b ecam e interwoven in the s u m p at the front o f the
pens, especially by the gates. Those w ith strength left clam bered over others subm erged in the h u m a n heap and
tried to clim b ou t over the fence. They were now helped by police a n d o th e r fans w ho hauled them u p a n d over.
N um bers o f fans were climbing over the radial fences into adjacent pens. At the back, m any were hauled up
into the west stan d to relieve the pressure.

  82. T h e steps from the su m p at gateways 3 an d 4 were so congested with bodies live a n d dead that each had
to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A n u m b e r o f individual
officers and fans worked frant ically to free those trappe d but the gateways were so narrow th a t only tw o or three
could get at the entw ined bodies Willing h and s got in one a n o th e r 's way. M ore officers arrived from the
gym nasium and elsewhere in the ground. Many used th eir own initiative to help those laid out on th e pitch, to
assist in getting others over the fencing a n d to com fort the distressed. But some stood in groups near the
perim eter fence not knowing what to do. They had been s u m m o n e d in response to w hat was th ought to be a
threat to public order. W hat they found was a hori ific scene o f carnage a n d some young officers were shocked
into im p otence by what they saw.

  83. It was truly gruesome. The victims were blue, cyanotic, inco ntinen t: their m o u th s open, vomiting; their
eyes staring. A pile o f dead bodies lay an d grew outside gate 3. E xtending further a n d fu rth e r on to th e pitch, the
injured were laid down an d atte m p ts m ade to revive them . More a n d m ore walking survivors flooded out on to
the pitch as the players left. The scene was em otive a n d chaotic as well as gruesome. As the en o rm ity o f the
disaster was realised, many o f the fans milling about were bitter a n d hostile to the police, b la m in g them for
what had happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat u p o n an d even assaulted. A small n u m b e r o f
hysterical fans had to be subdued.

  84. A dding to the chaos, a n u m b e r o f press photographers d o d g ed abo u t a m o n g rescue workers apparently
avid to secure photographs at point blank range o f those dying through the wire m esh a n d those laid on the
pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them. Police had to intervene.

   85. At a b o u t 3.12 pm. C h ief S u p erinten dent Nesbit. C o m m a n d e r o f the Traffic D ivision, arriv ed on the
pitch. He took charge at gate 3 an d organised a chain o f officers to simplify an d ex p e dite the extraction o f
casualties from the pen. In the absence o f any mechanical m eans, police and fans together pulled a n d worked
at the wire mesh with their bare hands and their feet to breach the fencing. T hey succeeded in both pens,
enabling officers to get in an d fans to be got out.

   86. By now. som e officers of their own initiative went round from the pitcJi io the tunnel where they met
other officers from the turnstiles an d the west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear o f the pens
to go back through the tunnel. Some com plied, but many resisted, wishing to stand th e ir ground. Casualties
were brought out through the tunnel, an d as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
further in a n d bring out more casualties, dead an d alive. They were laid on the ground in the concourse outside
the tunnel an d atte m p ts were m ade to revive them.

First Aid
  87. T he St Joh n A m bulance Brigade had some 30 personnel posted rou nd the ground for the m a tch - 25
adults and 5 j u n i o r cadets. They were quickly on the scene w hen the first casualties em erged a n d sought to
revive them . T heir Divisional S uperintendent. M r Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help those pressed against the
fencing by feeding oxy gen to them through the mesh until they could be got out.

  88. D r Purcell. Sheffield W ednesday's doctor, came from his seat in the south sta n d a n d attem p ted
resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he moved from patient to patient doing w h a t he could,
but in most cases it was too late.

  89. At 3.13 pm a St John's am b u lan c e cam e on to the pitch at the north-east corne r a n d drove to the
perim eter fence close to gate 3. There was no call for doctors a n d nurses on the public address system until
nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the m inutes ticked past, some o f them cam e o n to the pitch to help o f their
own accord when they saw the casualties and the am bulan ce an d realised the gravity o f the situation. Ma
fans also worked prodigiously in attem pts to revive the dead an d the dying, in som e cases their own rela tn
an d friends. Artificial respiration, m o u th to m o u th respiration a n d cardiac massage were applied by the skill
an d the unskilled but usually in vain. Those capable o f survival mostly came round o f their own accord. T
rest were mostly do o m e d before they could be brought out and treated.

    90. There was an urgent need to get casualties o ff the pitch an d to hospital. There were six stretchers in tl
first aid ro o m and three in the St Jo h n ’s am b ulanc e. They were quickly brought into use. T hen the fai
im provised by tearing down the hoardings aro u n d the edge o f the pitch a n d against the stands so that lengths c
b o ard could be used as stretchers. Improvising in this way. parties o f fans and police ran repeatedly the lengt
o f the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A n u m b e r were dead on arrival there.

In the Control Room
  91. M r Duckenfield stayed in the control room . C h ie f Inspector M cRobbie was th ere in civilian clothes a
an observer. M r Duckenfield sent h im down to the track to tell a policewoman at gate 1 to a d m it thost
displaced from the centre pens. M r Duckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw som eone laic
on the pitch. Even then, he did not realise the n a tu re o f the problem or its scale.

  92. M r M u rra y returned from his attem p t to stop the m atch a n d M r Duckenfield sent him down again to
clear the pitch an d assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. T h is was
because M r Duckenfield could not from the control room see clearly w hat was h a p p e n in g for the milling and
increasing numbers.

   93. T he Assistant C h ie f C onstable (Operations). Mr Jackson, had atten d e d the m a tc h in civilian clothes as
a guest o f the Club. H e cam e from his seat in the south stand to ask w hat had happen ed. M r D uckenfield was
unable to say; he did not tell M r Jackson that the exit gates had been o p e n e d on his authority. M r Jackson went
dow n to the pitch to discover the situation.

    94. At 3.06 pm Mr Duckenfield. still prim arily concern ed a b o u t public order, caused a message to be sent
to H ea d q u arte rs asking for O p e ra tio n Support. T h a t was a call for all available a d d itio n a l police resources to
c o m e to the g ro u n d to strengthen the police presence.

   95. M r Jackson was told by M r G reenw ood th a t there were casualties a n d returned im m ediately to control
to m ake sure em ergency services were alerted. M eanwhile. M r M urray had seen the plight o f those behind the
fence. H e radioed to control that a fleet o f am b u lan c es was required. H e also asked for a T annoy broadcast to
those in the pen s to move back bu t there is no clear evidence that it was made.

   96. Only w hen Mr Duckenfield received the request for a fleet o f am bu lances did he realise the nature and
gravity o f the situation. T hen, su p p o rte d by Mr Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting O peration
S u p p o rt into calls for the M ajor D isaster Plan.

N o Information
   97. Apart from the message to clear the pitch a n d the belated call for medical assistance about 3.30 pm. no
in form ation o r advice was broadcast on the public addre ss system. M r D uckenfield feared that the crowd
m ight turn hostile or might all a tte m p t to leave together thereby ham p erin g the emergency services if they were
given in form atio n about what had h app e ned . The result was that ap a rt from those close enough at the west end
to see the terrible truth for themselves, the m ajority o f the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
N o ttin g h am supporters in the Kop, still thought there h a d been a pitch invasion o r o th e r m isbehaviour by
Liverpool fans. They co ntinued singing a n d chanting incongruously. T h is infuriated som e Liverpool fans who
were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end. T h e police feared violence might result on
top o f the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large n u m b e r o f officers to form a line across the
w idth o f the pitch at the Kop e n d a n d advance up t o the halfway line sw eep ingany Liverpool fans back as they
m oved. T here th e line stood as an insurance against d iso rd er but doing nothing. O th er officers were posted to
the perim ete r track facing the no rth stand for th e sam e purpose. To those distressed a n d distraught who
w anted urgent action, this large contingent o f passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
intensified.

Misinformation
   98. At about 3.15 pm, M r G r a h a m Kelly. C h ief Executive o f the FA. M r Kirton also o f the FA and M r
G r a h a m Mackrell. Secretary o f Sheffield Wednesday, w ent to the control room for inform ation. Mr
D uckenfield told them he th ought there were fatalities an d the gam e was likely to be a b a n d o n ed . H e also said a


                                                                16

f o r c e d t h e i r w a y in.


  99. About 3.30 p m there was a further meeting in the C lub's boardroom . M r D uckenfield went there anc
met Mr Kelly, the referee a n d representatives o f the three clubs. ACC Ja ck so n was also there. Mi
Duckenfield indicated the m atch was likely to be a b a n d o n e d although no firm ruling w asgiven. H e a d d e d that
he did not want people to know it was to be a b a n d o n ed lest th e dispersing crowd h am p er the emergency
operations.

Public Announcements
   100. Later the managers o f the two team s were asked to go to the control room . T h ey were invited there to
make a public an n o u n c e m e n t to calm the crowd. M r Kenny Dalglish agreed to d o so. H e told the crow d that
there were problem s an d asked them to assist the police and those renderin g first aid. He asked for calm a n d his
message was well received. It was then 3.56 pm. At 4.10 pm it was a n nounced th a t the match was a b a n d o n e d
for that day. Again that message was received calmly by the crowd most o f w h om beh a v ed responsibly as they
dispersed.

Fire Brigade
   101. M eanw hile the em ergency services had been in action. At ab o u t 3.10 pm a request c a m e from the
perim eter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the wire mesh. Sergeant G o d d a r d co ntacted the police garage
close by w ithout success. At 3.13 pm. PC Bichard requested H ea d q u arte rs to call the fire service to bring
hydraulic cutting eq u ip m en t to the Leppings Lane entrance.

   102. T h e r e was no a r ran g e m en t for a fire officer to be present d uring the m atch. However, the M ajor
Disaster Plan required all em ergency services to be alerted. After ’p h o n e messages w hich must be described
later, fire appliances arrived at both Leppings Lane and P enisto ne R oad at 3.22 pm . At both entrances their
arrival surprised police w ho were u nin form ed as to why they had been called o r w here they should go.

  103. At Leppings Lane a police Inspector told Station Officer Swain “ I d o n't really think we need you".
Another police officer then asked for m ore resuscitators as people were dying so M r Swain radioed for ten fire
appliances. Each carries oxygen and resuscitation eq u ip m en t.

   104. At the Kop end. Leading Firem an Housley arrived w ith an emergency te n d e r a n d Station Officer
Fletcher in an o th er appliance, each with a crew. T he em ergency te n d e r cam e along th e roadw ay by the south
stand but owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefo re backed o u t a n d w ent to th e Leppings
Lane entrance losing some eight m inutes. From there. M r H ousley an d his crew w ent o n to the pitch with
resuscitation equ ipm en t. They rendered help there an d later at th e gym nasium . M r F letcher and his m e n ran
along behind the south stand carrying cutting e q u ip m e n t a n d oxygen cylinders. W hen they arrived at the
fence, the cutting e quip m ent was not required as by then the last o f th e d ead and injured were being removed
from the pens, M r Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area u n d e r th e police box an d firem en assisted in carrying
victims as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.

South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SY M A S)
    105. Before 1986 there had been no SYMAS representative routinely present at H illsborough matches. T he
 Club was content, as indeed are m any o th e r clubs, to rely upon the St J o h n 's A m bulance Brigade and a 999 call
 if necessary. From 1986 onw ards, after representations, the Club p rovided two seats in th e south stand for
 SYMAS staff at League matches. At o n e stage it was suggested they w o uld be best placed in the north stand
 close to the gym na sium which had been designated as the casualty centre in the event o f a m a jo r incident. T he
 south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYMAS sta ff closer to the players' tunnel should a player be
 injured. These seats were, however, not available at C u p semi-finals. SYMAS representatives nevertheless
 attended at the semi-finals by arrange m ent with the police in 1988 and again in 1989. T h e SYMAS officers
 stood on the r a m p leading to the pitch at the north-east corner. They had o n e am bulance o utside the ground
 and one on standby.

    106. O n 15 April 1989. Officers Higgins and Eason were at the ground with an am b u la n c e an d crew. They
 noticed fans on the track and went to the Leppings Lane end whilst the gam e was still in progress. They began
 to attend to casualties. Meanwhile, at 2.59 pm . there had been a call from Police Constable Waugh at police
H ea d q u a rte rs to the Hillsborough police control asking if am bulances were required. This was on the
instruction o f C hief Inspector E d m u n d so n who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise an d snatches of speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no reports o f injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
ground th at there might be injuries, police H eadq uarters notified SYMAS that am bulances might be required.
T h en , seconds later. M r M urray's request for a fleet of am bulances was relayed to SYMAS. They reacted at
once. A m b ulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane en tra n ce at 3.13 pm and at the Penistone Road
e n tra nce at 3.17 pm. In all. som e 4 2 am b u lan c es attende d. 31 o f them from SYMAS a n d II from
neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm, they had conveyed som e 172 casualties to the N o rth ern General
H ospital an d the Royal H allam shire Hospital.

Gymnasium
   107. T h e g ym nasium had been in use for serving meals to the police. W h e n the M ajor D isaster Plan was
o rdered , it was cleared a n d d iv id ed into two. O n e end becam e a tem porary m o rtu a ry : the o th e r was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed an d im provised, brought in m ore a n d more
casualties, the scene was initially an d inevitably chaotic a n d harrowing. T h ere was intense distress amongst
the inju red an d bereaved: relatives were reluctant to be parted from the d ead a n d sought to revive the m . T here
were people looking for missing friends an d relations: there were recrim ination s, there were scuffles. Som e o f
th ose involved were the worse for drink. D octors an d nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to atten d the injured as best they could in the adverse circum stances. T hose in m ost urgent need of
hospital tre a tm e n t were taken to am b u lan c es as they arrived, triage being em ployed to d e te rm in e priorities.
D o ctors were requested by the police to exam ine each person th ought to be deceased to confirm a n d certify
death. A police Constable was detailed to attend an d guard each o f the dea d an d a photograph o f each was
taken by a police p h otograph er so that relatives com ing to identify bodies could be spared th e ordeal of
searching a m on gst all w ho had died.

T h e D ea d an d the Injured
    108. O f the 95 w ho died, the evidence suggests that at least 16 an d probably 2 1 cam e through gate C after it
o p e n e d at 2.52 p m . T hat is established by the statem ents o f relatives and friends w ho cam e through with them
but survived.

    109. By co m m e n d a b le hard work, a team o f pathologists headed by Professor U sh er com pleted
p o st-m o rte m exa m in a tio n s on all the deceased within 48 hours. T h ey found th a t 88 o f the victim s were m ale
an d seven female. T h irty-eight were u nder 20 years o f age. 39 were between 20 an d 29 years a n d only th ree were
over 50. In virtually every case the cause o f death was crush asphyxia due to com pression o f the chest wall
against o th e r bodies o r fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all but nine cases that was the sole cause.
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture the aorta: in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck o r chest: in the rem aining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. T hirteen o f those were rib fractures. However, on e was a fractured femur, one a fractured
ra ^ 'u s a n d the rem aining three involved fractures o f bones o r cartilages ro u n d the voice box. T hese injuries
5 .      st the victim s may have been tro d d en while on the ground.

   110. Blood sam ples were taken from the dead. No alcohol was found in any o f th e females. O f the males, 5 1
had no m o re than 10 milligrams p e rc e n t in their blood which is negligible: 15 had over 80 milligram s p e r c e n t
an d six over 120 milligrams per cent.

  111. Although the great m ajority o f those who died were in pen 3. at least five were in pen 4. Most d ea th s
occurred at the front o f the pens but there were a few fatalities fu rth e r back.

  112. In all. some 730 people com plain ed of being injured inside the ground a n d 36 o utside it. O f the 730.
about 30% are th ought to have entered throug h gate C after 2.52 pm. T he largest category o f injury was
bruising, especially to the ribs a n d chest.
                                                               CHAPTER 6

                                                        S P E C I F I C IN C ID E N T S

             113. I have given my findings as to the basic factual background an d the m ain sequence of events in
          narrative form. T here was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to som e tim ings and numbers.
          Indeed, the consistency o f the evidence has been a rem a rka ble feature o f this Inquiry. T he experiences of most
          witnesses were unforgettable and n o d o u b t th e early hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
          existence o f tim ed videos and photographs and o f logged an d taped messages provided reliable checks by
          which to pro m p t a n d test witness recollection. Accordingly. I have not for the most p art b u rd e n e d the narrative
          with citations from the evidence o f individual witnesses.

             114. However, there were several instances o f detailed evidence a n d assertions being highlighted by the
          media in dra m a tic an d em otive term s during the hearing. Since some o f those m uch-publicised incidents gave
          rise to unfair criticism, they ought to be the subject o f specific findings. I have therefore dealt with them
j         individually at A ppendix 6.

   11 5. T his disaster was the worst in the history o f British football. It h appe ned because pens 3 an d 4 becan
grossly overcrowded. T hey were uncom fortably overcrowded by 2.50 pm at least to a degree which requirt
that they should be closed to fu rth e r arrivals. Even the n u m b e rs com ing through th e turnstiles in the last I
m in u tes would have increased the pressure beyond d anger po int an d there would have been injuries if nc
fatalities. As it was, the influx through gate C after 2.52 p m so increased the pressure in the two pens as t
cause fatal crushing.

    116. T h e overcrowding u p to 2.52 pm was du e to a n u m b e r o f factors which can be considered broadl
u n d e r th ree heads.
   (i) T h e layout at the L eppings L ane end.

                                 T H E LAYO UT AT T H E L E P P I N G S L A N E E N D

  I   18. 1 have already observed that the layout o f the turnstile area, o f the tcrraces and o f th e concoursc
between them was the result o f piecemeal changes. A b rief history o f these changes is now necessary.


The History
   1 19. Before 1965. the Leppings Lane end consisted entirely o f terracing like th e Kop. In that year, the west
stand was built an d the terraces rem aining in front o f it were tr u n c a te d to their present depth, front to back. As
to width, they consisted o f a single standing area with no d ividing fences. D uring th e early 1970’s, hooliganism
and pitch invasions m ade it necessary to prevent access to the playing area an d the p erim ete r fences were
therefore erected in 1977.


   120. Section 1 o f the Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Act 1975 em pow ered the Secretary o f State to designate a
sports sta d iu m having, in his opinion, a c co m m o d atio n for m ore th a n 10,000 as a sta d iu m requiring a
certificate from the local authority. Hillsborough was so designated with effect from 1 J a n u a r y 1979 by SI
1978/1091. In anticipation o f that date. Sheffield Wednesday instructed Eastwood an d Partners, a firm o f
consulting engineers, to act on their b e h a lf especially in their dealings with the local authority. D r Eastwood,
the principal o f the firm, is a highly experienced civil an d structural engineer a n d has advised several m a jo r
football clubs. He rec o m m e n d ed that a n u m b e r o f additional crush barriers sho uld be a d d e d since those
already in place were insufficient to com ply with the Green G u id e (1976 edition). T h a t work w as approved
and carried out d u rin g 1979.


  121. T h e relevant local a u tho rity at the tim e was the South Yorkshire C ounty Council. It set u p an Officer
Working Party consisting o f representatives o f the police, the fire service, its own bu ild in g surveyor’s division
and its own legal an d a d m in istra tio n d e p a rtm e n t. T h e Working Party m a d e inspections an d consulted with the
Club an d D r Eastwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 D e c e m b e r 1979 for an indefinite p e riod . It has
remained in force ever since an d has no t been am ended .


   122. Schedule 3 o f the certificate sets out the m a x im u m crowd capacity for various areas in th e ground. T he
figure for the west terrace is 7.200 a n d for the north-west terrace 2.900. These figures were in ten d ed to be in
accordance with the Green G u id e (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided f o r a m a x im u m “packing d e nsity” o f
between 54 an d 27 persons per 10 squ are m etres d epe n ding o n the c o ndition o f th e terrace. D r E astw ood had
calculated 8.000 for th e west terrace o n the basis o f 54 per 10 sq u a re metres. H e th ought this a ju stified starting
figure in view o f his im proved system o f barriers. However, he reduced it to 7.200 because th e re were no
gangways on the te rrace and he d id not think it feasible to provide any. So. the total figure for the L eppings Lane
terraces was an d is 10.100.


The 1981 Semi-Final
   123. As already m entioned, there was crush ing at the C u p semi-final in 1981. T h e match was between
T ottenham H o tsp u r and W o lverham pton Wanderers. T he police debriefing m in u te s after the incident
prophetically refer.


  "to the late arrival o f a large n u m b e r o f spectators who were still waiting to e n te r the Leppings L ane
  enclosure when the match started. T h e flash point occurred w hen T otte n h am scored” (at th e K op end) “a fter
  only three minutes. T he spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was happ ening a n d caused a
  crush, which resulted in the injuries” .


  124. T h ose being crushed called for the perim ete r gates to be opened onto the track. T h e r e was no
im mediate reaction, according to M r Vaux w ho was there, but fortunately a police lnspe ctorga ve instructions
and the gates were then opened. About 2 50 cam e out o nto the track. T here were broken arm s, legs an d ribs and
38 were treated e ith er in hospital o r by the St J o h n A m bulance Brigade. It is clear from th e d o c u m e n ts (a) that
the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure o f 10.100 had been exceeded by over 400 (b) th a t the police
shut off further access to the terraces because o f crushing, an d (c) th e police view after the event was th a t the
capacity figure o f 10.100 in the Safety Certificate was too high. T h is la tter view was c o m m u n ic a te d to the C lu b
by the C h ief S uperintendent th e n in c o m m a n d o f F Division b u t it was not pursued.
T h r e e P en s
    125. After this incident in April 1981 the police requested that the terrace should be d ivided into sections.
T h e object was to improve crowd control by reducing sideways m ovem ent. Division would enable m ore even
distribution to be effected when there was a capacity crowd. It would also enable th e west end to be used for
both ho m e a n d away supporters w ho could be segregated in separate pens, if necessary with an e m p ty pen
between them.

   126. This proposal was agreed by th e Club an d the Officer W orking Party and was app rov ed by the local
authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in N o v em b e r 1981. They are the fence now separating pens
2 a n d 3 a n d that now separating 5 a n d 6. T he result was to d iv id e the whole terrace into th ree pens. Access from
the concourse to the m iddle pen was through the tu nne l an d to the wing pens round th e sides o f the west stand.
D r Eastwood suggested and illustrated an altered layout which would have provided separate access through
separate banks o f turnstiles to the no rth stand, to each end o f the west stand, an d to each o f the three pens.
W hilst the m ain object o f this was segregation, such a layout would have enabled each o f those areas to be
m o n ito re d numerically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its m a x im u m capacity was not exceeded. T h e plan was
not adop ted. T h e m a x im u m capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at 2.200. but no alteration was
m a d e to th e Safety Certificate so to limit it n o r was there a n y m e an s mechanically o f coun tin g the n u m b e rs
going into that pen.

The 1985 Changes
    127. By 1985, Sheffield W ednesday had been p ro m o te d to the First Division a n d was draw ing larger
crowds. T h e im provem ent o f the Leppings Lane end was raised again by the C lub and D r Eastwood p repared a
n u m b e r o f drawings. These illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by providing m ore turnstiles
in separate banks an d divisions o f th e concourse. T he police w anted fu rth e r divisions o f th e terrace itself,
again to im prove control and segregation. T here was m u c h discussion o f these schem es which included
suggestions o f 29 an d even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, th e following alterations were carried out in
1985.

New Radial Fences
   128. O n the terraces, two m ore radial fences were fitted. O n e d iv id ed th e existing central pen into the
present pens 3 a n d 4. G ates were fitted at the m outh o f the tunnel to enable each o f those pens to be closed off.
T h e second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow' pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. Until
those two fences were added there existed only perim ete r gates 1 .2 .4 . 5 an d 6. T he creation o f pen 3 required a
new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.

Barriers
    129. T he lines o f the new radial fences ran across existing crush barriers so that w ithout m odification those
b arriers would have run through the fencing. T h e police considered the barriers would be used by fans as
c o n v e n ie n t m o u n tin g points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their object. They therefore wished
s p a n s to be rem oved from the barriers. H a d their wishes been met in full th e result would have been an
u n im p e d e d run in pen 3 from the m o u th o f th e tunnel dow n the south side o f the new fence to th e perimeter. D r
E astw ood d ug his heels in against that proposal which he rightly regarded as dangerous. H e did however agree
to so m e m odification to the m iddle row o f barriers in the newly created pen 3. chiefly to facilitate access.
Likewise in th e new pen 5. T h e 1985 m od ifications to th e pens are shown on the plan Appendix 4.

The Turnstiles and Concourse
    130. At the entrance, m odification bu t no increase in n u m b e r was m a d e at the turnstiles. T h e bank 1 to 16
was d iv id e d from A to G by the metal fence now in place an d that d ivision was projected across th e concourse
inside the turnstiles in the form o f a b rick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through that wall but
was enlarged to its present size at the request o f the police. T h o se alterations were m ade in th e interests of
segregation. T h e m o re elaborate d ivisions which D r E astwood had suggested, giving separate access to each
sub-division o f the ac com m odation , were no t pursued for financial reasons. In May 1985 th e Bradford
disa ste r occurred. T h e south stand at H illsborough had w ooden decking an d the Club realised it w ould have to
u n d e r ta k e expensive remedial works there. T he cantilever ro o f o f the sam e stand was also discovered to
requ ire expensive repairs.

   131. In fact, shortly after the new d iv id in g fence and wall had been built at the Leppings L ane en tra n c e a n d
concourse, the Club, by agreement with C h ie f S u p erintendent Mole, ceased to acco m m o d ate h o m e supporters
at the Leppings Lane end. There was th erefore no longer any need for segregation at that end, but the wall
rem a in e d .
         132. A l s o in 19 8 5 . e l e c t r o n i c c o u n t i n g e q u i p m e n t w a s i n s t a l l e d at all t u r n s t i l e s . T h i s c o n v e y e d t h e r u n n i n g
     c o u n t for e a c h b a n k o f t u r n s t i l e s , f or e x a m p l e A t o G . t o a t e l e v i s i o n s c r e e n in t h e C l u b c o n t r o l r o o m w h e r e t h e

     anyone w h o c l i m b e d over the turnstile.


     Barrier 144
        133. In J u n e 1986. the police requested that the crush barrier nearest to th e tunnel at the entra nce to pens 3
     and 4 should be rem oved to assist the flow o f fans into the pens. They found it caused o b structio n because it
     was in a good view ing position an d spectators liked to stand against it in n u m b e rs thereby blocking access by
     others further in to the pens. T he police also suggested it might h a m p e r effective evacuation through the tunnel
     especially in an emergency. D r Eastwood considered the pros an d cons o f this proposal an d accepted the police
     view. T he Officer W orking Party approved the proposal at a m eeting on 7 August 1986 on site. A uthority was
     given then an d th e re by M r Bownes o n b eha lf o f the Sheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility
     for the Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire C oun ty Council on 1 April 1986. Two spa ns o f the barrier were
     therefore removed, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on A p pend ix 4.

     Effects of the Layout
        134. T he result o f these changes was to divide the terrace into a n u m b e r o f small areas w ithout providing
     any com puterised or mechanical m eans o f limiting en try num erically into any one area if all areas were open
     for choice. Before the fences and pens had d ivided th e terrace, the overall figure o f 10,100 could be m o nitore d
     via the turnstiles a n d in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was not possible strictly to
     ensure com plian ce with Schedule 3 Part 1 o f the Safety Certificate which prescribed a m a x im u m o f 2.900 for
     the north-west terrace an d 7.200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 o f Schedule 2 o f th e Safety Certificate
     provides:

        “T he n u m b e r o f spectators adm itted to the Stad iu m an d to the several areas o f spectator a c co m m o d atio n
        within the S tad iu m shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1 o f Schedule 3”.

        T he Club had to rely upon visual monitoring.

       135. T he situation becam e worse however w ith th e division o f the west te rrace into pens. N ot only were
     there m ore and sm aller discrete areas but som e were likely to attract m o re th a n their a p p r o p r ia te share o f the
     10,100 total. It is well recognised that the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, the position o f the
     tunnel r is-a-ris the turnstiles A to G. its labelling and th e absence o f signposts advertising the wing pens would
     draw to it those with te rrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely th a t pens 3 a n d 4 would fill to capacity and
     indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. H a d D r Eastw ood's plan for separate tu rn stile access to
     separate sections with separate toilet an d refreshment facilities been im p lem en te d , total c o m p u te rise d control
     could have been kept.

                                  LACK O F F IX E D C A P A C I T I E S F O R T H E P E N S

    I 36. In 19 8 1. when the terrace was d ivided into three areas. Dr Eastwood gave the C lub the figure of 2.200
capacit> for the centre pen. He based this on the Green G u id e, making such allowances as he thought right. No
d o u b t the n um b e rs could have been counted in via the turnstiles if only that pen was in use or if such pens as
were in use were filled sequentially, but not otherwise.

   137. After the 1985 changes. D r Eastwood did not h im self give any figures for the new pens 3 and 4.
S om eone on his staff however split th e figure 2.200 into 1,200 for pen 3 a n d 1.000 for pen 4. T h ose figures did
not even take account o f the fact that pen 5 had been carved out o f pen 4 which was b o u n d to have a reducing
effect on capacity. Nevertheless, th e figures o f 1,200 a n d 1,000 were put on a draw ing em an a tin g from
Eastwood an d Partners an d the figures have been notionally regarded since as applicable by the Club and the
police. They are in fact too high.

  138. D r Nicholson, at the Research a n d Laboratory Services Division o f th e Health an d Safety Executive,
has calculated that the figures for pens 3 and 4 respectively would be 1.015 and 1.036 if the strength and
spacing o f the crush barriers had com plied with the G reen G uide. But they d id not.

Departures from the Green Guide
   139. In pen 3, four out o f five gaps in the lines o f crush barriers d o n o t c onform with paragraph 115 o f the
G reen G u id e (1986). In pen 4, nine out o f ten d o not conform . In particular, th e spans taken out o f the barriers
in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess o f the m a x im u m o f 1.4 metres prescribed. O n e gap was 57% wider than
the G re en G u id e m axim u m . Moreover, th a t gap was in direct diagonal line from the m o u th o f the tunnel to the
barrier which collapsed. D r Eastwood justified these larger gaps by the absence o f gangways. Fans had to be
able to get in an d out an d standard gaps tended to get blocked up. T h e effect o f his reasoning was that the
absence o f gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice o f a second safety feature,
nam ely gaps o f strictly limited width.

    140. Again, the removal o f barrier 144 was bou nd, as D r Eastwood con ced ed, to affect capacity. In fact it
d id m ore, as 1 shall indicate later.

   141. C apacity should also have taken account o f two fu rth e r d ep a rtu re s from the G reen G uide. If. as was
the case, the perim eter gates were not regarded as exits, som e 40% o f those in pens 3 and 4 were m ore than 12
m etres from an exit (and there was no gangway) contrary to th e aim o f parag raph 96. Four out o f five o f the
crush barriers in pen 3 an d six out o f nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
were the old barriers which had been repaired an d plated where their bases h ad corroded and fresh concrete
h ad been applied, raising the level o f the steps. T he point is not a c ad e m ic since, in the event, m any fans were
bent painfully over barriers u n d er great pressure.

   142. D r N icholson calculated that when all relevant f a c to n regarding the configuration and the Green
G u id e are taken into account, the m a x im u m capacity for pen .  ilit have been 822 an d for pen 4 ,871 .

Safety Certificate
   143. W hatever should have been the m a x im u m capacities for pens 3 a n d 4, th e fact is that no figures at all in
respect o f th e m were put into the Safety Certificate. D espite all the changes in layout o f the fences a n d barriers,
the two figures, 2.900 for the north-west terrace an d 7.200 for the west terrace, have rem ained as the only
m a x im a with which the Club has to comply.

   144. Section 2(1) o f the Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Act 1975 provides (so far as is rele v an t):

  “ A Safety Certificate shall contain such te rm s and con d itio n s as the local a u t h o r i t y co nsider necessary o r
  ex pedient to secure reasonable safety at the sta d iu m w hen it is in u s e . . . "

   Section 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):

  "W ith o u t p rejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety C e rtifica te -
  (a) shall specify the m a x im u m n u m b e r o f spectators to be a d m itte d to th e stadium ;
   (b) m ay specify the m a x im u m n u m b e r to be a d m itted to different parts o f it;
  (c) shall include term s an d c o n d itio n s-
  ... (iii) as to the number, strength and situation o f any crush barriers.


                                                               24
Section 2(2) was repealed by the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places of Sport Act 1987, section 19, which
gave power to the Secretary o f State to lay down, by         order, terms and conditions. No order has yet been
made and guidance from the H om e Office has rec o m m e n d ed local authorities to ap pro ach their
function u nd er section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See H o m e
Office Circular 71/1 987 d ated 25 N ovember 1987. Annex A. paragraph 6.)

   145. It is clear that when the certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire C ounty Council went
further than simply to fix the m a x im u m num bers for the whole Stadium. T hey prescribed figures for
each part o f the ground not merely by the four points o f the com pass but by specified sections.

   146. Section 8(1) o f the 1975 Act requires the holder o f th e certificate before carrying ou t any
proposals to alter or extend the stadiu m or any o f its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
operation to give notice o f those proposals to the local authority. T h a t obligation is specifically
repeated in Sheffield W ednesday's certificate at Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2). T h e Club com p lied with
the requirem ent. H aving received notice o f the alterations to the pens a n d the barriers, the local
authority ought, in my view, to have a m e n d e d the Safety Certificate accordingly. T hey d id not d o so.

Why was the Safety Certificate not Amended?
   147. Although D r Eastwood acknowledged that the various changes to the layout would have had
an effect on capacity, he did not take active steps to see that app ro p riate a m e n d m e n ts were m ade. He
says he m en tio n e d from tim e to tim e that the alterations would have an effect on capacity a n d that he
did not realise the Safety Certificate was not regularly u p dated. However, 1 find two m e m o r a n d a in
early 1987 highly significant. D r Eastwood's assistant M r Strange was concerned with queries from
the FA as to Hillsborough's capacity for a semi-final. M r Strange recorded these questions in a
m em orandum :-

  "H as any account been taken for alterations d one on Leppings Lane over th e last few seasons? Is the 10,200
  or so figure still correct? 1 said that in my op in io n it needs to be adjusted, b etter d o :t now than later."

  148. M r Strange's next m em o (a few days later) records as follows:-

  "D r Eastwood says leave the capacity at Leppings Lane e n d as it is. providing police have gates u n d e r West
  stand open so that people can distribute throughout the terrace evenly."

Although he says the last nine words d o not report him accurately. D r E astwood accepts the rest o f that
message.

   149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought to have been reviewed and
altered. T h e u n happ y situation is that the police believed even the overall figure o f 10.100 to be too high as far
back . ' ? 1. T h at was reported to the Club but apparently not to D r E a s t v " ^ . M eanw hile, that global figure
had b ^ . . rendered academ ic by the sub-division o f the terrace w hich was          fir   -i in the Gaiety Certificate
at all. If p roper m a x im u m figures had been inserted in the certificate for each o f the pens, the Club and the
police might well have been prom pted to find some m ean s o f limiting the n u m b e rs entering those pens other
than by visual monitoring. T his could have been d o n e by im p lem entin g one o f D r Eastwood s plans for totally
separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It could have been d o n e by insisting on sequential filling o f pens at
all matches: alternatively, by counting fans into each viewing area.

The City Council
   150. T h at the Safety Certificate was not a m en d e d and in dividual capacities not reviewed c a n n o t be laid
solely at D r E astw ood’s door. He was, after all. consultant engineer to the Club and responsibility for the
certificate was that o f the local authority. W he n the South Yorkshire C ounty Council h a n d e d over to the
Sheffield City Council, the latter delegated all its powers an d du ties u n d er the 1975 Act to its G eneral Purposes
Panel. Apparentlv. therefore, the decision-m aking body on b eh a lf o f the Council was th a t Panel, although two
specific functions were delegated to the H ead o f A d m inistration an d Legal D e p a rtm e n t —the power to issue a
prohibition under section 10 o f the 1975 Act and the power o f entry and search u n d er section 11 o f the Act.

 151. In practice. M r Bownes. the C ouncil's C h ie f Licensing Officer in the A d m inistratio n a n d Legal
Departm ent, bore the b ru n t o f the Council's duties u nd er the Act.
    152. T he Officer Working Party was superseded by a Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s A dvisory G roup, but
apart from the change of the nam e the system continued as before. M r Bownes atte n d e d th e inspections
and meetings of the Advisory G ro u p together with the representatives o f the police, the fire serv ice, the
d e p a r tm e n t o f health and c o n s u m er services, and the building engineer's division o f the Council. The
latter was an engineer and ought therefore to have been alive to the sam e issues as D r Eastwood.

  153. T h e Adv isory G roup seem s to have worked in a very inform al m anner. A short passage from M r
Bownes' evidence gives the flavour o f it:-

     "Q     W ho was taking the lead in the working party as you u n d e rsto o d it?

      A     T h a t is a good question, sir. Leads were com ing from several different direction s really.

      Q     Who chaired it. if anyone?

      A     N obody as such. sir. It was an inspection rather than a m eeting as 1 u n d ersta n d it.

      Q     Who decided what should be inspected?

      A     Effectively the group itself, sir. it seem ed to me. T h e r e was also some input from the Club
            representative as to, if you like, an elem ent o f direction as to w hat should be looked at.

      Q     A part from the inspections the working party met. presumably, or d id they only meet on
             inspections?

      A     No, sir, 1 have referred to three previous meetings.

      Q     Who took the chair when it met?

      A     1 suppose it could be said that 1 did, to som e extent.

      Q     T h ere is no point in having inspections unless you form conclusions as a result o f that inspection, is
            there?

      A    T h a t is correct.

      Q     T h ere must presum ably have been som e meeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
            together and decided what, if anything, should be done.

      A    T here was not, to my recollection, no.

      Q    How d id you decide w hat should be done, if anything n ee d ed to be done?

      A    T here were discussions on the site, particularly in relation       to barrier 144. which took place at the
            time.

      Q     N othing more than that an d no record anywhere o f any decisions that were made?

      A    No. sir.”

T h e decision to remove barrier 144 was assented to on behalf o f the City Council by M r Bownes. It was not
referred to th e G eneral Purposes Panel. W he the r M r Bownes strictly had any power to assent to it is to say the
least very doubtful. But he h im self ad m its that he was ill-equipped to d o so. He knew very little about football
grounds. He h ad read the file passed on from South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council an d assum ed all had been run
satisfactorily by them.

   154. It was recorded, however, in a report which M r Bownes drafted that “the con d itio n s (in the Safety
C ertifica!e)give som e cause for concern as they ap p e ar to be in ad equate o r inapprop riate in so m e areas” . T he
repo rt to the G eneral Purposes Panel suggested that new Safety Certificate con ditions should be drafted.

   155. T he task o f revising th e Safety Certificate was begun in J u n e 1986. In July 1987, a draft was sent to the
fire service to which they replied in August. In S eptem ber 1987, th e Panel was inform ed that the redrafting was
      ■•progressing s te a d i h " and should be su b m itte d to the Panel in October. T he final draft w asnoi circulated until
      30 March 1989. 16 days before this disaster.

         1 56. Meanwhile, the Safety Certificate has rem a ine d u n a m e n d e d since 1979. T he enlargement o f the Kop
      in 1986 increased its capacity to 21.000. A lthough this was known a n d agreed by the Council it had not been
      the subject o f any change in the certificate which still showed the capacity o f the Kop as 16.850. Mr Mackrell.
      Sheffield W ednesday’s Secretary, raised the question o f a m e n d m e n ts to the Safety Certificate and in particular
      with regard to the Kop in April 1987 with Eastwood and Partners bu t nothing resulted.

        157. Sheffield U n ite d Football Club was designated u nder the 1975 A c to n 3 July 1984. A Safety C ertificate
      was about to be issued by South Yorkshire C o unty Council at the tim e it han d e d over to the Sheffield City
      Council on 1 April 1986. No certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

         158. T he explanation given for these delays was pressure o f work. M r Bownes as C h ie f Licensing Officer
      was responsible for 32 other licensing systems w hen this one was a d d e d to his burden. H e had a s ta f f o f only
      five. 1 fully accept that the addition o f further statutory responsibilities to the already heavy workload o f a local
      authority with curbs on its expend iture creates problems. But it is clear that the attention given to this
      important licensing function was woefully inadequate.

      Summary
         159. T he Safety Certificate co ntained no m a x im u m figures for in dividual pens. T here was th erefore no
      sanction or provision focussing attention as to the need to limit en try to the pens by numbers. The layout at
      Leppings L ane as it evolved m ade electronic o r mechanical control over num b e rs entering individual pens
      impracticable if all pens were to be available. G iven an im portant m a tch an d a capacity attendance, fans were
      likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 an d 4. Those pens were likely to b ecom e overfull well before
      warning came from the turnstiles that n u m b e rs were approaching the terrace m a x im u m o f 10.100. Control
      over num be rs an d the avoidance o f overcrowding therefore d e p e n d e d entirely on visual m o nitoring o f the
      crowd.

                        LACK O F E F F E C T I V E M O N I T O R I N G O F T H E T E R R A C E S

  160. M onitoring the spectators on the terraces so as to avoid overcrowding involves observing the n u m be rs
and their d istribution in each area, m aking decisions as to w hen an area is “full", taking steps to close it off
and moving spectators from one area to another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problem s. 1) W ho
should carry it out? 2) When is an area “ full"? 3) Fear o f hooliganism.

W ho should Monitor the Terraces?
   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? S ho uld it be th e police?Should it be both ? O r should it be by
arrangem ent, d e pe nd ing upon the gro u n d or section o f the ground in question?

   162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a m atch on its prem ises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at that event. T h e G re en G u id e (1986) provides:

       “ 23. T h e safety o f the public inside the gro u n d is the responsibility o f those who stage the event and
             ad m in ister the grou nd in which it is held, ie the “ m a nage m ent". This responsibility applies in
             both norm al an d em ergency situations...

         195. ...there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. T hese are:

               (a)   controlling o r directing m em bers o f the public who are entering o r leaving the g round, to
                     help achieve an even flow o f people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal o f spectators on
                     the terraces o r viewing slopes:

               (b)   patrolling the gro und to deal with any em ergencies, eg raising alarm s or extinguishing
                     fires:

               (c)   m anning entrances, exits and o th e r strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which
                     are continuously open whilst the gro u n d is in use:

               (d)   assisting police as appropriate o r as requested with crowd control: and

               (e)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency."

The Interim Popplewell Report
   163. T here was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry held by M r Justice Popplewell
in 1985 as to th e responsibility o f the club an d the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his in terim report. M r Justice
Popplewell q u o te d from a report produced for the M inister o f H ousing a n d Local G o v e r n m e n t in 1969 as
follows:-

  “T h e responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is d iv id ed between the police a n d the club operating the
  ground. T he b ro ad line o f division being that police are responsible for movement o f spectators in public
  thoroughfares an d from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the control o f
  spectators once they are on the club’s premises . . . ”

M r Justice Popplewell said he d id no t quarrel with th at view an d went o n to observe that in practice the police
have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (p arag rap h 3.8):

  “ It follows, therefore, that as a m a tte r o f practice, while the physical safety o f the building an d the
  m a in te n a n c e an d good housekeeping o f the ground m ust always be the responsibility o f the club, the police
  have to take the d e facto responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all th a t entails, d u rin g the gam e . . ."

M r Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation o f the gro und as a procedure in w hich only the police
could bear the responsibility o f supervising the organisation o f the crowd.

The Final Popplewell Report
  164. He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 o f his Final Report. There, he cam e dow n more firmly in
favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “ Because, as a m a tte r o f


                                                           28
       practice, police officers have regularly attended in large num be rs at football grounds, it has somehow been
       assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed from
       them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcem ent o f law and order. Those responsible
       for organising a private function, however, have the prim ary and continuin g obligation and responsibility to
       ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises." Mr Justice Popplewell en ded that
       section as follows: “ It cannot be too strongly em phasised that it is u pon the club, o r t h e occupier o f the ground
       who is putting on the function, that the primary a n d continuing obligation rests.”

           165.                         There rem ains, however, the question w hether there are som e grounds or parts o f grounds whe
        club may need to rely upon the police (whom they pay to attend) to control filling o f pens an d m o n ito ring them
        for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they may need,
        and by agreement be entitled, to em ploy the police to act as their agents in certain circumstances. T h is very
        difficult an d grey area as to club an d police responsibility will need to be reviewed in greater d epth at stage two
 s     o fth is Inquiry.

       Arrangements at Hillsborough
 i        166. W hat is clear, however, is that de facto the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility for
 i     control o f the pens at the Leppings Lane end. The evidence o f the senior officers who h ad been con c erne d with
        policing at H illsborough over the years was all o n e way on this point. O nly Mr Duckenfield, w ho h ad not
        policed at Hillsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.




•
           167. M r Lock is now security officer at Sheffield W ednesday a n d was formerly a police S uperin te n d en t at
        Hillsborough m atches occupying M r M u rra y ’s role. He claim ed there had been a formal although unw ritten
 n     agreement between the Club a n d the police in about 1982. whereby the police agreed to steward the Leppings
        Lane end o f the ground. Such a formal agreement is d enied by o th e r senior officers a n d 1d o not accept that any
        formal agreement was reached. Nevertheless, a practice o r arrange m ent d id develop which was known and
 g     accepted by b oth Club and police. Its effect was that th ro ug hout the gro u n d the stewards were responsible for
        m anning exits an d entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for assisting spectators to their seats in the
        stands an d for helping to control the exits after th e m atch. T hey were also responsible at the Kop en d on the
 h     terraces for keeping gangways clear a n d helping to control the crow d which usually consisted o f hom e
        supporters. At the Leppings Lane end, however, there were no gangways on the terraces and the crowd
        consisted usually (and always since 1987) o f away supporters. M r Mole a n d other senior officers accepted that
        it would have been unreal and unreasonable to expect stewards to go o n to those Leppings Lane terraces. They
        would not have been effective there: moreover, they could well have been in some danger from hostile away
        supporters. T h e police accepted, therefore, that the p roper filling o f the pens a n d m on ito ring them for
        overcrowding could a n d would not be carried out by stewards. M any stewards have tended to be either
        extremely young or somewhat elderly. They are p aid only a m o d e st sum (£9 at Hillsborough) and they are not
: 11    suitable either by physique or by training to cope on a crow ded te rrace w ith no gangways,

       Club. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police co n tin u e d th ro u g h o u t the hearing to co n te n d that the Club an d
       not the police were responsible for filling an d m o n ito ring the pens a n d that this was well known to both parties,
 nc    He m aintained that the police were there essentially to secure an d preserve law and order. Q uite apart from the
 of    police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance o f the South Yorkshire Police has not always
       been to that effect.

ice    Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club Limited
          169. In M arch 1986. the South Yorkshire Police A uth o rity o b ta in e d a jud ge m ent against Sheffield U n ite d
       Football Cl ub for m oney due for police services provided at Sheffield U n ite d ’s matches. T h e defence had been,
the    inter alia, that the police were not providing “ special police services". They were doing no m o re than
ICC    performing th e ir n orm al police d u ties o f securing an d preserving law an d o rd er am ongst a crowd. T h e police
       argument was that they had add itio nal duties. In his jud ge m ent, B oreham J su m m arise d the instructions for
       policing as providing for:-

         "(a) the

                                                                   29
H e re f e rre d to th e a r g u m e n t o f C o u n s e l for th e S o u th Y o rk sh ire Police as foliows:-

  "Thirdly. here the police were not discharging their own d u ty to the public: they were in fact discharging the
  C lub's du ties to the spectators whom the Club invited to the ground. T h e C lub chose to invite large num bers
  to their private premises: it was the C lub's d uty to provide for their safety, health an d comfort. They could
  have em ployed a security firm as banks a n d o thers have to d o to protect their interests: they chose to request
  the police to perform those duties knowing that the police expected paym ent. Fourthly, the police within the
  groun d provided serv ices which it was not w ithin the scope o f their public duty to perform . For instance,
  they assisted in crowd m a n ag e m en t a n d in the e n force m ent of such g ro u n d regulations as refused entry to
  those w ho tried to enter w ithout paying or pro h ib ite d spectators encroaching on parts o f th e grou nd which

T h e learned Judge found:-

  "In a d d itio n to w hat m ay be called their law a n d o rd e r role the police were expected a n d did take part in
  crowd m a n ag e m en t, ensuring the safety o f spectators, the enforcem ent o f the Club's regulations a n d to be on
  h a n d to assist in the event o f some emergencies such as fire or accidental injury."

Police Practice at the Leppings Lane End
    170.      At League m atches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to decide in advance how m any a n d which
pens w ould be used. If a m odest crowd was a nticipate d only o n e or two pens might be needed. It was better to
confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent th e m ru n n in g about a n d (b) to reduce the n u m b e r o f police
required. T h e practice was then to fill the pens one by one. T h is involved m ak ing a judge m ent as to when a pen
was full. T here would then be a police decision to close that pen a n d fill another. It was regarded as im practical
a n d unsafe for police officers (just like stewards) to go o n to the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
T h is m eant that m onitoring the num bers in any pen had to be d one from vantage points o utsid e it. Here, the
police were m uch better placed than the stewards. T h ere was a good view from the control box an d the
television screens there. T here were officers on the perim ete r track. N o stewards were placed there because
having both police a n d stewards interfered with the viewing. There were also police in the west stand who
could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give th e police a good appreciation o f
th e state o f the terraces. W hen it was necessary to shut o f f access to the pen s officers on the concourse could be
inform ed by radio a n d could take the necessary steps.

“Find Their Own Level"
    171.      At C u p semi-finals, a different ap pro ach was a d o p te d . All the pen s were opened from the start an d the
policy was “ to let the fans find their own level". T h is phrase was repeated again a n d again by police officers at
th e Inquiry. W hat it m eant was that no specific direction was given to fans entering through the turnstiles.
T hey were free to go wherever they w ished on th e terraces. I f they becam e uncom fortable o r wished for any
o th e r reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
the fans on the terraces would level themselves out a n d that distribution would be achieved without police
intervention. O n these occasions, the gates at the top o f the radial fences were locked in the open position. It
was sought to argue, therefore, that th e re was freedom o f mov em ent from o n e pen to a n o th e r enabling fans to
“ find their level".

    172. This argum e n t was bad both in th eory a n d in practice. In theory, the whole object o f the radial fences
h a d been to achieve even distribution by directing fans into desired positions. To say then that they could move
freely from one pen to a n o th e r would defeat the object a n d enable fans to go from a less p o p u la r to a more
p o p u la r area w ithout inhibition. In p ractice this d id not hap p e n because the position an d size o f the gates was
such that once a substantial n u m b e r o f spectators were in. the gates were unnoticeable a n d inaccessible
especially to those towards the front w ho might have m ost need o f them.

   173. T he sam e argum ent was deployed to suggest that individual m a x im u m capacities for individual pens
need not be assessed since the presence o f the o p en radial gates still m ean t that the terrace was one area. In
practice this sim ply was not so. The photograph at A p pend ix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.59 p m shows
very clearly the congestion in pens 3 a n d 4 con trasted with the sparseness in pen 6. This gives the lie to the
suggestion that the fans could, if uncom fortable, "find their own level".

  174. T he effect o f this policy was th a t whereas at League m atches the police had to make a positive decision
when to close on e pen and open another, at semi-finals, w here overcrowding was m uch m ore likely, the police


                                                                        30
left it to the tans themselves to "find their own level". Effectively. the> were left to m on ito r their own comfort
and safety so as to avoid overcrowding. T he police would only intervene when there was som e o v e n sign that an
area was "full''.

When is an Area " F u ll”?
   175. Over the years, spectators on terraces have com e to accept conditions which are often very
uncomfortable an d not infrequently downright dangerous. They are subjected to buffeting a n d squeezing to
get in an d out o f the terraces. They are packed tightly a n d exposed to surging a n d swaying during th e match.
They put up with these conditions because they are d evoted to the gam e a n d because there is little they can do
about them. They believe the discom fort w ill pass an d nothing very u n tow ard will happen. Usually that is the
case and they are reassured by it. Most clubs have not. until very recently, consulted their sup porters as to their
grievances or suggestions. The practice has been to pack them in on the assu m ption that if they are prepared to
put up with it the conditions must be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased p ro p o rtio n o f seating as against standing
accom m odation. Terraces have still been packed.

   176. It is said that many fans enjoy these features o f terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
discomfort, weathering sways a n d surges together a n d ch anting the sa m e songs a n d slogans en m a sse do evoke
good hu m o u r a n d have produced a spirit or cult o f the terraces which many enjoy. Equally there are m any who
simply endure these things for the football, for a cheap ticket or in deed for the chance o f getting in at all. And
before Hillsborough most fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had not realised th e narrow
margin o f safety between an uncom fortable crush a n d a fatal one.

    177. T he G reen G u id e sought to im prove safety a n d com fort by laying down criteria for m axim u m
capacity, ie defining w hat is “ full” . T h e sta n d ard set was 54 persons per 10 square m etres in favourable
conditions but fewer, down to 27. in less favourable conditions. The tendency may have been to a im o ff too
little from the higher figure for shortcom ings in the layout. Certainly the figures considered app ro p riate in
pens 3 an d 4 at Hillsborough were too high, as already indicated.

   178. Even taking the highest figure suggested in the G re e n G uide, th e problem rem a in e d that those
supposed to be m on ito ring pens visually had a n d have little idea o f w hat 54 persons per 10 square metres look
like. Mr D uckenfteld's opinion was that when a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be “shoulder to
shoulder an d chest to back". T hat view may derive from seeing the sort o f density crowds regularly endure
without injury resulting. But it is m uch m ore dense th a n the G reen G u id e m a x im u m .

   179. T he South Yorkshire Fire Brigade provided the Inquiry with photographs o f people standing in an area
of 10 square m etres at various densities o f packing. Together with my Assessors an d others, I took part in a
similar experim ent at the Health an d Safety Executive's Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a room o f measured
area at densities o f 54. 80 and 100 per 10 square metres. It was clear from the photographs an d from our
experiment that the m ax im u m density set out in the G re en G u id e left considerably m ore room th a n those
monitoring the terraces would have left before declaring an area "full".

   180. T he tendency has been to allow the pens to fill until the fans c om plain or show signs o f discomfort. If
the density at the front appeared less th a n at the back, the T annoy would invite the fans to move forward to
make room for more. T h e evidence before the Inquiry a n d m any anecdotal letters I have received clearly show
there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused
discomfort a n d som etim es, for brief periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
eases and the incident passes unrecorded.

  181. After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final. Hillsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 1987.
There was evidence that the central pens were uncom fortably overcrowded on that occasion a n d again at the
1988 Cup semi-final, although entry to the tunnel was blocked o ff by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
because the pens were deem ed to be “ full".

Fear of Hooliganism
   182. O ver the last few years, hooliganism at a n d associated with football matches has strongly influenced
the strategy o f the police. In their plans an d m anagem ent they have c o n c en tra te d on averting o r containing
threats to public order. This is u n d ersta n dable an d indeed c om m enda b le . But it has ted to an im balance
between the need to quell a m inority o f troublem akers a n d the need to secure the safety a n d com fort o f the
majority. In the police O perational Order, the em phasis was upon prevention o f disorder an d in particular
prevention o f access to the field o f play. T here was no express requirem ent that officers on the p erim eter track
or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed, the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling the unruly since
the less room they had the less scope there was for m isbehaviour.

S um m ary
   183. Although the police had accepted de facto responsibility for m onitoring the pens, their policy on the
day was to leave fans to "find their own level" an d to co n centrate their own attention on possible disorder.
W hilst in theory the police would intervene if a pen b ec am e “full", in practice they p e rm itte d the test o f
fullness to be what the fans would tolerate.

   184. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 a n d 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncom fortable. To allow any m ore into those pens was likely to cause injuries; to allow in a large stream was
c ourting disaster.

             185. The decision to open gate C. an d subsequently gates A and B too. was forced on to the police by the
i the     crowd conditions which developed outside the turnstiles. T he crush was so severe that injuries were being
rder.     suffered and deaths were feared unless the pressure could be swiftly relieved. Why the crowd pressure had built
 st o f   to such intensity was one o f the principal issues during the hearing. T he suggested causes m ust be considered in
          turn.

a ere     The Physical Layout
 was         186. I have already described an d illustrated the a pproa ch to the turnstiles (Appendices 1 an d 2). At
          Penistone Road a n d at many o th e r grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately sp aced a n d with a
          sufficient waiting area for queues to form. N ot so at Leppings Lane. T he building line, the bridge over the D on
          and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perim ete r gates set in an arc, a n d across a short
          forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. T he pairs o f tu rn s t iles were close together a n d the forecourt, especially
          as divided by the metal fence, provided little space for a waiting crowd.

          The Number of Turnstiles
             187. T he decision to fill the whole o f the north stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
          there to a dm it 24,256 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G ) serv ing the terraces h ad to adm it
           10.100. ie an average o f just u nd er 1.450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road en d . 29.800 were
          served by 60 turnstiles, o r just u nder 500 per turnstile.

             188. The G reen G u id e recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which spectators can pass through
          turnstiles depends on a variety o f local circum stances but states "in general based on observation an d
          experience, it is unlikely that the m a x im u m notional rate per turnstile would exceed 750 per h o u r ” . Since the
          semi-final was an all ticket m atch requiring no cash transactions, the C lub considered that a higher rate o f
          about 1.000 per h o ur per turnstile could be expected. Even at th is higher rate, which assum es th e turnstiles
          working at m a x im u m efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly I '/: hours to adm it all those w ith terrace
          tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

             189. T he G reen G u id e provides (paragraph 44):-

            "Turnstiles should be o f such num bers as to adm it spectators at a rate wl-ereby no unduly large crowds are
            kept waiting for a d m is s i o n . . . " .

             190. The Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need, a n d D r Eastwood's v arious schemes, for
          improvement o f the turnstile arrangem ents. The m a th em atics are elementary. Both the police a n d the Club
          should have realised that the Leppings Lane turnstiles a n d the w aitingarea o utside them would be u n d e r strain
          to a^mit all the Liverpool supporters in time. S u ccessdepended o n the spectators arriving at a steady rate from
          .in early hour a n d u po n the m a x im u m turnstile rate being m a intain ed. In fact neither o f these requirem ents,
          which are inter-linked, was fulfilled. T h a t they might not be so was in my view foreseeable.

           I he "I*ate” arrival o f Liverpool Fans
             191. Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 p m the crowd waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5.000 a n d became
          unmanageable. The case m ade for the police was that large n u m b e rs o f Liverpool supporters arrived late; a
          high proportion o f them were d ru n k an d unco-operative: a high p rop ortion had no tickets: all o f th e m were
          hell-bent on getting in on time. They say this was unforeseeable a n d explains why they lost control.

             192. W hether those who arrived between 2.30 pm a n d 2.40 pm were "late" was m uch d eb a te d . T h e ticket
          simply requested its holder "to take up [his] position 15 m in utes before kick-off'. T h at m ay have been
          intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be u n re a so n a b le for a
          standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 p m . W h e th e r they were "late " or not,
          however, there was certainly a large concentration o f Liverpool fans arriving at a bout 2.30 p m an d after.

           1raffic D elays
             193. It is unlikely that traffic condition s had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
          1 iverpool traffic routes. There were roadw orks on the M 62 which was the recom m ended route. A t various
          points the carriageway was reduced from four lanes or three lanes to two. but no serious delays were reported.
O n ihe M63 there were longer delays due to a contraflow and at its ju n c tio n with the A560 there was h e a \ \
congestion due to volume o f traffic. However, the Liverpool routes were clear by 2.20 pm and those witnesses
w ho com p lain ed o f delays en route had nevertheless managed to be in range o f the ground in am ple time

Fine W eather and Drinking
   194. T he likeliest explanations for th e sparse Liverpool atten d a n ce in the ground before 2.30 pm were four­
fold - the w arm weather, drinking, disinclination to enter the ground early and prolong the standing, an d a
tendency o f Liverpool supporters to cut it fine.

   195. T he police em phasised that at the 1988 semi-final there was no com parable build-up o f “late" arrivals.
They claim , therefore, that they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988, although the w eather
was fine, it was 11 °F cooler th a n in 1989. 15 April was the s o n o f fine spring day which tem pted fans to sit or
stand abo u t in the sun with a drink. If you had a ticket it would seem m ore pleasant a n d sensible to relax in that
way than to en ter the ground early an d stand on the terrace for an extra hour. Pre-match enterta in m e n t in the
groun d had been advertised but d id not take place. Even if it had. it m ay not have been an encouragem ent to
m any fans to enter so early.

Was Drunkenness a Major Factor in the Crisis at the Turnstiles?
    196. O f those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very m any had been d rinking at public houses o r had
brought d rin k from h o m e or an off-licence. 1 am satisfied on the evidence, however, th a t the great majority
were not d r u n k nor even the worse for drink. T he police witnesses varied on this. Som e described a high
pro p o rtio n as d runk , as “ lager-louts” or even as “anim als". O thers described a generally n orm al crowd with an
unco-operative m inority who had d ru n k too m u c h . In my view som e officers, seeking to rationalise their loss
o f control, overestim ated the d ru n k e n element in the crowd. T h e r e certainly was such an element. T here were
youngsters influenced by drink and bravado pushing im patiently at the rear o f the crowd thereby exacerbating
the crush. But the m ore convincing police witnesses, including especially Detective S u perin te n d en t McKay
an d C h ie f Inspector Creaser as well as a n u m b e r o f responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this elem ent as a minority. T hose witnesses attrib u te d the crush to th e she er n u m b e rs o f fans all
anxious to gain entry. There was no criticism o f the crowd by any o f the witnesses in the period u p to 2.30 pm
o r even 2.35 pm . W h at happened then was not a sudden d eterio ratio n in the m o o d or sobriety o f those
assembled there. N o d o u b t those com in g behind would have h ad m o re to d rink a n d would have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd becam e packed into a confined
turnstile area an d its very density ham p ered its passage through the turnstiles.

   197. S u p erin te n d en t Marshall a n d oth e r officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police
ex ho rta tio n s to stop pushing and to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In t h a t crush m ost people
had no control over their m ovem ents at all. Two incidents involving police horses illustrate the point. O ne
horse was fo und afterwards to have cigarette burns on its ru m p . Clearly th a t was the despicable work o f a
hooligan w h eth e r in d rin k or not. However, there were also eyewitness accounts o f a horse being physically
lifted off its feet by the crowd. T h a t occurred, as the police accepted, without malice o r in ten t but as an
involuntary consequence of crowd pressure which those by the horse's flanks could not resist any m ore than the
horse itself.

Reduced Efficiency of the Turnstiles
   198. T h e labelling o f the turnstiles in the o rd e r A. C. B was confusing. A fan w ith a B ticket who w ent by
m istake to the w rong side o f the metal fence would have had the greatest difficulty in getting back a n d r o u n d to
the correct side. T he colour coding was inefficient because the coloured wooden panels were affixed to th e
turnstile walls so low th a t they were not easily visible through a crowd. T h e inform ation on the ticket p rinte d by
Sheffield W ednesday Football Club was misleading an d its layout unhelpful, as M r Mackrell frankly conceded.

   199. T he result was that in the early stages, police officers were pestered by fans for help as to where they
sh ould go. Later, as the crowd becam e more dense, fans were presenting their tickets at the wrong turnstiles.
T here were also Liverpool supporters who had acquired tickets for th e Kop end b u t sought entry at Leppings
Lane. T hey caused delays in the turnstile op era tio n w hen entry was refused a n d after a while the police
instructed th e operators to let th em through. T here was further delay because the crush m ade it difficult for
fans to get into the turnstile entrances. O nce there, the pressure from b ehind was such as, on occasions, to j a m
them in the doorw ay o r against the paddle of th e turnstile. Finally, there were fans w ithout tickets who sought
to en ter by offering paym ent, by seeking to go over o r u n d e r the paddle o r by sliding through with a ticket
holder. All o f these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst perio d was only a b o u t 600 per
h o u r p e r turnstile. T h e waiting crowd therefore expanded an d as the m inutes passed frustration grew. Visitors

Were Fans Without Tickets a M ajor Factor in the Build-Up?
  200. It has becom e a fact o f football life that fans d o turn up at all-ticket m atches w ithout tickets. It is not
possible to give an accurate figure o r even a reliable estim ate o f the n um be r w ithout tickets on 15 April. Police
estimates varied from about 200 to about 2.000. T here were certainly frequent requests for tickets o r "spares"
during the hours before the build-up. Many o f those warned off by the police were seen to return to the area.
Some were hanging about on the bridge. Again, however, the police witnesses who most im pressed me did not
consider the n u m b e r o f ticketless fans to be inordinately large. T his accords w ith two o th e r sources o f
evidence.

   201. First, there was a wide range o f witnesses w h o o b se rv e d inside th e g r o u n d that the Liverpool end was at
a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. T h e north stand still h ad m a n y em p ty seats a n d the wing
pens were sparse. T h e match being a sell-out. there were clearly many ticket holders to co m e a n d they could
account for the large crowd still outside the turnstiles. H ad the Liverpool a c c o m m o d a tio n been full by 2.40
pm, one could have inferred that most o r m uch o f the large crowd outside lacked tickets.

   202. Secondly, such figures as are available from the C lub's electronic m o n itoring system an d from analyses
by the HSE suggest that no great nu m b e r entered w ithout tickets. They show th a t th e n u m b e r w ho passed
through turnstiles A to G plus those who entered through gate C roughly equalled the te rrace capacity figure of
 10.100 for which tickets had been sold. T he Club’s record showed 7.038 passed throug h turnstiles A to G.
However, the coun ting m echanism on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE d id a study using the video film
and projecting figures from the other turnstiles. This gave an assessment o f 7.494. with a m a x im u m o f 7.644
passing through A to G. Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the n u m b e r w ho entered the gro und whilst
g ateC was open at 2.240 with a m axim u m o f 2.480. Accordingly, the H SE ’s best e stim a te o f the total entering
through gate C a n d turnstiles A to G was 9.734 with a m a x im u m o f 1 0 .1 2 4 .1 recognise th a t these can only be
rough checks because, for example, some with terrace tickets were allowed through turnstiles I to 16 a n d there
would be o th e r sim ilar factors which have not form ed p art o f the assessment. Nevertheless, the figures do
suggest that there was not a very significant body o f ticketless fans in the crowd w hich built up.

The “C onspiracy” Theory
   203. O n b eha lf o f South Yorkshire police, the theory was advanced that the “ late" arrival o f so many
Liverpool sup porters was planned to buck the system. T h e suggestion was that fans w ithout tickets conspired
to arrive late an d create such trouble as would force the police to a dm it th e m to the m atch. T h e slender
evidence upo n w hich this theory rested cam e from two sources: overheard con versations in public houses an d
the antecedent history o f Liverpool supporters at awav matches.

   204. O ne witness said he heard three Liverpool supporters saving, in effect, that they w ould m anage to get
in without tickets by causing trouble so that police would open a gate, and that they h a d d o n e this before.
Another w itness hea rd two o f a group o f Liverpool supporters say they had no tickets, that they w ould go to the
ground ju st before kick-off that no-one w ould stop th e m getting in and that they had not been stopped yet.
Statements were put in relating to two oth e r small groups talking in sim ilar terms.

Liverpool Supporters at Away Matches
  205. T he South Yorkshire police prepared a dossier o f reports on the b eh a v io u r o f Liverpool fans at away
matches with the object o f show inga pattern o f troublesom e b eh a v io u r by large n u m b e rs eith er w ithout tickets
or with forged tickets. W ithout setting out th e whole history, it can be sum m arise d as follows.

  206. O n three occasions Liverpool fans w ithout tickets were allowed into all-ticket m atches upon paym ent.
(At Watford on 13 F ebruary 1988. 1,500 were ad m itted : at S o uth am p to n on 24 S ep te m b er 1988, 150 were
admitted: at S o u th a m p to n again on 12 D ec em b e r 1988, 750 were adm itted.) At N orw ich on 1 April 1989,
Liverpool supp orters arriv ed without tickets but 1,272 tickets h ad been returned a n d fans from both Liverpool
and Norwich were allowed to buy them for cash. A sim ilar situation occurred at W im b le d o n on 13 M ay 1989.
There were six o th e r occasions from 1986 to date, including the C u p finals o f 1986 a n d 1989, w hen n um be rs o f
Liverpool su p p o rters tu r n e d up without tickets o r otherw ise behaved badly.

   207. Four points m ust be noted, however. O n none o f the occasions when ticketless fans were a d m itte d for
 payment was the m a tch a sell-out. There was therefore room in the ground on each occasion. At a sell-out fans


                                                                                             35
might not expect to be allowed in. even for paym ent. Secondly, no trouble o f the kind alleged was encountered
at the 1988 semi-final when Liverpool visited Hillsborough. Thirdly. Liverpool visited Hillsborough again in
January 1989 without any trouble. Finally, no forged tickets were in use on 15 April apart from three crude
photocopies.

No Conspiracy
   208. I have already found that there was not an abnorm ally large n u m b e r o f fans without tickets on this
occasion. With on e or two exceptions, the police witnesses them selves d id not subscribe to the "conspiracy"
theory. I am satisfied that the large con cen tration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm d id not arrive
as a result o f any concerted plan. T here were. I accept, small groups w ithout tickets who were willing to exploit
any a d v e n titio u s chance o f getting into the ground. They, together w ith the m inority who had dru n k too much,
certainly aggravated the problem faced by the police. But that m a in problem was sim ply one o f large n um be rs
packed into the small area ou tside the turnstiles.

The Police Operation at Leppings Lane
   209. T h e O perational O r d e r for 15 April followed closely that laid down for the 1988 semi-final. T he
e m p h asis was on m aintaining law a n d order. Side roads were to be blocked o ff to prevent dam age in residential
areas. Pairs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent “clash o f rival supporters” . Officers were to watch public
houses, shops a n d superm arkets “where loot in gc o u ld take place". O u tsid e the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
s up porters e ntering did not have banners, weapons, missiles o r alcohol.

   210. U nfortunately, hooligan b eh a v io u r has m a d e all these steps necessary. But the only written prov ision
a im e d at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was one e n jo in in g officers “ to ensu re orderly queues are
form e d". T h ere was no provision for controlling the e n t r y o f the crowd into the turnstile area.

  211. As long ago as 1924. the D ep a rtm en tal C o m m ittee on C row ds stated:-

  “T h e control o f crowds should begin at a point som e considerable d istance from the en tra n ce to th e ground.
  T h e advantages o f an arrangem ent o f this kind a r e ... in preventing congestion at th e entrances to grounds."

T his was particularly im portant at Leppings Lane where the tu rnstile area was so small an d awkwardly laid
out. If a large crowd was p erm itted uncontrolled entry through th e p e rim e te r gates, th e form ing o f queues at the
turnstiles a n d control by officers, w h ether on foot o r m ounted, w ould bec om e im practicable. T hose waiting at
the turnstiles would become a single growing mass. O nce that h a p p e n e d , it would be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  212. W h e th e r steps were taken a n d what steps to avoid this h a p p e n in g was left to oral briefing a n d a d hoc
instru ctions on the day.

Previous Experience
    213. T h e se n io r police officers said it had never h ap p e n ed before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two p revio us occasions w hen the Leppings L ane terraces had been used to till the whole o f the north
a n d west sides o f the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987 a n d 1988. In 1987. the m atch was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 12 noon, and kick-off was po stp o n e d for a q uarte r o f an h o u r because o f late arrivals.

Policing in 1988
    214. As to 1988. there was a very large an d consistent body o f evidence that, on the day. the police in
Leppings L ane conducted an efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those w ithout tickets an d
control the flow o f fans towards the ground. I d o not believe thr.t so m a n y witnesses w ithout e i th e r o p p o r tu n ity
o r reason to put th e ir heads together could be m istaken about w hat they experienced on that occasion. Yet. the
police m a in ta in that no filtering exercise o th e r than on a random basis was conducted in 1988 an d that th eir
policy a n d practice then were no different from those o f 1989.

   215. T he answ er to this conflict must. I think, be that whilst the policy may have been no different, in
practice the policing in 1988 was m ore efficient a n d was not put to th e sam e test an d strain as a yearlater. There
was not so large a swell in n u m b e rs a p p ro a ch in g the ground from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm as in 1989.
N evertheless, there had been w arning signs in 1988. Detective S u perin te n d en t McKay gave the following
evidence:



                                                               36
  "Q Were you aware ot a b u ild -u p o f n u m b e rs last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles?

  A   \e s.   There was a huge build-up aro u n d 10 m inutes to 3 when many, many Liverpool supporters
       cam e at that time. They had been drinking, the ones that I saw and there was quite a sizeable crush
       built-up - sizeable queue.

  Q   Q u eu e o r c r u s h ?

  A   C o m p a c te d queue, built-up in the area by the turnstiles which I believe are m a rk e d A to G . T h a t crowd
      reached back alm ost to the gates. It never got any bigger th a n that a n d the turnstiles operated relatively
      freely an d they dealt with that crowd. Fans were still arriving at a bout 10 past 3 but by then t h e . . .

 Q    T h is crow d that you have described o f the late arrivals at a bout 10 to - was it an orderly crowd?

  A   O h no. No. T he orderly crowd had gone in. a n d when I say they were not an orderly crowd, obviously
      m ixed am ongst those people w e r e . . .

  Q   O f course, but taking it generally?

  A   But by a n d large they had taken a lot o f d rink on board an d they were in such n u m b e rs that excluding
      th em from the g ro u n d was completely out o f the question.

  Q   Were they stand ing in an orderly q ueue o r was there som e p ushing a n d shoving?

  A   T h ere was a lot o f pushing and shoving. T here was an urgency to get into the ground.

  Q   But fortunately it does not appe ar to have been in nearly such n u m b e rs as th is year.

  A   It wasn't."

Police Intelligence in Advance
  216. A part from that experience in 1988. the tendency             o f Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
unknown. Witnesses said th at they get through th e turnstiles       at th e ir h o m e ground. Anfield. quite quickly and
tend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent         te nden c y to postpone arrival was n o te d by the
Sheffield City Council Advisory G roup, with police present,         on 23 M arch 1988. T h e m in u te read s:-

  “As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed o f people arrivin g some 15 m inutes
  before the start o f the gam e hoping to gain adm ission. T his tre n d may b e d u e to the b a n n in g o f alcohol at
  sports gro u n d s which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshm ent prior to the football m atch. As
  the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for the m ajo rity o f the time, an d that the late arrival
  problem could perhaps only be dealt with by ed uc atio n o f the spectators" (sic).

  217. In so far as Liverpool supporters' b e ha viour at away m atches m ay have been indicative o f w h a t police
problems m ight arise on 15 April, most o f the facts should have been available at the planningstage. As in other
forces. South Yorkshire Police had a liaison officer whose j o b was to seek, receive a n d collate relevant
information as to the visiting supporters. T h e A ssociation o f C h ie f Police Officers’ G u id e to Policing Football
highlights the im p o rta n c e o f such liaison:-

  ''It is im p o rta n t that the officer responsible for policing the m atch determ ine s the pre-m atch planning in the
  light o f the intelligence at hand. Whilst that intelligence can be ob ta in ed from a variety o f sources, the prim e
  source for football intelligence is the Police N atio nal Intelligence S ystem which is based on the netw ork o f
  police liaison officers. S um m aries com pleted by police officers o f the hom e club force are forwarded to the
  v isiting club's liaison officer making available intelligence abo u t fans' b eh a v io u r at bo th hom e a n d away
  fixtures. T h is in form ation will be collated a n d m a d e available for future m atches involving that clu b ” .

  218. T h e FA had also laid down in a m e m o r a n d u m issued in the 1985/6 season m easures to be a d o p te d by
the away club which included the following:-

  " l t is th e responsibility o f the away club to advise the hom e club o f the recent b eha v io u r o f their supp orters
  at away m atches, irrespective o f w hether the b eh a v io u r has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
  Association o r n o t” .

  219. It does not seem that inform ation o f this kind was passed to the Sheffield W ednesday Club o r played
any part in the South Yorkshire Police plans. Had the latter been inform ed of the history contained in the
dossier and sum m arise d above it may well have influenced police strategy in Leppings Lane.

  220. There is presently a proposal that a national com puter-b ased police football intelligence system should
be set up to make the necessary inform ation readily available.

Police Intelligence on the Day
   221. T he unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures fo re ntry available from the
C lu b's c o m p u te r an d observations on the video screen should have enabled those in the control room to
m o n ito r the n u m b e rs arriving and still to arrive at Leppings Lane. R adio contact with m obile (Tango) patrols
detailed to m o n ito r licensed premises in the district could have indicated the num bers still to com e. But at 2.30
p m w hen M r M urray told M r D uckenfield they would “get th e m all in by 3 o'clock" he seem s not to have
appreciated that in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were m an y more still to com e. Certainly . M r
M arshall outside the turnstiles was not told and could not otherw ise have known that there were still many
Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.

\ l r M arshall and Mr Greenwood
  222. T he division o f co m m an d between these two officers d id not help. M r Marshall was in charge o f the
serials outside the p erim eter gates in the Leppings L ane area a n d in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
inside an d ju st outside the turnstile area. M r G re en w o o d 's area as G ro u n d C o m m a n d e r e x ten d e d from the
pitch to the p erim ete r gates. He in fact stationed him self n ea r the players'tunnel. He was wholly unaw are o f the
growing problem s at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers w ho were u n d er
pressure there. N o-one in the control room thought to tell him.

Control Lost
   223. In the result, the large concen tration o f arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrained into
the turnstile area through the perim eter gates which were fully open. W h e n that area was full, later arrivals
swelled the crowd out to the forecourt an d even into the road. As already recounted, th e foot officers at the
turnstiles becam e trappe d an d endangered and retired through the turnstiles. T he m o u n te d officers could not
opera te am idst such a dense crowd in a confined space. They c a m e out o f the turnstile area. T h ere were then
the belated atte m p ts to close the p erim eter gates and prevent m ore fans jo in in g the mass until it had a chance to
d im in ish through the turnstiles: still later the attem pt to put a cordon o f horses across the en trance.

   224. Despite knowledge o f the difficult layout, the very large n u m b e r o f fans to be got through so few
turnstiles an d the tendency o f fans to arrive in the last h alf hour, no contingency plans were m a d e to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the day. the need to close Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 pm and the
o th e r available intelligence already sum m arised, should have p ro m p te d those in c o m m a n d to take precautions
against such a crush. If some o f the p erim etergates h ad been closed a n d cordons o f m o u n te d a n d foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow o f fans into the turnstile area c ould have been
controlled before that ;.iea becam e engulfed. It was the crush itself w ^ h produced th e frustration and the
panic an d brought out the worst in those who had d r u n k too m uch '• ../in •• control oi en try would have
p revented the crush an d m a inta ined the good m ood w hich had prevailed until 2.30 pm.

  225. It should m oreover have been obvious by 2.40 pm. if not earlier, th at a large part o f th e crowd could
not be a d m itte d until well after 3 pm. Had a decision to p ostpone kick-off been m a d e a n d a n n o u n c e d much of
the frustration a n d with it the im petus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A c o m b in atio n o f
controlled filtering an d a postponed kick-off would probably have obv iated the need to o pen the gates.

Postponement of Kick-off
    226. At v arious stages in his evidence. M r Duckenfield gave three accounts o f why he th o ught it too late to
p o stp o n e kick-off. O n ce it was that one o f the teams had already com e o n to the pitch. T h en it was that a group
o f photo graphers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the te am s were com in g o u t. Finally, he did not
know whv he th ought the teams were c o m in g o u t. They did not in fact com e onto the pitch until 2.54 pm. two
m in u te s after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a postponem ent o f kick-off before
gate C was op ened. It should not. however, have needed a police Constable in the thick o f the crowd (and there
were oth e rs o f like m in d ) to think o f postponin g the kick-off. T h e need should have been clear in the control
room.

   227. T he truth was that M r D uckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with M r Murray.
K ick-off would not be postponed unless there were so m e m a jo r cause for delayed arrivals eg a ja m on the

    Summary
       228.      The layout o f the turnstiles and the n u m b e r they were required to serve left no margin o f safety against
    an uneven flow o f fans. Because police strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it. the arrival o f a
    large n u m b e r o f supporters between 2.30 pm an d 2.40 pm created an unm anageable crush. The presence of
    a substantial m inority o f fans who had d ru n k too much aggravated th a t problem. Having lost control and
    rejected the o p tion o f postponing kick-off. the police were faced with a serious danger o f dea th s o r injuries.
    They were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gates. S u p erinte ndent Marshall was right at that
    stage to ask for it and M r Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects o f so dra m a tic a step required
    other action.




                                                                                           39

                                    TH E BLUNDER ON O PE N IN G TH E GATES

    229. T he decision to o rd er the o p en in g o f the gates was not a cco m pan ied o r followed by any o th e r o rd er to
deal w ith the consequences. W hen gate C was opened, a steady stream o f ab o u t 2.000 fans p o u red through it
o ver som e five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground som ew here an d unless they were d iverted
th e ir likeliest route was through the tu n n e l for reasons already given. No w arning was issued from the control
ro o m th a t the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. N eith er the C lub co n tro l room
n o r th e C h ie f Steward at the Leppings Lane end was w arned. Not even M r G reenw ood, the G ro u n d
C o m m an d e r, was inform ed. From 2.47 pm when M r M arshall m ade his first request until 2.52 p m when M r
D uck en field acceded to it. there were five m inutes in which orders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not done. In evidence. M r D uckenfield began by saying th a t no officer m ade any
w rong decision b ut he later conceded he h ad erred in this regard. He said he d id not co n sid er w here the people
w ould go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, w hen he could see the influx on the television screen, no
o r d e r was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. M r D uckenfield said it d id n o t cross his m in d to detail
officers on the concourse to shut o ff the tunnel. T hose officers could not have known from th e ir position how
full pens 3 a n d 4 were. T h at was a m a tte r for the control ro o m to m o n ito r from its own ob se rv a tio n s a n d using
intelligence from aro u n d the ground.

    230. Since pens 3 an d 4 were full by 2.50 pm. the tu n n e l should have been closed off w h eth er gate C was to
be o pen e d o r not. T h e exercise was a sim ple one a n d h ad been carried o u t in 1988. All th a t was necessary was
f o r a few officers to act as a cordon at the en trance to the tu n n e l an d div ert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the
1988 closure seems to have been unknow n to the senior officers on d u ty at th e tim e. It d id n o t figure in the
d eb riefin g notes. It therefore h ad no influence on the p la n n in g for 1989.

   231. P lan n in g apart, however, it sho u ld have been clear in the control ro o m w here there was a view o f the
p en s a n d o f the crowd at the turnstiles th a t the tunnel h ad to be closed. I f o rd ers h ad been given to th a t effect
w h en gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the e m p ty a reas o f the wings a n d this disaster
co u ld still have been avoided Failure to give th a t o rd e r was a b lu n d e r o f the first m agnitude.

    232. Significantly, when perm ission was given to open gate A. M r D uck en field d id o rd er serials to go to that
p a rt o f the concourse to m o n ito r the influx towards the n o rth stand. H e d id th is because he feared th a t if fans
w ent to the n o rth stan d w ithout tickets, they would not get seats and, th ere being no p e rim e te r fences at the
n o rth side, they might invade the pitch. T his illustrates again the p reo c cu p a tio n w ith avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety a n d the risks o f overcrowding, Because those entering th rough gate C could n o t get onto the
p itch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to m o n ito r them . T h e possibility o f overcrow ding simply
was n o t considered.

                                                  TH E BARRIERS IN P E N 3

Barrier 144
   233. T h e removal o f barrier 144 in 1986 should have reduced th e n o tional capacity o f pen 3 as already
m entioned. But it d id more. In th e absence o f b a rrier 144. the influx o f fans after 2.52 p m m e t no retarding
structure as it c am e into pen 3. T h e pressure created was free to p u sh fans straight dow n by the radial fence to
the lowest line o f barriers. The pressure diagonally from the tunnel m o u th dow n to b arrier n u m b e r 124a which
collapsed was unb ro k en by any interv en in g barrier. 124a was also v u ln e ra b le to pressure straight dow n the pen
through the gap in the barrier above it created in 1985.

  234. In sp ecto r Bullas, p o sitioned in the west stand, described w h at he saw looking dow n on th e pens
around 3 pm.

  “... 1 saw from the direction o f the tu n n e l a k ind o f m o v em en t dow n th e te rr a c in g ... th e type o f th in g th a t you
  see on the n atu re program m es, the m olten lead flowing down the side o f the m ou n tain sid e, the m o lten la v a ...
  a "riv er o f p eo p le” ... goingdirectly tow ards th e pitch b u t there again sp rea d in g ... o u t.”

   235. D r Eastwood conceded in evidence th a t the removal o f b a rrie r 144 was likely to have co n trib u te d to
the collapse o f 124a. Later, he sought to resile from th at answer, but I t h in k his earlier ad m issio n was correct. It
was argued th a t if b a rrier 144 h a d rem a in e d , the influx from gate C w ould have built up fu rth er back a n d the
tragedy might have occurred in the tu n n e l o r m ight have broken b a r r ie r 144 itself. T h is is speculative a n d I
think unlikely. W h a t remained o f b a rrier 144 in p en 4 d id not cause a build-up; nor d id it collapse. But its
rem aining in p osition may well have acco u n ted for no b arrier fu rth er d o w n pen 4 collapsing an d for the lesser
carnage in th a t pen.

When did Barrier 124a Fail?
  236. C ounsel for th e South Yorkshire Police sought to argue th a t this b arrier collapsed o r may have
collapsed at a b o u t 2.47 pm . His p u rp o se was to suggest th a t the o pening o f gate C was not causally linked with
the crushing a n d fatalities resulting fro m th a t collapse. 1 have already f o u n d th a t whilst the evidence does not
perm it the tim e o f collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 p m . I now give my reasons:

  (a) I have several tim es w atched the BBC v ideo tape on which Counsel relied. 1 d o not find the in c id en t he
      identifies at 2.47 p m suggestive o f a collapse at th a t time:

  (b) the evid en ce o f fans who were n e a r o r at the b a rrier was overw helm ingly to the effect th a t th e collapse
      occurred at o r after 3 pm:

  (c) the biggest g roup o f witnesses was th a t w hich related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley's
      " n ear-m iss" a t the Kop end a t 3.04 pm:

  (d) the ap p e a ra n c e on video and p h o to g rap h s o f fans in the area o f b a r r ie r 124a after the incid en t at 2.47 pm
      a n d before the final crush is n o t co nsisten t w ith it having collapsed so early:

  (e) it is highly unlikely that if so catastro p h ic an event h ad occurred as early as 2.47 pm. the police on the
      track a n d elsew here would have taken until nearly 3 o'clock to realise so m eth in g was seriously wrong.
      Indeed, if C o u n sel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in h is tim in g o f the collapse, the failure o f
      th e police to resp o n d for so long would expose th e m to even graver criticism th a n th a t m a d e in this
      Report.

Dr Eastwood's Testing of the Barriers
   237. Two sections o f b arrier 124a i n p e n 3 collapsed as a result o f th e overcrowding. T h a t collapse caused a
n u m b e r o f deaths. D r E astw ood and his sta ff h a d u n d erta k en the periodical testing o f crush barriers required
by the G reen G u id e a n d by the Safety Certificate. B arrier 124a had been tested in July 1988 a n d passed.

   238. T h e test h a d been carried o u t in accordance w ith D r Eastwood's in terp retatio n o f Annex C to the
G reen G u id e. T h a t requires an evenly d is trib u ted force o f 6.0kN /m etre w idth to be applied for 3 five m in u te



                                                                    41
periods, the interval between ap p licatio n s to be as short as possible. A record has to be kept o f the am o un t ol
d efo rm atio n d u rin g each loading and o f the percentage o f reco v en . If the recover) is less th an 50% alter the
th ird ap p licatio n o f force, the b a rrier has failed the test. If recover)' is between 50% and 75%. there must be a
re-test. T h e qu estio n is: 50% o r 75% o f what? Is the recovery to be in relation to the position ol the b arrier
before the first application o f force o r before the third? If the former, a span o f 124a recorded 53% at the 1988
test a n d should have been re-tested. If the latter, it recorded 100% an d passed. U nfortunately the G reen G u id e
is unclear as to the correct in terp retatio n . D r Eastwood took the latter view a n d so passed the barrier. H e
justified his interpretation in evidence. H e said failure to recover to the original position could be d u e to a
“ sh ake-dow n” effect related to som e giving in the ashes u n d e r the concrete o r to some other extraneous factor
ra th e r th a n to any defect in the m aterial o f the b arrier itself.

   239. 1 think, after consulting Professor M aunder, th a t safety ought to have dictated recovery should be by
reference to the position o f the b a rrier before the first ap p lica tio n o f force. 1 accept, however, that the G reen
G u id e is am b ig u o us and D r Eastw ood's interp retatio n is tenable. It has som e support fro m the British
S tan d a rd s tests on steel structures. Clearly, however, for the future, the G reen G u id e should be clarified on this
point.

Corrosion
   240. Inspection o f barrier 124a. a n d indeed o th e r barriers at H illsborough, by th e HSE showed
co n siderable corrosion o f the m etal at vulnerable points w here water could accum ulate. D r Eastw ood agreed
th a t if a significant degree o f corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a b arrier should be co n d em n ed .

   241. T h e G reen G u id e does not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, inter alia:

   “C ru sh b arriers a n d balustrades should be exam in ed for d efo rm atio n o r any o th e r overt signs o f weakness .

P aragraph 6 o f Annex C prov ides:

   " I f d u rin g any test, even though the b a r r i e r ... satisfies the above loading requirem ents, d o u b t should arise
   for any reason (including such m atters as cracking o f the terracing o r d isto rtio n o f connections) as to the
   safety o f th e b a r r i e r ... a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results o f this investigation
   rem ove th e d o u b t as to safety o f the b a r r i e r ... (it) should be d ee m e d to have failed the test .

   242. Since co rro sio n is a likely cause o f d eterioration, a revision o f the G reen G u id e should make specific
 reference to it.

 Causation
   243. Tests d o n e by the HSE suggest th a t although b arrier 124a passed the loading test in 1988 a n d probably
 would have been able to sustain a force w hich d id not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist the load
 im p o sed u p o n it bv reason o f the n u m b ers in pen 3. the excessive gap in the b a rrier higher up the pen an d the
 absence o f b a rrier 144. Corrosion pro b ab ly played a part, b ut the effective cause o f the collapse was the
 excessive a n d u n an ticip ated pressure to w hich th e b arrier was exposed.

    Observation from Control Room
       244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in th e control room could be expected
    to keep a close watch o n pens 3 and 4. T hey had a direct view o f th em from an elevated position through their
    window. A lthough they h ad no field-glasses, there was the zo o m facility on the TV camera. T h e rad io was by
    then w orking again a n d although reception was difficult d u e to crowd noise an d possibly excessive air traffic
    on ch an n el 25. atte m p ts could have been m ade to alert officers on the p e rim e te r track to watch for
    overcrowding an d report th eiro b serv atio n s. In th e event, pen s 3 an d 4 becam e m ore an d more crowded, surges
    took place, fans were show ing an d signalling distress. N one o f this was seen o r recognised in th e control room.

    Officers on the Track
      245. T h e 20 officers detailed to the p e rim e te r track were d istrib u ted ro u n d the pitch so that som e five
    officers were at the west end. T h eir w ritten instructions m a d e no reference to the avoidance o r d etectio n o f
    overcrowding. T h e sa m e applied to the officers in the west stand. M r G reen w o o d a d m itte d th a t his oral
    briefings also co n tain e d no m ention o f m o n ito rin g the pens for overcrowding.

       246. T h e O p eratio n al O rd e r for 1988 h ad instructed officers to forbid anyone “access to th e track from the
    terraces w ith o u t the c o n sen t o f a sen io r officer (except to receive medical a tte n tio n )”. At the end o f the 1988
    semi-final, there was a m in o r pitch invasion. Accordingly, th at p ro h ib itio n was em phasised in the 1989
    O p erational O rd e r by being put into capital letters. T h e co m b in atio n o f no instructions as to overcrow ding and
    a strong p ro h ib itio n on o p en in g the gates was likely to m a k e police recognition o f crushing slow a n d their
    response reluctant. Small w o n d er th a t th e growing pressure an d congestion between 2.50 pm a n d 2.59 pm
    went u n h ee d ed o r certainly u n rem edied. Even w hen officers recognised there was a problem , the rule required
    consent o f a sen io r officer before a gate could be opened.

      247. " S en io r officer" m e a n t an officer o f Inspector rank o r higher. T h e In sp ecto r in charge o f the 20 officers
    on th e track was M r Darling. He statio n ed h im self by the players' tunnel, the m ost central p osition for
    supervising his men. In evidence he said:

      “1 w ould only take ac tio n if I thought crow ding h ad got to such a stage th a t the fans were in danger. I'd then
      inform g ro u n d control a n d 1 would expect som eone deployed to th e back o f the sta n d .”

      T h a t u n d erlin es the inhibition against o p ening p erim ete r gates. So d id the evidence o f o n e C o n stab le who
    said it h ad been so d r u m m e d into officers not to open the gates th a t w hen he saw distress in pen 4, he “d e b a te d "
    with h im self before o p en in g the gate, thinking: “ If I'm wrong. I'm going to get a right bollocking for this."
    Naturally, one would h o p e th a t c o m m o n sense and h u m a n ity would m ak e som e officers cut thro u g h the rules
    and open a gate if fans were clearly in distress.

      248. T h is is what h ap p e n ed , but not until officers recognised the distress an d even then not im mediately.
    Hence, gates 3 a n d 4. having been o p en ed , were shut again before they were finally opened a n d at first those
    seeking to clim b o ut ov er the fence were p u sh e d back. T h is reaction o f the police d id not go on fo r as long as
    some witnesses believed. They probably m isin terp reted th e h an d m o v em en ts from M r G reenw o od a n d others
    aim ed at persu ad in g fans to move back a n d relieve the pressure as atte m p ts to sto p those clim b in g out a t the
    front.

      249-. Nevertheless, there was a p erio d d u rin g which the failure to recognise the problem a n d the in h ib itio n
    against tackling it caused vital tim e to be lost.

T h e Officers in Com mand
   250. Even when realisation o f the p roblem ca m e to officers on the track, it was som e m inutes before it
reached th e control room . W hen spectators first ap p eared on the track, the im m e d ia te assu m p tion in the
control ro o m was th a t a pitch invasion was threatened. T h is was unlikely at the beginning o f a m a tch . It
becam e still less likely when those on the track m ad e no m ove tow ards the pitch. M r M otson, th e BBC
co m m en tato r, recognised and said, well before the m a tch was stopped, th a t the trouble seem ed to be
overcrow ding a n d not misbehaviour. Still, th e assu m p tio n to th e contrary persisted in the control room . U ntil
M r M u rray rad io ed for a fleet o f am bulances, ab o u t 3.06 pm, M r Duckenfield c o n tin u e d to treat th e incident
as a th rea t to the pitch a n d to public order. T h e message calling up all available officers m en tio n e d a pitch

   251. U n til C h ie f S u p erin te n d en t Nesbit arriv ed , there was no effective leadership eith er from control o r on
the pitch to harness an d organise rescue efforts. N o o rd ers were given for officers to e n te r the tunnel a n d relieve
pressure. Som e officers d id this on their own initiative. A part fro m the Tannoy request to clear th e pitch, no
attem p t was m a d e to clear an d m ark o ff a casualty area w here first-aid could be given w ith o u t h in d ran c e by
fans a n d p hotographers milling ab o u t between th e bodies. T here was no co -o rd in atio n o f the early provision o f
first-aid o r o f stretcher parties o r o f the rescue effort through gates 3 a n d 4. N o req u e st for help was b ro a d c a st to
doctors a n d nurses in the crowd until ab o u t 3.29 p m w hen it was to o late. P robably, th e re was little th a t could
have been achieved in m ost cases however soon doctors h ad been su m m o n ed , b u t there were m arginal cases
where earlier atten tio n might have m ad e a difference.
  252. T h e plight o f those b ehin d the fencing a n d the existence o f injuries were know n to officers a t the scene
from 3 pm . But the M a jo r D isaster P lan was not started until 3.06 p m at earliest w hen th e a m b u lan c e service
was called. N o request for cutting gear o r for the fire brigade was m a d e until 3.13 p.m . Again, it is unlikely that
these services could have saved lives if they h ad been called promptly, but it is possible.
Police on the Pitch
    253. D espite the initial lack o f leadership, m any officers d id all they h u m an ly co u ld to rescue a n d revive the
victim s. M any su pp o rters who gave evidence p aid trib u te to these efforts. It is also fair to say th a t th e n u m b e r
o f officers w ho could at first be usefully involved at the tw o o pen gates was necessarily limited.
    254. C h ie f S u p erin te n d en t N esb it’s action in deploying a line o f officers acro ss th e m id d le o f the pitch has
already been m en tio n e d . I can well u n d ersta n d the rese n tm e n t it caused. However, th e police assertio n th at a
rush by so m e fans tow ards the Kop en d raised fears o f conflict are well b o rn e o u t by th e video tape. In my
ju d g e m en t. C h ief S u p erin te n d en t N esbit was well ju stified in using som e o f th e m any officers called up
p u rsu a n t to O p eratio n S u p p o rt to prevent possible violence. To have had o p e n fighting in a g ro u n d where
som e 9 0 spectators already lay d ead would have been a n u n th in k ab le a n d o bscene developm ent.
Fans on the Pitch
   255. M any fans w h o escaped onto the pitch alive were in a state o f collapse o r close to it. M ost o f those who
retain ed th e ir strength strove m agnificently to assist th e victim s. T hey hel ped pull th e m d e a r ; they help ed w ith
first-aid; they helped carry th e im provised stretchers.
   256. T h ere were fans, however, who were distraught, angry, d ru n k , o r all three. T h e ir co n d u c t in abusing,
assaulting a n d spitting at the police was disgraceful, th e m o re so since earlier police failures h a d little to do
w ith tho se officers now d o ing their best for the injured. In ad d itio n , the re were abuse a n d assaults on
a m b u lan c e m en a n d firemen in the course o f th e ir rescue work. T h is was probably because th e ir sim ilar
u n ifo rm s caused th e m to be m istaken for police. However, alth o u g h the abuse w as w idespread, th e n u m b e r o f
assaults a n d spittings was on th e evidence co m p arativ ely small. In deploring th e m , o ne m ust recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience which those responsible h ad ju s t suffered a n d were still suffering.
False Reports
   257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories rep o rted in the press, a n d said to have e m a n a te d from
police officers present at th e m atch, o f “ m ass d ru n k enn ess". It was said th a t d ru n k e n fans u rin a te d on the
police while they were pulling the d ead a n d injured out, th a t o th ers had even u rin ated on the bo d ies o f th e d ead

allegations although every o p p o rtu n ity was afforded for any o f the represented parties to have any witness
called w h o m they wished. As soon as the allegations I have m en tio n e d were m a d e in the press, M r Peter

                                    THE PER IM ETER GATES WERE TO O SM A LL

   258. T h e p erim ete r gates in the pens were not designed as exits. They were intended to afford access by the
police to cope with any local d iso rd er o r with an emergency. The k in d o f em ergency co n tem p late d was not
massive crushing but. for example, th e collapse o r illness o f an individual. Emergency evacuation o f the pens
had been considered by the O fficer Working Party. A lthough fire risk was m inim al since the terraces, west
stan d and tunnel were o f concrete construction, the fire brigade were the principal arbiters o f evacuation
procedure. T hey a im e d to be able to em p ty the pens in six minutes. T he plan was to evacuate spectators via the
tunnel. If for any reason th a t op tio n becam e im practicable, p ^ d u e to a b o m b threat, then the alternative route
would be along the back o f the terraces, through the gates in the radial fences a n d ro un d the sides o f the west
stand. T he fire brigade were satisfied th a t each o f these routes would enable the pens to be evacuated in less
th an six minutes, w ith o u t relying on the gates to the pitch. T hose gates would also be available, but their use
was excluded from the calculation o f evacuation time.

  259. T he need to provide for speedy a n d large scale ev acu atio n from the front o f the pens to the pitch was
not anticipated. T h e G re en G u id e (1986) provides as follows:

  "209. Access to the pitch m ust be m a d e as difficult as possible in n o rm al circum stances while at the same
  tim e ensuring th a t th e police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose o f crowd control and
  enabling th e pitch to be used (where ap p ro p riate) in th e event o f serious emergency . . .

  214. . . . at som e m a jo r soccer stad ia, w here restriction on crowd m o v em en t form s a necessary p art o f the
  safety m easures, it may be necessary to have a fence w hich prevents access to th e pitch in normal
  circum stances . . . b u t allows for access in emergency.

  215. For m ost m a jo r stadia, w h eth e r used for association football o r o th er sports, the pitch p erim eter fence
  will be required e ith e r to prevent access to the pitch as m en tio n e d above, o r at least to discourage attem pts
  by spectators to e n ter the playing area. G ates o r o th e r access points (m in im u m w idth 1.1 m etres) should
  nonetheless be p ro v id ed for use in an emergency . . . P rovision o f such gates o r access points is particularly
  im p o rta n t to allow full access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a place o f safety in
  an emergency.            Such gates o r access p o in ts sh o u ld be properly stew arded a n d                   clearly
  m a rk ed so th a t im m e d ia te access to the playing area o r p erim eter trac k can be ensured".

   260. G ate 3 was .82 m etres in w id th ; gate 4 was .79 m e tres in width. T here were therefore clear departures
from the G reen G u id e standard.

  261. T he Safety Certificate pro v id ed (by Schedule 2 Paragraph 24) as follows:

  T h e (club) shall arrange for the S tad iu m to be inspected by a suitably qualified C h a rtered E n g in e e r . . . at
  least once each perio d o f 12 m o n th s . . . a n d . . . shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
  the . . . Council a Certificate by th e said C h a rtered E n g in e eras to the cu rren t com p lian ce o r non-com pliance
  w ith . . . the ap p ro p ria te provisions a n d re c o m m e n d a tio n s o f th e (G reen) G u id e o f all structu ral parts o f the
  S tadiu m . . .

  262. It was argued th a t there was no breach o f the Safety Certificate since the G re en G u id e specifically
provides for flexibility. However, in my view the Safety Certificate ca n n o t a n d certainly sh o u ld not be
interpreted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic req u irem en ts as the size o f exit gates to the total
discretion o f the club a n d its advisers. O n e o f the m atte rs for consideration a t stage two o f this inquiry will be
w hether, a n d in w h at respects, the G re en G u id e needs to be clarified a n d toughened.

   263. D r E astw ood explained the small w idth o f the gates by reference to the d ilem m a facing the police. They
w an ted a gate sufficient for its in ten d ed purpose ie police access an d small scale emergencies. O n the other
han d , they d id not w an t a flood gate o f such size as to en da n g er th e prim e principle o f preventing pitch
invasions. In the light o f Hillsborough, this is perhaps the m o st poignant exam ple o f the difficulty o f achieving
a balance between stop p in g hooliganism an d ensuring crow d safety.

   264. Even if the w id th o f gates 3 a n d 4 had co m p lie d w ith the present G reen G u id e stan d ard , they would
have been wholly in ad eq u ate to relieve pressure an ^ release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the

   265. T h e im m ed iate cause o f the gross overcrowding a n d hence the disaster was the failure, w hen gate C was
o p en ed , to cut o f f access to the centra) pens w hich were already overfull.

  266. They were already overfull because no safe m a x im u m capacities h ad b een laid dow n, no a tte m p t was
m a d e to control entry to individual pens numerically a n d there was no effective visual m o n ito rin g o f crowd
density.

   267. W h e n the influx from gate C en tered pen 3. the layout o f the barriers there afforded less protection
th a n it should a n d a b a r r ie r collapsed. Again, the lack o f vigilant m o n ito rin g caused a sluggish reaction and
response w hen the cru sh occurred. T h e small size a n d n u m b e r o f gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So.
in the initial stages, d id lack o f leadership.

   268. T h e need to o p en gate C was d u e to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. T h at occu rred because, as
b oth C lub an d police should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with th e large nu m b ers
d e m a n d e d o f it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. T h e O p eratio n al O rd e r a n d police tactics on
the day failed to provide for controlling a co n centrated arriv al o f large n u m b e rs should th a t occur in a short
period. T h a t it m ight so occur was foreseeable an d it d id. T h e presence o f an unruly m in o rity w ho h ad d ru n k

                                                T H E FA's C H O I C E O F G R O U N D

        269. T h e FA were strongly criticised by the Football S up p o rters' Association a n d o th ers for having
    im p o sed the H illsborough v enue on Liverpool for a second year running. T h e Liverpool supporters h ad to
    travel m u c h fu rth e r to Sheffield than th e ir N o ttin g h am rivals. T h e police required th a t if the m atch was to b e a t
    H illsborough at all, Liverpool would have to have the west a n d n o rth side acco m m o d atio n . T h e d isadvantages
    o f that a n d the d isp a ra te n u m b e rs o f h o m e sup p o rters o f the two clubs have already b ee n set out. Liverpool had
    h ad to knuckle u n d e r to th e a rran g e m en t in 1988. They resented having it im posed in 1989. To hold th e m a tch
    at O ld Trafford would have b een a perfectly good a n d acceptable alternative. Indeed, the FA n o m in a te d Old
    Trafford as th e v enue for the replay should there be a draw at H illsborough.

       270. M r Kelly, the FA's C h ie f Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring H illsborough, b u t the on ly one
    w hich seem ed to have any validity was th a t the 1988 m atch h ad b een co n sid ered a successfully m anaged event.
    He a d m itte d th a t a telep h o n e call from the C h ie f Executive o f the Liverpool Club protesting a n d p u ttin g
    L iverpool's case h ad n o t b een m e n tio n e d to th e FA c o m m ittee w hich finally d ecid ed the venue. M r Kelly
    frankly co n ced ed that "th ere was an elem ent o f u n fairn ess” to Liverpool in choosing H illsborough for a second
    time. I th in k the decision was ill-considered. N o d o u b t in future the FA will be m o re sensitive a n d responsive
    to reasonable representations.

      271. However, it was not suggested th a t the choice o f v enue was causative o f this disaster. T h e only basis on
    w hich that could be said w ould be that, because o f its layout, the Leppings Lane en d was incapable o f being
    successfully policed for this semi-final. 1 do not believe th a t to be so.

Choice of Ends by the Police
   272. T h ere was m u c h bitterness am o n g st Liverpool supporters that they h ad to m ak e d o again for the
second year w ith the Leppings Lane end. But, cogent as th e ir com p lain ts were, they am o u n te d to reasons for
choosing a different gro u n d altogether. G iv en H illsborough as the venue, I th in k the police were right to
allocate the sections o f the ground as they did. T h e d irectio n o f arrival a n d th e n eed for segregation m a d e it
sensible a n d to reverse th e 1988 arran g em en ts would have m a d e for confusion. As w ith choice o f venue, 1 do
not c o n sid er choice o f ends was causative o f the disaster. H ad it been reversed, the disaster could well have
occurred in a sim ilar m a n n e r but to N o ttin g h am supporters.

Police Planning
   273. T h e O p e ra tio n a l O rd e r for 1989 left m u c h unsaid. A p art from th e lack o f any provision for late o r
congested arrivals, o r any provision for the avoidance o f overcrow ding on the terraces, there was a n u m b e r o f
o th e r om issions. For example, there was no specific d e p lo y m en t o f officers to m a n the p erim eter gates. T h e
O rd e r d id no t detail th e duties o f the m o u n te d officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, who included
Liverpool officers to assist in m arshalling th e ir own fans. T h e duties o f S u p erin te n d en ts (especially M r
G reen w o o d a n d M r M arshall) were n o t defin ed so as to achieve clarity a n d efficiency. By a n oversight, the
provision req uirin g m obile (Tango) patrols to assist the em ergency services was o m itte d from the text.

   274. T h e 1988 O rd e r was never substantially reviewed save to reduce th e n u m b e r o f officers deployed in
sh o p p in g areas a n d to em phasise in cap ital letters th e em b arg o on fans h aving access to the pitch. S atisfaction
with th e 1988 event led to complacency. T h a t so m e th o u g h t th e pens overfull in 1988 a n d th a t th e tu n n el was
closed o ff o n th a t occasion d id not figure in o r influence th e plan for 1989.

   275. M r D uck en field was p ro m o ted a n d put in charge o f F D ivision only 21 days before this semi-final. T h e
pre-p lann in g was already in progress u n d e r M r M ole w ho h ad been in c o m m a n d b o th in 1987 a n d in 1988. It
m ight have b een w iser to have left M r M ole in charge o f this o p eratio n . O n the o th e r han d , it is quite
u n d e rsta n d a b le th a t M r Duckenfield sh o u ld have b een expected to take c o m m a n d o f events in his Division
from th e d a te o f his prom otion. In view o f his lack o f experience at H illsborough a n d o f a semi-final match,
however, it was im p erativ e that he be fully briefed a n d th a t he should also b r ie f himself.

   276. He was not inform ed o f the crushing incid en t in 1981 n o r d id he m a k e inquiries which would have
revealed it. He d id not know the a rran g e m en t as b etw een C lu b a n d police for m o n ito rin g th e Leppings Lane

m a tch on 2 April, there was only a sm all crowd p resent a n d he left control o f th e gam e to the Superintendents.

Policing on the Day
   277. O n e o f th e regrettable features o f the football scene as it has d eveloped is the en o rm o u s exp end itu re o f
money, tim e a n d effort in em ploying large n u m b e rs o f police all over th e cou n try to g uard against th e sort o f
d iso rd er a n d m isb eh a v io u r which have b eco m e endem ic. Police m a n ag e m en t o f a gam e o f football h as becom e
a m ilitary o p era tio n . T h e problem s faced a n d the responses received m u st be dish earten in g a n d may have
te n d ed to h ard e n police attitudes to su p p o rters in general.

   278. It is fair to state that over m a n y years the S o u th Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
public. T h ey have h an d led crowd p roblem s sensitively a n d successfully at a large n u m b e r o f football gam es
including m a jo r m atches, during strikes in the coal in d u stry a n d th e steel industry, a n d in o th e r contexts.
U nfortunately, th e ir policing o n 15 A pril b roke dow n in th e ways already d escrib ed an d , alth o u g h there were
o th e r causes, the m a in reason for the d isaster was the failure o f police control.

  279. In all so m e 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I m u st report th a t for th e m ost
part the q u ality o f th e ir evidence was in inverse p ro p o rtio n to their rank. T h ere were m any young Constables
who as w itnesses were alert, intelligent an d open. O n the day, they a n d m a n y o th ers strove heroically in ghastly
circu m stan ces aggravated by hostility to rescue an d succour victims. T hey inspired confidence a n d hope.

   280. By co n tra st, w ith som e n o ta b |e exceptions, th e seniorofficers in c o m m a n d were defensive an d evasive
witnesses. T h e ir feelings o f grief a n d sorrow were o b vious and genuine. N o d o u b t those feelings were
intensified by th e knowledge th a t such a d isaster h ad occurred u n d e r th e ir m anagem ent. But, n eith er their
h an d lin g o f p ro b lem s on the d ay n o r th e ir ac co u n t o f it in evidence showed the q ualities o f leadership to be
expected o f th e ir rank.


                                                                  49
   281. M r D uckenfield leant heavily on M r M u rra y ’s experience. Between them they misjudged the build-up
at the tu rn stiles an d d id little ab ou t it until they received M r M arshall's request to open the gate. T hey d id not.
for exam ple, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check w ith Tango units as to the
n u m b e rs still to com e. They did not alert M r G reen w o o d to the situ atio n at the fringe o f his area of c o m m a n d .
They gave n o in stru ctio n s as to the m an ag em en t o f th e crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they d eclin ed to
p o stp o n e kick-ofT.

   282. W h e n M r M arshall’s request cam e, M r D uckenfield's capacity to take decisions an d give orders
seem ed to collapse. H aving sanctioned, at last, th e o p ening o f the gates, he failed to give necessary
co n seq u en tial o rd ers o r to exert any control w hen the disaster o ccurred. He m isin terp reted the em ergence o f
fans from pen s 3 an d 4. W hen he was unsure o f the problem , he sent others dow n to "assess the situ atio n "
rather th a n d escend to see for himself. H e gave n o inform ation to th e crowd.

   283. M ost surprisingly, he gave M r Kelly a n d o th ers to th in k th a t there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
fans forcing o p en a gate. This was not only u n tru th ful. It set o ff a widely reported allegation against the
su p p o rters w hich caused grave offence a n d distress. It revived against football fans, and especially th o se from
Liverpool, accu sation s o f hooliganism which caused reaction n o t only n ation w id e b u t from Europe too. 1 can
only assu m e th a t M r D uckenfield’s lack o f c a n d o u r on this occasion was out ofcharacter. He said his reason for
not telling th e tru th was that if the crowd b ecam e aw are o f it th ere might be a very hostile reaction and this
m ight im p ed e rescue work. He did not wish to divulge what h ad h ap p e n ed until he h ad spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell M r Kelly the tru th d id not require th a t he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
alth o u g h Assistant C h ie f Constable Jackson w as at han d , M r D uckenfield d id not disclose the tr u th to him
until m u c h later.

   284. T h e likeliest e xplanation o f M r D uck en field's co n d u ct is that he sim ply could not face the en o rm ity o f
th e d ecision to open the gates an d all that flowed therefrom . T h a t w ould explain w hat he said to M r Kelly, what
he d id n o t say to M r Jackson, his aversion to addressing th e crowd a n d his failure to take effective co n tro l o f the
disaster situ ation . H e froze.

The Police Case at the Inquiry
   285. It is a m a tte r o f regret that at the hearing, a n d in their subm issions, the S outh Yorkshire Police were not
p repared to co ncede they were in any respect at fault in w hat occurred. M r D uckenfield. u n d er pressure of
cross-ex am in atio n , apologised for b lam ing the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But. that a p a rt, the police
case was to b lam e th e fans for being late a n d d ru n k , and to blam e the C lub for failing to m on ito r th e pens. It was
argued th a t the fatal crush was not caused by th e influx th ro u g h gate C but was d u e to b arrier 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic ap p ro ach gives cause for anxiety as to w hether lessons have been learnt. It would
have b een m o re seemly and encouraging for th e future if responsibility had been faced.




                                                                 50

   286. T h e p erfo rm ance by the City Council o f its d uties in regard to the Safety Certificate was inefficient an d
dilatory. T he failure to revise o r am en d the certificate over th e period o f three years preceding this disaster,
despite im p o rta n t changes in the layout o f th e g round, was a serious breach o f duty. T here were, as a result, no
fixed capacities for the pens. T h e certificate to o k no account o f the 1981 an d 1985 alteratio n s to th e ground.

  287. A n u m b e r o f breaches o f G reen G u id e sta n d a rd s were p erm itted an d persisted eg the spacing o f the
crush barriers, the w idth o f perim eter gates a n d th e gradient in the tu n n el (1 in 6 as against the G re en G u id e
m axim um o f 1 in 10).

  288. T h e Advisory G ro u p lacked a p ro p er structure; its proced u re was casual a n d unbusinesslike. Its
accountability to the G eneral Purposes Panel was ill-defined. D ecisions were tak en informally an d to o m uch
was left to M r Bownes. In particular, the decision to remove b a rrie r 144 w as not referred to the Panel a n d ought
not to have been m ade.

                                           TH E CLUB AND DR EASTW OOD

    289. It should be recorded that in general the Club has over the years ad o p ted a responsible and
co n scien tio u s a p p ro a ch to its responsibilities. It retained the services o f D r Eastwood as co n su ltan t engineer
an d a b id ed by his advice. For his part, D r Eastwood is skilled a n d experienced in this field, as already
indicated, a n d he sought I have no d o u b t to act efficiently a n d professionally in his advice an d practical work.
T h e C lub also retained M r Lock w ho had ac q u ire d great experience a n d knowledge o f H illsborough d u rin g his
police service. A n u m b e r o f witnesses d escrib ed H illsborough as a very good ground, “ one o f th e best in the
c o u n try ” . T h e police agreed that relations b etw een th e m a n d th e C lu b were good. O v er the last fo u r years, the
C lub h ad sp en t s o m e £ l '/: million on ground im provem ents.

   290. N evertheless, there are a n u m b e r o f respects in which failure by the C lu b co n trib u ted to this disaster.
They w ere responsible as occupiers a n d invitors for th e layout a n d structure o f th e ground. T h e Leppings Lane
en d was unsatisfactory an d ill-suited to ad m it th e n u m b e rs invited, for reasons already spelt out. T h e C lu b was
aw are o f these p roblem s and discussed solving th e m in various ways between 1981 a n d 1986. In the result,
there re m a in e d th e sam e n u m b e r o f turnstiles, a n d the sam e p rob lem s outside a n d inside them. T h e plan for
this semi-final, involving as it d id the loss o f 12 turnstiles for th e n o rth stand a n d large n u m b e rs to be fed in
from L eppings Lane, was one agreed between the Club a n d the police. T h e C lu b knew best what rate o f
ad m issio n th e turnstiles could m anage an d ought to have alerted th e police to th e risks o f the turnstiles being
sw am ped.

   291. T h e alteratio n s inside th e turnstiles a n d on th e terraces clearly affected capacity, but no specific
allow ance was m a d e for them. In that respect, bo th D r Eastw ood and the C lu b should have taken a more
positive ap p ro a ch . Either a schem e such a s o ne o f those D r E astw ood p u t forw ard should have been ad o p te d
giving m o r e turnstiles a n d total separation o f areas o r at the very least th e capacity o f the new p en s a n d o f the
terraces as a whole should have been treated m o re cautiously. T h e police view in 1981 that 10.100 was too high
a figure was known to the Club (although D r Eastwood says n o t to him). Yet, d esp ite th a t and the sub-division
into pens, th e figure remained.

   292. A lthough the police h ad assum ed responsibility for m o n ito rin g the pens, th e Club h ad a d u ty to its
visitors a n d the C lu b ’s officials ought to have alerted the police to the grossly u n ev en d istrib utio n o f fans on the
terraces. T h e C lub operated a n d read the closed circuit television a n d the c o m p u te r totaliser. Liaison between
C lub a n d police on the day failed to alert th e latter to th e n u m b e r o f Liverpool su p p o rters still to com e. T he
o n u s h ere was on th e Club as well as on the police.

    293. T h e rem oval o f b arrier 144 was th e responsibility o f th e C lu b although it clearly acted on the advice o f
 D r E astw ood a n d th e Advisory G ro u p w hich in this instance was misguided.

   294. Likewise, the breaches o f the G reen G u id e were m atte rs           > i :h m e C lu b sho u ld have ap p reciated and
 rem edied.

    295. Lastly, as already indicated, the p o o r signposting on th e concourse te n d e d to produce under-filling o f
 th e w ing p en s a n d over-filling o f pens 3 a n d 4. Poor signposting o u tsid e th e tu rn stiles a n d the unhelpful form at
 o f the tickets also led to confusion aggravating the b u ild -u p in th e tu rn stile area.

    No Fault by th e Emergency Services
       296. 1 say at the o utset o f this ch ap ter that no valid criticism can be m a d e o f the response by th e St John
    A m bulance Brigade, by SYM AS o r by th e fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no rep resen ted p arty v entured any
    criticism o f them . T h e only attack on SYM AS ca m e from two Liverpool doctors. O n e claim ed that am b u lan ces
    did not arriv e swiftly or w ith sufficient e q u ip m en t an d that there was a lack o f triage. H e was proved to be
    wrong in all three respects. U nfortunately he h ad seen fit to go on television o n 15 April w hen he said more
    lives could have been saved if sta ff and e q u ip m en t h ad arrived earlier. A part fro m being proved w rong in fact
    as to the tim es o f arrival o f am bulances, he co nceded in evidence th a t it was not possible to say w h eth er lives
    could have been saved. H is co m m en ts on television were irresponsible. T h e o th e r d o c to r co m p lain ed o f the
    absence o f defibrillators. 1 a m satisfied on overw helm ing evidence th a t to atte m p t to use a defibrillator on the
    pitch w ith people m illing a b o u t would have been highly d angerous owing to the risk o f injury'from the electric
    charge.

      297. 1 find that all three o f the emergency services n am ed above responded p ro m p tly when alerted, that
    they brought ap p ro p ria te eq u ip m e n t a n d that th e ir personnel o p e ra te d efficiently.

      298. It w ould be u n reaso n ab le to expect, at any sports sta d iu m , m edical facilities capable o f dealing w ith a
    major d isa ste r such as occurred. To have in advance at th e g ro u n d , oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, o th er
    eq u ip m en t a n d m edical staff sufficient to d eal w ith over 100 casualties is not practicable.

      299. W h a t is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid. for professional m edical atten tio n a n d for
    am bulance atten d a n ce , together with a system o f co -ord in atio n w ith the em ergency services w hich will bring
    them to the scene swiftly in w hatever n u m b e rs are required. W h a t will a m o u n t to a n a p p ro p riate basic
    provision for the f u t u r e ^ the eq u ip m en t in a first aid room , req u ires expert ev alu a tio n a n d advice.

       300. O n th e day, there was no clear u n d ersta n d in g betw een the Club a n d D r Purcell as to his role. H e
    believed he was p rim arily there to attend to the players. T h e C lu b regarded him also as the “physician available
    to attend at the first aid ro o m if required", as laid dow n in the Safety C ertificate.

      301. T h ere was insufficiently close co-operation betw een the p olice an d th e em ergency services. It is clear
    that SYM AS a n d th e fire brigade should have been called earlier th an they were. However, in view o f the n atu re
    and extent o f the crushing, the tim e when police rescue began a n d the pathetically sh o rt period for w hich those
    unable to b rea th e could survive, it is im probable that qu ick er recourse to the em ergency services would have
    saved m o re lives.

       302. Finally, there was evidence that a n advertising b oard h ad to b e k n c - 1 -I dow n at th e north -east co rn e r
    o f ihe g ro u n d to allow an am b u lan ce onto the pitch an d that at th e top o      r? m p leading to th e pitch th e
    access for am b u lan c es was inadequate. T h ere was also evid ence that th e p re-m atch arran g e m en t for
    am bulances to use th e tw o gates from P enistone Road at the north-east end o f the ground as in an d o u t routes
    was frustrated by the presence o f vehicles just inside the ground. In the event, n o n e o f these m atte rs affected
    operations. T he h o ard in g was quickly knocked down. T h e difficult access to the ram p was negotiated an d
    am bulances used o n e e n tra n ce satisfactorily by backing out w hen loaded.




                                                                53

   303.       O n e p roblem which im p ed ed police control and the gathering o f intelligence was the in term itten t
failure o f c o m m u n ic atio n by radio. There was the period o f two or three m inutes w hen the control room was
out o f rad io contact. Even when that was rem edied, it was only by using a h and set in the control room . This
m ean t that control could not override any o th e r messages. N o effective radio c o m m u n ic atio n seem s to have
reached control from the perim eter track at the relevant time. M r G reen w o o d 's request for the m a tch to be
sto p p ed a n d various messages from C onstables reporting th e distress in the pens d id not register. Likewise,
co m m u n ic a tio n from Leppings Lane to control was unreliable. U n d o u b ted ly these breakdowns m a d e it more
difficult for those in c o m m an d to m a k e p ro p er assessm ents a n d exercise effective co m m an d .

Limited Objectives
   304. It is im p o rtant to stress the lim ited objectives o f the interim re c o m m e n d atio n s 1 can make in this
Report. M> p u rp o se is to propose instant m easures capabie o f being im p lem en ted forthw ith and where
possible before the c o m m en c em en t o f the 1989/1990 season. T hey are designed to prevent overcrow ding an d
crushing on terraces in th e short term a n d to im prove safety procedures. They d o not and can n o t m eet all the
p roblem s o r ad d ress all th e issues o f post-H illsborough football. W ider issues such as m em b ersh ip schemes,
identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia an d lo n gterm re c o m m e n d a tio n s fall to be considered in my Final
Report. So d o a n u m b e r o f o th e r specific m atters such as a co m p re h en siv e review o f the G reen G u id e, the
problem o f excessive pre-m atch drinking, fans w ith o u t tickets an d ticket touts. I m ention these m atters lest it
be th o u g h t I have decided no re c o m m e n d atio n s need be m a d e concernin g them , I have not. But before
deciding w hat if any rec o m m e n d atio n s to m ake ab o u t these a n d o th e r m atters, m o re evidence a n d study is
required.

   305. Accordingly, the m ain thrust o f these interim rec o m m e n d atio n s, as a holding exercise, is to reduce
n u m b ers on th e terraces, to increase vigilance an d to achieve a p ro p e r balance in crowd co n tro l between
p revention o f d iso rd er a n d m a in ten an ce o f safety.


Perimeter Fences
   306. It would be im practical and unwise to rec o m m e n d w orks o f co n stru c tio n o r radical structu ral changes
now. before com pleting the extensive study a n d consultation w hich will form stage tw o o f this Inquiry. Hasty
interim re c o m m e n d a tio n s o f that kind might well prove to be ill-judged after fu rth e r study a n d require to be
changed in a m a t t e r o f m onths.

   307. In particular, 1 do not at this stage m ake any re c o m m e n d a tio n as to rem oving perim eter fences or
replacing th e m w ith stru ctu res o f different design. U nderstandably, th e re was a wave o f p o p u la r feeling against
such fences in the im m ed iate afterm ath o f H illsborough. T h e horrifying spectacle o f people being crushed
against th e fencing focussed blam e for the disaster on the fences themselves. T h ere were pleas to dism an tle
them a n d em o tive references to the fans being treated like "caged an im a ls ” . S om e clubs rem oved th e ir fencing
straightawav. It was therefore very tem p tin g to consider at an early stage m aking a re c o m m e n d atio n th a t the
fences should be removed. I confess to being so tem pted.

  308. Regrettably, only a m onth after H illsborough, there were incidents w hich showed th a t violence and
hooliganism are still liable to erupt at football grounds. O n 13 May at Selhurst Park. B irm in g h am City
supporters invaded the pitch and fought w ith supporters o f th e h o m e club. Crystal Palace. Five police officers
and 16 su p p o rters were in i"re d and required trea tm e n t at a local hospital. O n the sam e day a t a m a tch between
Bristol City and Sheffield I nited. spectators spilt o n to the pitch a n d there > ;u i i ' iigonth^: terraces. At the
Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton on 20 May. th e re was a pitch invasion, albeit a com paratively
benign one.

   309. Even the Football Supporters' Association (FSA) felt it necessary to say in their final subm ission.

        " W ith som e reservations, the FSA accept that p erim ete r fences are necessary for crowd control."

   310. Bearing in m in d those matters, an d the need to c o n sid er fu rth e r expert evidence. I have decided that it
would be unwise and p rem a tu re for me to m ak e any rec o m m e n d a tio n s now eith er to remove o r to preserve or
to alter the structure o f p erim eter fences. I shall make re c o m m e n d a tio n s ab o u t th e m in my Final Report.

   311. For the present. I would e m p h asise that, although the fencing prevented escape, th e real cause o f the
 H illsborough disaster was overcrowding and it is against th a t d an g e r th at my interim re c o m m e n d atio n s are
 prim arily directed. W hilst declining to reco m m en d the rem oval o f the fences. I d o consider th a t th e gates to the
 pitch should be kept o p en whilst the terraces are occupied. T h is will have. I hope, three beneficial effects.
 Obviously, an open gate is a more ready escape route th an o n e w hich has to be locked. Secondly, the sight o f
 open gates will be reassuring to spectators on the terraces. Thirdly, the existence o f gaps in the fencing by
 reason o f the o pen gates will concentrate the m inds o f police officers or stew ards on the track to the need for
 careful m o n ito rin g o f those on the terraces,


                                                              55

Reduced Numbers
   313. In the assessm ent o f figures for capacity, the criteria in C h a p te r 16 o f the G reen G u id e were n o t at
Hillsborough, a n d m ay not elsewhere, have been applied with sufficient rigour. Therefore, in a d d itio n to

    314.        T h e Safety Certificate pro ced u re should, if it is properly ad m in is te re d and enforced, go far tow ards

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
*         1. W here a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
        should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

        A pen or area is to be deemed “ self-contained" notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
        another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

*        2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
        Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

        (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure", proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
            which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
            in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

        (b) after assessing “ the Green Guide figure", a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
            margin.

*        3. Arrangements should be made:-

        (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
            figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
            ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherw ise, and

        (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
★         4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
        responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
        , *her terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
        variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

★         5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
        area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
        sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
        period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
        or police presence. H e should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
        below, and by radio to the control room.


Fences and Gates
          6.    All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
        duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
        crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
        demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
        different crowd densities.

    ★      7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
        different colour from the rest of the fence an** marked “ Emergency Exit” .



                                                              57
*    8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    when spectators are on the terrace.

*     9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
    The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity . H e should be able to make radio contact w ith the control room
    either him self or via an officer close at hand.

*     10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
    brigade or stew ards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W hether to use it should be a decision of a
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
★    11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

       12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    com plies w ith the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessm ent o f the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority . Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority w ithin whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthw ith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually .


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, mt itoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the local authority 's rules.

       17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
    of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, o f the club and o f a recognised supporters' club. T he Advisory Group's terms of
    reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written reports for consideration by the local authority.


Duties of each Football Club
★     18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
    inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
    anticipated.


                                                          58
★         19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
        as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
        turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity o f that viewing area should be reduced
        accordingly.

★         20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
        reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
        operators for this purpose.

          21.    Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
        concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

★         22. A ll signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
        reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, sim ple
        and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement o f spectators to their appropriate viewing
        area.

★         23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
        the information provided in respect o f each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
        should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

★        24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
        by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
        admitting spectators to the ground.

          25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters' club as to the provision of pre-match
        entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
★         26. The C hief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
        should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management o f each football club and local authority
        concerned in respect of the safety and control o f crowds.

★         27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
        officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
        is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

★        28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
        any foreseeable pattern in the arrival o f spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
        sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

    ★    29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
        Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

           30.     There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
        monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
        at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
        in the interpretation and use o f these data.


    Communications
           31.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
         received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such a s to give operators in the control room
         priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the sam e channel. Additional channels should be
         used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
         sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.




                                                             59
      32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
    with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

      33. W ithin the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
    areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
    announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
    noise in the ground. T his arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
    match.

      34. U se should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
    Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
    the control room the existence o f certain emergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
★      35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
    liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★     36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
    ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number o f
    spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
    concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
    rooms o f each of the emergency services.

★     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
    services should be reviewed. They should include routes o f access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
    within the ground itself.

★     38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
    the arrival of emergency services and should be informed w hen such services are called as to w here and why
    they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
★      39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
    club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

      40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
    equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
    medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

★     41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at e&ch match and available to deal w ith
    any medical exigency at the ground. H e should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. H e should be
    present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until h a lf an hour after the end of the
    m atch. H is whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
    contactable.

★      42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
    attendance at all matches with an expected crowd o f 5,000 or more.

      43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
    be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement of the Safety Certificate.

                                                  S P E C I F I C IN C ID E N T S

M r H icks' Evidence
    1. M r and M rs H icks' two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived early en famille but had tickets
for different sections. T h e tw o daughters had standing tickets: they went into pen 3. Mrs Hicks h ad a seat in the
n o rth stand. M r Hicks took up a standing position in pen I just below an d to the west o f th e police box at ab o u t
2.1 5 p m F rom there, he h ad a view o f the centre pens. He kept an eye o n th e m as they filled up since he knew his
d au g h ters to be there.

    2. His evidence was that by 2.50 p m he could see people were in distress. At ab o u t 2.55 p m he and others
called to a senior police officer at the to p o f the steps to the control box to d raw his atten tio n to th e crushing. M r
Hicks was only ab o u t 10 feet from the officer. H e d escribed h im as w earing a flat cap w ith gold o r silver b raid
a n d a light coloured anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officer who sto p p ed th e m atch. M r G reenw ood, w h o
d id stop the m atch, was certainly not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can clearly be seen on th e video.

  3. M r Hicks says that he and others shouted several tim es to this officer in a ttem p ts to alert him to th e
distress in the pens. T h ere was no reaction although M r Hicks believes th e officer m ust have been in earshot.

   4. T h a t officer d escended from the steps an d tw o cam e ra m e n w h o m M r Hicks believed were from
television ca m e a n d ap p e are d to direct their cam eras towards the pens. A n o th er sen io r officer ap p eared two
steps down from th e platform . He was a stocky figure; he also wore a flat cap b u t w ith black braid, M r H icks
says th a t he an d two o r three others tried several tim es to ca p tu re this officer’s a tte n tio n w ith o u t success. T h en
M r Hicks says he sh o u ted “ For Christ's sake! C an’t you see w h at’s going o n? We can, a n d you have cam eras” . T h e
officer is said to have replied dismissively “Shut your fucking p rattle” .

   5. W hen the disaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. V ictoria was p u t in an am b u lan ce a n d M r
H icks ac c o m p a n ie d h e r to hospital w here she was found to be dead, Sarah d ied at the g round.

   6. M r Hicks was an im pressive w itness an d . despite his grievous loss, rem ark ab ly stoical. H e gave his
evidence clearly a n d w ith o u t rancour. He was certainly m istaken a b o u t M r G re en w o o d being one o f th o se on
the steps a n d it has not been possible to identify either officer from M r Hicks’ d escriptions. H e may well also
h ave been im precise as to timings. Nevertheless, I see no reason to d o u b t th a t w h at he d escrib ed did o c c u r in
relation to tw o officers. As M r Hicks generously said himself, the dism issive ?buse fro m th e second officer
(although reprehensible) may have been d u e to his being preoccupied w ith trying to see w hat was h ap p e n in g at
pens 3 an d 4 aro u n d kick-off time.

T h e G oalkeeper and G ate 4
   7. M r B a m b ro ck . a Liverpool supporter, said he w ent through the tunnel. H e w o u ld have liked to have
tu rn ed back w h en he saw how crowded the pens were. H e went wiih his f?,u.“r a n d 13 year o ld brother Stephen
towards the front o f pen 4. He saw the team s com e on to th e pitch. C o n d if Vt-.s at th e front were, he said, alright
until ab o u t 2 m in u te s to 3. T hen the pressure in the pen increased an d he an d his fath e r b ec am e separated. His
feet ca m e o f f th e ground. H e shouted to police officers through the fence to get th e m o ut a n d help th em . T h e
police d id no t react. T h e Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce G robbelaar, spoke to a p olicem an on th e track. T h e gate
was then o p en e d by a blo n d e policewoman a n d ab o u t 25 to 30 peo p le w ent through it. They included the
witness’s father a n d his b ro th er Stephen w ho h ad a b roken arm . A police C onstable sh u t th e gate. It was th en
reopened by th e sa m e policew om an, the witness thought, a n d he got out.

  8. M r Eccleston. a m ale nurse a n d an im pressive w itness, was sittin g in th e north stand. He noticed p e n s 3
and 4 were full an d realised som ething was wrong w hen fans started co m in g over th e p erim ete r fence b u t d id
not invade the pitch. He said the Liverpool goalkeeper appeared to n otice this too.

  9. M r G ro b b e la a r w as o ut of the co u n try d u rin g the Inquiry a n d was therefore n o t called. However, he
m ade a sta te m en t which was put in as his evidence. In the course o f it he s a id :-

  “ Kick-off h a p p e n e d a n d we got into o u r stride pretty quickly - we forced a co rn er pretty early on a n d th e ball
  cam e down to my end - 1 rolled it out to the full back once a n d play went on until P eter Beardsley h it the
  crossbar o f the N o ttin g h a m Forest goal from a corn e r an d cam e back into play. I rem e m b e r ju st after that
  there were sh o u ts a n d screams from the crowd ju st b ehin d me, it was different; n ot th e o rd in ary crowd noise
  and I tu rn e d a ro u n d to look. W hat am azed m e first was the co n cen tratio n an d squash o f fans in th e centre
section, the end areas still h ad plenty o f space. It was only then 1 becam e conscious th a t the crowd was
squashing forward a n d wasn’t able to go sideways and th a t’s when 1 noticed the fencing alongside them
holding them in. 1 saw fans being pulled up into the stan d above the terraces. 1 saw fans climbing over into the
em p ty areas at the side a n d 1 saw fans clim bing out over the front o n to the pitch which was particularly
difficult because o f th e spikes on the top o f the fencing b u t they were getting out.
    "Play was still going on an d 1 was in a terrible p osition trying to co n centrate on play an d having my
a tte n tio n taken by w h at was happening b eh in d me. T he ball cam e down to o u r en d a n d N o ttin g h a m Forest
won a corner, it was taken a n d we cleared o u r box area a n d as play was going forward over the centre line 1
heard a shout, ‘Bruce - please help’ - a desperate shout from a fan squashed up against th e fencing to the
right o f my goal as I looked at Leppings L ane terraces. H e scream ed, ‘Please get th e fucking gate o pen - Help,
help ’. All th e people w h o could speak were pleading for help. T h ere were tw o policem en n ea r th e gate right
alongside th e fan w h o had shouted to m e a n d so I shouted to them , ‘G et th e gate open’. I was still trying to
co n c en tra te on play a n d was still having my atten tio n tak en by w hat was h ap p e n in g b eh in d m e - there were
lots o f fans on th e pitch b e h in d the goal area by th em too. I called again to th e policem en, ‘O p en th e fucking
gate’ a n d o n e ju st tu r n e d away from m e an d looked back at th e crowd b ut the o th e r w ent to th e gate an d
o p en e d it a n d it was like taking the to p o ff a shaken coke b o ttle - people were everywhere on th e play area
a ro u n d my goal. Play was still going on an d it cam e dow n tow ards m e again for the left h a n d com er. It was
a N o ttin g h a m Forest throw-in, away to my left, the ball was o u t o f play a n d a fan cam e up to m e on the
p itch an d said. ‘Bruce, th e y ’re killing us’. I said ‘W h o ’s killing you?’, an d he said ‘T h ey ’re cru shin g us-our
fans’. I said ‘G o a n d get so m e help’, a n d th e n a p o licem an cam e on an d spoke to this fan. I d o n ’t know
w ho th e fan was, a n d th en he led him off. It was ab o u t this tim e I saw a p o licem an ru n nin g o n to th e pitch
from m y right across m y box an d to the referee who blew up. recovered the ball an d told all players to clear
th e p itch .”
   10. It is clear from th e video that M r G ro b b e la ar’s recollection o f the sequence o f events, even w ith regard
to th e game, is inaccurate in a n u m b e r o f respects. F or exam ple, the two N o ttin g h am Forest c o m e r kicks
o ccu rred m in u te s before Beardsley struck the bar. F urther, it seems highly pro b ab le from o th e r evidence that
gates 3 a n d 4 were o p e n co ntinuously well before M r G ro b b e la ar says the fan asked him to get th e gate open. It
seem s surprising too th a t with all th e noise M r G ro b b elaar w ould hear the precise words o f an in d iv id u al fan,
let alo n e resp o n d tw ice to th em , whilst th e gam e was in progress.
    11. As to M r B a m b r o c k ’s account, the evidence o f P C F iona R ich a rd so n was that she was th e only
p o licew o m an on th e track in the early stages although others ca m e from the seated a re a as the incident
developed. PC R ich ard so n began at gate 1 an d , although she d id go a n d help people o u t th ro u g h gate 3, she
d id n o t go to gate 4, a n d d id n o t open it twice o r even once. T h e tw o officers w h o spoke o f o p e n in g gate 4 were
b o th male.
    12. I th in k M r G ro b b e la a r did b ecom e conscious o f distress in th e crowd b e h in d h im an d d id speak to a
police officer at so m e stage, probably earlier than he now thinks. N o t to reach th a t b ro ad conclusion would
involve a ttrib u tin g his w hole account to invention or fan tasy a n d I see n o g rounds for d o in g so. However, his
d etailed a c co u n t was n o t tested in cross-exam ination a n d its inconsistencies a n d errors w h en co m p a re d with
o th e r inco n tro v ertib le evidence would m a k e it unsafe to d erive m o re th an th e b ro ad conclusion stated above.
T h e in c id en t shows how honest witnesses can becom e confused and their evidence flawed w hen recollecting
events experienced u n d e r tension o r em otion.
   13. As to th e o p e n in g o f gate 4 there was an ap p a re n t conflict o f evidence. P C Illingworth said that ab o u t
five m in u te s to 3 he o p en e d it an d guided fans emerging th rough it to gate 5. P C H ooson said th a t it was he
w h o o p en e d gate 4 ju s t before kick-off. I am satisfied from the evidence o f a n u m b e r o f fans th at, like gate 3,
gate 4 was o pened m o re th an once. T h e p robability is. therefore, th a t w hilst P C Illingworth w as shep h erd in g
fans to gate 5. gate 4 had been closed again until it was re-opened by P C H o o so n tw o o r three m in u tes later.

Oxygen
    14. It was alleged by a d o cto r th a t an oxygen cylinder p ro v id ed to him on the pitch was e m p ty D r Phillips, a
L iverpool supporter, h ad been in pen 3 with his b ro th e r a n d others. H e c a m e u n d er pressure a n d clim bed into
pen 2. W h e n the disaster occurred a n d gate 2 was opened, he went through it, in juring his h ead as he d id so. H e
c a m e o n to the pitch so m e tim e after 3.10 p m a n d started resuscitation procedures. He was given an oxygen
cylinder. He believes this was from St J o h n A m bulance. It was, he thought, too early to be the fire service. T h e
cy lin d er was sw itched on b u t D r Phillips says it gave no oxygen since it was empty. T h ere was o n e oxygen
cy lin d er on the St J o h n ’s am b u lan ce w hich cam e to th e scene. M r Wells, th e Divisional S u p e rin te n d e n t o f St
Jo h n , to o k th a t cv linder o n to the pitch. H e said it was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a p a tien t being
treated bv D r Phillips an d says th a t oxygen was flowing into th a t p atien t. Moreover, M r Wells tested th e
cy lin der afterw ards a n d fo u n d it was still h a lf full. It has a capacity th a t will last for 5 h ours 40 m in u tes on a
high setting.
   15. T here was evidence from Assistant C h ief Fire O fficer H ornsby th a t a M a x am a n resuscitator h ad failed
to work properly. It was delivering an oxygen flow ap p ro p riate to a "child" setting rath er th a n a full “ad u lt"
flow. O n ex am in a tio n , it was found th a t a retaining n u t in the control k n o b h ad w orked loose, possibly d ue to
vibration in transit, a n d this h ad affected the flow o f oxygen. T h e device had last been tested on 10 April 1989.

   16. I accept the evidence o f M r Wells th a t th e St Jo h n A m bulance cylinder was charged with oxygen an d
working properly. In m y view, D r Phillips may have been m istak en as to the cylinder o f w hich he co m p lain s
being empty. H e agreed he was under great pressure, in an aw kw ard situation; his h ead was injured an d he
b ecam e very angry at w h at he regarded then as wholly the fault o f th e police. He co n c ed e d th a t if the cylinder
was not em p ty there was a possible alternative - th a t the m a ste r tan k to p valve was shut. It seems unlikely th a t
he could have b een referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was clear that th e bo ttle he received was a
sim ple piece o f eq u ip m e n t n o t designed to b rea th e for the p a tien t b u t merely to supply oxygen.
  17. I co n c lu d e th a t on a balance o f probabilities the evidence does not justify a fin d in g that an em p ty
cylinder was b ro u g h t to th e scene.

C alling the Fire Service
    18. PC B ich a rd ’s call to police H ea d q u arte rs at 3.13 p m for the fire service to b rin g hydraulic cutting
eq u ip m e n t to cu t m etal fences (see paragraph 101 supra) was h e a rd by C h ie f Inspector E d m u n d so n . H e went
in to th e a d jac en t o p era tio n s ro o m to give in stru ctio ns for the message to be passed to th e fire service. T here, a
tem p o rary c o n tro l ro o m assistant was already speaking to the fire service ab o ut a h ouse fire. M r E d m u n d so n
in terru p te d th e call a n d asked the assistant to tell the fire service th a t cutting eq u ip m e n t was w anted at
Hillsborough. T h ere followed a conversation between th e assistant a n d Miss D avies at th e fire service in th e
following te rm s ;-
  Police              C an we have cutting gear for Hillsborough, please - straight away?

  Fire C o n trol     Ju st a m in u te. Right - w hat’s the address?

   At th a t p o in t C h ie f Inspector E d m u h d s o n in tervened an d spoke for the police. T h e conversation

   Fire C o n tr o l   Hello! N o w y o u wnt s o m e c u t t i n g g ea r - w h a t ex act ly is it fo r0

   Police              T h ere has been a m a jo r accid en t at H illsborough football g ro u n d where the semi-final is.
                       the crow ds have forced their way in, they have broken fences an d gates dow n. I d o n ’t know
                       exactly what it is but there are people trap p ed .

   Fire C ontrol       Right! O K - leave it with us.

   T h a t co nversation to o k 1 m in u te 13 seconds. It was pu b lish ed in a n u m b e r o f new spapers with strong
critical c o m m e n t mostly against the fire service. T h e th ru st o f the criticism was th a t valuable tim e was wasted
by the fire service asking unnecessary q u estio n s as to w here a n d why c u ttin g eq u ip m en t was required.

    19. T here was a m e etin g o f the em ergency services in August 1988 to discuss p ro ce d u re in the event o f a
m a jo r disaster at Sheffield W ednesday's ground. It was p o in te d o u t a n d m in u ted th a t “ It was im perative th a t
th e Police Co n tro l give th e exact location o f any fire o r in c id e n t a n d as m u ch detail as possible. N o senior fire
officer is on d u ty at the m a t c h . . . Fire service will a tte n d via P enistone R oad o r Leppings Lane a s directed by
th e police.”

   20. T h e message from PC Bichard co n tain ed all th e necessary in fo rm atio n - Leppings Lane en d , hydraulic
cu ttin g eq u ip m en t, to cu t m etal fences. Regrettably, it was no t passed o n by H ea d q u arte rs in those terms. M iss
D avies h ad rightly b een tra in e d to require a precise location a n d needed to know th e p ro b lem w hich would face
the fire service so th a t th e ap p ro p riate response could be m ade. In fact, there are several football grounds in the
H illsborough d istrict alth o u g h clearly Sheffield W ed n esd ay ’s ground is the principal one. In th e result,
although C h ie f In sp e c to r E d m u n d so n clarified, to an extent, the n a tu re o f th e p ro b lem , th e locus w hich
em erged in the course o f the conversation (P en iston e R oad) was n ot th at co n tain ed in th e original message
from g ro u n d co n tro l (ie “ Leppings L ane en d .” ) W hilst on th e face o f th e conversation th e fire service may seem
to have been slow in th e uptak e or perh ap s p edantic, in m y view the police o u g h t to have b ee n m ore specific.
T hey h ad th e necessary in fo rm atio n to be so.

  21. 1 a m satisfied, however, th a t th e delay o f 1 m in u te 13 seconds over the call, a n d even the delay
occasioned by the c u ttin g eq u ip m e n t going to P enistone R o ad rather th an Leppings L ane, d id n o t affect the
outcom e. Even h a d th o se w ith cutting eq u ip m e n t gone directly after a briefer ’p h o n e call they would n o t have
arrived at a stage early enough to m a k e cu ttin g the fencing a helpful exercise.

   22. W hen the L iverpool m an ag er went to th e c o n tro l ro o m a n d agreed to m a k e the a n n o u n c em en t
b ro ad cast at 3.56 p m , he says in a sta te m en t that he could n o t get th e T annoy to work. Spectators could see
h im trying to a d d re ss th e m and in d icated to h im m a n u ally th a t n o th in g could be h e a rd . A n officer pressed
b u tto n s on the m a c h in e a n d M r Dalglish says he trie d again with sim ilar lack o f success. H e was then taken
u n d er the police box to the room used by the disc jock ey to b roadcast pre-m atch music. T h ere, the m icro p h o n e
worked a n d iie b ro a d c a s t his message.

   23. M r Dalglish was n o t called. T h ere was no o th e r evidence a b o u t this incident. I accept it occurred as he
described. W hy th e T an n o y could n o t at th a t tim e b e successfully op erated from the police box is, however,
strange a n d unex p lain ed . U n lik e th e radio, it h a d o p e ra te d satisfactorily from the police box at the critical
tim es save th a t its messages may n o t always have b een h e a rd above th e prevailing noise. It h a d worked a t about
3.30 p m w hen it called for medical staff. I can see no g ro u n d s for criticising the police in regard to this in c id en t
a n d certain it is th a t th e b rie f delay in relaying M r D alglish’s message can have h ad no significant effect.

   7. ACTIONS AFTER DEATH

   Introduction

     At common law a person's death extinguished all rights of action that he
   m ight have had. In particular, if the death was a result of the tortious acts of
   another, the deceased's family would have no right of action in respect of
   the death.13 The position is now governed by statute.
     If a person dies as the result of the tortious acts of another there are two
   ways in which an action m ight be brought. First, by reason of the Law
   Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934, certain causes of action which
   were vested in the deceased at the tim e of his death survive for the benefit of
   his estate. Secondly, certain "dependants" of the deceased now have a right
   of action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976.


   Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934

     By section 1(1) of the 1934 Act it is provided that all causes of action, w ith
   the exception of actions for defamation and seduction which were vested in
   a person on his death shall survive for the benefit of his estate.
      It is expressly provided, by section 1(2)(a) that the damages recoverable for
   the benefit of the estate "shall not include any exemplary damages." Where
   the person's death has been caused by the act or omission w hich gives rise


   12 [1979| Q.B. 722.
   13 Adm iralty Commissioners v. SS. Amerika [1917] A.C. 38.




to the cause of action the damages recoverable for the benefit of the estate
shall be calculated w ithout reference to any loss or gain to his estate conse­
quent on his death, except that a sum in respect of funeral expenses may be
included.14 Damages for "loss of expectation of life" and for the "lost years"
cannot be recovered if the death occurred after January 1, 1983.15
  It follows that an action can be brought by the estate of a person who died
as a result of police misconduct. Compensatory and aggravated damages can
be recovered by the estate.
The Fatal Accidents Act 1976

   The 1976 Act gives a right of action to "dependants” of a deceased person
whose death was caused by any “wrongful act, neglect or default" such as
would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the person injured to recover
damages.16
   Dependants are defined in section 1(2) and include spouses, parents and
grandparents, children and grandchildren, nephews nieces and cousins and
any person who had been living w ith the deceased in the same household
for a period of at least two years immediately before death as husband or
wife and any person treated by the deceased as a parent or as a "child of the
family."
   A husband or wife or the parents of an unm arried minor are entitled to
damages for "bereavem ent"17 in the sum of £3500.18 O ther damages are
awarded as are proportionate to the injury resulting from the death to the
dependants respectively. Such damages are assessed on the basis of the
"value of the dependency," in other words, the dependants are entitled to
that sum of money that will replace the "m aterial benefits" provided to
them by the deceased.19
   It should be noted that the dependants cannot recover if the deceased
earned his living by crime, because their claim would be defeated by the
defence of ex turpi causa.20
   T he damages recoverable can be reduced.to take into account any "con­
tributory negligence" by the deceased.21
   T he dependants of anyone killed as a result of police wrongdoing will,
therefore, have an action against the police under the Fatal Accidents Act.


8. LIMITATION

  All the causes of action discussed in this chapter are "founded on tort."
The basic tort lim itation period of six years "from the date on w hich the
cause of action accrued" therefore applies.22

21 s.5.
22 See Limitation Act 1980, s.2.
   The cause of action accrues at the m om ent at w hich the plaintiff could
first sue. When a tort is actionable per se, tim e will run from the m om ent at
which the wrongful act was committed. Thus, a cause of action in libel will
run from the m om ent of publication and will be time-barred six years later.
O n the other hand, where damage is essential to the cause of action and it
will only arise w hen the damage actually occurs. Thus, a cause of action in
negligence, misfeasance in a public office or conspiracy will only arise w hen
the plaintiff actually suffers loss or damage as a result of the defendant's
breach of duty or misfeasance. In the case of a breach of statutory duty the
date of accrual of the cause of action will depend on w hether th e statute is
construed as giving a cause of action w hich is actionable per se.73 If a statute
does give rise to a breach w hich is actionable per se th en tim e will run from
the date of the breach, otherwise tim e will run from the date on w hich
damage takes place.
   Where the action is "in case" the cause of action will accrue w hether or
not the plaintiff knows th at the damage has taken place.24 Thus, for
example, if property is damaged by negligent police action tim e will run
from the date of damage, not the date w hen the plaintiff discovers that it has
happened.
   Where the damages claimed by the plaintiff "consist of or include
damages in respect of personal injuries25 to the plaintiff or any other per­
son" then the applicable lim itation period is three years.26 In such a case the
tim e period runs from either the date on w hich the cause of action accrued
or the date of knowledge (if-later) of the person injured.27 The court has a
discretion to extend the lim itation period under section 33 of the Limi­
tation Act 1980 28
   If the person injured dies before the expiration of th e three year lim itation
period then the lim itation period for a cause of action surviving for the ben­
efit of the estate under section 1 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Pro­
visions) Act 1934 is three years from the date of death or the date of the
knowledge of the personal representative, whichever is the later.29 If the
person injured dies after the expiry of the lim itation period then his per­
sonal representatives can ask the court to override the lim itation period.30
   An action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 cannot be brought if the
death occurred when the person injured could no longer m aintain an action
in respect of the injury, w hether because the action is time-barred or for any
other reason 31 Where the action would have been barred by the three year
tim e lim it in respect of personal injuries there is no statutory discretion to
override the tim e lim it under section 33 32 No action under the Fatal Acci­
dents Act can be brought after the expiration of three years from the date of
death or the date of knowledge of the person for whose benefit the action is

of death then the court does have discretion to extend time under section
33 34
   Where any fact relevant to the cause of action is deliberately concealed by
the defendant the period of lim itation does n ot begin to run u n til the plain­
tiff discovered th e concealment or could, w ith reasonable diligence have
discovered it.35
1   Fatal Accidents Act 1976

The Fatal Accidents Act 1976 allows dependants to claim against anyone who
causes death by their wrongful act, neglect or default, provided the wrongful

act, neglect or default would have been such as to allow the person who died to
have made a claim if they had not died. In other words the act, neglect or
default must constitute a civil wrong; if the police would have had a good
defence to the civil wrong, the claim for the death also fails.

 Who can sue?
M ost members o f the family o f the dead person can sue, including:
(a) spouse;
(b) parents or grandparents;
(c) children or grandchildren;
(d) siblings, uncles and aunts, and all their descendants;
(e) common-law spouse of two years’ standing (lesbian and gay relationships
    are therefore excluded);
(f) anyone treated as a child o f the family following a marriage;
(g) anyone treated as a parent.

 W rongful act, neglect or default o f the police
It has to be shown that the wrongful act, neglect or default o f the police caused
the death .93This may be fairly straightforw ard if, say, the death resulted from
a deliberate assault or from a road accident caused by a police officer’s
negligent driving. It is less clear-cut if the death arose partly from the act o f the
person who died, say in the case o f someone who died from alcohol or drugs.
The police have a detailed Code o f Practice (see Appendix Two) on the
treatm ent of people in their custody concerning such matters as the conditions
of detention, the treatm ent o f detained persons and medical treatm ent. While
a breach of the Code does not o f itself render any individual officer liable to a
separate civil action, a breach o f the Code might be evidence of negligence.94
   A problem might arise where someone dies because the police fail to act to
prevent the death. This might occur where the police arrest someone who is ill
or someone becomes ill after an arrest and the police fail to call a doctor. In the
ordinary law of negligence a “ pure omission” to act, such as where a passer-by
fails to call an am bulance after a ro ad accident, does not make the passer-by
liable. However, the position is different if the person who fails to act has a
legal duty of care:95 police custody officers are under a statutory duty to ensure
that anyone detained at a police station is treated in accordance with the
Police and Criminal Evidence A ct and the Codes o f Practice.96 U nder the Act,
failure on the part of an officer to comply with any provision of the Codes does
not o f itself render that officer liable to any civil proceedings.97 However, it
seems that the special duty to take care of people in police custody existed
before the Act was passed98 so this provision should not defeat a claim based
on an act o f omission by the police. Even if the courts decided it was an
obstacle, it seems only to protect the officer who failed to comply with the
Codes. A claim against the chief officer o f police should therefore still succeed,
se e p lO l.
   A further problem may arise where someone commits suicide in police
custody. If the suicide was induced by a wrongful act of the police, a claim can
still succeed even though the person who died took their own life.99 There
must, however, be a clear link between the wrongful act and the suicide, such
 as where a person is falsely im prisoned or assaulted and becomes depressed
and suicidal as a result. If the police have a good defence to the false
im prisonm ent or assault allegation, the claim for damages arising from the
death would also fail.
   It is arguable that a claim can be made if the police negligently fail to
prevent a suicide. This might arise where the police take into custody someone
they know to be prone to suicide,100 an d then fail to prevent them harming
themselves by, for example, failing to keep them under regular and frequent
observ ation .101 It is impossible to say with certainty th a t this is the law, as it
appears that there has never been a reported case directly on the point, in
England. However, in a case which decided that it was justifiable to force-feed
a suffragette on hunger strike, the L o rd Chief Justice said “ It was the duty,
both under the rules and apart from the rules, o f officials to preserve the health
and lives o f the prisoners, who were in the custody o f the C row n” .102 This
however does not deal with the crucial problem that in the general law of
negligence if someone consents to a risk, such as consenting to a surgical
operation, their claim fails. N orm ally a person who carried out an act
themselves would be taken to be clearly consenting to the risk. The question
that remains to be decided is w hether som eone of unsound mind can be said to
“ consent” .

2   Damages

Damages are only awarded for:
(a) bereavement; and
(b) the loss of reasonable expectation of financial benefit.
Damages for bereavement are a fixed am ount, currently £3,500.103 They are
only awarded to the spouse of the deceased or the parents of someone under 18
who never married.
   Damages for reasonable expectation o f financial loss can include such
things as loss of a p a ren t’s financial support, or loss o f a son’s voluntary gifts
during a period o f em ploym ent104 or loss o f free services as where a wife who
was killed acted as a housewife.105 H ow ever, if the person who died earned his
or her income from a life of crime, the dependants are n ot allowed to claim for
loss o f the benefits o f crim e.106
NEGLIGENCE
G eneral
              §4.1. THE DEFINITION OF NEGLIGENCE

I n t e n t i o n is clearly a mental state, and a type of legal fault. Another
type of legal fault, not necessarily involving a mental state, is
negligence.
    Some accidents (or other events) are so unexpected that when they
happen we can only say that they were unavoidable—in legal language,
"inevitable," We cannot think of anything that a careful person would
have done to avoid the evil result, if he had been in the shoes of the
defendant.
    Other accidents happen because of the neglect of some precaution that
a reasonable man would have used. (The reasonable man is sometimes,
and better, called a prudent man.) Such accidents are the products of what
we call negligence, or carelessness.
    Negligence, then, is failure to conform to the standard of care to which
it is the defendant's duty to conform. It is failure to behave like a
reasonable or prudent man. in circumstances where the law requires such
reasonable behaviour. (In this context, of course, as nearly always in law.
the word "man" includes "woman.") An employer may for example be
negligent as to whether safety precautions are being used by his
workpeople.

You mean the defendant was thoughtless?
   Yes. or incompetent in a job (such as driving a car) in which he should
have been competent. Or. worse still, he may actually have seen the
danger and "chanced his arm." In the latter case he is advertently
negligent, or in other words reckless. If he did not advert to the danger,
or in other words realise there was a risk, when he ought to have, he is
inadvertently negligent. Negligence means forbidden conduct where the
defendant's liability depends on the fact that he failed to realise (foresee/
know) what he ought to have realised, and failed to conform his conduct
accordingly, or. a fortiori, that he did realise it and yet failed to conform
his conduct as he should.
  The test of negligence in terms of the prudent man is called an
"objective" standard, because it does not depend upon a finding of what
passed in the defendant's mind.
Why do you bring in the prudent man in defining negligence? Is it because
otherwise the standard would vary for everyone?
  There would be no standard at all. Every judgment of a man's conduct
implies judgment measured against a standard external to him.
Who is this “ prudent m an” ? Is he the man in the street?
   The man in the street, that legendary combination of sage and
ignoramus, does not quite represent the idea. The “prudent man" or
"reasonable man" of the lawyer's imagining is the exemplary man: the
cautious, circumspect, anxiously calculating paragon who is held up by the
judges as a model of behaviour. Sometimes, it is true, he is described as
the ordinary man. or the average man. But little effort is made at trials to
find how ordinary men behave: and it w'ould not be a cast-iron defence to
a charge of negligence to show that other people are prone to do exactly
as the defendant did. (At least, that is the position in the law of tort.)
H o m o juridicus is the ideal man. the moral man. the conscientious man—
not setting the standard so high that life becomes impossible in ordinary
terms, but nevertheless requiring the most careful consideration to be
given, so that harm is avoided and the law obeyed.
Why not eliminate talk of reasonable men by asking simply whether the
harm was probable?
   Probability is a matter of varying degree. Negligence consists in taking
a risk of harm with such a degree of probability as to be socially
unacceptable. This depends on what it is that is at stake. A surgeon may.
if there is no other way of alleviating his patient's suffering or prolonging
his life, perform an operation that carries a very high risk of killing his
patient, without being adjudged negligent. An employer w'ho. in order to
increase production and profits, takes what is. statistically, a much smaller
risk with the lives of his workpeople may w'ell be held to be so.
W hat should a prosecutor do to prove negligence?
  In an action in tort for negligence the plaintiff must give particulars of
the alleged negligence in his statement of claim. For example, in a running-
down case he will say that the defendant drove too fast, on the wrong side
of the road, without keeping a proper look-out, and so on. There are no
similar pleadings in criminal cases, but the prosecutor who alleges
negligence must be prepared to say what the defendant could and should
have done (or refrained from doing) in order to avoid the accident or other
occurrence.

Do I gather that when considering negligence you entirely ignore the
defendant’s state of mind?
   That would be going too far. One can imagine circumstances where an
ordinary driver would not be careless in running a blind man down, if he
did not know he was blind and had no reason to suppose he would proceed
as he did. But a driver who knew that the man w^as blind might on such
facts be guilty of careless driving.

Is negligence a form of mens rea?
   Some judges assume this, but there are substantial arguments the other
way.
• Negligence is not necessarily a state of mind, so it is not properly called
     mens rea.
• The most serious and severely punishable crimes are defined to require
  intention or recklessness. If it were allowed that negligence is mens rea.

      the judges might extend the concept of recklessness to cover negligence
      (which some of them are in any event strongly inclined to do), and might
      hold that all crimes at common law can be committed negligently (which
      would result in a great increase of severity). The argument does not
      involve saying that negligence should not be punished: only that it
      should not generally be punished on a par with crimes requiring a mental
      element/"’



 § 4.2. THE JUSTIFICATION OF PUNISHMENT FOR NEGLIGENCE

The reason for punishing negligence is the utilitarian one, that we hope
thereby to improve people's standards of behaviour.

Isn’t the question one of moral wrong? It is wrong not to exercise
consideration for others.
   If inadvertent negligence results from not caring about other people, it
is a defect of character and may be regarded as morally wrong. But what
lawyers call inadvertent negligence is not always of this kind. Negligence
may be just a slip by a well-disposed person, and whether that should be
accounted morally wrong is open to debate.

Even though the offender did not realise the danger on the occasion in
question, he would have realised it if he had taken due precautions. So he
was morally to blame.
   I do not dissent; but we should keep our eyes open to the facts. Apply
what you say to the particular case of a forgetful person. A man with a bad
memory can often take steps to remedy his deficiency— by keeping a diary
of his engagements and consulting it frequently, and so on. But his memory
may be so bad that one day he forgets to look in his diary, or forgets an
item recorded in it. Perhaps, to overcome this risk, he takes additional
steps, such as asking his wife to remind him of a particular engagement.
But one day he forgets to ask his wife. Is he to think of another device to
remind him to look at his diary or to ask his wife to remind him? Is it moral
fault not to do so? What we are faced with is the plain fact that on the
particular occasion the thought of the engagement never comes into his
mind. That is a deficiency in his mental make-up which he cannot help. To
search back into his past for the purpose of finding some defect in the
arrangements he made to remedy his failing, and blaming him on that
account, often wears the appearance of being an unrewarding exercise in
moralism.

   It is not only a question of memory. Many studies have been made of
accident proneness; and it has been found that large categories of people
are more accident prone than others. Old people are worse than younger
people, men worse than women, unmarried people worse than married.1
But some individuals are particularly accident prone. They are born
negligent, so to speak, or become so through their experiences. A person
has an innate temperament, which may in course of time be modified by
many circumstances over which he has no control. The result may be that
he is impulsive, unable to stop and consider the consequences of what he
is doing, or too dull in mind to imagine them: that he is selfish, preferring
his own convenience to the safety of others: that he is clumsy, unable to
control his own movements (or those of a machine he is using) with due
precision, or with a slow' reaction-time in case of emergency.

If. as vou say, the individual is unable to help these aspects of his mind or
body, how can he be said to deserve punishment?
   This objection to imposing liability for negligence appeals particularly to
those w'ho take the "determinist" position, according to w'hich all events
(including human acts) are governed by pre-existing events w'hich are their
causes. Everything we do is the product of our genetic constitution and
personal history.
   We need not go into the voluminous arguments for and against
determinism. Sufficient to say that the determinist philosophy, though it
may be true, is of little interest either to the lawyer or to the moralist. The
question in law and morals is whether the offender could have acted
otherwise if he had willed. If he could, he is morally and legally
responsible.2 The further question "Was he able to will?" may be
speculated on by philosophers, but is eschewed in law and morals for a
pragmatic reason. The object of the law and of a moral system is to
influence our wills in a socially desired direction. Once this simple point is
grasped, the apparent difficulty of reconciling the philosophy of
determinism with ordinary moral attitudes disappears. However,
malfunctioning of the will is given moral and legal significance when it is
associated with childhood or is regarded as a symptom of mental disorder.

   Liability for negligence is a way of sanctioning (punishing) common
sense rules that in themselves have no legal force. There are well-known
rules of prudence relating to the management of firearms, that one should
never leave them loaded, or point them at anyone even though believed to
be unloaded, and so on. Again, it is only a rule of prudence, not explicitly
one of law, that one should not pass on a blind corner (except that there
is a law on the subject of not crossing double white lines). Failure to
observe these rules (which will generally be an intentional or reckless
failure) will readily be held to be negligence, founding a charge of careless
driving or of manslaughter.

The reason why drivers do not pass on blind corners is because they
apprehend a consequence much more immediate and terrifying than what
may afterwards happen in a court of law.
   That is true, but the law of reckless and careless driving can add to the
pressure to make bad drivers change their habits and in the last resort to
give up driving.
   Carelessness with firearms is in a different legal position from careless
driving. Such carelessness is not an offence in itself, and it is not an offence
even if it causes severe injury, the reason evidently being that accidents
with firearms are too uncommon to attract particular attention from the
law. However, if the victim dies, a charge of manslaughter may be brought.

When comparing the physically handicapped (blind, maimed, etc.)
defendant with the reasonable man, we suppose that the reasonable man
suffers from the same handicap. The defendant need only do his best with
the body he has. But it would generally be negligent for a handicapped
man to undertake something that could be done safely only by an ordinary
man, if he has the opportunity not to do it.

W hat if the defendant is substandard in abilities?
  The reasonable man is not imagined to be substandard in intelligence or
foresight.

But wouldn’t it be more just to have different standards of care for experts
a t one end of the scale and people of poor intelligence at the other?

10. Negligence and
Other Civil Actions


1. INTRODUCTION

   In Part II of this book the "traditional tort actions" against the police were
considered. These actions are by far the most important. They cover the
areas where citizens will be most concerned with unlawful police activity:
assault, unlawful arrest and imprisonment, interference with land and
goods and unjustified prosecutions. Nevertheless, the law provides a wide
range of other causes of action which may be relevant to the citizen's pos­
ition in relation to the police. This chapter deals with six areas: negligence,
breach of statutory duty, defamation, conspiracy, misfeasance in public
office and actions after death.


2 . NEGLIGENCE

Introduction

  The common law action in negligence has, in recent decades, become of
central importance to the law of tort. Large areas of tortious liability have
been gradually redefined and assimilated to it. Nevertheless there have been
very few attempts to fix the police with liability for negligence in relation to
their "operational policing" functions. Complex and difficult questions
arise concerning matters such as the existence of a duty of care, the policy
limitations on such a duty, and the intervening acts of third parties.


The elements of the tort

  The elements of the tort of negligence are clear and well established.
There must be:
     (1)   a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff)
     (2)   a breach by the defendant of this duty,-
     (3)   damage to the plaintiff;
     (4)   which is caused by the breach of duty.
(1) D u t y o f care. The generally accepted test1 to be applied to establish
whether or not a duty of care is owed by the plaintiff to the defendant is set
out in the speech of Lord Wilberforce in A n ns v. M erton 2:
     “the question has to be approached in two stages. First one has to ask
     whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who has suf­
     fered damage there is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neigh­
     bourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of the former,
     carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter, in
     which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly, if the first ques­
     tion is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider whether there
     are any considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or lim it
     the scope of the duty or the class of person to whom it is owed or the
     damages to which a breach of it may give rise."
Thus, if it is forseeable that the plaintiff will be damaged by the defendant's
lack of care, a duty of care will arise unless there are policy considerations
which restrict or negative the duty. Policy considerations may “negative" a
duty of care if it is not "just and reasonable" that a duty be imposed.3

(2) B reach o f d u t y . The defendant will be in breach of his duty if he fails to
take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances. The standard of care
is that of the reasonable man. This is a matter of law and the court w ill take
into account matters such as the degree of risk if the duty is not fulfilled,
the seriousness of the risk, the utility of the defendant's acts and the cost of
avoiding the harm.4 In police cases the standard of care will often not be a
high one, because the police act under considerable pressure, with compet­
ing demands on their resources, often in situations of some danger.3
Whether the defendant is in breach of his duty in a particular case is a ques­
tion of fact and degree.

(3) D a m a g e . Because negligence is an action on the case, there will only be
a complete cause of action if the plaintiff can show some "special damage"
such as personal injury, nervous shock or economic loss. If economic loss is
the only damage caused then there are strict "policy limitations" on recov­
ery. The plaintiff can only recover for "pure economic loss" if he can show a
"very close proximity" to the defendant.6 In general, the plaintiff can only
recover for damage which is "reasonably foreseeable."7

(4) C a u s a tio n . Even if the plaintiff was damaged and the defendant was in
breach of a duty owed to him, there will be no action unless the damage was
in fact caused by the breach. The defendant will not be liable if, on a proper

understanding of events, the plaintiff's damage was not in fact caused by the
negligence of the defendant but by some intervening “new act" [novus
actus in terveniens ). Human action does not, of itself, sever the connected
sequence of events.8 The basic rule was summarised by Greer L.J. in the
leading case of H aynes v. H arw ood9 as follows:
      “If what is relied upon as a novus actus interveniens is the very kind of
      thing which is likely to happen if the want of care which is alleged
      takes place, the principle embodied in the maxim is no defence."
In police cases the first element will often be the most difficult to establish.
Special considerations may arise if the police are acting under “statutory
powers.''10 Even if the plaintiff can establish a prima facie duty of care this
may well be negatived by “policy considerations." When it is alleged that
there has been a negligent failure to carry out proper investigations special
difficulties arise concerning liability for the acts of independent third par­
ties.


Negligence liability and independent third parties

  Difficult legal issues arise when the plaintiff's claim is based on damage
caused by an independent third party who, it is said, was placed in a position
to cause the damage by the defendant's negligence. It is clear that the simple
fact that the damage was caused by a third party:
      “does not, of itself, preclude success of the claim, since breach of duty
      on the part of the person against whom the claim is made may also have
      played a part in causing the damage.''11
Nevertheless, the situations in which such an action may succeed have
been strictly limited although the precise basis and extent of this limitation
have been unclear.
  There is no doubt that there will be liability if there is a “special relation­
ship" between the defendant and the third party by virtue of which the
defendant is responsible for controlling the actions of the third party.12
There will also be liability if the defendant negligently causes or permits a
source of danger to be created in a situation where it is reasonably foresee­
able that third parties may interfere with it.13
  There have been, however, considerable difficulties as to liability in cases
where there is no “special relationship" or situation of danger.14 The auth­
orities revealed two different approaches with different practical conse­
quences. These can be called the “policy" and the “foreseeability"
approaches.
  The first approach treats the limitation as a question of policy. On this

view, policy excludes liability in the absence of a special relationship or
other special circumstances. This was the analysis of Lord Denning M.R. in
Lam b v. C a m d e n ls and was partially supported by Oliver L.J. (as he then
was).16 In P. Perl (Exporters ) v. C a m d e n 17 Goff L.J. (as he then was) applied
Lord Wilberforce's test in Anns18 and suggested that “policy consider­
ations" negatived a duty of care in the absence of a special relationship
between the defendant and the third party. More recently, Lord Goff has
refined his analysis of the absence of a duty of care in this area stating that
the fundamental reason for it is “that the common law does not impose
liability for what are called pure omissions."19
   The second approach treats the question as being a matter of foreseeabi­
lity: if the third party intervention is foreseeable with a sufficiently high
degree of probability there will be a duty of care. In D orset Yacht v. H om e
Office20 Lord Reid said that there would be liability if the “intervening
action" of the third party was “very likely" (or perhaps just “likely")21 to
happen. In subsequent cases it has been suggested that the defendant may
be liable where third party intervention is “likely or very likely to
happen,"22 that there must be a “very high degree of foreseeability/'23 per­
haps "amounting almost to inevitability.'24
   This conflict was resolved by the decision of the House of Lords in Sm ith
v. L ittlew o o d s 25 when this second approach was endorsed by a majority. It
was said that “mere foreseeability of damage is certainly not a sufficient
basis to found liability."26 Nevertheless, as Lord Mackay (with whom Lord
Keith and Lord Griffiths agreed, Lord Brandon taking a similar approach)27
said:
      "what the reasonable man is bound to foresee in a case involving injury
      or damage by independent human agency, just as in cases where such
      agency plays no part, is the probable consequences of his own act or
      omission, but that, in such a case, a clear basis will be required on
      which to assert that the injury or damage is more than a mere possi­
      bility."28
The result must be "highly probable or very likely" and the needle that

measures the probability of a particular result must be "near the top of the
scale."29 It is submitted that this is the correct approach and is in line with
the older authorities which deal with the problem as one of causation. As
Greer L.J. put it in a passage which has often been approved:
    "it is not true to say that where a plaintiff has suffered damage occa­
    sioned by a combination of the wrongful act of a defendant and some
    further conscious act by an intervening person, that of itself prevents
    the court coming to a conclusion in the plaintiff's favour if the accident
    was the natural and probable consequence of the wrongful act."30
The fact that the third party's acts are unlawful is no objection to liability.
As Lord Reid has said:
    "Unfortunately, tortious or criminal action by a third party is often 'the
    very kind of thing' which is likely to happen as a result of the wrongful
    or careless act of the defendant."31
It is submitted, therefore, that in the absence of "special relationships," a
person will be liable for the tortious acts of third parties if these are reason­
ably forseeable consequences of his own negligence. Liability will depend
on the facts of each particular case.
9. GENERAL DEFENCES


Introduction


  There are a number of general defences which are potentially applicable
to all the tort actions considered in this chapter. The most important of
these are as follows:
        (1)   contributory negligence;
        (2)   consent;
        (3)   necessity,-
        (4)   the plaintiff is a wrongdoer.



Contributory negligence


  At common law contributory negligence was a complete defence to an
action in negligence or breach of statutory duty but does not seem to have
been applied to any other cause of action.36 The position is now governed by
the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945. If a plaintiff in an
action for negligence suffers damage "as the result partly of his own fault”
his damages are reduced "to such an extent as the court thinks just and
equitable having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the
damage.37
  The position when the plaintiff's claim is a tort other than negligence or
breach of statutory duty is unclear. "Contributory negligence" will only be
a defence to an action for defamation, conspiracy or misfeasance if it can be
shown that the defendant's acts were themselves tortious; mere "careless­
ness" by the defendant will not be sufficient.38

Consent

   The maxim volen ti non fit injuria, that to which a man consents cannot
be considered an injury, is of general application in the law of tort.39 The
defence of consent takes two forms: as consent to the invasion of interests
or the willing assumption of risk of injury.40
   No action will lie in respect of acts which were authorised by the plain­
tiff. The defendant must establish that the plaintiff's consent was fully and
freely given. This form of the defence applies to intentional torts such as
trespass to land or goods. It also applies to actions for defamation41 and pre­
sumably to misfeasance and conspiracy.
   The defence of volenti also applies in "non-intentional torts" when the
plaintiff has agreed to "assume the risk" of suffering damage. The scope of
the defence of consent as "assumption of risk" has been considerably
restricted by judicial decision. It is necessary for the defendants to show
that:
        "the plaintiff voluntarily and freely with full knowledge of the nature
        of the risk he ran impliedly agreed to incur it."42
It is not enough that the plaintiff had knowledge of the risk; he must be
shown to have consented not to hold the defendant liable:
        "The plaintiff must agree, expressly or impliedly, to waive any claim
        for any injury that may befall him due to the lack of reasonable care by
        the defendant."43
The defence must be specifically pleaded.44
  The defence of volenti is very rarely successful in actions for breach of
statutory duty or negligence.43 Although it was held to be applicable in A s h ­
ton v. Turner.46 This was a negligence action by one of two burglars who
had been drinking against the other who had injured him by crashing their
getaway car. It was held that no duty of care was owed by the driver to the
passenger in that situation but that the action failed, in any event, because
the passenger had assumed the risk of such injury by taking part in the bur­
glary and attempted escape.


Necessity

  There is no doubt that "necessity" is a defence to an action in trespass,
especially when human life is at stake 47 The defence probably applies to
"intentional torts." It will apply if the defendant takes "reasonable

measures” to deal with a "real and imminent danger.”48 The police may be
able to rely on it to justify taking reasonably necessary steps to prevent
crime.49 The defence will not, however, be available if the necessity has
arisen from the defendant's own negligence.50
   In the case of R igby v. Chief C on stable51 the police successfully relied on
this defence to an action for trespass when they had set the plaintiff's gun
shop alight by firing CS gas canisters into it to "flush out" a dangerous
armed psychopath. Although the trespass was justified by necessity it was
no defence to an allegation of negligence in making arrangements to deal
with the consequences of the intrusion. The defendant was, therefore,
found guilty of negligence for firing the gas canister when no fire fighting
equipment was on hand.52


The plaintiff is a wrongdoer

   This defence has been discussed in relation to trespass to the person53and
interference with goods.S4 Its scope remains unclear but it seems that the
plaintiff's wrongdoing may, in some circumstances extinguish any right of
action in reliance on the maxim ex turpi causa non oritur actio-, an action
does not arise from a base cause. In the case of T hackw ell v. B arclay’s
B ank 33 Hutchison J. suggested that the Court should consider whether
there was any illegality of which the court should take notice and whether,
if there was, giving relief to the plaintiff was contrary to public policy
because it would be indirectly assisting or encouraging him in his criminal
act.
   The fact that the plaintiff was engaged in a criminal act may mean that he
cannot recover for damage caused by the defendant's tortious conduct. In
M urphy v. Culhane56 it was held that a man who takes part in a criminal
affray may be said "to have been guilty of such a wicked act as to deprive
himself of a cause of action."37
   On the other hand, the plaintiff's wrongdoing may mean that the defend­
ant's acts were not, in the circumstance, tortious. In the case of A sh to n v.
Turner 58 Ewbank J. held that:
      "The law of England may in certain circumstances not recognise the
      existence of a duty of care by one participant in a crime to another parti­
      cipant in the same crime, in relation to an act done in connection with

    the commission of that crime. The law is based on public policy, and
    the application of the law depends on a consideration of all the facts."
He went on to find that, on the facts, no duty of care existed between the
plaintiff and the defendants.
   This defence is, however, limited in scope and "Cases where an action in
tort has been defeated by [it] . . . are exceedingly rare."39It is submitted that
it will only succeed in two situations:
     (1) where, to establish his cause of action the plaintiff has to rely on
         criminal activity to found his claim60;
     (2) where, by giving the relief sought the court would be "indirectly
         assisting or encouraging" him in his criminal act.61
Thus, for example, a claim that the police had not shown proper care in
looking after a person in police custody, would not be defeated simply
because the person being held was being held for admitted wrongdoing. On
the other hand, a plaintiff who was injured following a negligent failure by
the police to deal with his 999 call in relation to a criminal affray which he
had instigated would not succeed in a negligence claim.
NEGLIGENCE
P o lic e
Negligence and police activities


   There is no doubt that in many spheres of activity the police are liable for
negligence and that no special principles of law apply. One example which
lies outside the range of this book concerns "accident at work" negligence
actions brought by serving police officers. Such actions are common and are
governed by the same principles which cover ordinary negligence actions by
employees.
   Similarly, actions against the police in respect of negligent driving are
common and usually uncontroversial in law. It has been held that police
drivers, acting in the course of their duties owe the same duty of care as all
other road users.46 This applies even when they are answering emergency
calls.
   The fact that the police are engaged in "policing" activities does not
exempt them from ordinary duties of care. These duties of care are not
"negatived" just because the police are engaged in difficult or dangerous
work—but the nature of the work is taken into account in assessing the
applicable "standard of care." The principle is clearly illustrated by the case
of Marshall v. O sm o n d 47 which involved injury to a suspected criminal at
the end of a chase by a police car. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial
judge on the law and held that a police officer owed the same duty of care to
a criminal he was pursuing as to anyone else, namely a duty "to exercise
such care and skill as is reasonable in all the circumstances."48 They went
on to support the trial judge's conclusion and held that the officer was, in
fact, not in breach of this duty.
   If police conduct, in all the circumstances, falls below the standard
expected of "reasonable police officers" the courts will impose negligence
liability. Thus, in the case of K nightley v. Johns 49 the police had been called
to an accident in a tunnel. The police inspector in charge, in contravention
of standing orders, had forgotten to close the tunnel to traffic. He therefore
ordered the plaintiff, a police motorcyclist, to ride back down the tunnel,

46   See G a y n o i v. A l l e n [1959] 2 Q.B. 403> W o o d s v. R ic h a r d s [1977] R.T.R. 20.

against the flow of traffic, to close it to traffic. The plaintiff collided with a
car and the Court of Appeal held that the Chief Constable was vicariously
liable for the inspector's negligence. The case raised complex questions con­
cerning novus actus interveniens but the point to note is that there was no
discussion as to whether the police should be held liable for a negligent per­
formance of their duties. The Court assumed that, if the inspector did not
come up to the standard of the "reasonable police officer” (and there was no
novus a c tu s ) then negligence liability followed.
   In general then, when the police are acting (as opposed to failing to act)
they will owe a duty of care to people who are likely to be directly affected
by their actions. No policy considerations will "restrict or negative” this
duty of care. This is illustrated by four cases in which such a duty of care
was accepted.
   The briefly reported case of Bryson v. N orthum bria Police A u th o rity 50
concerned a young man who had been arrested for drunkenness, kept in a
cell to sober up for some time and then released at 4.55a.m. In the cell he
had been vomiting and it seems unlikely that he had fully recovered by the
time of his release. Wandering home in the wrong direction he was killed in
an accident on an urban by-pass. In those circumstances Reeve J. held that
the police, in exercising their discretion whether to release or detain an
arrested person owe him a duty of care, but that, on the facts they had dis­
charged that duty. No policy considerations appear to have limited the duty.
   A similar approach was adopted by Taylor J. in the case of R igby v. Chief
C onstable of N o rth am pton .31 This involved police attempts to ''flush'' a
psychopath out of a gun shop. They did this with CS gas which was gener­
ated by a canister which got very hot and which the police knew was likely
to cause a fire. The police originally had a fire engine on hand but it left and
they made no attempt to replace it. A CS canister was then used with no fire
fighters at the scene. The canister did in fact cause a fire which destroyed
the plaintiff's shop. In these circumstances he was able to recover damages
for negligence. No "policy considerations" limited the duty of care.
   The county court case of Charles Wilson A u to m o b ile Engineers v. Chief
C onstable of Greater M a n c h e ste r,2 involved a claim for the negligent
release of a car from police custody. The police stopped the car and arrested
the occupants on suspicion of theft. Although the occupants were of no
fixed abode, with no documents and were not the registered keepers of the
car they were released two hours later with the car and they disappeared.
The judge held that:
      "a police officer owes a duty to the owner of goods which he has seized
      to take reasonable care for their safety, to make such enquiries as may
      be reasonable to ascertain their ownership and to take reasonable steps
      to return them to their owner if that is possible.”53
The duty owed by the officer was said to be "to take such care as is reason­
able in all the circumstances."34As the judge said:

         "One has to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case
         including, for example, the difficulty of any problem facing the officer,
         the nature and extent of the information available to him, the need in
         some circumstances perhaps to make a swift decision and the myriad of
         other considerations which may arise in any particular case."53
 On the facts, it was held that the police were negligent.
    The Scots law in this area is the same as that in England and the Court of
 Session case of A llan (or Wilson) v. Chief Constable of Lothian et? Borders
 Police36 provides a useful illustration of the applicability of ordinary negli­
 gence principles to the police. The pursuer (plaintiff) was a widow whose
 husband had died of hypothermia in a field after having been taken away in
 a police car. The police had been called after a domestic dispute in the
 middle of the night. The deceased had been drunk and aggressive and the
 police were removing him from the place where he had been causing
 trouble.
    Although Lord McCluskey was not prepared to hold that the police had
 "deliberately decided to teach . . . (the deceased) a lesson by depositing him
 in the remote outskirts of Edinburgh"37he was of the view that:
         "there is no escape from the fact that had the police officers given any
         thought to the weather conditions, the deceased's condition, the
         deceased's clothing, the remote location in which they left him, the
         conditions underfoot they would have been bound to realise that he
         was a danger to himself."38
He held that the police had a choice, whether to release the deceased or to
hold him and:
         "In deciding how to exercise that choice they had a duty to exercise a
         reasonable care to have regard to the reasonably foreseeable conse­
         quences of his being released."39
Although it was not reasonably foreseeable that the deceased would die of
hypothermia the damage suffered by him was of a "reasonably foreseeable
type"—that is harm by adverse weather conditions—and could, therefore,
be recovered for.60
  The judge concluded that "the police failed in their duty to take reason­
able care for . . . (the deceased's) safety"61 and his widow was, therefore,
awarded damages of £62,537 calculated on ordinary "fatal accidents" prin­

  In summary when police officers act in a negligent way they will in
general be liable according to ordinary principles. However, they will not be
subject to high standards of care in situations in which there is an important
discretionary element in the activity in question.

1. The Legal Status
and Organisation of the
Police


1. INTRODUCTION

   The legal status of the British police is complex and suffers from many
obscurities. Modem statutes governing the position have, according to the
familiar pattern, been constructed on common law assumptions which have
never been fully clarified. Despite the central importance of the police in the
legal system there are considerable doubts as to such fundamental matters as
their precise duties, the legal status of the organised "police force" and the
extent to which they are obliged to follow the orders of police authorities.
   Many civil actions against the police turn on the extent of their powers.
These powers flow partially from statute and partially from their status as
"constables" at common law. An understanding of the "office of constable"
and the duties which flow from it remains fundamental to any analysis of
the legal position of the police. The powers which the law gives to the
police are, almost always, vested in individual constables. It is important to
distinguish between the different types of powers involved. These areas
dealt with in the first section of this chapter.
   Although the law has taken very little direct cognisance of the fact that
the police operate in "forces" an understanding of police organisation and
hierarchy is sometimes of great importance in considering the civil law pos­
ition of police officers. In the second section of this chapter, therefore, the
organisation and structure of the police is considered. This involves not
only the organisation of individual police forces but the relationship of
forces to police authorities and to the Home Secretary. The police are regu­
lated by a tri-partite system designed by the Police Act 1964. The present
constitutional arrangement is that the police (outside London) are super­
vised by an ill-defined co-ordination of chief constables, police authorities
and the Home Secretary.
   The relationship between police officers can give rise to practical problems
in relation to "vicarious liability." Difficult and unresolved questions arise
concerning the circumstances in which chief constables are liable for the torts
of officers in their force and the precise legal relationship between officers.
These questions are considered in the fourth section of the chapter. In thefinal
section police ranks, appointment and promotion are briefly discussed.
2. THE CONSTABLE: OFFICE, DUTIES AND
POWERS


Introduction

   From the point of view of most citizens the police appear to be one more
branch of the government. They seem to be a nationally organised, hier­
archical and disciplined body of men, under the ultimate control of the
Home Secretary. In strict law, however, their position is very different.
Although they are public servants in the broadest sense, they have a unique
legal status. A police constable is an officer of the Crown and holds a public
office. He is said to exercise an original discretion in keeping the Queen's
peace which derives from the office of constable and the swearing of the
constable's oath. He is said to be answerable to the law and to the law alone.
   The position of chief constables and the Metropolitan and City of London
Police Commissioners is also unique. The conventional view of their pos­
ition is that they have complete "operational independence" from national
and local government. It is said that the responsibility for maintaining law
and order belongs solely to chief officers and no minister of the Crown or
locally constituted police authority is entitled to interfere with the way in
which they carry out these functions. This doctrine is discussed and criti­
cised in Chapter 13.1
   The roots of the unique constitutional status of the police are to be found
in the gradual evolution of the common law system of part-time, unpaid,
"parish constables" into the modern professional police force. The first
organised "police force" along modem lines was, of course, established in
London by the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829. This force was always
under the ultimate direction of the Home Secretary although the precise
limits of his powers over it have never been clearly established.2 Outside
London, local authorities were empowered to set up police forces by the
Municipal Corporations Act 1835 (in the boroughs) and the County Police
Act 1839 (in the counties). The next century saw the slow development of
the present policing system with the number of police forces declining
(from 237 in 1856 to 43 today), chief constables gradually asserting their
"operational independence" and the Home Office taking on an increasing
range of regulatory and supervisory functions.3The modem policing system
was substantially in place after 1945 and was confirmed and regularised by
the Police Act 1964. Although this legislation clarified the relationships
between police authorities, chief constables and the Home Office4 the basic
"element of policing" is the same as it has been for many centuries: the
common law constable. Despite the increasing numbers of statutory func­
tions given to the constable over the past 150 years, there has been no com­
prehensive statutory definition of his duties. His basic legal status is still
defined by the common law.

The office of constable

  The 1929 Royal Commission5 described the police in the following
terms:
      "The police of this country have never been recognised either in law or
      tradition as distinct from the general body of citizens. Despite the
      imposition of many extraneous duties on the Police by legislation and
      administrative action, the principle remains that a Policeman, in the
      view of the common law is only "a person paid to perform, as a matter
      of duty, acts which if he were so minded he might have done volun­
      tarily."6
Although these remarks are often quoted they do not recognise crucial dif­
ferences between the common law powers of constables and those of private
citizens. At common law a constable could arrest a person whom he had
"reasonable and probable cause to suspect" was guilty of treason or felony
(both of which at common law were capital offences). Furthermore, the
common law also gave constables, but not ordinary citizens, a range of
powers of entry and search.7
  Although the distinctive role of the individual police constable was recog­
nised by the common law, the police force as an organisation of constables,
was not. Thus, H a ls b u iy ’s Laws of England states that:
      "notwithstanding that the police have numerous statutory powers and
      duties, in essence a police force is neither more or less than a number of
      individual constables whose status derives from the common law,
      organised together in the interests of efficiency."8

acts as an officer of the Crown and a public servant.9 Consequently, as a
public officer, a constable commits a common law offence if he wilfully and
culpably neglects to perform any duty which he is bound to perform (either
at common law or by statute) unless the discharge of the duty would
involve greater danger than a man of ordinary firmness and authority might
expect to encounter.10
  By virtue of the office itself, a constable acts on his own responsibility
when exercising his powers (unless executing a lawfully issued warrant).11
Therefore, although a chief constable commands his force, he cannot give
an officer under his command an order to do acts which can only be lawfully
done if the officer himself forms a suspicion on reasonable grounds.12

Similarly, he cannot divest policemen of their powers of arrest and any
attempt to do so would be unlawful.13
  A distinctive feature of the “office of constable" is the swearing of the
constable's oath. Every constable upon his appointment must be attested as
a constable by making a declaration that he does—
      “solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that . . . (he) will well and
      truly serve Our Sovereign Lady, the Queen, in the office of constable
      without favour or affection malice or ill will; and that . . . (he) will to
      the best of his power cause the peace to be kept and preserved and pre­
      vent all offences against persons and properties of Her Majesty's sub­
      jects; and while . . . [he] will to the best of his skill and knowledge,
      disqharge all the duties thereof faithfully according to the law."14
The declaration must be made before the Commissioner or Assistant Com­
missioner of the Metropolis or in any other case, a justice of the peace with
jurisdiction within the police area.13 The Royal Commission on the Police
suggested that the constable's claim to be independent from outside control
is reflected in the terms of the constable's oath.16However, it is difficult to
see how such a suggestion can be supported by an examination of the words
of the attestation itself.17


The "independence” of the constable

  Lustgarten has suggested that the precise nature of the constable's "orig­
inal authority" and "independence" can be subjected to further analysis.18
He argues that "discretion" plays a central role. Perhaps the most important
aspect of a constable's discretion is whether or not to invoke the criminal
law in the first place.19 Yet, the obvious dangers inherent in selective law
enforcement have not troubled the courts. In A rrow sm ith v. Jenkins20 the
Divisional Court dismissed such a complaint. Lord Parker C.J. said:
      "I think the defendant feels that she is under a grievance because—and
      one may put it this way—she says: 'Why pick on me? There have been
      many meetings in this street from time to time. The police, as on this
      occasion have attended these meetings and assisted to make free pas­
      sage, and there is no evidence that anybody else has ever been pros­
      ecuted. Why pick on me?' That of course has nothing to do with this
      court. The sole question here is whether the defendant has contravened
      [the statute].21"

The duties of the constable


   The duties of constable derive from his office and have long been thought
to be common law duties. However, in George v. G arland 24 it was held that
the obligations of a police officer had become statutory duties because they
are now expressed in the form of delegated legislation.25 In any event, the
question of whether the constable's duties are statutory or exist at common
law is irrelevant for the purposes of enforcing them by way of judicial
review 26 The House of Lords made it clear in C.C.S.U. v. M inister for the
C ivil Service 27 that judicial review will apply to a power derived from the
common law or the royal prerogative just as much as it does to a statutory
power.
   The primary function of the constable is the preservation of the Queen's
Peace.28 The leading case of Glasbrook Bros. v. Glamorgan C ou n ty Coun­
cil 29 concerned the payment of the police by colliery owners during a coal
miners strike. Viscount Cave stated that
        "No doubt there is an absolute and unconditional obligation binding
        the police authorities to take all steps which appear to them necessary
        for keeping the peace, for preventing crime or for protecting property
        from criminal injury."30
  In Rice v. Connolly31 Lord Parker C.J. described the duties of the police as
follows:
        "it is part of the obligations and duties of a police constable to take all
        steps which appear to him to be necessary for keeping the peace, for

      preventing crime or for protecting property from criminal injury. There
      is no exhaustive definition of the powers and obligations of the police
      but they are at least these and they would further include the duty to
      detect crime and to bring offenders to justice."32
Thus, it is a constable's duty to prevent breaches of the peace that he
reasonably apprehends33 but not to protect an individual against "a mere
apprehension of future crime."34 He is under a general duty to protect life
and property3'"1and to execute in his area a warrant issued by a justice of the
peace.36
  There is an important discretionary element in these duties. As Sir John
Donaldson M.R. has put it:37
      "There is no doubt about the duty of the Chief and other Constables to
      keep the peace and enforce the law . . . However, Chief Constables
      have the widest possible discretion in their choice of the methods
      whereby they will discharge this duty (R. v. Com m issioner of Police for
      the Metropolis, ex. p. Blackburn [1968] 2 Q.B. 118)."38

Cases such as Glasbrook Bros. v. Glamorgan Cou nty Council39 and Rice v.
C onnolly 40 express this discretion in subjective terms: a constable must do
what appears to him to be necessary. Nevertheless, it has been established
by a number of important judicial review cases over the past two decades
that, however subjective a discretion is, its exercise is subject to objective
principles. The discretion must be exercised bona fide in accordance with
the law, relevant matters must be taken into account and irrelevant matters
must be excluded 41 Furthermore, in the Scottish case of Wilson v. Chief
C onstable of Lothian & Borders 42 it was held that, in exercising their dis­
cretion, the police owed a duty of care to someone who would, foreseeably,
be affected by its exercise.
  In general, a constable's duties:
      "must be carried out in a fair and even-handed manner. Because his
      resources are finite he will not be able to provide perfect protection for
      all. Even if he has available resources his public duty is not boundless.
      He has a duty to protect against crime or threatened crime, particularly
      threatened violent crime. It is not his public duty to protect against the
      mere apprehension of possible crime. There is no absolute standard of
      duty and no definition of the exact amount of police protection to

      circumstances.”43



 The nature of police powers


   In order to be able to carry out their various duties in an effective manner
the law gives constables a number of special "powers." Under these powers
the police are “authorised" to do things which would otherwise be unlaw­
ful. If an ordinary citizen attempted to stop and search people in the street,
to arrest them on suspicion of having committed crimes, or to enter and
search their houses he would usually be liable to civil action. Police powers
provide constables with a defence of “lawful justification" against civil
actions in respect of actions carried out in pursuance of their duties.
   In invoking their powers the police are seeking to justify activity which
is, prima facie, an unlawful interference with another's interests.
   As a general principle of statutory construction, statutes which justify
such activity must be strictly construed against those seeking 10 reply on
them. To cite the words of Lord Diplock:
      "if the statutory words relied upon as authorising the acts are ambigu­
      ous or obscure, a construction should be placed upon them that is least
      restrictive of individual rights which would otherwise enjoy the protec­
      tion of the common law."44
The comments of Lord Scarman on the importance of express statutory pro­
vision are also relevant here:
      "it is not the task of judges, exercising their ingenuity in the field of
      implication, to go further in the invasion of private rights and liberties
      than Parliament has expressly authorised. The importance of express
      provision is that it affords the citizen the opportunity, if he chooses to
      use it, to read and understand the extent to which his rights and liber­
      ties have been curtailed."43
  Police powers are of three basic types: common law powers, without war­
rant powers and with warrant powers. Different considerations apply to
defences of "lawful justification" based on different types.

(1) C o m m o n l a w p o w e r s . Despite increasing trends towards the statutory
codification of police powers the common law position remains of crucial
importance in many cases. This is in part due to parliament's strange reluc­
tance to abolish common law powers, even when enacting statutory powers
covering the same ground. An example of this is the failure of the Police and

45 M orris v. B ea rd m o re 119811 A.C. 446 a t 463.
 Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to abolish common law powers of seizure.46
Police powers at common law have been refined and adapated by judicial
decision over the centuries. The courts continue to play a creative role in
this field. The most recent example being the extension of the M areva juris­
diction to the police.47 As a matter of general principle such extensions
should be limited in scope because the powers in question represent
invasions of the common law rights of citizens.
   Common law police powers are usually such that they can only be exer­
cised if certain preconditions of fact and belief are fulfilled. Thus a constable
has a common law power to arrest someone whom he sees breaking the
peace or who so conducts himself that he causes a breach of the peace to be
reasonably apprehended. If no breach of the peace has taken place and none
is reasonably apprehended then the constable has no common law power of
arrest and any arrest made will be unlawful.

(2) Without warrant powers. Many of the most important police powers
of arrest, search, entry and seizure are statutory “without warrant" powers.
In other words, they can only be exercised if particular preconditions of fact
or belief laid down by the statute are fulfilled. The majority of such powers
are now to be found in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. If the
preconditions of fact or belief laid down by the Act are not met then an
arrest, search or entry will have been done without "lawful justification"
and an action in tort will lie. It is important to note that the lawfulness of
the exercise of a police power must be justified at the time of its exercise, "It
cannot be made lawful or unlawful according to what happens after­
wards."48
   The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 contains a number of "proce­
dural safeguards" in relation to "without warrant" powers. It is submitted
that the proper approach when examining such provisions is as follows:
   (a) It is first necessary to consider whether the police conduct at the tim e
they are obliged to follow a particular provision is prima facie tortious: are
they detaining or searching a person, entering land or holding goods at that
time? If not then no action in tort will lie simply for a breach of the proce­
dural safeguards. A failure to carry out a procedure that must be followed
after the prima facie tortious conduct has occurred will not retrospectively
render otherwise lawful actions unlawful.49 Thus, for example, the police
will not be guilty of false imprisonment solely because they fail to comply
with a duty which arises after the suspect has been subjected to a "stop and
search."50

   a t p. 67, n. 79.
   (b) I f the conduct is prima facie tortious it is necessary to identify the
police power in the Act which "justifies" the conduct and consider whether
the police have acted "in accordance" with it;
   (c) If the police have not acted in accordance with their statutory power it
is necessary to consider whether or not, on a true construction of the stat­
ute, the provision casts a m a n d a to ry du ty on the police. A procedural safe­
guard which gives the suspect an entitlement but which places the police
under no duty to implement it will not render them liable in tort if they fail
to do so (although an action for breach of statutory duty may lie).31
   (d) If the police were acting in a way which was prima facie tortious and
are in breach of a mandatory duty laid down by the statute then, it is sub­
mitted, they will be deprived of the defence of "lawful justification" and an
action in tort will lie.32
  Under section 66 of the 1984 Act the Secretary of State has a duty to issue
codes of practice in connection with "searches of premises by police offi­
cers" and "the seizure of property found by police officers on persons or
premises."33 Any breach of the provisions of these codes of practice will
render a police officer liable to disciplinary' proceedings.34 But, by section
67(10) a failure of a police officer to comply with any provision of a code
"shall not of itself render him liable to any criminal or civil proceedings."
Nevertheless, it is provided by section 67( 11) that
       "In all criminal and civil proceedings any such code shall be admissible
       in evidence; and if any provision of such a code appears to the court or
       tribunal conducting the proceedings to be relevant to any question aris­
       ing in the proceedings it shall be taken into account in determining that
       question."
In other words, the provisions of a code can be taken into account in civil
proceedings. They will, it is submitted, be relevant to the "reasonableness"
of police conduct in particular situations. Rather like the Highway Code
they will not be definitive of this but will provide a basic framework within
which reasonableness can be assessed.53

(3) “With warrant” powers. Police arrests, entries, searches and seizures
are often conducted under the authority of a legal authorisation or "war­
rant."36 A warrant gives the person to whom it is issued lawful authority to
do acts which would otherwise be unlawful. A warrant provides a complete
defence to a civil action in respect of things done "in obedience to it." Even
if a warrant is, in fact, invalid the police will have a statutory defence under
the Constables Protection Act 1750 provided they act "in obedience" to it.37

was because police constables were not "servants" of the watch committee
or the chief constable but independent "officers of the Crown." The pos­
ition was summarised as follows:
       "A constable . . . when acting as a peace officer, is not exercising a dele­
       gated authority, but an original authority, and the general law of agency
       has no application."12
   It is submitted that, on the narrow question of whether police officers are
"servants" of their watch committees or police authority this conclusion
was legally sound.13Nevertheless, it gave rise to considerable practical diffi­
culties as members of the public would bring civil actions against individ­
ual constables who had no right to recompense from public funds against
awards of damages. The practice seems to have been to give financial sup­
port on an ad hoc case by case basis. The use of public funds by the Home
Office to settle a civil action in 1959 gave rise to stormy parliamentary
debates and was one of the factors which led to the setting up of the Royal
Commission on the Police.14
  The Royal Commission recommended that statutory provision be made
for vicarious liability and this was enacted by section 48(1) of the Police Act
1964. This provides that the chief constable of a particular police force (or,
in London, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner) is vicariously liable—
      "in respect of torts committed by constables under his direction and
      control in the performance or purported performance of their functions
      in like manner as a master is liable in respect of torts committed by his
      servants in the course of their employment."
If the officers committing the tort were being "lent" by one police force to
another under the provisions of section of the Police Act 1964 then, by sec­
 tion 14(3) they are deemed to be under the direction and control of the chief
officer to whom they are lent.
    If a chief officer is found to be vicariously liable for a tort committed by a
constable under his direction and control then damages are payable out of
the police fund.13 If an action against a chief officer is settled then the
damages are payable out of the police fund only if the settlement is
approved by the police authority.16
    The provisions of section 48 give rise to a number of potential practical
problems. First, it applies unclear common law provisions to the vicarious
liability of chief constables without dealing with possible differences
between police officers and ordinary employees. Secondly, instead of deem­
ing constables to be servants for all purposes it confines this to actions in
tort. This may give rise to difficulties in questions of vicarious responsi­
bility outside the law of tort. These problems are considered in the next two
sections.

Vicarious liability and the law of tort

   The effect of section 48 is to fix a chief constable with liability in all situ­
ations in which a “master is liable in respect of torts committed by his ser­
vants in the course of his employment." The situations in which a master is
so liable depend on the very considerable case law in this area. Only the
briefest of guidelines can be given here.17
   The question to be asked in all vicarious liability cases is whether, at the
time the tort was committed, the servant was “acting within the scope of
his employment."18 This does not mean that the servant must, in fact, be
acting in performance of his master's purposes in an authorised way. If a ser­
vant is doing an authorised act then the master will be liable even if it is
being done in an unauthorised manner.19 If a servant is doing an act which
is expressly forbidden by his master then the master will still be liable if the
prohibition deals with conduct within the sphere of his employment. If, on
the other hand, the prohibition limits the sphere of employment itself then
the master will not be liable in respect of the prohibited acts.20 The com­
mon law position is explicitly recognised in section 48 by the words "in the
purported performance of their functions."
   It is submitted that if a constable is on duty and is bona fide purporting to
carry out policing functions then there is no doubt that his chief constable
will be vicariously liable for any torts committed by him. If, however, a con­
stable is acting so outrageously that it could not possibly be thought that he
was "purporting to perform policing functions" then his chief may be in a
position to deny vicarious liability. Thus, for example, if a police officer
goes shoplifting whilst on duty it is difficult to see how his chief officer
could be vicariously liable for wrongful interference with goods. As in all
such cases liability will depend on all the circumstances of a particular case.
   A difficult which is peculiar to the vicarious liability of police officers
concerns torts committed by "off duty" police officers. In ordinary master
and servant cases there can be no question of vicarious liability if the ser­
vant is not actually working for the master at the time the tort is commit­
ted. The position in relation to the police is less clear.
   Police constables hold office under the Crown and it can be argued that
they continue to have responsibilities of such office whether or not they are
formally on duty. This is a problem which must often arise in practice in
relation to the criminal offence of "assaulting a constable in the execution
of his duty" contrary to section 51(1) of the Police Act 1964: is a person who
assaults an off-duty constable guilty of the offence? Surprisingly enough,
there is no direct authority on this point. The indirect authorities point in
different directions. In the case oiM cL orie v. O xford 21 Donaldson L.J. treats
an officer's being on duty as a necessary condition for his acting "in the
execution of his duty."22 On the other hand, the defendant in the case of

22 As h e a lso does in C o ffin v. S m i t h (1980) 71 C r.A p p.R . 221.
A lb e r t v. Lavin 23 was convicted of the section 51 offence in relation to an
off-duty police officer. Although the point was not explicitly considered by
either the Divisional Court (which included Donaldson L.J.) or the House of
Lords the conviction was upheld.
  It is submitted that, in strict law, police constables are always on duty.
Thus, a chief constable will be liable for any torts committed by a police
officer "in purported performance of" policing functions whether or not the
officer was on duty for police pay purposes at thp time.
  Although there are a number of potential difficulties in this area there is
no reported case in which a chief officer has sought to contend that he was
not vicariously liable for the actions of one of his constables.


Agency and the police

   The case of Fisher v. O ld h a m 24 not only denies that constables are "ser­
vants" of watch committees but goes on to hold that they exercise "original
authority" and are that the "law of agency has no application."23 If this
were correct then it would mean that one police officer, exercising his func­
tions as a "peace officer," could never be regarded as "acting on behalf" of
the chief constable and senior officers who were giving him orders. This
could have some impact on civil actions where questions of police knowl­
edge are at stake.
   It is submitted, however, that police officers must now be regarded as
agents of their chief officer. The contrary dicta in Fisher v. O ld h a m 16 are,
strictly, obiter as the case was directly concerned only with the relationship
of master and servant. In any event, the position has now, arguably, been
altered by the effect of section 5 of the Police Act 1964 which places a police
force under the direction and control of the chief constable. Such direction
and control suggests a subordination of the original authority of individuals
constables to that of the chief constable.27 This contention is supported by
the case of H a w k in s v. B e p e y * in which it was held that a police officer
instituting a prosecution was, in effect, doing so "on behalf of" his chief
constable.
   It is submitted, therefore, that police officers are properly regarded as
agents of chief officers of police. It would follow that the usual principles of
the law of agency apply. In particular, information which is given to a police
officer within the scope of his authority is effective as if it were given to his
principal, the chief officer. Matters which are known by any constable
would therefore, be deemed to be known by the chief officer, and hence by
all officers under his command as his agents.
   The impact of this conclusion in police cases is limited by the fact that
many police powers depend on the state of knowledge of the individual con­
stable concerned. In deciding whether an arrest is lawful the knowledge and
beliefs of the arresting officer (or the officer who supplied the information

make an arrest.30 The lawfulness of continued detention depends on what
was known to the custody officer.31 Whenever a statute requires a
constable to have reasonable grounds then principles of agency will be irrel-

     POI.ICE DUTIES AND RFSPONSTBTT.TTTF5.

The basis of present day police duties and responsibilities lies in the
requirement of each individual officer to uphold the the fundamental
principles contained in the statutory declaration taken upon enrolment This
is required by Section 18 of the Police Act 1964 and defined by schedule 2
to that Act as follows;


 Z— ... of...
 “               do so/emn/yandsincerely dec/areandaffirm t/iatI w/ff

according to the/aw.M

The composition of this oath indicates a duty to Sovereign, state, people
and custom in accordance with the dictates of the law*


A police officer’s authority, therefore, arises from his having sworn to serve
the Crown and when on duty he acts as an officer of the Crown and a
public servant His powers are exercised by virtue of his office and on his
own responsibility.
                                      1
 Chief Constables and senior officers are not liable, except under certain
statutes, for the actions of their subordinates and constables are not
employees of police authority or Crown.


This unique position must be considered when looking at the responsibi­
lity of the police collectively or as an organsiation.


The precise constitutional position of the constable is still somewhat
ambiguous and little is written on the subject in government and
constitutional commentaries.


In 1959 a disagreement between the Nottingham Watch Committe and
the Chief Constable led to detailed debate about the constitutional
relationship between police authorities and police acting as law
enforcemnet officers. The Watch Committee dismissed the Chief
Constable but his re-instatment was secured by the Home Office. Their
view was that chief officers of police, as constables at common law,
exercise a discretionary authority in keeping the peace and are not subject
to control or instructions by watch committes whilst performing their
law enforcement function.


The original office of constable was held at common law and later
enlarged by the Statute of Wincester. It is debatable if, at that time, any
independence of action or freedom from control, was envisaged. The
status of constable was subject to variance and by the eighteenth century
had diminished to that of servant of the local Justices.
The supposition of the individuality of the powers of a constable is based
upon an interpretation of statute law which asserts that powers are
conferred on a constable as ” original ” and not ” delegated ” from any
other authority.


This position has not arisen as a result of any judicial enquiry neither is
there any principle in English public law on which it is based.


The only time when the position of the constable has been subject to
judicial review has been in the area of civil liability and in particular the
general rule that there is no master and servant relationship between
constables and their police authorities.


A man took an action against Oldham Corporation after being wrongly
arrested on a warrant.


His case was based on the fact that he considered the defendents were
acting through their watch committee and were the police authority for the
County Borough of Oldham and thus the employers of the police for the
borough.


The mans counsel was unable to cite any English decision in which civil
liability of a police authority for the actions of its constables had been
determined.


Judgement examined the relevant provisions of the Municipal Corporations
Act 1882 which provided watch committes with the ability to make
regulations to ensure borough constables were efficient in the discharge of
their duties. However, this authority was complicated by the Police Act
1919 which gave the Home Secretary, as central police authority, power to
make regulations as to the government, pay, allowances, conditions of
service etc.
From these considerations and the common law view of the status of a
constable, it was clear that the police were fulfilling their duties as public
servants and officers of the Crown and the corporation were not
answerable in law for their actions. Judgement was given for the
defendents.


fls/ier v O/d/iam Corporation f 1930J.

The effect of the judgement was to make it plain that the powers of a
police officer, whether conferred by common or statute law, are exercised
by him by virtue of his office and cannot be exercised on the responsibility
of any person but himself.

A number of Royal Commissions, public enquiries etc, have reviewed this
general principle but it remains essentially intact.


Following a Royal Commission in 1960, the Police Act 1964 made Chief
Constables responsible in law for torts committed by his officers.


Further cases have confirmed the independence of the constable and the
position at present can be summarised by words from the judgement in R
v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis ex parte Blackburn ( 1968 ).


” Every constable in the land should be and is independent of the executive.
No minister of the Crown can tell him he must or must not keep
observation on this place or that he must or must not prosecute this person
or that, nor can any police authority tell him to do so. ”
The actual position of the police as an independent authority has never been
stated.


The cases quoted clearly indicate the thoughts of the judiciary but there is
evidence that this position is otherwise regarded by the executive. One such
example is contained within the Customs and Excise Management Act
1979, where customs and excise, being a revenue gathering service of the
government, have power conferred by the legislation to demand police
assistance.


We see then that each invidual within the police has a duty and responsibi­
lity to disharge his duties according to the law and is responsible for his
conduct.


The police as an organisation have a duty to enforce prohibitions created by
the legislature. When a law is passed it will, if required, grant a power to
the police to enable enforcement.


Inherent in the power granted is the requirement of its use, and therefore, a
duty or responsibility to use it as circumstances dictate.


Many laws actually require a course of action by the police or chief
constables as with firearms control, immigration or licensing, and no
discretion is available in many instances.
Other laws within the criminal field are intentionally defined vaguely to
give the police discretionary powers. Threatening and abusive words or
behaviour under the Public Order Act or obstrucing free passage along the
highway under the Highways Act are such examples which allow the
police to control a situation using their judgement, they cannot be
understood as acts against which the police are instructed to proceed.


The law and the criminal justice system do not influence the police by
direct means or instructions. They define a set of opportunities and
constraints. The powers conferred by the law are resources that the police
may use in pursuing their objectives.


It may be said that the police have a duty to enforce all laws equally and
not attempt to change the rules by non enforcement of selected legislation.


The legislature may, of course, wish to define limits of conduct and set out
codes of behaviour for the police, such as The Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984, again the police have a duty to obey.


It would be pointless to list all those statutes individually which give
powers and responsibilities to the police, any act dealing with criminal law,
traffic law, control of licensed premises etc will by its very nature
empower the police to act as regulatory body.
VICARIOUS
   &
CORPORATE
 LIABILITY
 (7) V ic a rio u s liab ility
    (1) Apart from the criminal liability of corporations, dealt w ith at §§ 17-11 n
 seq., vicarious liability rarely arises in trials on indictm ent, as it is usually confined
 to summary’ offences. In some cases however, these can be tried o n indictment
 w hen the defendant has the right o f election.
    W here an offence has been held to be an absolute offence, in that mens rea as
 defined above is not required, “ the person on w hom a duty is throw n is respon­
 sible, w hether he has delegated or whether he has acted through a servant": R, v,
  Winson [1969] 1 Q .B . 371, C.A ., {per curiam). See also Barker v. Levinson [1951] ]
 K .B . 342; C. Gabriel L td . v. Enfield Borough Council [1971] C rim .L .R . and contrast
 Reynolds x. Austin and Sons Ltd. [1951] 1 K .B. 135.
    In Portsea Island M u tu al Co-operative Society Ltd. v. Leyland [1978] C rim L.R. 554
 the D ivisional Court held that where a milk roundsm an, contrary to his
 em p loyers’ orders and without their knowledge, em ployed a boy o f 10 to help him
 on his round, the em ployers were not guilty o f an offence under section 21 o f the
 Children and Young Persons A ct 1933. T h e Court held that on the authorities the
 roundsm an's em ployers would on ly be liable if there w'as clear evid e n c e that they
 em ployed the child or that a servant, for exam ple a personnel m anager, w ho was
 em ployed to take on staff, em ployed him.
    (2) I n the class o f cases, where a duty is thrown on a particular category o f per­
 sons, e.g. licence holders, it has been held that if that person has delegated his
 responsibilities to another the mens rea o f the delegate will be im puted to the princi­
 pal so as to make the latter criminally liable. T h is form o f liability has been termed
 “vicarious liability.” T h e leading case appears to be Linnett v. Metropolitan Polici
 Commissioner [1946] K .B . 290, D .C . T here a licensee o f a public h o u se was held to
 have been rightly convicted o f “k n ow in gly perm itting disorderly c o n d u c t’ " where
he had absented h im s e lf from the prem ises and had left control to another man
w h o h im se lf had know ingly permitted the disorderly conduct, th o u g h the licensee
defendant was unaw'are o f it.
   Lord Goddard C.J. said: “ T h e point does not, as I say, d epend m erely on the
fact that the relationship o f m aster and servant exists; it depends on the fact that
the person w h o is responsible in la w as the . . . licensee o f the hou se has chosen to
delegate his duties, powers and authority to som ebody else . . . . I do not wish it to
be thought that I am saying that w here a statute provides that in a n y business a
certain act permitted by the m an ager shall be an offence on the part of the
m anager i f it is done w ith his know ledge, that if the act takes place whilst the
m anager h im se lf is carrying on that business and is in charge o f the business but
w ithout his k now ledge, so that he was powerless to prevent it, that person necess­
arily com m its the offence. But if the m anager choose to delegate the carrying on of
the business to another, whether or not that other is his servant, then w hat that
other does or w hat he knows must be im puted to the person w ho put the o t h e r into
that position .”
   (3) C onsiderable d oubts were cast upon this doctrine o f “ vicarious liability by
d elegation ” in Vane v. Yiannopoullos [1965] A.C. 486, H .L . T h e doctrine however
w'as reaffirmed and applied by the C ourt o f A ppeal in R . v. Winson , ante , where Vant
v. Yiannopoullos w’as considered. I n i ? , v. Winson the licensee was absent from the
premises, and the know ledge o f the m anager w as im puted to the absent licensee.
T h e doctrine w as applied in H ow ker v. Robinson [1973] 1 Q .B . 178, D .C . and
extended to the case w here the licensee was on the premises but had delegated the
control o f a particular bar to the barm an. T h e b a r m a n ’s know ledge was imputed
to the licensee. It is subm itted that it is at least doubtful w hether the House of
L ords w ould approve o f any extension o f this doctrine to offences w here it had not
already been applied before the decision in Vane v. Yiannopoullos.
   N o th in g said above affects the liability o f a defendant w ho has counselled, pro*
cured, aided or abetted another to com m it an offence, see post , § 2 9 - 3 et seq.
(8) O ffen c e s by c o rp o ra tio n s
   (1)   T h e question o f w'hich offences can be charged against corporations is con­
sidered in § 1 -2 9 ante. It is proposed now to consider for w hose acts, intention,
know ledge etc., a corporation is held responsible. T h e authorities are mainly con­
c e rn ed with lim ited com panies, but it is sub m itted that they will apply to all
 bodies corporate.
     Where absolute or vicarious liability exists the sam e principles apply as to the
 li ability o f a personal defendant for the acts o f its servants, or its agents in cases
 suc h as Linnett v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, ante.
     (2) A corporation aggregate m ay be indicted, by its corporate nam e, for
 breaches o f public duty, w heth er in the nature o f nonfeasance or o f m isfeasance,
 such as the obstruction o f a h ig h w ay by a railw ay com pany, in a m anner not a u th ­
orised bv their A ct o f Parliament: A tt.-G en . v. London & North Western R y. [1900] 1
 Q.B. 78. It w ould seem , also, that a corporation m a y be indicted by- its corporate
 name, and fined, for a libel published by its order. See Pharmaceutical Society v. Lon­
don & Provincial Supply Association (1880) 5 A p p .C a s. 857, 870; Triplex Safety Glass
 Co. v. Lancegaye Safety Glass Co. (1934) Ltd. [1939] 2 K.B. 395.
     (3) Apart from such cases, the principle seem s to be m ost clearly expressed by
 Lord Diplock in Tesco Supermarkets L td. v. N attrass [1972] A .C . 153 at 199: “ T h e
n a t u r a l persons w h o are to b e treated as being the com pany for the purpose o f acts
done in the course o f its business are those natural persons w h o by the m e m o r a n ­
dum and articles o f association or as a result o f action taken by the directors, or by
the com pany in general m eeting pursuant to the articles, are entrusted w ith the
exercise o f the powers o f the c o m p a n y .”
     (4) In other cases difficult questions have arisen in deciding w hich o f the officers
or servants o f a corporation are to be identified w ith it so that their guilt is the guilt
of the corporation. It m ust b e a question o f law w hether, o n ce the facts have been
ascertained, a person in doing particular things is to be regarded as the corpor­
ation or merely as the corporation’s servant or agent. In Bolton ( Engineering) Co. v.
 Graham [1957] 1 Q .B . 159, 172, Lord D e n n in g M .R . said: “ A com p a n y m a y in
many ways be likened to a hu m an body. It has a brain and nerve centre w h ich
controls what it does. It also has hands w hich hold the tools and act in accordance
with directions from the centre. Som e o f the p eo p le in the co m p a n y are m ere ser­
vants and agents w h o are noth in g more than hands to do the work and can n o t be
said to represent the m ind or will. Others are directors and m anagers w h o rep­
resent the directing m ind and will o f the c om p a n y , and control w ha t it does. T h e
state o f m ind o f these m anagers is the state o f m ind o f the c o m p a n y and is treated
by the law as s u c h .” In Tesco Supermarkets L td . v. Nattrass [1972] A .C . 153, Lord
Reid at p. 171, w h ile generally approving the ab ove-m en tioned statem ent o f Lord
Denning added: “T h ere have been attem pts to apply Lord D e n n in g ’s words to all
servants o f a co m p a n y w hose work is brain work, or w ho exercise som e m anagerial
discretion under the direction o f superior officers o f the c om p a n y . I do not think
that Lord D en n in g intended to refer to them . H e only referred to those w h o rep­
resent the directing m ind and will o f the c om p an y and control w h a t it does. I think
that is right. . . . T h e board o f directors m ay d elegate so m e part o f their functions
of m anagem ent giving to their delegate full discretion to act in d ependently o f
instructions from them . I see no difficulty in holding that they have thereby put
such a delegate in their place so that within the scope o f the delegation he can act
as the com pany. It is not alw ays easy to draw the line, but there are cases in w hich
the line must be d r a w n .” H e cited with approval the speech o f Lord H a ld a n e L.C .
in Lennard’s Carrying Co. L td. v. A siatic Petroleum Co. [1915] A .C . 705, 713 and
expressed the view that R . C. Ham m ett L td. v. Crabb 95 J .P . 180 and R . C. H am m ett
Ltd. v. London County Council 97 J .P . 105 and Series v. Poole [1969] 1 Q .B . 6 76 were
wrongly decided and that in R . v. I. C. R . H aulage Ltd. [1944] K .B . 551 the prin­
ciples relating to the liability o f a com pany for its agent had been too w idely stated.
Lord Morris o f Borthy-y-G est, at page 180, said that there had been no feature o f
delegation in the case to a store m anager, w h o did not function as the directing
mind or will o f the com pany, but w as, so to speak, a cog in the m a ch in e w h ich had
been devised; it w as not left to him to devise it, nor was he w ithin w h at had been
called “ the brain area” o f the com pany. Lord Pearson, at page 192, em phasised
that the shop m anager could not be identified w ith the c o m p a n y ’s ego nor w a s he
an alter ego o f the com pany, bu t an em ployee in a relatively subordinate post. Lord
Diplock, at page 199, laid d ow n the principle set o u t in (3) ante.
     (5) In R . v. Andrews Weatherfoil Ltd. and others (1971) 56 C r.A p p .R . 31, in w h ic h
 Tesco Supermarkets L td. v. N attrass, ante, was followed, the C ourt o f A p p eal stated}
that it w as not every “ responsible a gen t” or “ high e x ecu tive” or “ agent acting onv
beh alf o f a co m p a n y ” w ho could bv his actions m ake the com p an y criminally ,}
responsible, and that it w as necessary to establish w hether the natural person or'.*
persons in question had the status and authority w h ich in law m ade their acts
the matter under consideration the acts o f the com p a n y so that the natural persoiij;
w as to be treated as the com pany itself; and that it w a s necessary for the ju d g e to; j
invite the jury' to consider w hether or not there were established those facts which .
the ju d g e decided as a m atter o f law were necessary to identify the person con-?i
cerned with the com pany.                                                                J
   (6)      T h ere is authority for the proposition that a corporation m ay be liable for;;
the act o f its servant even though that act was do n e in fraud o f the corporation ;
itself. T h u s in Moore v. I. Bresler [1944] 2 All E.R. 515 the subm ission by officers of
a com pany o f false returns o f goods sold (required for assessm ent o f purchase tax)
w as held sufficient to render the com p a n y liable, although the returns had been*
m ade to conceal from the com pany the fact that sales in fraud o f the c om p an y had ,
been m ade. See also R . v. St. M arga ret’s Trust L td. [1958] 1 W .L .R . 522; 42
C r.A pp.R . 183. T h e s e decisions have been the subject o f criticism by writers of
text books and it is doubtful w hether they would now be followed.                        :3

      Director guilty of
      manslaughter
      In an unprecedented case, Norman
      Holt, a director of David Holt Plastics
      Ltd, was recently convicted of
      manslaughter after the death of an
      employee at the company’s factory in
      May 1988*. He had pleaded guilty to
      the charge and was sentenced to 12
      months’ imprisonment suspended for
      two years. His brother and fellow

MISFEASANCE IN PUBLIC OFFICE
6. MISFEASANCE IN A PUBLIC OFFICE

Introduction

  A police constable holds a "public office."82 One consequence of this is
that a constable who wilfully neglects to perform his duty is guilty of a
crime at common law.83 It also entails potential civil liability in the ancient
tort of misfeasance in public office.
  The action for misfeasance in public office can be traced back at least to
the e/rly eighteenth century. In the famous case of A s h b y v. W hite ,84 the
House of Lords upheld an action for damages by an elector who had been
wrongly refused a vote in parliamentary elections. The elements of the tort
were clarified and developed in a number of nineteenth century cases.
Nevertheless, for reasons which are not entirely clear, it appears to have fal­
len into disuse in England for a considerable period85 and the leading text­
books in the law of tort either ignore it entirely or classify it as being
"doubtful/'
  Such a view is now plainly untenable. In the Privy Council case of D u n ­
lop v. Woollahra M u n icipal Council 86 Lord Diplock refers to the "well-
established tort of misfeasance by a public officer in the discharge of his
public duties." In the case of Bourgoin SA v. M in istry of Agriculture87 Mann

an analogous cause of action in Scotland was confirmed by the case of
M icosta SA v. Shetland Islands Council.89


The elements of the tort

  The precise "elements" of the tort do not appear to have been set out sys­
tematically in any case or textbook. There are, it is submitted, four of them.
The tort is committed when:
       (1)   a public officer;
       (2)   causes damage;
       (3)   to a "foreseeable" plaintiff;
       (4)   by acts or omissions which are a "malicious abuse" of his office.

(1) “A public officer.” This term covers:
      "everyone who is appointed to discharge a public duty, and receives
      compensation in wha.tever shape, from the crown or otherwise."90
There can be no doubt that a police constable is a "public officer" in this
sense. In Lewis v. C a ttle 91 Lord Hewart C.J. said that "a police officer is a
person who holds office under His Majesty." The point was conceded in R.
v. D y t h a m 92 In the important Australian case of Farrington v. Thom son e)
Bridgland93 a sergeant of police was held to be the holder of a public office.

(2) Damage. This is required because misfeasance is an action on the case.
Any kind of damage will be sufficient, including, it is submitted, not only
financial damage, but loss of liberty or damage to reputation.94

(3) A foreseeable plaintiff. This element involves the issue of limitation
of the class of potential plaintiffs. In many of.the old cases the defendant's
acts were "aimed at " a particular person for malicious reasons. There was,
therefore only one potential plaintiff and no "limitation" issue arose. In the
Bourgoin case it was unsuccessfully argued that "intent to injure the plain­
tiff" ("targeted malice") was an essential ingredient of the tort. It was held
that a plaintiff would be entitled to sue in either of two situations:
       (1) if damage was caused to him by a malicious act which was aimed at
           him,-
       (2) if the defendant had deliberately done an act which he knew he did
           not have power to do—with knowledge of its consequences—and
           the plaintiff had suffered damage as a result.95

On this view, the class of potential plaintiffs would embrace any claimant
who in fact suffers damage, provided that damage was foreseeable. The
"limitation" issue was not expressly considered in the Bourgoin case but
the class of potential plaintiffs seems dangerously large, bearing in mind the
numbers of people who may be affected by the actions of public officers
such as police constables. It could be argued that one possible limiting prin­
ciple would be to confine plaintiffs to the class of those to whom injury
from an unlawful administrative act is reasonably foreseeable. The test
would, then, be the same as in negligence.
   Another possibility was suggested in the Australian case of Tam pion v.
A n derson .96 It was held that the plaintiff must show that:
      "he was a member of the public or one of the members of the public to
      whom the holder of the office owed a duty not to commit the particular
      abuse complained of."
Thus, it might be argued that if a police officer stood by and allowed
someone to be injured by attackers (as in the D y th a m case!, the person
injured (or, as in D y th a m , his estate or dependants) could sue but, for
example, his employer, could not.
   The whole question of "limitation" of the class of potential plaintiffs to
whom the duty to behave properly in a public office is owed awaits further
judicial clarification.

(4) A ct Oi omission. The fourth element is some act or omission, by the
public officer, which constitutes a "malicious abuse" of his office. It is now
clear that there does not need to be a "positive act" or "misfeasance" to pro­
duce liability. An omission, by which the officer fails to perform a public
duty will be sufficient.97 An important question arises when a police officer
orders someone to do something when he has no power to do so. Is such an
order an "act" for the purposes of this tort? In an Australian case a police
officer ordered a hotel owner to close his hotel, knowing that he had no
power to do so. It was held that this was sufficient to found liability in mis­
feasance.98


Malice

   Malice has always caused the most difficulty in relation to this tort. It has
often been argued that whenever damage is caused by a public officer doing
something beyond his powers an action for damages should lie. This argu­
ment has been rejected in the large majority of cases.99 The position is dif­
ferent, however, if the act is knowingly invalid. There is now no doubt that
in such a case tortious liability will arise. In the Bourgoin case (in an analy­
sis accepted by all the judges in the Court of Appeal)1Mann J. put the point
like this:

       "There is no sensible distinction between the case where an officer per­
       forms an act which he has no power to perform with the object of injur­
       ing 'A' (which the defendant accepts is actionable at the instance of 'A')
       and the case where an officer performs an act which he knows he has no
       power to perform with the object of conferring a benefit on 'B' but
       which has the foreseeable and actual consequence of injury to 'A'."2
Thus, a "misfeasance" or "malicious abuse" is committed by the police in
one of two circumstances:
        (lj where a police officer does something for a "malicious motive"
            which causes damage to the plaintiff;
        (2) where damage is caused by a police officer "knowingly" doing
            something which he has no power to do.

(1) I m p r o p e r m o t i v e s . The first alternative requires "malice." As in mali­
cious prosecution cases "malice" does not simply mean "ill will" or spite.
As Lord Campbell C.J. said to the jury in T ozei v. Child (a direction upheld
by the Court of the Queen's Bench)
       "malice might be proved, not only by evidence of personal hostility or
       spite, but by any evidence of any other corrupt or improper motive."3
Any "wrongful motive" will, therefore, be sufficient "malice" for these pur­
poses. Thus, it will be a "malicious abuse of office" for a police officer to
request a person to wait for him at a police station in a deliberate attempt to
harm his business or to relieve him of the burden of conducting immediate
inquiries to enable him to go home early. The latter motive is a "wrongful"
one in law, even though no spite or hostility are involved.
  If the actions of a police officer are "malicious" in this extended sense
they do not have to be ultra vires his powers to attract liability.4 In other
words, there will be liability in damages for any loss caused by police acts or
omissions based on wrongful motives. Thus a police officer who lawfully
seizes goods which he has reasonable grounds for believing are evidence of
an offence which it is necessary7 to seize to prevent them being concealed
will be liable for misfeasance if his motive in seizing the goods is not the
collection of evidence but some wrongful motive such as causing damage to
the owner's business. Despite the lawfulness of his acts he will be liable
because of the maliciousness of his motive.
  The mere presence of a wrongful motive is not, in itself, sufficient to
found liability. Such a motive must be determinative of the act or omission
in question. The criminal case of R. v. Llewellyn-Jones ,3 provides useful
guidance here. The case involved a County Court Registrar who was
accused of making an order in relation to funds under his control "in the
expectation that he would gain personal advantage from the making of such
an order." The trial judge ruled that:
       "if the registrar of a county court when exercising his power to order
       payment out of court of money held on behalf of a beneficiary were to
       make an order in expectation of some personal benefit he hoped to

      obtain and in circumstances where, had it not been for the personal
      benefit, he would not have made the order, that would be an example of
      misconduct in a public duty . . . but I would not be prepared to say that
      it would be misconduct for this purpose for a registrar to make a
      decision which did affect his personal interests, merely because he
      knew that his interests were so involved, if the decision was made
      honestly and in a genuine belief that it was a proper exercise of his juris­
      diction."6

 (2) Knowing invalidity. The second alternative way that a police officer
can "abuse" his office is by doing something which he knows he has no
power to do. Thus the unlawfulness of his actions is a necessary precondi­
tion to liability. Under this second alternative motive is entirely irrelevant.
He may act out of the best of motives but, if he knows that he has no power
to act in that way then he will be liable in tort for damage caused.7It is clear
that "actual knowledge" of invalidity is necessary. "Constructive knowl­
edge" will not be enough.
   The most famous of all recent misfeasance cases was under this second
head. It concerned an order given by the prime minister and attorney-
general of Quebec to a liquor licensing authority. He ordered the cancel­
lation of the plaintiff's restaurant licence because the plaintiff had stood
bail for various Jehovah's Witnesses who were at that time responsible for
serious public order problems in Quebec. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court
of Canada found that the defendant had abused his office and awarded the
plaintiff damages of $33,123.8
   An important example is the case of Farrington v. Thomson &) Bridg-
la n d .9 The plaintiff was the licensee of a hotel which the police ordered him
to close down because they believed his licence to be forfeit. It was estab­
lished that the police, in giving such orders were "intentionally purporting
to exercise a power to give binding orders to the plaintiff which they were
fully aware, at the time, that they did not possess."10 It was held that this
was sufficient to found a misfeasance action. Smith J. also decided that the
fact that the plaintiff had obeyed the order was not sufficient to make the
resultant damage too remote.11


Applicability to police cases

   The tort of misfeasance in public office is, it is submitted, a well-estab­
lished cause of action which is plainly applicable to the police. In many
situations it will overlap with established torts. Thus if a police officer
arrests a plaintiff knowing that he has, in fact, no power to do so he will be
liable in false imprisonment as well as misfeasance. Given the fact that the
burden of justifying false imprisonment is on the police the former would
obviously be the simplest cause of action to pursue.

11 I b id . at 293-297.
   Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which misfeasance may be the
only available cause of action. Thus if a constable makes a lawful arrest
with a malicious motive an action in false imprisonment will not be avail­
able but there will be a cause of action in misfeasance. To take another
example, if the police give a person orders which they know they have no
power to give and the person obeys and as a result suffers loss then there
will be no action in trespass. There will, however, be an action in misfea­
sance as Farrington’s case illustrates.
  It would seem that if a police officer brings a prosecution against someone
with a malicious motive but with reasonable and probable cause then, if the
prosecution terminates in that person's favour, an action for misfeasance
will lie.
   If a person is caused damage by a police policy decision which is known to
be ultra vires then damages can be recovered in misfeasance. If a policeman
knowingly or maliciously neglects to carry out his duties then an action
may be brought. In R. v. D y t h a m ,12 the police constable was accused of
"wilfully omitting to take any steps to preserve the Queen's peace or to pro­
tect the person" of a man he saw being attacked. The man died and the con­
stable was convicted of the offence of wilful neglect of his duty. It is
submitted that the deceased's estate could have recovered damages in mis­
feasance.

BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY
3. BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY

Introduction

   The police have a large number of specific statutory duties under legis­
lation such as the Police Act 1964 and the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984. It has been held that the general duties of the police as constables
are now "statutory duties.''90
   In line with general tort principles it is possible that a breach of some of
these duties may give rise to an action in damages for "breach of statutory
duty." In particular, such an action may be the only possible remedy for a
lawfully arrested and detained suspect who is denied his rights under Part
IV of the 1984 Act.91

The right of action


   An action for breach of statutory duty will only lie if the statute is one
which in fact confers a right of action for damages. This is, fundamentally, a
question of policy: should the breach of a particular statutory provision be
compensated in damages? The court must consider whether or not the stat­
ute in question intended to give a right of action in tort.92 There are "indica­
tions which point with more or less force to the one answer or the other."93
   The first "indication" is whether there is, in the statute, an alternative
method of enforcing compliance or penalising non-compliance.94 The
absence of any other sanction creates a presumption that there is an action
for breach of the statute.95
   The second "indication” is whether or not the duty is imposed for the
benefit of a particular class of persons.96 If the duty was imposed to benefit a
particular class an action is more likely to lie.
   The third "indication" which may point to the absence of a right of action
is a lack of precision in the definition of the statutory right which it is
sought to enforce.97
   When a statute casts duties on a public authority such as the police, diffi­
cult questions arise as to which of the duties are "public law" ones and
which give rise to "private rights." A distinction has been drawn between
"decision-making" functions, which are a matter of public law, and "execu­
tive" functions which may give rise to private law rights and obligations.98
If the public authority makes an "unlawful" decision—because the proper
procedures were not followed, because an incorrect view of the law was
applied or for general W edn esbu ry reasons99 this must be challenged by the
"judicial review" procedure. No action for breach of statutory duty can
arise. Once the decision has been made, however, private law rights do arise
and may be enforced by an action for breach of statutory duty—provided
that, on a true construction of the statute, such an action is available. The
precise limits of this distinction remain to be worked out. The mere fact
that "public law" questions arise concurrently to a "private law" right of
action will not prevent a plaintiff from bringing an action for breach of
statutory duty.99a

The elements of the tort

   Even if it can be established that the statute is one which confers a right
of action, three other things must be established in order for a plaintiff to be
entitled to recover damages for breach of statutory duty:

(1) T h e d u t y m u s t b e o w e d to th e p l a i n t i f f ’} There is unlikely to be any
difficulty in cases brought by suspects for breaches of duty under the Police
and Criminal and Evidence Act 1984. This requirement may, however,
cause considerable problems if a plaintiff seeks to base an action upon
general duties cast upon the police by statutes such as the Police Act 1964.

(2) T h e d e f e n d a n t m u s t b e in b r e a c h o f th e s t a t u t o r y d u t y . This a
question of fact and, of course, depends on the precise wording of the rel­
evant statutory provisions. The burden of proof will be on the plaintiff.

(3) T h e h a i m m u s t b e o f t h e k i n d t h a t th e s t a t u t e w a s d e s i g n e d to
p r e v e n t . 2 Difficulties under this head are unlikely to arise in actions for
breach of statutory duty under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
as the statute is designed to prevent damage of all kinds to people w ho are
suspected of offences.
   Although an action for breach of statutory duty is an action on the case3 it
is not always necessary to prove damage as part of the cause of action.
Whether or not damage is a necessary ingredient of the cause of action has
been said to depend on the construction of the statute involved. Thus:
     "Where, from its context, it is clear that the statute created alright in
     the plaintiff so absolute in its content that the plaintiff was to be pro­
     tected against violation, even though it caused no damage, then the tort
     is actionable per se."4
The following rights have been held to give rise to a breach actionable per
se: the statutory right to vote,3 the right to receive a statement of how
wages were made up,6 a person's right to have his suitability for a living as a
minister of religion determined.7 A person's rights under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 should be actionable per se as the interests
protected by the statute—interests in receiving information and assistance
while under police investigation—do not usually generate "special damage"
if they are violated. As Street says:
     "The courts are most likely to interpret in this manner a statute which
     protects an interest of the plaintiff other than his interest in his person
     or his goods."8

Applicability to police cases

   The availability of this cause of action to police cases depends on the par­
ticular statutory provision which is being relied upon. The Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 gives rise to a number of rights to information
and assistance. No remedies for breach of these provisions is provided by
the statute. It should be noted that by section 67(10) it is expressly provided
that a failure to comply with any provisions of the Codes of Practice issued
under section 66 "shall not of itself render him liable to any . . . civil pro­
ceedings." The only liability that this section can be seeking to exclude is
that for breach of statutory duty. It is significant that the statute does not
seek to exclude liability for breach of the provisions of the Act itself, as
opposed to the Codes. So, an action for breach of statutory duty m ust then
lie if the police fail to comply with the “information and assistance" pro­
visions of the 1984 Act. The following sections would appear to give rise to
potential actions:

(1) S e c tio n 56: R i g h t to h a v e s o m e o n e i n f o r m e d w h e n a r r e s t e d . This
section provides that:
     "Where a person has been arrested and is being held in custody in a
     police station or other premises, he shall be entitled, if he so requests,
     to have one friend or relative or other person who is known to him or
     who is likely to take an interest in his welfare told, as soon as is practi­
     cable except to the extent that delay is permitted by this section, that
     he has been arrested and is being detained there."9
The section permits delay only in the case of serious arrestable offences10 if
it is authorised by an officer of at least the rank of superintendent.11 Delay
may only be authorised where there are reasonable grounds for believing
that12 telling the named person of the arrest:
     "(a) w ill lead to interference with or harm to evidence connected with a
     serious arrestable offence or interference with or physical injury to
     other persons,- or
     (b) w ill lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having com­
     mitted such an offence but not yet arrested for it, or
     (c) w ill hinder the recovery of any property obtained as a result of such
     an offence."13
If a delay is authorised the detained person must be told the reason for it and
the reason should be noted on his custody record as soon as is practicable.14
Once the reason for authorising delay ceases to exist there may be no
further delay in permitting the exercise of the right.15 Similar consider­
ations apply to the duty to inform the "person responsible for the welfare”
of a child or a young person that he is in police detention under section 57.

(2) S e c tio n 58: A c c e s s to l e g a l a d v i c e . This section provides that:
        "(1) A person arrested and held in custody in a police station or other
        premises shall be entitled, if he so requests, to consult a solicitor
        privately at any time . . .
        (4) If a person makes such a request, he must be permitted to consult a
        solicitor as soon as is practicable except to the extent that delay is per­
        mitted by this section."
The section permits delay only where the person is in detention for a
serious arrestable offence and the delay is authorised by an officer of at least
the rank of superintendent.16 Such delay may only be authorised where the
officer has reasonable grounds for believing17 that the exercise of the right at
the time the person desires to exercise it:
        "(a) w i l l le a d t o i n t e r f e r e n c e w i t h or h a r m t o e v i d e n c e c o n n e c t e d w i t h a
        s e r i o u s a r r e s t a b le o f f e n c e o r in t e r f e r e n c e w i t h or p h y s i c a l in ju r y t o
       o t h e r persons,- o r
       jb) will lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having com ­
       mitted such an offence but not yet arrested for it; or
       (c) will hinder the recovery of any property obtained as a result of such
       an offence."
If a delay is authorised the detained person must be told the reason for it and
the reason must be noted on his custody record.18 Special provisions apply
to persons detained under the terrorism provisions.19 It is difficult to see
how, in the large majority of cases, a private consultation w ith a solicitor
could lead to the results which would justify the delay.

(3) S e c tio n 21: R i g h t s to a c c e s s a n d c o p ie s . The section gives the per­
son who had custody or control of something seized by the police the right
to apply for access to it20 or the right to obtain photographs or copies.21 This
right is subject to a number of statutory limitations 22
   The "indications" point towards there being a right of action against the
police for breach of the provisions of all these sections. The only remedy
provided by the Act for breach is disciplinary action against the officers
involved. This does not give any right to damages to the person deprived of
his statutory entitlement. The sections are designed to protect specific
classes of people, namely, those in police custody or whose property has
been seized. Finally, the duties under all the sections are defined with preci­
sion. It is further submitted that breaches of sections 56, 57 or 58 will be
actionable per se.23
   It would follow that a detained person who was denied his rights under
section 56 or section 58 w ill have rights of action against the police for
breach of statutory duty. His damages for this breach would be "at large"24

and he would also have a potential claim for aggravated and exemplary
damages. Furthermore, any "reasonably foreseeable" special damages could
also be recovered. A person who was denied access to property held by the
police or copies of documents would also have a right of action for breach of
statutory duty under section 31.
  In an unreported case23 two firms of solicitors applied for injunctions to
restrain the police from breaching their statutory duty in refusing to allow
them access to clients held'in police custody. Rose J. refused the application
saying:
    "I am not persuaded that I have jurisdiction. Assuming I did have juris­
    diction were I to make the Order sought it would be unreasonable, a
    hindrance to police inquiries may be caused."
It is submitted that there was, in fact, no jurisdiction to make the order as
the proper plaintiffs were not the solicitors but the prisoners who, in the
nature of the case, could not give instructions to make the application. The
prisoner would, however, have an action for damages after his release. It is
further submitted that in such a situation the solicitors would have locu s to
apply for an order of mandamus to compel the police to discharge their
statutory duties under section 58.26

                                          §16.1.             KILLING IN HOMICIDE

The  common law definition of murder, and similarly that of manslaughter,
requires that the defendant should have “killed" his victim, and that the
death should follow within a year and a day (§ 11.1).
   A “killing" can take place by any means. There need be no direct
physical act. If the victim asks his way on a dark night, and the defendant,
intending to cause his death, directs him to a path that he knows will bring
him to the cliff edge, and the victim suffers a fatal fall, this is clearly
murder, though the defendant has done nothing more than utter words. So
we may say that “killing” means conduct causing death in any way that the
law regards as sufficient.1What these ways are has to be considered.

W hat o f accelerating the victim ’s death?
  This is a “killing'' in law. Since w’e are all fated to die at some time, every
instance of killing is an instance of accelerating death: and even if death is
hastened by as little as five minutes it is still a criminal homicide. So it is
no defence to a person who stabs another to death to show that the victim
was already dangerously ill.2 All the same, as we shall see. there are some
cases where the courts will ignore minimal causation (§ .5).

W hy require that the death must follow within a year and a day?
   In origin the rule was perhaps dictated by the desire to limit difficult
problems of causation.3 The CLRC proposed the continuation of the rule
on the ground that it would be w'rong for a person to remain at risk of a
charge of homicide for a long time.4 He may have been convicted and
sentenced for causing serious injury: if the victim then dies from the injury,
it would be undesirable to have a fresh trial for murder.

Do problems of causation arise only in homicide cases?
  These are the most important in practice, but a causal question is
capable of arising in other offences, particularly those against the person

or property. For example, the offence under section 18 of the Offences
aeainst the Person Act is of causing grievous bodily harm. The wording of
sections 20 and 47 is different: the one speaks of inflicting grievous bodily
harm and the other of occasioning actual bodily harm, but these verbs,
also, imply a requirement of causation.
   Similarly, the offences under the Criminal Damage Act 1971 imply that
the act of the defendant has caused the damage.
   The notion of causation may also appear in general penal legislation,
where the context may give the word a special meaning. "Causing"
something to be done sometimes bears the narrow meaning of giving an
order or direction to do it.3


                                         § 16.2.             BUT-FOR CAUSATION
An important distinction must be taken. The question of causation, as it is
generally used in the law. involves both a problem of causation sine qua
non. and a problem of imputability.1
  A convenient English equivalent of the term causation sine qua non is
but-for causation (properly speaking, but-for . . . not causation). For a
factor to be a but-for cause, one must be able to say that but for the
occurrence of the antecedent factor the event would not have happened.
Surely the notion o f but-for causation is ridiculously wide, because it takes
us back to Adam and Eve. The crim inal’s mother is a but-for cause of his
crim es, and so is his grandmother, and all his ancestors to infinity.
   That is perfectly true, but two factors limit the judicial enquiry. First,
one starts with the defendant who is charged: his mother does not come
into it, much less Adam and Eve. Secondly, bu’-for causation is only half
the story; the defendant who was the but-for cause of the harm is not
responsible unless his conduct was also the im putable cause. We still have
to deal with imputable causation.
Is the notion o f but-for cause a useful one? Where the cause is a positive act,
isn ’t it too obvious to be worth stating? If D shoots V and V drops down
dead, surely you don’t have to prove that the bullet entering V ’s heart
caused him to die?
  When but-for causation is obvious (as it usually is), it is not discussed.
Certainly the answer to your last question is in the negative. But
occasionally an issue of this kind may require expert assistance.
       D may administer poison to V, who may die shortly afterwards, yet an
       autopsy may reveal that V died not of the poison but of heart disease.
       There will then be medical evidence at D ’s trial to the effect that the
       poison did not cause the death, meaning that V would in any case have
       died at the time and in the way he did, and that the poison did not play
       any contributory part. If the jury believe this evidence, or, rather, if

           they are not sure that it is untrue, they must acquit of murder—though
           D may. of course, be convicted of the attempt.
   We may summarise, then, by saying that but-for causation is of legal
interest only in the comparatively rare cases where, notwithstanding
appearances, it is absent; that when it is alleged to be absent, this raises a
question of fact for the jury, who may decide by ordinary experience but
may have to be assisted by expert evidence; and that the burden is on the
Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant’s act (or
omission) was a but-for cause.2
    T h e last point occasions some difficulty in respect of expert evidence, because an expert
may not be willing to commit himself to more than the statem ent that the result would
" p ro b a b ly " not have happened as it did apart from the defendant's act or omission.
N otwithstanding that the expert will not commit him self to more, the jury (somewhat
strangely) are entitled to draw a sure inference of causation from the evidence.3 Nevertheless,
they should be reminded that they themselves must be sure: and the hesitation or reserve of
the expert should surely be a factor leading the appeal court to scrutinise a conviction with
care.

The courts assume in manslaughter cases like Stone (§ 12.3) that an
omission can be a cause. But surely a non-event cannot be a but-for cause
o f an event.
  Whatever the philosophical view may be, the courts certainly assume,
and must assume, that an omission can be a cause (just as lack of oxygen
or food is commonly regarded as a cause of death).4 (However, a court
can, and should, say that a reference to causation in a statute does not
cover omissions, in the absence of express words or necessary implication:
§ 7.3 n. 10). That is not a rule of causation but a question of the legal
import of words.
  The application of the usual burden of proof to the issue of causation is
of considerable importance in cases of omission, and sometimes gives the
court the opportunity of arriving at a merciful conclusion.5 On any charge
involving causation by omission it behoves the defence to go into the
evidence of causation most carefully.

W hat about two but-for causes contributed by different defendants? D oesn’t
your definition imply the paradox that if two persons independently cause
an event, neither causes it?

  To provide for this, an exception for cases of multiple causation has to
be inserted into the definition. It is possible for two sufficient causes, Cl
and C2, to be present together, so that E follows both, when usually it

follows only one or the other. Both Cl and C2 are causes, even though in
the particular situation one or other (as the case may be) was not necessary
to be present. An example is where two fatal wounds are given
independently at the same time. See more in § .9.

Suppose that D l’s shot entered the lung and would have caused the victim’s
death in an hour, but D2’s entered the heart and killed him instantaneously?
   Then, of course, only D2 has killed him. D1 is guilty of an attempt.
   The but-for cause is sometimes referred to as the factual cause, or the de
facto cause, or the scientific cause. The important thing is to distinguish it
from cause in another sense, the “imputable” (or “legal” or “effective” or
"direct” or “proximate”) cause, to which we now turn.




                       § 16.3.     IMPUTABLE CAUSATION

When causation is in issue, the defendant's act (or omission) must be
shown to be not only a but-for cause but also an imputable or legal cause
of the consequence. Imputable causes are some of the but-for causes. In
other words, the defendant’s act, being a but-for cause, must be sufficiently
closely connected with the consequence to involve him in responsibility.
The lawyer is interested in the causal parentage of events, not in their
causal ancestry. The Model Penal Code expresses the principle by stating
that a person is not criminally responsible for a result if it is “too remote
and accidental in its occurrence to have a just bearing on the actor's
liability or on the gravity of his offence.”1
   Several attempts have been made to find a suitable name for this second notion o f cause.
To call it the "direct” or "proxim ate" cause (as is often done) is misleading, because several
Mages may intervene betw een the so-called direct cause and the effect. D may send poisoned
chocolates to V, who lives at the other side of the world; if V eats the chocolates an d dies,
she law will certainly regard D as responsible for the death, though his act was far rem oved
in space and considerably removed in time from its effect. To call D 's act the "effective” cause
is unhelpful, because every cause must by definition be effective— if an act is not effective to
produce a given result, it is not a cause of it.
  Sometimes (looking at the situation backwards instead of forwards) im putable causation is
Mated in terms of "rem oteness of consequence."' To say that a particular consequence is "too
remote" is only another way of saying that the defendant's act (or omission) is not an
!mputable cause.
   Going back to the formulation in the Model Penal Code, the use of the word “just"
mdicates the true nature of the problem. W hen one has settled the question o f but-for
causation, the further test to be applied to the but-for cause in order to qualify it for legal
recognition is not a test of causation but a moral reaction. T h e question is w hether th e result
^an fairly be said to be imputable to the defendant. Sometimes the question of fairness is
'•cttled by rules of law. sometimes it is left for impressionistic decision in the individual case.
    ’he term "cause” must be used, it can best be distinguished in this m eaning as the
  ■mputable" or "responsible" or "b lam a b le " cause, to indicate the value-judgment involved.
 T he word “im p u tab le" is here chosen as best representing the idea. W hereas the but-for cause
 can generally be dem onstrated s c i e n t if i c a lly n o experiment can be devised to show that one
 of a number o f concurring but-for causes is more substantial or im portant that a n o th e r, or that
 one person who is involved in the causal chain is more blameworthy than a n o th e r.3


 What are the principles governing imputable causation?
    Hitherto the judges have made little progress in establishing such
 principles. Generally, of course, no problem arises. Where causation is
 obvious, the judge may give no direction upon it, even in a homicide case,
 and even though the burden of proof o f causation is supposed to rest on
 the prosecution. “In homicide cases.” said Robert Goff LJ, “ it is rarely
 necessary to give the jury any direction on causation as such.”4 Even when
 a direction is given, it is usually in very general terms, without so much as
 distinguishing between factual and legal causation. The judge will use one
 of the adjectives already mentioned, telling the jury that the defendant’s
 act must have been the “efficient” or “direct” or “proximate” or
 “substantial” cause of the result, or something beyond a trivial cause, or
that the result must not have been too “ remote” Or he may tell them that
in law the defendant’s act need not be the sole cause, or even the main
cause, of the result, it being enough that the act contributed “ significantly”
to that result.5 This is good enough if the defendant's act was clearly an
imputable cause, and it may be good enough in cases where no precise rule
can be formulated. It is unsatisfactory in some of the cases to be discussed
in this chapter, where the proper result may seem doubtful to the layman
and a vague direction may produce discordant verdicts w’hich could have
been avoided if more specific guidance had been given.
   The direction to the jury should distinguish, where necessary, between
the two kinds of causation, and the jury should be informed with some
precision of any rules o f law that are involved. If the issue is one of but-for
causation, it should be enough to ask the jury whether the defendant’s act
(or omission) was a cause of what happened, explaining that this means:
would the event have happened in any case? There is no need to talk about
“substantiality.”6 But if the issue is whether the alleged cause w-as an
imputable cause, and if the proper view is that for some specific reason the
alleged cause was not or may not have been an imputable cause in law, it
should be a misdirection to instruct the jury no more fully than this.7

  Similarly, if the proper legal view is that the defendant's act was a cause
  in law. the judge should be entitled to tell the jury so.
    This was the practice during the 19th century. Courts would robustly tell
  the jury whether or not the defendant was responsible for the conse­
  quences on given facts. There are now indications that the judges will again
  do this, if the facts are sufficiently strong.
           In Pagetft the defendant was a gunman who shot at armed police,
           using a girl as a shield. The police returned his fire in self-defence, and
           accidentally killed the girl. Pagett, charged with the murder of the girl,
           was acquitted by the jury of murder but convicted of manslaughter,9
           and his appeal against conviction was dismissed.

    The case will be discussed later as an application of the principles of
 causation. At present we are concerned with it only as an instance of the
 judge's function. On the question of causation the trial judge had directed
 the jury that it was for him to decide as a matter of law whether the
 defendant caused the death. On this the Court of Appeal commented: “No
 legitimate criticism can be made of the judge's direction. Strictly speaking
 it was for him to direct the jury on the applicable principles of law, leaving
 it for them to decide as a question of fact, on those applicable principles,
 whether the necessary causal link had been established. In practical terms
 that was precisely what the judge did."
    The first of these sentences seems to deny criticism of the judge, while
 the second sentence seems to express some faint criticism. Perhaps the
 court means that it is best for the judge not to say frankly that the causation
 question is for him, but that all the same he may instruct the jury in such
 terms that where the facts are clear they have no causation issue to decide.
 There is no virtue in such hair-splitting.
    The theoretical problem may be clarified if we distinguish between cases
 where there is and is not a relevant rule of law on the subject of imputable
causation. If no satisfactory rule can be formulated, and it is a matter of
  ‘gut reaction,” the proper verdict on the point being subject to legitimate
doubt, the jury can be told that they must decide whether in fairness the
result should be attributed to the defendant. (The direction is
unnnecessary if it obviously is imputable to him.) If a rule can be
formulated, which ought to govern all similar situations (which w'as the
case in Pagett). the judge should be entitled to announce it firmly to the
jury, and where necessary to exclude irrelevant evidence.
    The last proposition is supported by another recent case. M a lc h e r e k } 0

          irretrievably damaged, she was taken off. On a charge of murder the
          trial judge refused to leave the issue of causation to the jury, and D
          was convicted. On appeal the defence sought to introduce evidence to
          suggest that the doctor had switched the machine off prematurely, but
          the court refused to hear the evidence. In such circumstances, the
          court declared, where a doctor decides “that the patient is for practical
          purposes dead,-’ and switches off. this does not in law prevent the
          assailant from being responsible.

   Granted, then, that rules of imputable causation are rules of law, we
must consider what these rules are. Subject to what is to be said in § .9 as
to the new intervening act, no problem generally arises when the defendant
has intentionally produced the consequence.11 The chief difficulties relate
to unintended consequences. It may be suggested that five rules are
supported either by authority or by common sense:

—       the rule that negligence must be relevant (§ .4);
—       the minimal causation principle (§ .5);
—       the ordinary hazard principle (§ .7);
—       the reasonable foresigh.t principle (§ .8); and
—       the principle of the new intervening act (§ .9).



                             § 16.4.            CAUSATION AND NEGLIGENCE

Where negligence (or recklessness) is in issue, a limiting rule straddles the
divide between but-for and imputable causation. The rule is that the
negligence proved against the defendant must be negligence in a relevant
respect. The case must be such that the accident would not have happened
if he had not been negligent. In other words, the defendant is not liable for
an event that is not causally connected with the feature of his conduct that
was negligent. The rule has some applicaton to manslaughter and causing
death by reckless driving.
         An illustration in the reports is D a llo w a y } The driver of a horse and
         cart let the reins lie loose on the horse's back. This was of course a
         negligent way of driving. A child ran across the road, and was knocked
         down and killed. Erie J directed the jury that if the driver by using the
         reins could have saved the child he was guilty of manslaughter but
         that if they thought he could not have saved the child by pulling the
         reins they must acquit him.
            In other words, the question was this. Assuming that the defendant
         had been driving carefully, holding the reins, would the death have
         occurred? A defendant is not guilty of causing a death by negligence
         if the victim ran out at a moment when no one—not even a person
         who had been behaving carefully throughout— could have pulled up.

                   § 16.5.             THE DEFENCE OF M IN IM A L CAUSATION
Of the assorted adjectives mentioned in § .3, “substantial" currently finds
the greatest favour; and if this word is used in instructing the jury a
conviction is pretty safe from being upset on appeal. However, the Court
of Appeal regards it as being too favourable to the defendant.1 The
preferred direction is to tell the jury that they can convict the defendant if
his conduct (for example, his reckless driving) was “a cause" of the death,
being something more than a purely trivial cause (a de m inim is
contribution, as it is ungrammatically termed). The reference to “a cause"
is presumably to but-for causation, while the reference to minimal
contribution seems to express the idea that imputable causation is lacking.
This direction at least gives the jury some pointer to the fact that they are
entitled to use common sense (or moral instinct) on questions of causation.
   It may have been a notion of minimal causation that was in the mind of
Devlin J in A d a m s .2 As we have seen (§ .1), the acceleration of death is
supposed to be enough for criminal liability, so that the defendant is not
normally allowed to say that the victim would in any event have died
before long. But in A d a m s Devlin J directed the jury that when health
cannot be restored a doctor “is still entitled to do all that is proper and
necessary to relieve pain and suffering even if measures he takes may
incidentally shorten life." The passage as a whole seems to imply the view
that what the doctor does by way of approved medical practice is not a
cause in law. It plays such a minor part in causing the death that it can be
excluded from consideration. A more satisfactory reason would be the
doctrine of necessity, at which Devlin J perhaps glanced in his use of the
word “necessary. But we may applaud his attitude without enquiring too
closely into its legal basis.



                                      § 16.6.            THE UNEXPECTED TWIST
Most problems of causation relate to what may be called the unexpected
twist, which is to occupy the rest of this chapter. Subject to what is to be
said later, an unexpected twist in the ‘outcome of conduct does not

 necessarily put the end result outside the mental element, or mean that the
 conduct is not the imputable cause of the result.
           For example, D attacks V intending to stab him in the arm. but V
           jumps back, falls and cracks his head. Assuming that both the harm
           intended and tfrat suffered are grievous bodily harm, there is no
           difficulty from the point of view either of m en s rea or of causation in
           convicting D of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, under
           section 18 of the OAPA. The legal category is “grievous bodily
           harm.” and it does not matter that the defendant intended one form
           and did another.1
   Such facts are very similar to transferred intention, except that here the
intention takes effect upon the person intended, and the only variation is
in respect of the way in which it takes effect or in respect of the precise
description of the injury. The unexpected twist principle does not supplant
the primary requirement of a mental element for the particular crime. In
a crime of intention, the ultimate result must be as intended by the
defendant2; but the mode by which the intended result occurred need not
have been intended/
   W here, as in the case of criminal dam age, the offence is defined in broad term s so that it
covers a great variety o f causal nexus, the unexpected twist principle can have unwelcome
results, particularly in m aking the defendant subject to conviction for doing much greater
dam age than he expected. T h e solution here would be to sentence on the basis of what was
within the range of what the d efendant must have foreseen.
   A problem of justice can also arise where the defendant is still at an early stage in his effort
to commit the crime when events are. so to speak, taken out o f his hands. Professor Smith
suggests that the d efendant can be liable for the result if he had reached the stage of attempt,
but otherwise not.4 He p uts two hvpotheticals.

         D prepares a poisoned apple with the intention o f giving it to his wife. V. to eat
         tom orrow. V finds the poisoned apple today, eats it and dies. O r D is cleaning his gun
         with the intention o f shooting V tom orrow . The gun goes off accidentally and kills V.

   It would obviously be too harsh to convict D o f m urder in the second case: his liability is
for manslaughter. As to the first case, the answer may d epend on the more detailed facts. If
D put the poison by his wife's bedside, intending to administer it to her when she woke up,
the jury should be allowed to find that he has launched himself sufficiently far on his ghastly
plan to be guilty of an attem pt, and therefore (according to S m ith’s suggestion) to be guilty
of m u rd er if the wife unexpectedly wakes up and drinks the poison herself. If on the other
hand the.poisoned drink is still in the kitchen, the result should probably be different. The
question of attem pt is further considered in § 17.5.
   W hatever the theory may be. the law is not always applied with full rigour. O n a charge
of m urder the trial judge may permit or encourage the jury to return a verdict of
manslaughter. O r he may accept a plea to manslaughter, even when in strict law it is murder.
T h e unexpected twist principle would probably meet with general acceptance in obvious
cases. But the criminal law should, so far as possibie, avoid saddling people with liability for
results markedly different from what was intended o r foreseen. So it is im portant not merely
that the law should be applied with discretion but that we should find rules that satisfactorily

                       § 16.7.            THE ORDINARY HAZARD PRINCIPLE

This is a narrow principle and has not come before the English courts, but
it seems obvious.
         D attacks V intending to stab him to death; V runs away, and in his
         fight is struck by lightning and dies. One would say that D is not guilty
         of murder, though he is guilty of attempted murder. Why is he not
         guilty of murder? Because it was not he that killed V, but the
         lightning? But if V had jumped over a cliff or into a river in an effort
         to escape, or to commit suicide in despair, or had accidentally fallen
         over the cliff or into the river in his flight, D would have been
         accountable for the death, and we should not have said that it was not
         D who killed V but the water or the hard ground. What is it that
         makes us feel that the lightning is different?

   The most obvious answer is that being struck by lightning is an ordinary
risk of life that people do not seek to avoid. One is no more subject to
being struck by lightning when one is running away from an attacker than
when one is taking a walk. The attacker has not substantially increased the
victim’s risk.
   A n o th e r example of th e ordinary hazard principle is w here the victim of an attack dies in
a traffic accident w hen he is being conveyed by am bulance to hospital, or dies as a result of
a fever which sweeps through the hospital. Assuming that his death was not contributed to
by his weak condition, the attacker is not guilty of it, because the effect of the attack was
merely to place the victim in a geographical position w here a n o th er agency produced his
death. T h e attack did not substantially increase the risk of the fatal result, because anyone
may die in a traffic accident or epidem ic.1 O f course, a reasonable man mulling over all the
possible consequences of an attack might think of these possibilities; but they would not be
possibilities rendered any more likely by the fact of the attack. E ven if it could be shown that
there was slightly m o re risk of dying of fever in hospital than elsewhere (perhaps because of
the presence in hospital of resistant bacteria), this would probably be accounted too
insignifcant to affect the decision.
   Contrast the case w here the victim died of hospital fever, but a contributory factor was the
weakness caused by his injuries, so that he would not have died if it h ad not been for his
weakness. Probably the attacker would then be guilty o f criminal homicide (m urder or
manslaughter), for on these facts there is a medical (and not merely a fortuitous) connection
between the w ound and the death. It is like the case of a wound turning gangrenous and
causing death, w here the wounding is clearly the cause of death.

  In the absence of English authority, the ordinary hazard principle is a
matter of theoretical speculation. In most but not all applications it can be
regarded as a particular application of a test of reasonable foresight, on
which decided cases can be found.

                   § 16.8.              THE REASONABLE FORESIGHT PRINCIPLE

To say that a consequence, to be imputed to the defendant, must be within
the risk that would be apprehended by a reasonable man is much wider
than the ordinary hazard principle. Under the name of the "risk principle”
it has been discussed by writers on the tort of negligence, and it also makes
an appearance in the criminal case of R o b e r ts }
            Roberts was driving a girl from a party, and. according to the view of
            the facts that (in the opinion of the Court of Appeal) the jury must
            have taken, he pestered her with advances, held her coat and told her
            that he had beaten up girls who had refused him. She jumped out of
            the moving car and suffered injury. The chairman of Sessions directed
            the jury that on these facts Roberts would be guilty of an assault
            occasioning actual bodily harm under OAPA s.47. He was convicted,
            and the conviction was affirmed on appeal. The court said: “The test
            is: Was it [the injury] the natural result of what the alleged assailant
            said and did, in the sense that it was something that could reasonably
            have been foreseen as the consequence of what he was saving or
            doing?”2

   In previous cases of similar tvpeJ the test laid down had generally been
whether the victim acted reasonably in his endeavour to escape. Roberts
widens the area of liability and also puts it on a more intelligible footing.
Whether it is prudent for a woman to jump from a rapidly moving car to
avoid rape is a question on which opinions may differ, but at any rate it is
fully understandable, and the possibility of it could well have been foreseen
by the attacker.
   T h e reasonable foresight principle gives the jury the opportunity of exempting the
defendant where what happened is particularly unusual and it would be unfair to hold him
liable. But the intentional w rongdoer will rarely be advantaged by it. A lthough he has a
theoretical opportunity of escaping a consequence brought about by the victim's
unforeseeable reaction, a jury would probably b e loth to describe an act done to escape as
not reasonably foreseeable. A nyone who makes a serious or distressing attack o n another
should realise that the victim may try to escape, and in panic may try to escape in a very
dangerous way. H ow ever the question of causation is in the last resort decided by the jury,
and the jury m ay take a merciful view.4

         The facts of a New York case5 would seem to illustrate conduct that is not reasonably
         foreseeable, but the court did not take this view. D gave a lift in his car to an 18-vear-old
         girl: and during the journey offered the girl $1 to have sexual intercourse. T h e girl in
         panic jum ped from the car. when it was moving at about 25 m .p .h .. fractured her skull
         and died. D was convicted of manslaughter, though he had neither made an attack on
         the girl nor threatened her, the court holding that her effort to escape was a "natural
         consequence” of D 's act. O ne may gravely d o u b t w hether it was reasonably foreseeable.

  An event m a y be re a s o n a b ly fo reseea b le as p a r t o f a g e n e ric risk , e v e n t h o u g h it is

      " A harlo t w o m a n w as delivered o f a child. She laid it aw ay, alive, in an o r c h a r d ; an d

m ajo r risk o r as so m e su bsid iary risk; and it is immaterial that a subsidiary risk was so unlikely
in itself that if it had stood alone the conduct would not have been negligent.1

Doesn’t the risk principle, as applied to crimes requiring intention,
contradict that requirement?
  The objection overlooks the fact that rules of causation cannot make the
defendant guilty of a crime of intention unless he intended the event
specified in the law (such as the death of a human being). All that the rules
do is to settle the question of liability where the event occurs in an
unexpected way. The foreseeability rule is a lim itation upon the general
principle relating to the unexpected twist.

How does the rule in manslaughter excluding the victim’s special sensitivity
from consideration square with the risk principle?
  The special sensitivity rule is an exception from the risk principle, but it
can be justified on special grounds.

Does the risk principle apply to the doctrine of transferred intention?
  Apparently not. No case decides that it does, and one suggests that it
does not.8 It may be thought that in G ore (§ 11.5 n. 1) the defendant could
not reasonably have foreseen that the apothecary would be poisoned, yet
her intention was transferred.



                               § 16.9.         NEW INTERVENING ACT
An extreme view of criminal responsibility might be that a man is under
a duty to act in such a way that others are not led to cause harm, so that
in some circumstances he would be responsible for harm that is
directly caused by others, even though without his authorisation or
encouragement. This does not represent the criminal law. The legal
attitude is that a man is primarily responsible only for what he himself does
or incites. The fact that his own wrongful conduct provided the background
for some consequential wrong act by another, and that he should have
foreseen this act. does not make him responsible for it.

   The n o vu s actus principle is so potent that it can even rescue a defendant
from strict liability.
           In Im press (W orcester) L td. v. R ees 9 the appellant company's fuel
           store leaked oil into the Severn, after an unknown person had
           tampered with the valve. Normally (it was assumed) the leak would
           have been an offence of strict liability,10 but the Divisional Court held
           that the company was not liable, because the intervening act of the
           stranger was an "intervening cause of so powerful a nature that the
           conduct of the appellants was not a cause at all but was merely part
           of the surrounding circumstances.”
   The pollution of the river was, of course, factually caused in part by the
circumstance that the company had accumulated fuel near the river. But
this was merely the background of the matter; in law, the only operative
cause was the act of the mischief-maker. The distinction is between
something operating directly to produce the result and something
operating only indirectly through the wrongful intervener.
   The n o vu s actus principle was expressly recognised, for the law of

                    § 16.10.              THE NON-RESPONSIBLE INTERVENER

We have seen, in discussing the subject of complicity, that if D incites an
innocent agent to commit a criminal act, and the innocent agent does so,
D is regarded as perpetrating the crime. Put in terms of causation, the rule
is that if D has done the last act that he intended to do (instructing the
innocent agent), he causes the result notwithstanding that the immediate
cause was the act of another (the innocent agent), if there was no
subsequent criminal volition of another. This principle is wider than the
simple doctrine of innocent agency, as M ichael 1shows.
         Michael, a single woman, had an illegitimate baby boy a few months
         old whom she boarded out with a foster-mother. Intending to murder
         the infant she bought a bottle of laudanum, told the foster-mother that
         it was medicine, and directed her to give the infant a teaspoonful every
         night. The woman gave none, but put the bottle on the mantelpiece.

         where a few days later her own small boy, aged about 5. being left
         alone with the infant, took the bottle down and administered half its
         contents to the infant, who died. Michael was convicted of murder,
         and the conviction was affirmed by the Court for Crown Cases
         Reserved.
   No clear reason was given by the court for holding Michael responsible,
but we may rationalise as follows. Michael intended to poison her baby
with laudanum administered by the hand of another, and this very thing
happened. The fact that she intended the killing process to be spun out w'as
immaterial. (The trial judge in directing the jury assumed that it w'as
necessary for the prosecution to show that a single teaspoonful of the
liquid—the dose directed by Michael— was enough to kill the baby; but
nowadays this would be regarded as too lenient a direction. Even if the
dose of a teaspoonful each night would have killed only by reason of having
a cumulative effect, the variation whereby half the bottle was administered
at once would have been immaterial.)
   The more striking deviation from Michael’s plan was the intervention of
a different, and unforeseen, 'actor. The small bov  * was innocent, being  O
under the age of criminal responsibility, and Michael was responsible for
the result that he helped to bring about, even though he was not Michael’s
intended tool. Michael had done the last act that she intended to do. and
there was no affront to the sense of justice in saying that the variation in
the chain of causation was immaterial.

T h is ty pe o f p r o b l e m w as dis cussed in §.6.

   Two decisions mentioned previously provide further examples of the
non-responsible intervener: M alcherek “ and P agett .3 The judgment in the
latter case proceeds on the basis that the police were acting in self-defence,
but the more obvious justification was that they were entitled to kill if
necessary in the course of trying to make an arrest or to prevent violent
crime or the escape of a violent offender. On any view the police were
acting under the pressure caused by the defendant, and so were not
exercising the unfettered volition presupposed by the n ovu s actus rule.
               § 16.12.             CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF VICTIM

The principle is that the victim's contributory negligence is no answer to a
charge of crime.1 In other words, it is generally no defence that the victim
laid himself open to the act, or was himself guilty of negligence bringing it
about.
   This rule can have strange results. Suppose there are two burglars
engaged together in blowing a safe in a grossly negligent way. If one is
killed the other is presumably guilty of manslaughter, even though the
victim participated throughout in the act of negligence. It can be argued
that there should be a defence of negligent joint enterprise, but the courts
have not hitherto recognised it.

   This is unlawful killing w ithout intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm: R.
v. Taylor (1834) 2 Lew. 215 and see Stephen Dig.Cr.L. 9th ed. p. 221. Apart from
the intent required the elem ents o f the offence are the sam e as in murder (see
§§ 2 0 - 3 — 20 -1 3 , and §§ 2 0-15 — 20 -2 7, ante). T h e rules as to causation,3 time
limit o f a year and a day, se lf defence etc., therefore apply though it must be
remembered that provocation and dim inished responsibility only apply to murder
and so as to reduce that crime to manslaughter.

   T h e difficulty is to identify the elements which m ay make the killing unlawful:
see Andrews v. D .P .P . (1937) 26 Cr.A pp.R . 34 per Lord Atkin. T he law has gone
through a process o f developm ent. It was formerly held that there w as a doctrine
o f constructive manslaughter whereby death resulting from any unlawful act,
whether intrinsically likely to injure or not, was manslaughter, but this has long
ceased to be the law.
   T h e authorities on involuntary m anslaughter are difficult to reconcile, but the
following propositions appear to be established:
    (1) T he killing is m anslaughter if it is either
    (a) T he result o f a grossly negligent (though it m ay be otherwise lawful) act or
         omission on the part o f the accused (see § 2 0 -4 9 , post); or
    (b ) T he result o f his unlawful act (though not his unlawful om ission), where
         the unlawful act is one, such as an assault, w hich all sober and reasonable
         people would inevitably realise m ust subject the victim to the risk o f some
         harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm, whether the accused
         realised this or not: Andrews v. D .P . P . , ante; R . v. Larkin (1944) 29

         (Injecting another person with heroin which the defendant had unlawfully
         taken into his possession for that purpose, is an unlawful act and if death
         results the offence is m anslaughter notw ithstanding that the victim con­
         sented and the heroin is only one o f the causes o f death, i.e. a cause o f death
         outside the de minimis range— drug addicts had prepared a strong solution
         o fh e r o in and injected each other with it: R. v. Cato [1976] 1 All E.R. 260,
         C .A .), c.f. R . v. D a lb y (1982) 74 Cr.App.R. 348, C.A. (intravenous con­
         sumption o f dangerous drug was substantial cause o f death— D had sup­
         plied the drug, he had not participated in the injecting o f it— the act of
         supplying the drug w'as not directed against the person o f the deceased and
         the supply did not cause any direct injury to him— conviction for man­
         slaughter quashed).
            In R . v. M itchell (1983) 76 C r.A pp.R . 293, C .A ., the Court certified the
         following point but refused leave: “ whether in order to constitute the
         offence o f m anslaughter the unlawful and dangerous act m ust first, be
         aim ed at the person w ho died, or second, involve direct contact or impact
         upon the person w ho d ied .” T h e court upheld-a conviction for m a n s l a u g h ­
         ter where M becam e involved in an altercation with X , aged 72 (M having

           tried to force his w a y into a queue) an d hit X w ho fell against an 89 year old
           w o m a n . H e r femur was broken and an operation was performed to replace
           her hip jo in t. She died subsequently, the cause o f death being pulm onary
           em b olism caused by throm bosis o f the leg veins w h ich in turn was caused
           by fracture o f the femur. T h e court could see no reason o f policy for holding
           that an act calculated to harm A could not be m a n sla u g h te r if it in fact
           killed B. T h e fact that there was no physical contact b etw een the defendant
           and the victim was im m aterial. In D .P . P . v. N ew bury, ante, the H o u se of
           Lords approved the follow ing dictim in R . v. Larkin [19 43 ] 1 All E.R. 217,
           219: “ W here the act w hich a person is engaged in perform ing is unlawful,
           then if at the sam e tim e it is a dangerous act, that is, an act which is likely
           to injure another person, and quite inadvertently he causes the death o f
           that other person by that act, then he is guilty o f m a n slau gh te r .” It is
           unnecessary to prove that the accused knew that the act was unlawful or
           dangerous: D .P . P . v. N ewbury. In j u d g in g w hether the act was dangerous,
           the test is not did the accused recognise that it was d a n g ero u s, but w ould all
           sober and reasonable people recognise its danger: ibid. T h e practice o f
           directing juries other than in accordance with the principles set out above
           should cease: ibid.b

a person by their appearance and conduct that in co n se q u e n c e that person suffers
a heart attack from which he later dies, a proper direction to the ju ry would
involve telling them that the requisite harm was caused i f the unlawful act so
shocked the victim as to cause him physical injury', see R . v. D aw son, Nolan and
 Walmsley (1985) 81 C r.A p p .R . 150, C.A.
   D a lb y, P agett and M itchell were considered in R . v. Goodfellow (1986) 83
C r.A pp.R . 23, C .A . It was subm itted on b e h a lf o f the a p p e lla n t that D a lb y was
authority for the proposition that in the case o f “ unlawful a c t ” m anslaughter the
action o f the d efendant m ust have been directed at the v ictim . T h is subm ission
w as based o n the following passage from W aller L .J.’s j u d g m e n t in D alby — (1982)
74 C r.A pp.R . 348, 352— “ where the charge o f m a n slau gh ter is based on an u n la w ­
ful and dangerous act, it m ust be a n act directed at the v ic tim and likely to cause
im m ediate injury, how ever slight.” Lord L an e C.J., d elivering the j u d g m e n t o f the
court in Goodfellow, having quoted this extract, continued: “ H o w e v e r , w e do not
think that he w a s suggesting there m ust be an intention on the part o f the d efend­
ant to harm or frighten or a realisation that his acts were likely to harm or frighten.
Indeed it w ould have been contrary to the dicta o f Lord S a lm o n in D .P .P . v. N e w ­
bury [(1976) 62 C r.A p p .R . 291] if he was. W h a t he w as, w e believe, intending to
say was that there m ust be no fresh intervening cause b e tw e e n the act and the
dea th ” (at p. 27). H is L ordship referred to Pagett and M itch ell as supporting this
interpretation o f D a lb y.
   (3) M ens rea is essential to m anslaughter but it can consist o f either (in ( l ) ( a )
above) gross negligence or (in ( l ) ( b ) above) the mens rea appropriate to the u n la w ­
ful act, or both; Andrews v. D .P . P . , ante-, R . v. Lam b, ante-, R . v. Lowe, ante.
   (4) For the purpose o f ( l ) ( b ) above, an act w hich is unlaw ful by the m anner o f
its execution, e.g. dangerous driving, is not an “ unlawful a c t ” ; Andrews v. D .P . P . ,
ante.
   See further at § 2 0 -5 1 , post and the cases collected at § 2 0 - 5 5 , post.

“G ross n e g lig e n c e ”
    (1)     It w o u ld have been satisfactory to have been able to say, as was suggested in
the 39th edition o f this work, that “ gross n e g lig e n c e ” was e q u iva len t to “ reckless­
n e ss ” as defined in § 17-24, ante. Certainly a direction to this effect could only be

 criticised on the ground that it w as too favourable to the accused. T h e position
 how ever is not so sim ple, and it is necessary to refer to certain o f the authorities.
     (2) T h e leading case is Andrews v. D .P . P . (1 93 8) 26 C r.A pp.R . 34, H .L ., a case o f
 “ m otor m anslaughter.” H o ld in g, as w e have seen, that “ dangerous d r iving” was
 not an “ unlawful a c t” for the purpose o f § 2 0 - 4 8 (1) (b), ante, Lord A tkin (in a
 speech concurred in by the rest o f the A ppellate C om m ittee) said that in the pres­
 ent case it was only necessary to consider m a n sla u g h ter from the point o f view o f
 an unintentional killing caused by negligence, that is, the o m ission o f a duty to
 take care. He cited from the considered j u d g m e n t o f the Court o f C rim inal A ppeal
 in R . v. Batemen (1925) 19 C r.A pp.R . 8 the follow ing passage:
     “ In explaining to juries the test w hich they should apply to determ ine w hether
 the negligence, in the particular case, am o u n ted or did not a m ount to a crim e, the
J u d g e s have used m a n y epithets, such as ‘c u lp a b le ,’ ‘crim inal.’ ‘gross,’ ‘w ic k e d ,’
 ‘clear,’ ‘com plete.’ But, w hatever epithet be used and w hether an epithet be used
 or not, in order to establish criminal liability the facts m ust be such that, in the
 opinion o f the ju r y, the negligence o f the accused w ent beyond a mere m atter of
 com pensation betw een subjects and showed su ch disregard for the life and safety
 o f others as to am ou n t to a crim e against the State and conduct deserving punish­
 m e n t .”
     Lord Atkin w en t on to say: “ . . . the expressions used are not. indeed they were
 probably not intended to be, a precise definition o f the crime. I do not m y s e lf find
 the connotation o f mens rea helpful in d istinguishin g between degrees o f negligence,
 nor do the ideas o f crim e and pun ish m en t in them selves carry a ju r y m uch further
 in deciding w hether in a particular case the degree o f negligence show n is a crime
 and deserves p u n ish m en t. But the substance o f the ju d g m e n t is m ost valuable, and
 in m y opinion is correct. In practice it has generally been adopted by ju d g e s in
 charging juries in all cases o f m anslaughter by negligence, w hether in driving
 vehicles or otherwise. . . .
     S im p le lack o f care is not enough. For the purposes o f the criminal law there are
 degrees o f negligence, and a very h igh degree o f negligence is required to be proved
 before the felony is established. Probably o f all the epithets that can be applied,
 “ recklessness” m o st nearly covers the case. It is difficult to visualise a case o f death
 by dangerous driving caused by “ reckless” d rivin g in the c onnotation o f that term
 in ordinary sp e e c h w hich w ould not justify a c onviction for m anslaughter. But it is
 probably not all em bracing, for “ reckless” su g gests an indifference to risk, whereas
 the accused m a y have appreciated the risk and endeavoured to avoid it and yet
s h o w n such a high degree o f negligence in the m eans adopted to avoid the risk as
 w ould justify a con v ic tio n .” T h e H o u se o f Lords has now decided that “ failure to
give any thought to the possibility o f this being a risk” can a m o u n t to recklessness
 (see § 17-24, ante).
     It should be noted that in involuntary m a n slau gh ter by negligence there must
 be both a duty to take care and a high degree o f negligence, w h ich how ever need
 not necessarily a m o u n t to recklessness.
     (3) In R. v. Lam b (1967) 51 C r.A pp.R . 417, C .A ., a strong Court o f A p p ea l in a
 considered j u d g m e n t said, obiter (at p. 424) that “ w h en the gra va m e n o f a charge is
criminal negligence— often referred to as recklessness— o f an accused person, the
ju r y have to con sid er a m o n g other matters the state o f his m ind, and that includes
 the question o f w h eth er he thought that w h a t he w as doing was safe. In the present
c a se ”— pulling the trigger o f a partly-loaded revolver in je st— “ it w ould h a v e been
 fully open to a ju r y , if properly directed, to find the accused gu ilty because they
considered that his view o f there being no danger w as fo rm ed in a criminally negligent w ay,
 but he was entitled to a direction that the j u r y should take into account that fact
 that he had u ndisputelv formed this view and that there was expert evidence o f
 this being an understandable v ie w .”
     (T h e court held that there w as no evidence o f m anslaughter as the result o f an
 unlawful act. because w hat the accused h ad d o n e did not even am ou n t to an
 assault in the a b sen ce o f any hostile intent— see § 2 0 -5 1 2 ,p o st.)
     (4) In R. v. L ow e (1973) 57 C r.A pp.R . 365. C .A ., the Court o f A p p eal a p p e a r to
 h ave equated “ recklessness” w ith the high standard o f negligence required, but
 this was obiter and the court were clearly intending to follow Andrews v. D .P . P . , ante.
    (5) In R. v. Cato (1976) 62 C r.A pp.R . 41, C .A ., on the question o f the degree o f
negligence required, the trial ju d g e had said that “ recklessness” m ust be proved,
without defining that word. T h e Court o f A p p ea l said (at p. 48) that definition w as
unnecessary— “After all, recklessness is a perfectly sim p le English word. Its m e a n ­
ing is well known and it is in co m m o n use.”
   (6) In R . v. Dobinson (1977) C r.A pp.R . 186, 192, 193, C .A , the C ourt o f A ppea l
said that it was not necessary for there to be an appreciation by the accused o f the
risk o f death or serious injury. T h e y w en t on to say that there m ust be a “ reckless
disregard o f danger to the health and welfare o f the infirm person. M e re inadver­
tence is not enough. T h e defendant m ust have been proved to have been indiffer­
ent to an obvious risk o f injury to h ealth, or actually to h a ve foreseen the risk but to
have determ ined nevertheless to run it.”
   In v iew o f the contrast in the abo ve passage betw een “ indifference” and “ actual
foresight” it is difficult to understand w hat distinction is being d raw n betw een
“ inadvertence” and “ indifference.” T h e passage, how ever, is consistent with the
opinions o f the majority o f the H o u se o f Lords in R . v. Caldwell and o f all their
Lordships in R . v. Lawrence (§ 17-24, ante). In R . v. West London Coroner, ex p . Gray
and others [1987] 2 All E.R. 129, D .C ., W atkins L.J. identified the ingredients o f the
offence o f unlawful killing by neglect.

    (7) Collisions at sea. I f a charge o f m a n slau gh ter follow ing loss o f life in a collision
at sea, is to succeed, it is essential that the crown sho uld be able to prove clearly
and for certain every act w hether o f c om m ission or o m ission by those against
whom that charge is brought and w h ich is said not only to have ca used death but
to have been o f so grave a character that a conviction for m anslaughter should fol­
low. In such cases com parable directions on the law to those appropriate in m otor
manslaughter cases sh ou ld be given. In Seymour (1983) 77 C r.A p p .R . 215, H .L .,
the H o u se o f Lords held that the appropriate direction in m otor m anslaughter
cases is the sa m e as has been suggested in Lawrence (1981) 73 C r.A p p .R . 1 (see §
2 0 -2 7 4 ). T h u s the relevant questions are (i) D id the respective acts o f navigation
create an obvious and serious risk o f causing physical d a m a g e to s o m e other ship
and thus to other persons w h o m ight have been travelling in the area o f the colli­
sion at the material time? I f so, did any o f the defendants by their respective acts o f
navigation so navigate either w ithout having g iven any thought to the possibility
of that risk or, w hile recognising that the risk existed, take that risk: Kong Ckeuk
K w an v. R . (1986) 82 C r.A pp.R . 18, P.C.

    (8) Manslaughter charge as an alternative to causing death by reckless driving. T h e offence
o f causing death by reckless driving o f a m otor veh icle on a road is still m a n sla u g h ­
ter by the law o f England even though it is also a statutory offence and has been
since 1956: Government o f U .S .A . v. Jennings (1982) 75 C r.A p p .R . 367, H .L ., (an
extradition case). T h e evidence to prove either offence is therefore the sam e.
    In R. v. Seymour (1983) 77 C r.A pp.R . 215, H .L ., it w as held that w here m a n ­
slaughter was charged and the circum stances were that the victim w as killed as the
result o f the reckless driving o f the defendant on a public highw ay, the jury sh o u ld
be directed as suggested in R . v. Lawrence (see § 2 0 - 2 7 4 , post), but it would be
appropriate to point out that in order to constitute the offence o f m an sla u g h ter the
risk o f death being caused by the m an n er o f the d e fe n d a n t’s driving m ust be verv
high. Lord Roskill, with w h o se speech all but o n e o f the rem ainder o f their L ord­
ships agreed, said that there could be no justification for jo in in g both m a n sla u g h ­
ter and the statutory offence in the sam e in d ic tm e n t a n d that if it w ere d o n e the
prosecution should be m ad e to elect upon w hich cou n t they w ish ed to proceed.
T h e suggestion that a prerequisite for a m a n sla u g h ter charge is that “ the risk o f
death must be very h ig h ” is quite inconsistent w ith Lawrence and is obiter.


Duty o f care
   T h is belongs m ore to the fields o f contract and tort than to this work. In prac­
tice, however, the question o f w hether the accused w a s under a d u ty o f care
usually only arises in m anslaughter cases w here it is alleged that the accused had
undertaken the care o f a child or infirm person or the like. In other cases, such as
the m edical practitioner or driver o f a car or an engine, the duty is obvious.
   In R. v. Stone, R . v. Dobinson {ante), Stone and D o b in son were living together,
D o b in so n being S to n e ’s mistress. S to n e ’s sister, Fanny, the deceased, lodged in
their house and they had taken s o m e care o f her. It was argued for the appellants
that they had no duty o f care to the deceased. Rejecting this, the Court o f A ppeal
(at p. 191) said:
   “ W hether F a n n y was a lodger or not she w as a blood relation o f . . . Stone; she
was occupying a room in his house; M rs. D o b in so n had undertaken the duty of
trying to w ash her, o f taking such food to her as she required. There was am ple
evidence that each accused was aw are o f the poor condition she was in. . . . T his
w as not a situation analogous to the drow ning stranger. T h e y d id make efforts to
care. T h e y tried to get a doctor; they tried to discover the previous doctor. Mrs.
D o b in so n helped with the w a s h in g and the provision o f food. . . . T h e j u r y were
entitled to find that the d u ty had been a ssu m e d . T h e y were entitled to conclude
that once Fanny b ecam e helplessly infirm. . . . the appellants were, in the circum ­
stances, obliged either to s u m m o n help or else to care for F anny th e m se lv e s.”

“Unlawful Act”
   (1) See ante § 2 0 - 4 8 . R ea son ab le correction o f a child by a person in loco parentis
is not unlawful— see § 2 0 -2 5 , ante. For observations as to the proper direction
w h en such an issue arises see R . v. M ackie (1973) 57 C r.A p p .R . 353 and post,
§ 2 0 -5 8 . A s to injuries caused in lawful g a m e s an d contests, see post, § 2 0 - 5 6 .
   In R . v. Lamb, § 2 0 -4 9 (3), ante, w h e n the accused had pulled the trigger o f the
revolver in jest, the Court o f A p p eal pointed out that this was not an unlawful act
and therefore the prosecution could only h a ve established m anslaughter by prov­
ing gross negligence.
   (2) In R . v. Cato, § 2 0 - 4 9 (5), ante, the C ourt o f A ppeal held that injecting
another person with heroin w hich the defendant had unlawfully taken into his po s­
session for that purpose, (he had exch a n g ed syringes with the other person), is an
unlawful act, and if death results the offence is m anslaughter, notw ithstanding
that the victim consented to the injection and provided the syringe and the heroin.
H ow ever, cf. R . v. D a lb y, ante, § 2 0 - 4 8 , (a person w ho supplies the drug w hich is
injected by the deceased h im se lf is not guilty o f m anslaughter).
   (3) A n act calculated to harm A is m a n sla u g h ter if it kills B and it is im material

   {!) Counselling, (see also post, §§ 2 9 - 1 9 — 2 9 - 2 8 ) . A person can be indicted for
and convicted o f accessory before the fact to involuntary m anslaughter, but semble
not in the case o f voluntary m anslaughter (see ante, § 2 0 -4 7 ): R . v. Creamer (1966)
49 C r.A pp.R . 368, C .C .A ., {obiter o n this point but following old authority).     -■■■<
   A t page 378 the Court said: “ A m an is guilty o f involuntary m anslaughter when
he intends an unlawful act and o n e likely to do harm to the person a n d death
results w hich was neither foreseen nor intended. It is the accident o f d e a th which
m akes him guilty o f m anslaughter as o p p osed to som e lesser offence such as
assault or, in the present case, abortion. T h is can no d oubt be said to be illogical,
since the culpability is the sam e, but nevertheless it is an illogicality w h ic h runs
throughout the w ho le o f our law , both the c o m m o n law and the statute law . . . •
Bearing that in m ind, it is quite consistent that a m an w ho has counselled and pro­
cured such an illegal and dangerous act from w hich death, unintended, results
should be guilty o f being accessory before the fact to m a nsla ughter.”
   T h e C ourt’s dictum that a person cannot be indicted as an accessory before the
fact to voluntary m anslaughter w a s based on the old authorities referred to in the

                                                         IN T R O D U C T IO N

  1. O n 15 April 1989 a football m atch to d ec id e a semi-final r o u n d o f th e FA C u p co m p etitio n was to be
played b etw een the Liverpool a n d N o ttin g h a m Forest Clubs. T h e neutral v en u e chosen was H illsborough
Football S ta d iu m , Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. Only six m in u tes in to th e gam e, play was s to p p e d w hen it
was realised th a t spectators o n the terraces b e h in d the Liverpool goal h ad been severely crushed. In th e result,
95 died a n d ov er 4 00 received hospital trea tm e n t.

  2. O n 17 April 19891 was ap p o in ted by you to carry out an In q u iry with the following term s o f reference:

      To in q u ire into th e events a t Sheffield W ednesday football g ro u n d o n 15 April 1989 a n d to make
      r e c o m m e n d a tio n s a b o u t th e needs o f crowd control a n d safety at sports events,

    3. Two A ssessors were ap p o in ted to assist me: M r Brian J o h n so n Q P M , C h ie f Constable o f Lancashire,
a n d P rofessor L eo n ard M a u n d e r OBE, BSc, P h D , ScD, FEng, FI M ech E, Professor o f M echanical
Engineering at the U n iv ersity o f N ewcastle u p o n Tyne. T h e ir help has b een invaluable a n d I a m very grateful
for th e ir ex p ert advice a n d wise counsels. W hile th e sole responsibility for this rep o rt is mine, I a m com forted
in the know ledge th a t b o th Assessors agree w ith it.

  4. M r R o b ert W halley was a p p o in ted Secretary to th e Inquiry. H e a n d his assistants have w orked
prodigiously a n d skilfully to give m e all the advice an d su p p o rt I could have w ished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help I h av e received, as always, from m y clerk, M r Ernest Pott.

   5. T h e policing arrangem ents for 15 A pril were in the h a n d s o f the S outh Yorkshire C onstabulary. The
efficacy o f th o se arran g em en ts a n d th e ir im p lem en ta tio n was from an early stage called into q u es tio n . It was
therefore d ec id e d that th e investigation o f th e d isaster an d th e gathering o f evidence for this I n q u iry should be
co n d u c te d by an in d e p en d e n t police force. M r Geoffrey D e a r Q P M , C h ie f C onstable o f W est M idlands
Constabulary, u n d e rto o k this task. H e was m a d e responsible directly to me; he ap p o in ted A ssistant C h ief
C onstable M e rv y n Jo n e s to take full-time charge o f the investigation. I a m deeply in d e b ted to b o th o f them.

   6. O n 18 April I visited Hillsborough S tad iu m . I inspected the scene o f th e d isa ste r o n the terraces an d all
relevant p a rts o f the sta d iu m a n d its ap proaches. My Assessors a n d I have m a d e further visits durin g the
Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool on 21 a n d 29 April.

    7. T h e L o rd M ayor a n d the Sheffield C ity Council kindly offered to m ake th e a c c o m m o d a tio n a n d facilities
o f Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing o f oral evidence. T h is offer was gratefully accepted a n d I would
like to record my th a n k s for those facilities an d for the co-operation afforded to the Inquiry by the authorities
in Sheffield.

   8. O n 2 8 April 1 9 8 9 ,1 held a p relim in ary hearing to an n o u n c e th e d ate w h en th e oral evidence w ould begin,
to give so m e d irectio n s as to the proced u re I in ten d ed to follow a n d to hear ap p lica tio n s from th o se w ishing to
be rep rese n te d at the hearing. I accorded representation to the following:
       ( i)    T h o se bereaved o r injured as a result o f the disaster.
       (ii)    T h e Football Supporters’ Association.
       (iii)   T h e Football Association.
       (iv)    Sheffield C ity Council.
       (v)     Sheffield W ednesday Football C lub together w ith the Football League, the Club’s casual sta ff a n d
               th e ir insurers, the Sun Alliance.
       (vi)    South Yorkshire Constabulary.
       (vii) S outh Yorkshire Fire a n d Civil Defence Authority.
Subsequently, d u rin g the hearing. 1 fu rth e r accorded representation to:
       (viii) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire M etropolitan A m b u lan ce Service
              (SYMAS).
an d   (ix)   D r W Eastwood, co n su ltan t engineer to Sheffield W ednesday Football Club.

    9. Since the circum stances o f the disaster raised urgent q u estio n s o f safety, especially at football grounds,
you ind icated at the outset that you w ould welcome any rec o m m e n d atio n s, even o f an in terim nature, w hich 1
might be able to give in advance o f th e new football season d u e to c o m m en c e in m id-A ugust 1 9 8 9 .1 therefore
a n n o u n c e d at th e prelim inary hearing on 28 April th a t I w ould co n d u c t a n oral hearing w ith all possible
ex p ed itio n as the first phase o f the In q u iry to discover the facts a n d causes o f the disaster a n d enable me to
m ake any im m e d ia te interim reco m m e n d atio n s necessary in th e short term .

   10. T h e West M id lan d s Police investigation began on 24 April. A “ F re ep h o n e” n u m b e r was advertised to
en ab le m e m b ers o f th e public, especially those w h o h ad atte n d e d the m atch, to offer th e ir evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this n u m b e r was available for three days on 28 different lines. T h e response fro m the public
was such th a t th e lines were c o n tin u ed for a fu rth er three days by the e n d o f w hich 2,666 calls h ad been
received. T h ere were also many w ritten offers o f help. S om e 440 West M id lan d s officers were deployed on the
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in B irm in g h am , Liverpool a n d
Sheffield a n d c o m p u te r technology was used to the full. In all som e 3776 statem en ts were taken. T here were
also som e 1550 letters to M inisters, to the Inquiry a n d to m e personally all o f w hich I read. T h e police,
Sheffield W ednesday Football Club a n d the BBC h ad video cam eras film ing at the g ro u n d on 15 April. In
aggregate, they rec o rd e d some 71 h o u rs o f film covering the period before, d urin g an d afte r th e disaster. T h u s
the m aterial gath ered a n d potentially available for p resen tatio n at the oral hearing was en o rm o u s. F rom this
m ass it was essential to select only sufficient good a n d reliable evidence necessary to establish the facts a n d
causes o f th e disaster.

   11. W here it seem ed likely that any allegation o r criticism might be m a d e o f the co n d u c t o f any person or
party, the T reasury Solicitor, after con su ltatio n w ith Counsel for th e Inquiry, w rote to th e p arty concerned
setting o u t the likely grounds for co m p lain t. This followed the practice established by th e Royal C o m m issio n
on T rib u n als o f In q u iry (the Salm on Com m ission).

    12. T h e hearin g began on 15 May. It co ntinued, sitting long hours, for 31 days conclu d in g o n 29 Ju n e. In
th a t p eriod, 174 w itnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel’s subm issions were delivered in w riting on 7 July an d
o n 14 July I h e a rd th e ir brief oral subm issions supplem enting the w ritten argum ent.

    13. W itnesses were not sworn. Since this is a d ep a rtm e n tal inquiry, there was no pow er to a d m in ister the
o a th b u t there was no instance o f any witness giving evidence w hich I co n sid ered m ight have been different
h a d he or she b e e n sworn.

   14. T h e w itnesses called were only a small fraction o f those from w h o m statem ents were o r could have been
taken. N evertheless, I a m satisfied that they were sufficient in n u m b e r a n d reliability to enable m e to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called m ore would have prevented m e from presenting an in te rim report in the
req u ired tim e a n d w ould not have a d d e d significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been able to
take into a c co u n t m any written statem en ts in ad d itio n to oral testimony.

    15. A part fro m the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry w hich was draw n fro m statem en ts taken by
th e West M id la n d s Police a n d o th ers volunteered by individuals, each o f the represented parties was given full
o p p o r tu n ity to p u t forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final su b m issio n was m ade by
Counsel for the S outh Yorkshire Police that since th e investigation by West M idlands Police is still continuing,
all th e evid en ce has not been assem b led a n d it w ould be unsafe for m e to make findings o f fact. I should
therefore m ake clear th a t the investigation continues principally to furnish as much detail as possible to H M
C o ro n er for th e City o f Sheffield as to the cause o f death, the precise position at d ea th a n d the care an d
m o v e m en t o f each o f the 95 victim s individually. I a m assured by C h ie f Constable D ea r a n d A ssistant C h ief
C o n stab le M ervvn Jones th a t it is m ost unlikely any fu rth er evidence gathered will significantly alter o r a d d to
th e history o f events which em erged at the hearing.

    16. I sh o u ld like to thank all those w ho m ade it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
event a n d for evidence to be efficiently presented a n d tested so as to give a full a n d fair account o f w hat
h a p p e n e d in all its aspects w itho u t irrelevancy or d uplication. I pay trib u te particularly to th e West M idlands
Police for th e ir speed an d d edication in gathering the evidence a n d to all those responsible for processing it.



                                                               2
T he m ost e lo q u en t trib u te to the fairness an d thoroughness o f th e police investigation ca m e from the Secretary
o f the Football S u p p o rters' Association. He said there h ad been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to w h eth e r that
investigation would be fair and objective. His A ssociation therefore collected 200 witness statem ents
themselves. H aving h ea rd the opening statem ent by Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered
by the police, he fo u n d that it accorded entirely with his Association's evidence and th e initial anxiety was
w holly dispelled.

   17. Before a n d d u rin g the Inquiry I derived great assistance on a w ide range o f technical issues from the
H ealth an d Safety Executive w ho providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the R esearch a n d Laboratory
Services D ivision ) w here tests were conducted a n d reports p repared swiftly a n d efficiently. T h is was d o n e
in close co n su lta tio n w ith Professor M aunder. I a m m ost grateful to th e Director, D r A Jones, a n d to the
D eputy D irector, D r C E N icholson, for th e ir invaluable help.

   18. I wish to c o m m e n d Counsel to the inquiry, M r Andrew Collins Q C, M r A lan G oldsack a n d M r
B ernard Phillips for th e ir industry, care a n d fairness in selecting a n d presenting the necessary evidence; also.
Counsel for all th o se represented w ho tested th a t evid en ce fully b u t expeditiously. T h is In terim R ep ort could
not possibly have b een p rep ared in so short a tim e h ad I not h a d th e w hole-hearted co -o p e ra tio n o f all those
m en tio n e d a n d m a n y others.

   19. T h e se co n d p hase o f the Inquiry will be directed to m aking final a n d lo n g te rm re c o m m e n d a tio n s ab o u t
crowd control a n d safety at sports grounds. I need to co n sid er in d e p th inform ation, o p in io n s a n d arg u m en ts
from a w ide range o f sources an d co n trib u tors b o th here a n d ab ro a d . It was clear fro m th e outset th a t this
second p hase co u ld not be carried to co m pletion before the next football season. However, at an early stage o f
the oral h earin g I in v ited evidence from all w ho w ished to co n trib u te to it a n d specifically from m any sporting,
local authority, em ergency service a n d police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked th a t subm issio n s
should be in w ritin g a n d should be m ad e p ro m p tly so that the second phase o f th e In q u iry could
follow im m ed iately afte r th e first. I shall now proceed to co n sid er the large body o f w ritte n evidence w hich has
been su b m itte d . I shall w an t in som e instances to have fu rth er oral evidence o r discussion in co n ju n ctio n w ith
my Assessors. We will also n eed to m ake a n u m b e r o f visits a n d inspections.

   20. I now p rese n t my In terim Report an d R e co m m en d a tio n s. I shall p rep are my Final Report an d

Fixing T h e Venue
   21. O n 20 M arch 1989. the Football Association (the FA) requested th a t th e ir C u p semi-final between
Liverpool a n d N o ttin g h am Forest be held o n 15 April at H illsborough Football S tad iu m . T he co rresp o n d in g
semi-final between the sam e two team s h ad been held there in April 1988. T h e arran g em en ts h a d been
successful in the view b o th o f the police a n d o f the host club. Sheffield W ednesday (the Club) were therefore
willing to a c co m m o d ate th e 1989 match. South Yorkshire Constabulary were p rep ared to police it b u t only if
the ticketing arran g e m en ts were the sam e as those for 1988. O therw ise, the FA w ould have to look elsewhere.
T h ose arran gem en ts d id n o t please Liverpool or its su p p o rters e ith e r in 1988 o r 1989. T hey th o u g h t th e ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police req u irem en t was
accepted a n d the m atch w as fixed for 15 April at H illsborough.

T he G round
  22. T h e H illsborough S tadium is som e 2'k miles to the north-w est o f cen tral Sheffield in th e district o f
O w lerton. T h e ground w as o p en ed in 1899 on what was th en a greenfield site by the river D on. T h e pitch lies
roughly east to west. A plan o f the g rou n d an d its im m ed iate en v iro n s is at A p p en d ix 1.

  23. T h e west end. w ith w hich this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings L an e end. The
east en d abuts on P enistone Road, the A 61. To the south is th e river D on a n d to the n o rth a residential street.
Vere Road, which ru n s betw een Leppings L ane an d P enistone R o a d North.

   24. Alongside the river is a private roadw ay giving access to th e south stan d , to th e D irectors’ a n d players’
en trances, an d to th e ad m in istra tiv e block u n d er the stand. T h e roadway gives bo th vehicular a n d pedestrian
access betw een P en isto n e Road a n d Leppings Lane, but there are gates which ca n shut it o ff at each end. There
is so m e ca r parking along this roadway principally for D irectors, players a n d em ployees o f the Club. T h e south
sta n d d ates from 1914 a n d is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8.800. 5.500 o f those are
roofed over a n d 3.300 are uncovered.

  25. T h e north sta n d is also all seating a n d ac co m m o d ates ab o u t 9.700. B ehind it is a g y m n a siu m o r sports
hall. T h ere are also a first aid room a n d police room close by.

  26. T h e east en d is all terracing and is known as th e Spion Kop. It was enlarged a n d roofed over in 1986 and
now ac c o m m o d a te s so m e 21.000 stan d in g spectators. T h ere are crush b arriers in the Kop ru n n in g parallel to
the goal line b u t no d iv id in g fences to prevent free m o v em en t from side to side.

   27. At the west o r Leppings Lane en d o f the ground there is terracingclose to the pitch. B eh in d it is the west
sta n d w hich provides covered seating a n d was built in 1965 for World C u p m atches, som e o f w hich were held
at H illsborough in 1966. T h e covered sta n d ac co m m o d ates 4.456 seated spectators. T h e terracing in front o f it
exten d s higher in th e corners between the stands a n d its total capacity was stated to be 10.100. At b oth the Kop
en d a n d the west e n d access to the pitch is barred by p erim ete r fencing. T h e fencing is ab o u t eight feet high
m o u n te d u p o n the low wall at the foot o f the terracing. At the to p o f th e fencing the wire returns b ac k at a sharp
angle for som e 15 inches to m ake it difficult for anyone to clim b over tow ards the pitch. T h ere are gates at
intervals along the p erim eter fencing to afford access between terrace a n d pitch. T hese gates are less than a
m etre w ide an d were designed to be o p en e d only from the pitch side for police purposes o r in an emergency.
T h ey are m ark e d a n d n u m b e re d on th e plan A ppendix 1.

    28. U nlike the Kop end. the west terracing has not only cru sh barriers parallel w ith th e goal line but radial
fences at right angles to it. dividing the area into pens. T h is division was begun after an FA C u p semi-final in
1981 w hen cru sh in g occurred d u e to overcrow ding and gates h a d to be o pened. It proceeded in stages, the final
arra n g e m e n t being shown on the plan A p pendix I . T h e first section o f the west terracing m oving south to north
c o n tain s gates 1 a n d 2 and is known as pens 1 an d 2 although in fact co ns titu tin g only o n e pen. Next is pen 3
with o n e gate: next pen 4 with one gate: pen 5. which is extrem ely narrow, was in tend ed as a sterile area to
d iv id e pen 4 from pen 6. This was to isolate hom e an d away fans on occasions w hen b o th might be
a c c o m m o d a te d o n the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is p en 7 at the north-w est co m er. Pens 5, 6
a n d 7 each have a p erim eter gate. At the back o f the pens, u n d er the front o f th e west stand, th e re is a gate in
each radial fence. W hen those gates are open, the back row o f the terracing is intended to perm it access from
pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, w hen substantial n u m b e rs are present, those gateways are not
readily v isible or accessible. The present layout o f the pens, fences, crush b arriers a n d gates has resulted from a
series o f piecem eal changes. The n atu re an d effect o f those changes must be considered later.

The Turnstiles
   29. Because o f the housing in Vere R oad there is no access from th e north side o f the ground. Along
Penistone Road N o rth there are some 46 turnstiles which usually give access b oth to the Kop and to the east
end o f the n o rth stand. They are m arked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. T h e 12 n u m b e re d 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the n o rth stan d but were not used for th a t p urpose on 15 April in o rd e r to segregate su p p o rters o f the
two team s as ap p e ars later. Two o f th e m . 77 an d 78. were however used for access to the Kop.

   30. At the south side o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles (n u m b e re d 19 to 42 o n the plan). Those
n u m b e re d 37 to 42 led to th e Kop and the rest to the south stand.

  31. In summ ary, the south and east sides o f the ground ac c o m m o d a te d som e 29.800 whose access on the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. T he o th e r tw o sides o f the g round, n o rth a n d west, w ith a capacity o f 24.256 were fed solely from the
Leppings Lane en tra n ce where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the Ground
  33. M ost su pp o rters were expected to com e by road although rail tran sp o rt was available. N o ttin g h am
supporters travelling by train would arrive at th e m ain line Sheffield M id lan d Station whence they would be
directed a n d escorted northw ards by th e police. T hey w ould arrive at the gro u n d along P enistone Road.
N o ttin gh am su p p o rters travelling by coach, m in i-b u s o r car would ap p ro a ch Sheffield from the south mainly
on the M 1. Again th e ir arrival at the g ro u n d would p red o m in an tly be via P enistone Road o r H erries Road.

   34. Liverpool sup p o rters travelling by n o rm al rail service would arrive at Sheffield M idland S tation ju st
like their N o ttin g h am counterparts. T h e police aim ed to segregate the rival fans an d put th em into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
catering solely for football supporters a n d situated to the n o rth o f the ground. A police escort was available to
conduct th e m on foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. T h o se com ing from Liverpool by road w ould approach
Sheffield eith er via the M 62 an d down the M 1 from the n o rth o r across th e P ennines from the no rth west. All
such routes would bring th em to the g ro u n d via o ne o r o th e r lim b o f Leppings Lane as shown on A pp en d ix 1.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north a n d west: arrivals from N o ttin g h am
would be from the south a n d east.

Allocation of Places and Tickets
   35. Experience in recent years has p ro d u ce d a policy o f segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
o f rival teams. T h e n eed for this policy to be m a in ta in ed was endorsed a n d em phasised by the Popplewell
Report following the Bradford City d isaster in 1985. Accordingly, before th e 1988 semi-final the police decided
that sections o f the H illsborough S ta d iu m should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation o f
Liverpool a n d N o ttin g h am Forest fans. T h e section to be granted to each was d eterm in e d by th e direction
whence each p re d o m in an tly ap pro ach ed . T hus, Liverpool were allotted th e n o rth a n d west sides o f the ground
for which access was from Leppings Lane. N o ttin g h am Forest were allotted the south an d east sides w ith access
from P enistone Road.

   36. T h e effect o f th e decision was th a t for this all-ticket C u p Tie. Liverpool were allotted only 24,256 places
as against 29.800 for N o ttin g h am Forest. This, although average a tten d a n ce o f supporters at h o m e m atches
was substantially higher at Liverpool th a n at N o tting h am . Moreover, w ith stand in g tickets at £6 a n d seats at
£12. N o ttin g h am Forest h ad 21.000 standing places com p ared with Liverpool's 10.100. So, L iverpool’s
allocation was m o re expensive as well as smaller. U nderstandably. Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
o f places a n d tickets. They sought with som e support from the host club a n d the FA to have it changed in
1988. but the police were adam ant. To switch en d s would, in their op in io n , have involved rival supporters
crossing each o th e r’s p aths when ap p ro a ch in g the ground thereby frustrating a ttem p ts at segregation and
creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989, when the sam e plan was proposed. Liverpool again challenged it. T h e
police, however, m a in ta in e d their view, ad din g that those who had a tten d e d in 1988 would be fam iliar with the
arrangem ents and th a t any change w ould lead to confusion.
A ccess from L ep p in g s L ane
   37. As the plan Appendix 1 shows, the ap p ro a ch to the west turnstiles is across a narrow'neck o r forecourt at
a b en d in Leppings Lane w here, com ing from the north, it tu rn s to th e south-west a n d crosses a bridge over the
river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged n orth a n d west o f th e ground. They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs o f Leppings Lane a n d would converge on the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line o f railings w ith six sets o f d o u b le gates. Inside
those p erim eter gates is the short ap p roach to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs A p p en d ix 2. the
latter are in tw o sections d iv id ed by a fence. T h e northern section consists o f turnstiles 1 to 16. N u m b ers ! to
 10 gave access to the north stand. T h u s there were 10 turnstiles for the 9.700 with n o rth sta n d seats. T h eir
tickets were m arked "E ntrance A '' a n d were colour-coded brown. T u rn stiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above th em an d brown b o ard s on the wall.

   38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for those w ith seats in the west stand. T h u s 4.456 were served by six turnstiles.
They were th e next block to the right o f those m arked A. However, instead o f these tu m s tile s a n d the west stand
tickets being m arked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were m a rk e d C. T heir colour-code on
tickets a n d b o ard s was red.

   39. O n th e o th er side o f the d iv id in g fence in the ap p ro ach area, there were only seven tu rn stiles to serve
10.100 w ith tickets for the west terracing. T ho se seven turnstiles were labelled A to G . T his w as because there
had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings L ane an d the sequential n u m b e rin g con tin u ed fro m 19 upw ards
on the south side o f th e ground. W hen the n u m b e r at Leppings Lane was brought u p to 23 the present
a rran g e m en ts o f 1 to 1-6. A to G an d th en 19 up w ard s w a sa d o p te d to avoid re-num bering all r o u n d the ground.
However, above th e lettering A to G was a large letter B. "E n tra n c e B” also ap p eared on tickets for the west
terrace. T h u s, the three blocks o f turn stiles en co u n te re d by a ticket h o ld e r at the Leppings Lane e n d read from
left to right A. C. B. T he colour-code for west terrace tickets a n d the b o ard s beside turnstiles A to G was m auve.
To the right o f turnstile G is a tubulai steel b a rrier to divide the q u eue for that turnstile from the roadw ay to the
south stand.

Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
   40. T urnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. T h ere isan exit gate (m arked A
o n A p pendix 1) between turnstile 1 a n d the ad jacen t housing.

  41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 an d 7 an d the steps to the west stan d . T h ere is a
wall d iv id in g this area from that inside tu rn stiles A to G, It had been built to segregate hom e a n d away fans at a
tim e w hen the Club in ten d ed they should share the west terrace. T h at idea was not p u rsu e d but the wall
rem ained. T h ere was. however, a gateway in the wall w hich d id perm it access between the tw o areas. An exit
gate (m ark ed B on Appendix 1) was p ro v id ed from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

   42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse b o u n d e d on the left by the wall ju st
m e n tio n e d a n d on the right by the wall o f th e private roadway com ing frcm the south stand to Leppings Lane.
T h ere was an exit gate in the latter wall (m ark ed C on Appendix 1)ju st inside tu rn stile G.

    43. All th ree exit gates. A. B a n d C. were o f concertina design. They could be o pened only fro m the inside
a n d were n o t intended for entry o f spectators into the ground.

   44. T h o se entering through turnstiles A to G had three o p tio n s once inside the ground. T hey could by
m oving to the right go round the south end o f the west stand a n d gain entry into pens 1 an d 2. They could go
through th e gap in the d ividing wall tow ards the concourse b eh in d turnstiles 11 to 16 and then r o u n d the n o rth
end o f th e west stand into pens 6 o r 7. However, there were n o conspicuous signs inviting them to take e ith e r o f
th o se courses. T h e obvious way in was straight ahead o f the turnstiles w here a tu n n el under the m id d le o f the
west stan d gave access to pens 3 a n d 4. Above its en trance in large letters was the w ord “S tan d in g ” and a large
letter “ B \ T h u s B ticket holders were draw n tow ards the tunnel.

   45. T h e length o f the tunnel is som e 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels off but finally descends
tow ards the terraces at a gradient o f 1 in 6. As it emerges on to th e terrace, the way a h e a d is bisected by the radial
fence betw een pen 3 on the right a n d pen 4 on the left. A short sp u r o f brick wall projects forward from each side
o f the tu n n e l at its mouth. T hose em erging are thu s guided straight forward rather than to e ith e r side. T he
p h o to g rap h at A ppendix 3 shows th e west stand a n d terraces.

   46. As w ith the la vout on the terraces, the c o n tif ir a tio n ot th e Leppings Lane turnstiles and th e areas inside
th em was effected by a series o f piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary to analyse their resu ltan t effect.


                                                                 6
Policing A r r a n g e m e n ts
   47. At th e 1988 semi-final, policing had been u n d er the control o f C h ief S up erin ten d en t Mole, then
C o m m a n d e r o f F Division w ithin whose area H illsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 M arch 1989 when
the FA b ro ac h ed the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over c o m m a n d o f F Division on 27 M arch to
S u p erin ten d en t D u c k e n fie ld o n the latter's p ro m o tio n to C hief Superin ten d en t. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 M arch, but on 27 March M r Mole bowed out a n d M r Duckenfield took over. U n d er him were
Sector C o m m a n d e rs , all S u p erin te n d en ts w ith m u ch experience o f policing football m atches at H illsborough
an d elsew here. In particular. S up erin ten d en t M arshall was in charge o f the area o u tsid e the Leppings Lane
entrance a n d the ap p ro a ch e s to it. S u p erin te n d en t G reen w o o d was in c o m m a n d inside the ground, but this
included the area between th e turnstiles an d the perim eter fence. T h ey thereby sw apped roles from the
previous year. U n d e r M r D uckenfield’s overall c o m m a n d were som e 801 officers a n d men on du ty at the
ground plus traffic officers a n d others from D D iv isio n to deal with the influx o f su p po rters into the city centre.
In all. therefore, som e 1.122 police were deployed for this m atch am o u n tin g to a b o u t 38 per cent o f th e total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the m o u n ted section o f 34 were officers from Liverpool and N o ttin g h am to
assist respectively in m arshalling their h o m e supporters. T h e total at the g ro u n d was divided into serials
consisting usually o f eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant a n d an Inspector. T h e serials were posted to d u ties
at various sta tio n s in and aro u n d the ground in three phases: before, d u rin g an d after the m atch. All o f this
was provided for in a n O perational O rd e r which followed closely th e O rd e r draw n up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into accou n t the force's "S tanding In stru ctio n s for th e Policing o f Football G ro u n d s” . T h e O rd e r
described th e duties o f each serial at each phase. It was sup p lem en ted by oral briefings before and on the d ay o f
the match.

Sheffield W ednesday's A rrangem ents
   48. T he C lu b p r o v i d e d 376 stewards, gatem en a n d turnstile operators for du ty on 15 April. T h e stewards
w e re briefed as to their d u ties on the m o rn in g o f th e m atch by police Inspectors a n d were allocated ro u n d the
ground. T hey wore yellow tabards. T h e C lu b 's control room , situated below the south stand , could
co m m u n icate by V H F rad io with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the C lub with
screens in th e ir control room showing all the tu rn stiles round th e ground. A co m p u terise d counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed o n to a screen in the Club control room the ru nning total o f
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. T h u s, at th e Leppings L ane end. there would be
s e p a r a t e ru n n in g totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (n o rth stand), turnstiles 11 to 16(west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). W hen the total for any section was w ithin 15 p e r c e n t o f its p erm itte d capacity a w arning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing th a t w arning would occur when the n u m b e rs were w ithin 1 5 per
cent o f the total terrace capacity o f 10.100. W h a t the system could not d o was m o n ito r the d istrib u tio n o f fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no w arn in g therefore if o n e pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

 Police Com m unications
   49. T h e nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west co rn e r o f the
ground between the south stand and pen 1 o f the west terracing. T h e box is elevated a n d reached by a n u m b e r
o f steps. It has windows co m m a n d in g views across the pitch a n d straight a k ng th e line o f the west p erim eter
t'cnce. T h e box is very small a n d has seats for only three officers. S u p erin le n d en t M urray was in control o f it
and was a d v iso r to M r Duckenfield as he h ad been to M r M ole the year before. N ext to him sat Sergeant
G o d d ard who o p erated th e radios. T h e th ird seat was for Police C on stab le Ryan who operated the telephone
and public ad d ress systems. At the back o f the box stood Police C on stab le Bichard w h o was in control o f the
police closed circuit television system op erated by a row o f consoles on a bench in front o f him a n d b e h in d the
three seated officers.

    50. T here were five television screens showing views o f five roving cam eras fixed at high p oin ts on the
 stands an d directed both inside and outside th e ground. T h ere was also a m a ste r screen which flicked in
 rotation from o n e cam era view to a n o th e r a n d which m a d e a video recording. T h e cameras have a zoom
 facility to close in on any p o in t o f interest. Specifically, there were good cam era view's o f the west terracing, o f
 the Leppings Lane turnstiles an d beyond th e m o f Leppings L ane itself

   51. T he Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage p o in ts inside the
 ground an d outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed u n d e r the police control box. to relay
 music before th e match, but it could be o verridden by the police. Messages co u ld be relayed th rough all
 speakers o r if a p p ro p riate to o ne area only.
   53.     R a d io co n tac t at Hillsborough from control 10 serials operating both inside and outside the g ro u n d was
U H F on c h a n n e l 25. T here was a W1 FU p o rtable base station in the control box a n d if it failed there was a
stand-by sta tio n u n d e r the o p era to r's bench. H an d sets were issued to all ranks o f Sergeant an d above
C o m m u n ity Constables on d u ty would already have their own. O ther C onstables h ad no radio.
C o m m u n ic a tio n was on "talk th ro u g h ” i.e. any message from any source would be h ea rd by everyone tu n e d in
an d if m o re th a n one source spoke messages could b ecom e garbled. E ar pieces were issued to som e officers in

Early Arrivals
   54. 15 April 1989 was a w arm sunny spring Saturday. T he m atch was a sell-out, so 54,000 ticket holders
were expected. O th ers would com e w ithout tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain access otherwise.
T he following acco u n t concentrates, as d id the evidence, on the western ap p ro a ch e s an d the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. T hey began to arrive in the Hillsborough area q u ite early in
small num bers. Som e b rought cans o f beer w ith them an d were seen drinking as they walked; o th ers took
advantage o f the w eather an d sat ab ou t on walls an d o p en spaces. W hen the public houses o pened, many
resorted there, drinking inside or spilling o u t into the sunshine. Leppings Lane a n d its environs co m p rise a
mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool su p p o rters keen to find a public
house or off-licence. M any were asking for tickets or "sp a re s”. T h ere were a few touts selling th em at inflated
prices. F rom an early stage, som e o f the fans were using private gardens a n d yards to urinate. As the m o rn in g
wore on, n u m b e rs increased. Requests for tickets an d trespass to urinate also increased. Still th e prevailing
mood was one o f carnival, good h u m o u r and expectation.

Public H ouses
  55. T h ere were som e 74 shops w ith off-licences in an d aro u n d Sheffield. In general, they o p en ed at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters d id visit them b u t the evidence d id not suggest a great a m o u n t o f alcoholic d rin k was
bought there.

  56. O p enin g tim e at public houses was in general 11 am . S om e rem a in e d closed all day. O f the others, som e
72, mostly in the city, were frequented by local p atro n s only. S om e 23 public houses, however, served over a
hundred Liverpool su pp o rters each. A n o th er 51 served m o re th a n 2 0 each. Little trouble was reported, but
many su p p o rters d ran k enough to affect their m ood. At first excitem ent: later frustration.

The G athering Crowd
   57. Towards the end o f the m orning, fans gathered on an d a ro u n d th e bridge n ear the Leppings Lane
entrance. T hey seemed reluctant to enter the g ro u n d early. All tu rn stiles were o p e n at 12 noon an d o n e or two
as early as 11.30 am. S om e 53 police had been deployed to o p era te o u tsid e the tu rn stiles a n d in the Leppings
Lane area. They en qu ired at ran d o m w hether fans h ad tickets. T h o se who had not were advised to go away;
nevertheless, m any retu rn ed more than once. T hose w ho h ad tickets were guided in the right direction. T he
police tried to persuade th em to en ter the g ro u n d early. Officers, m ale a n d female, h ad been posted outside
each turnstile with the d u ty o f searching en tra n ts for w eapons, d rin k o r drugs. O n c e through the turnstile, an
entrant was liable to be searched again by o ne o f a serial o f officers p o s itio n e d ju s t inside.

   58. At ab o u t 12 noon C h ie f Inspector C reaser asked S u p e rin te n d e n t M urray w h eth er the pens on the west
terrace were to be filled om by one successively, bu t was told th a t they sh o u ! A al' be available from the start and
the fans should find their own level.

  59. By 2 pm it was ap p a re n t to those inside the grou n d an d those m on ito rin g events in the police a n d Club
control room s th a t the n u m b e r o f N o tting h am fans in their places greatly o u tn u m b e re d those from Liverpool.
The Kop and the south sta n d were filling u p steadily, b u t the north a n d west sta n d s were h alf empty. It was
noted ab o u t th at tim e th a t th e turnstile figures showed only 12.000 h ad en tered as against 20,000 at th e sam e
time the previous year. O n the west terraces, although pens 3 a n d 4 were filling, th e wing pens 1 ,2 ,6 a n d 7 were
nearly empty. At 2.15 p m a T annoy message asked fans in pens 3 a n d 4 to move forw ard an d m ak e ro o m for
others.

  60. T h ere h ad been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. T h is time, there was only one. It arrived
early, ju st before 2 pm. at Wadsley Bridge station. T h e 350 passengers were m e t by both m o u n te d an d foot
police officers who escorted them in a crocodile dow n Leppings Lane. They were orderly an d passed through
the turnstiles into the gro u n d by ab o u t 2.20 p m w ith o u t incident.

  61. By this tim e the police Traffic Div ision reported th a t the Liverpool routes were clear, so th e m ajo rity o f
Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. T he n u m b ers converging on the Leppings Lane e n tra n c e were
increasing rapidly. Between the perim eter gates an d the turnstiles th e crowd becam e congested. T h ere was no
longer a separate q ueue at each turnstile but a single p halanx filling th e whole ap p ro a ch area. T h e foot officers
outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone a n d h ad difficulty in searching even selectively.
M o u n te d officers in and o u tsid e the turnstile area were having difficulty m a n o eu v rin g in such a dense crowd.
T he police were besei by fans b em u sed by the ticket and turnstile labelling asking for directions. M any had
been d rin k in g but up to and ju st after 2.30 pm the m o o d rem a in e d good.

   62.      S u p e rin te n d e n t Marshall was on foot am o n g st the crowd. H e becam e anxious a b o u t the nu m b ers
co m in g dow n Leppings Lane a n d spilling out o n to the roadway w here buses an d cars were moving. At 2.17
pm he rad io e d to control to have m o to r traffic in Leppings L ane s topped. T h is was eventually d o n e at ab o u t
2.30 pm. U p to this time, d espite the large mass o u tsid e the turnstiles a n d the n u m b e rs still approaching, there
was still no p an ic in the crowd: no perception o f crisis by the police. In the control room M r Murray, w ho could
see Leppings Lane on the video, ad v ised M r D uckenfield th a t they w ould get everyone in by 3 pm. M r
D uckenfield reaffirm ed to h im the policy ab o u t a delayed kick-off. It would be o rdered only if there was som e
m a jo r external factor such as fog on th e P ennines o r delay on the m otorw ay: not if spectators merely tu rn e d up
late even in large numbers.

    63. In th e 20 m inutes from 2.30 pm to 2.50 p m there were crucial developm ents bo th inside a n d outside
the ground. In pens 3 an d 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as m ore fans ca m e through the tu n n e l to the
favoured area b eh in d the goal. By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
discom fort to m any well used to en d u rin g pressure on terraces. T h e n u m b ers at th at tim e were clearly in excess
o f the m a x im u m density stated by the H o m e Office G u id e to Safety at Sports G ro u n d s (1986 Edn) (the G reen
G u id e) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the G reen G u id e has no statu to ry or legal force, it is the
only official advice available ab o u t safety at sports grounds.) In th e wing pens 1. 2. 6 and 7. there was still
am ple room an d bare patches o f concrete were visible.

   64. M eanw hile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As more arrived at th e back the cru sh at the
front grew worse. Entry to th e turnstiles becam e m o re difficult. T h e ir efficiency was im p aired a n d th e ir rate
reduced. Arrivals at th e back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the b u ild -u p increased. T h e foot
officers o u tsid e were unable to function an d in d an g er them selves so they went through the turnstiles and out
again through gate C where they d id w hat they could to relieve pressure by the tu b u la r barrier. T h e m o u n ted
officers were su rro u n d e d by the dense mass o f people and becam e ineffective. S u p e rin te n d e n t M arshall was in
the m idst o f the turm oil. H e extricated h im self an d stood on a p ara p et o f the bridge to get a clear view. A
dru n ken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was throw n at a m o u n te d officer. But these were isolated acts by
individuals: the m enace c a m e from the massive nu m b ers single-m indedly d eterm in e d to be in for th e kick-off
with tim e ru n n in g out. At the back o f the crowd fans were fru stra ted by the lack o f progress as 3 o ’clock
approached. Some, mostly young men who h ad been drinking, trie d to push an d force their way forw ard. At
the front, people were ja m m e d together an d against the tu rn stile walls. Som e p an ick ed as th e pressure
intensified. S om e youngsters an d w om en were fainting and in distress. They were help ed out th ro u g h the
tubular b arrier by turnstile G o r were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans clim bed up a n d over the
turnstile b uilding o r on to th e d ividing fence. T h is was to escape th e crush rather th a n to gain free en try since
most o f th em h ad tickets.

   65. At 2.44 pm M r Marshall radioed for reinforcem ents, for the Tannoy to request the crow d to stop
pushing an d for a vehicle w ith loudspeaker e q u ip m e n t to com e a n d request the sam e. U nhappily. a t ab o u t 2.40
pm. radio co m m u n ic a tio n on channel 25 becam e defective. For a p e rio d o f two o r th ree m inutes the control
room lost contact. A co m m u n ic a tio n s officer cam e pro m p tly a n d sw itched to th e sta n d b y station. W ith the use
o f a han d set at control, contact was restored. D espite this hiatus, two o f M r M arshall’s requests were received.
The T annoy was used b u t w ith little effect. Reinforcem ents, in clu d in g m o u n ted officers from P en isto n e Road,
were sent. T h e th ird request, for a Landrover. was received direct by its d riv er PC Buxton who arriv e d at 2.46
pm and urged th e crowd by loudspeaker not to push. T his was no m ore effective th a n the Tannoy. T he
m ounted officers besieged near the turnstiles ca m e outside the p erim ete r gates. An a ttem p t was m a d e to shut
them against the crowd outside, to enable the th ro n g inside to be dispersed o r at least th in n ed th rough the
turnstiles. T h e pressure from without, however, op en e d the gates again. M o u n te d officers, now reinforced to
greater n um bers, form ed a cordon across the elbow o f Leppings L ane from the sweet sh o p to the bridge, again
with the o bject o f reducing pressure inside the gates. T hey were successful in this for so m e m in u tes despite
desperate ind iv id u als forcing their way u n der or between the horses. However, this exercise was o vertaken by a
more d ra m a tic relief o f the pressure.

“O pen the G a te s"
   66. Between 2.40 pm a n d 2.45 pm the crowd inside and o u tsid e the turnstile ap proach h ad swelled to
over 5.000. At the head o f th e phalanx co n d itio n s h ad become intolerable. T hose w ho got through were short
o f breath a n d sweating profusely. M any co m p lain ed to police officers on the conco u rse inside th e turnstiles
and asked th e m in forceful term s to do som ething. Exit gates A a n d B were being shaken. It was clear th e crowd
could n o t pass through the turnstiles by 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the L androver to control
asking th a t kick-off be p o stponed. T h e suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

  67. S u p erin te n d en t M arshall realised the crowd h ad become u n m anageable. A lthough loth to d o so, since it
was contrary to basic police strategy, he decid ed to request th e exit gates be o p en e d to relieve th e pressure.
Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. O th e r senior officers o u tsid e the g ro u nd agreed. At 2.47 pm he
radioed control to p erm it th e gates to be opened. At 2.48 p m , whilst M r D uckenfield was considering the
request, gate C o p en e d to eject a youth who had clim bed in w'ith no ticket. Im m ediately, fans o u ts id e took
advantage a n d ab o u t 150 m anaged to get in before a m ounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. M r
Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He rep eated it a th ird tim e, adding th a t if the
    gates were not opened som eone was going to be killed. In the control room . Mr D uckenfield had not m ad e a
    decision. Mr M u rray asked him "Are you going to open the gates?". M r D uckenfield gave th e o rd er an d Sgt
    G o d d a r d rad io ed to Mr Marshall “O p en the gates”. N eith er the C lub control room no r any police officers
    inside th e tu rn stiles were told o f this o rd e r before o r after it was given o r o f any action it w ould require.

       68. At 2.52 pm . gate C was o p en e d wide. Fans b eh in d tu rn stiles A to G and from the concourse beyond
    ca m e ro u n d to flow through it in large num bers.

       69. About tw o m inutes later the pressure o utside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, d esp ite the g atem a n ’s
    objection, for it to be opened. If it was not, he said, “ It’ll go a n d so m eo n e will get killed”. P erm ission was given,
    but this tim e reserve serials were alerted to m o n ito r the inrush tow ards the north stand. G a te B was also briefly
    o p e n e d against th e gatem an’s w ishes an d about 2 0 0 o f those pressed at turnstiles A to G g ain ed entry to their
    left.

       70. T h e largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five m inutes it was open ab o u t 2,000 fans passed
    th rough it steadily at a fast walk. Som e m ay have h a d tickets for the stands. N o doubt so m e h ad no tickets at all.
    T h e m ajority h ad tickets for the terraces. O f these, som e fou n d th e ir way either right to pen s 1 an d 2 o r left
    th ro u g h the d iv id in g wall to 6 an d 7. But a large p ro p o rtio n h ea d ed straight for the tunnel in front o f them.

   71. The initial influx through gate C. aug m en ted by en tra n ts via the turnstiles, cam e through the tunnel
with great m o m e n tu m . Fans spoke o f being swept through, feet o ff the ground. T h e 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
their progress. U po n reaching the crowded pens, som e wished to go back but were unable to d o so. T h e new
arrivals found them selves pushed forward a n d the pressure becam e intense. At 2.54 pm . shortly after this
influx began, th e team s came o nto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forw ard. M any were now
acutely, u nco m fo rtab le an d so m e were in distress. T h e m ass seethed ab o u t but voluntary' m o v em en t by any
individual was difficult: hands down could not be raised a n d so m e fans found it h a r d to breathe. Still the flow
continued thro u g h the tunnel causing further surges forward. T h e re were shouts for help an d for the gates to be
opened to th e pitch. Police officers on the p erim ete r track d id n o t im m ediately react. In th e deafening noise
from ch an tin g a n d shouting they d id not at first recognise the problem . Realisation ca m e at different m o m e n ts
to different officers in different places.

   72. G ate 3 spran g o p en u n d e r th e intense pressure from w ithin. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it spran g again; officers tried to shut it. T hose seeking to escape were urged an d p ushed back. G ate
4 was o p en e d by a policem an w ho n oticed the crushing. People began to spill out th rough it an d were directed
to the wing pen s where there was still am ple room . M eanwhile, gate 4 was closed again an d then re-opened. At
gate 3, a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his w ritten orders an d rad io ed for perm issio n to
open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it u p o n h im self to o pen it.

  73. Just before 3 pm, the m atch kicked off. At the sam e tim e, gate C. which h a d been closed at 2.57 pm.
was reo p en ed a n d a steady trickle con tin u ed to e n ter through the tunnel.

   74. To escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences o u t o f pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 an d 5. O th ers
tried to get over the front perim eter fence but were at first tu rn e d b ack by police w h o feared a pitch invasion.
Near the front, fans, m ostly youngsters, were w eakened to the point o f collapse an d in som e instances death but
they were held upright by pressure all round. F u rth e r back, m ost were so preoccupied w ith the pain o f being
pressed against barriers an d with breathing problem s that they saw noth in g o f the gam e. But at th e rear there
were m any who. although cram ped, were w atching the football unaw are o f the d istress at the front.

  75. At 3.04 pm . Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. T h ere was a ro ar from the
Liverpool fans an d at the sam e tim e a powerful surge forw ards in pen 3. T h e several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried th e pressure dow n the pens tow ards th e pitch. T h e force becam e such as to twist
and break two sp a n s o f a crush b arrier tow ards the front o f pen 3. T h e evidence does not establish with
certainty w hen this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm. But I am sure it occurred after
the influx fro m gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. W h en the b arrier broke those w h o m it had
supported were projected towards the p erim eter fence. M any fell an d the inv oluntary rush o f th o se b eh in d
pressed th em down. T h e crushing force was tran sm itted a n d dispersed so that all along the front o f pen 3 fans
were pressed h ard u p against the low wall and th e wire m esh o f the fence above it.

  76. In p en 4 no b a rrier broke. Nevertheless those at the front were crushed against wall an d fence. F u rth e r
back, two b a rriers were bowed and som e in d iv id u als su ccu m b ed to the pressure a r o u n d them.

   77. Surges on terraces are co m m o n . Usually, they go forw ard, th en recede. Here, w ith the weight o f
num bers, th e re was no receding. T h e pressure stayed an d for those crushed breathless by it. stan d in g o r prone,
life was eb bing away. If no relief cam e in four m inutes there w ould be irreversible brain dam age; if longer,
death.

  78. In th e control ro o m no-one n oticed the overcrow ding o r anything amiss in pens 3 a n d 4 until the first
fans spilt o u t o n to the p erim eter track just before kick-off. T hen, the officers in c o m m a n d assum ed that there
was an a tte m p te d pitch invasion. T hey called up reserve serials waiting in the g y m n a siu m and all available
officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was m ade to H Q for dog handlers.

   79. S u p e rin te n d e n t G reenw ood, the G ro u n d C o m m an d e r, was by the players' tunnel at the kick-off. He
noticed fans on the track and went to the west e n d b eh in d th e goal. As he approached, he d id not th in k the pens
overcrowded until he was very close an d saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
situation "retriev ab le" if those higher up the p en relieved the pressure. He climbed on the wall below the fence
and signalled w ith both hands to those b ehind to move back. O th e r officers jo in e d him . It was im possible.
Those fans who would have wished to com ply were powerless to do so. Behind them , there were still m any
u naw are o f the crisis, watching the game. The football co n tin u e d to jovous shouting and singing ro u n d the rest
o f th e ground while those crushed and trap p e d slowly expired.

   80.       W hen M r G reenw ood's signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for th e match to be
sto p p ed . At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arm s tow ards the control
box. M r D uckenfield sent M r M urray dow n from the box to have the m a tch slopped via the linesman, the
agreed em ergency drill. Before he could d o so. M r G reen w o o d ran over the pitch to the referee w ho stopped the
game. It was 5 : m inutes past 3.

                                                    TH E AFTERM ATH

Rescue Attempts
   81. From 3 o'clock, gates 3 a n d 4 h ad been open and rem a in e d so. At first, fans h ad walked o r staggered out
w inded and faint. But th e final surge at 3.04 pm . and the struggle to reach the o pen gates, caused a h o rren do u s
blockage o f bodies. T h e dead, the dying an d the desperate becam e interwoven in th e s u m p at th e front o f the
pens, especially by the gates. Those with strength left clam b ered over others subm erged in the h u m a n h eap and
tried to clim b out over the fence. They were now helped by police and o th e r fans w ho hauled th e m up a n d over.
N u m b ers o f fans were climbing over th e radial fences into adjacent pens. At th e back, m any were hauled up
into the west stan d to relieve the pressure.

   82. T h e steps from the su m p at gateways 3 and 4 were so congested with bodies live a n d d ea d that each had
to be prised from th e pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A n u m b e r o f individual
officers and fans w orked frantically to free those tra p p e d but the gateways were so narrow th a t only two or three
could get at the en tw in ed bodies Willing h an d s got in o n e an other's way. M o re officers arrived from the
gym nasium and elsewhere in the ground. Many used th e ir own initiative to help those laid o u t on the pitch, to
assist in getting o th ers over the fencing an d io com fort th e distressed. But so m e sto o d in groups near the
p erim eter fence not knowing what to do. T h e \ had been su m m o n ed in resp o n se to w hat was th o u g h t to be a
threat to public order. W h at they found was a hori ific scene o f carnage an d som e young officers were shocked
into im potence by w hat they saw.

  83. It was truly gruesome. The v ictim s were blue, cyanotic, incontinent; their m o u th s open , vomiting; their
eyes staring. A pile o f d e a d bodies lay an d grew o u tsid e gate 3. Extending fu rth e r a n d fu rth e r on to the pitch, the
injured were laid dow n a n d attem pts m ad e to revive them . M ore an d m o re walking su rv iv o rs flooded out on to
the pitch as the players left. The scene was em otive a n d chaotic as well as gruesom e. As th e en o rm ity o f the
disaster was realised, m any o f the fans milling ab o u t were b itter and hostile to th e police, b lam in g them for
what h ad h ap p en ed . Officers were confronted, abused, spat upon an d even assaulted. A small n u m b e r o f
hysterical fans h ad to be subdued.

  84. A dding to th e chaos, a n u m b er o f press p h o to g rap h ers dodged a b o u t am o n g rescue workers apparently
avid to secure p h o to g rap h s at point blank range o f those dying through th e wire mesh a n d th o se laid on the
pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them . Police had to intervene.

   85. At ab o u t 3.12 pm . Chief S u p erin te n d en t Nesbit. C o m m a n d e r o f the Traffic D iv isio n , arrived on the
pitch. He took charge at gate 3 a n d organised a chain o f officers to sim plify a n d ex p ed ite th e extraction o f
casualties from the pen. In the absence o f any m echanical m eans, police an d fans together pulled a n d worked
at the wire mesh w ith their bare h an d s and their feet to breach the fencing. T h ey succeeded in bo th pens,
enabling officers to get in and fans to be got out.

   86. By now. so m e officers of th e ir own initiative went round from the pitch to the tu n n el w here they met
oth er officers from th e tu rn stilesa n d th e west stand. Together, they tried to persu ad e f a n s a t th e rear o f the pens
to go back through the tunnel. Som e com plied, but m any resisted, w ishing to stan d th e ir ground. Casualties
were brought o u t through the tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
further in and b rin g o u t more casualties, dead and alive. T h ey were laid on the gro u n d in th e conco u rse outside
the tunnel a n d a tte m p ts were made to re\ i ve them.

First Aid
  87. T he St Jo h n A m bulance Brigade had som e 30 personnel posted ro u n d the g ro u n d for the m atch - 25
adults and 5 ju n io r cadets. They were quickly on the scene when the first casualties em erged an d sought to
revive them . T h e ir D ivisional S u p erin te n d en t. M r Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help th o se pressed against the
fencing by feeding oxygen to them through the mesh until they could be got out.

  88. D r Purcell. Sheffield W ednesday's doctor, cam e from his seat in the south s ta n d and attem p ted
resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he moved from patien t to p atien t d oing w hat he could,
but in most cases it was too late.

  89. At 3.13 p m a St John's a m b u lan c e cam e o n to the pitch at the north-east co rn e r a n d drove to the
perim eter fence close to gate 3. T h ere was no call for doctors and nurses on the public ad d ress system until
nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the m in u tes ticked past, som e o f th e m cam e o n to th e pitch to help o f their
own accord when they saw the casualties and the am b u lan c e and realised the gravity o f the situation. Ma
fans also worked prodigiously in a tte m p ts to revive the dead and the dying, in som e cases their own relati'
and friends. Artificial respiration, m o u th to m o u th respiration and card iac massage were applied by th e skill
an d the unskilled b ut usually in vain. T hose capable o f survival mostly ca m e round o f their own accord. T
rest were mostly d o o m e d before they could be brought o ut a n d treated.

    90. T here was an urgent need to get casualties o f f the pitch and to hospital. There were six stretchers in tl
first aid room and three in the St J o h n ’s am b u lan ce. T h ey were quickly brought in to use. Then th e f'ai
im provised by tearing down the hoard in g s around the edge o f the pitch an d against the sta n d s so th a t lengths c
b o ard could be used as stretchers. Im provising in this way. p arties o f fans a n d police ran repeatedly the lengt
o f th e pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A n u m b e r were d ea d on arrival there.

In th e Control Room
   91. M r D uckenfield stayed in the control room. C h ie f Inspector M c R o b b ie was there in civilian clothes a
an observer. M r Duckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policew om an at gate 1 to a d m it thos»
displaced from the centre pens. M r D uckenfield d id not realise there were injuries until he saw so m eo n e laic
o n th e pitch. Even then, he d id not realise the n atu re o f the problem o r its scale.

  92. M r M urray returned from his a ttem p t to stop the m atch and M r D uckenfield se n t him down again tc
clear the pitch a n d assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. T h is was
because M r Duckenfield could not from th e control ro o m see clearly w hat was h ap p e n in g for the milling and
increasing num bers.

   93. T h e Assistant C h ie f C onstable (Operations). M r Jackson, had a tte n d e d the m atch in civilian clothes as
a guest o f th e Club. H e cam e from his seat in the south stan d to ask w hat h ad happened. M r D uckenfield was
u n ab le to say: he d id n o t tell M r Jackson that the exit gates h ad been o p en e d o n his authority. M r Jackson went
d ow n to the pitch to discover the situation.

   94. At 3.06 p m Mr D uckenfield. still prim arily co n cern ed ab o u t public order, caused a message to be sent
to H e a d q u arte rs asking for O p eratio n S upport. T h at was a call for all a vailable ad d itio n a l police resources to
co m e to the g ro u n d to strengthen the police presence.

   95. M r Jackson was told by M r G reenw ood that there were casualties a n d retu rn ed im m ed iately to control
to m a k e sure emergency services were alerted. M eanw hile. M r M urray h ad seen the plight o f those behind the
fence. H e rad io ed to control that a fleet o f am b u lances was required. H e also asked for a Tannoy broadcast to
th o se in the pens to move back but there is n o clear ev id en ce th a t it was m ade.

   96. O nly when M r Duckenfield received the request for a fleet o f a m b u lan c es d id he realise the nature and
gravity o f the situation. T hen, su p p o rted by M r Jackson, he caused messages to be sent co n v ertin g O peration
S u p p o rt into calls for the M ajo r D isaster Plan.

N o Information
   97. A part from the message to clear the pitch and th e belated call for m edical assistance about 3.30 pm , no
in fo rm atio n o r advice was b roadcast on the public ad d ress system. M r D uckenfield feared that the crowd
m ight tu rn hostile o r might all a ttem p t to leave together thereby h am p erin g the em ergency services if they were
given in fo rm atio n a b o u t what h ad h ap p e n ed . T he result was th at apart from those close en o u g h at the west end
to see the terrible truth for themselves, the majority o f the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
N o ttin g h a m supporters in the Kop, still thought there h ad been a pitch invasion o r o th e r m isb eh av io u r by
L iverpool fans. T h ey con tin u ed singing and chanting incongruously. T h is infuriated som e Liverpool fans who
were already distraught. A few began to run towards th e K op end. T he police feared violence might result on
to p o f th e existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large n u m b e r o f officers to form a line across the
w idth o f th e pitch a t the Kop en d an d ad vance up to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
m oved. T h ere the line stood as an insurance against d is o rd e r b u t d oing nothing. O th e r officers were posted to
the p e rim e te r track facing the n o rth sta n d fo r the sam e p urpose. To those distressed a n d distraught who
w an ted urgent actio n , this large contingent o f passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
intensified.

 M isinform ation
    98. At ab o u t 3.15 pm , M r G ra h a m Kelly. C h ief Executive o f the FA. M r K irton also o f the FA an d M r
 G r a h a m Mackrell. Secretary o f Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for inform ation. M r
 D uckenfield told th e m he thought there were fatalities a n d the gam e was likely to be ab a n d o n e d . He also said a


                                                                16

  99. About 3.30 pm there was a further m eeting in th e C lu b ’s b o ard ro om . M r D uckenfield went there anc
met M r Kelly, the referee an d representatives o f th e three clubs. ACC Jackson was also there. Mi
Duckenfield indicated the m atch was likely to be ab a n d o n e d although no firm r uling was given. He a d d e d that
he did not want people to know it was to be a b a n d o n e d lest the dispersing crow d h a m p e r the emergency
operations.

Public A nnouncem ents
   100. L ater the m anagers o f the tw o teams were asked to go to the control room . T h ey were invited there to
make a public a n n o u n c em en t to calm the crowd. M r Kenny Dalglish agreed to d o so. He told the crowd that
there were problem s an d asked th e m to assist th e police a n d those rendering first aid. H e asked fo rc a lm an d his
message was well received. It was th en 3.56 p m . At 4.10 p m it w’as an n o u n c e d th a t the m atch was a b a n d o n e d
for that day. Again that message was received calmly by th e crowd m ost o f w h o m b ehaved responsibly as they
dispersed.

Fire Brigade
   101. M eanw hile the em ergency services h ad been in action. At ab o u t 3.10 p m a request cam e from the
perim eter fence to control for bolt croppers to cu t the wire mesh. Sergeant G o d d a rd co n tac ted the police garage
close by w ith o u t success. At 3.13 p m . PC Bichard requested H e a d q u a rte rs to call the fire service to bring
hydraulic c u ttin g eq u ip m en t to the Leppings Lane entrance.

   102. T h ere was no arran g em ent for a fire o fficer to be present d u rin g the m a tc h . However, the M ajor
Disaster Plan required all em ergency services to be alerted. After 'p h o n e messages which m u st be described
later, fire appliances arrived at b o th Leppings L ane an d P en isto n e Road at 3.22 p m . At b o th entrances their
arrival surprised police who were u n in form ed as to w hy they had b een called o r w here they s h o uld go.

   103. At Leppings Lane a police Inspector to ld Station O fficer Swain "I do n 't really th in k we need you” .
A nother police officer then asked for m ore resuscitators as people were dying so M r Swain rad ioed for ten fire
appliances. Each carries oxygen a n d resuscitation eq u ip m en t.

   104. At the Kop end. Leading F irem an Housley arrived with an em ergency te n d e r and S tation O fficer

resuscitation eq u ip m en t. They rendered help there an d later at the g y m n asiu m . M r F letch er a n d his m en ran
along behind the south stand carrying cutting e q u ip m e n t a n d oxygen cylinders. W h e n they arrived at the
fence, the cutting eq u ip m en t was not required as by then the last o f the d e a d an d injured were being rem oved
from the pens. M r F letcher set up a casualty clearing area u n d e r the police box a n d firem en assisted in carrying
victims as well as rendering first aid on th e pitch.

South Yorkshire M etropolitan A m bulance Service (S Y M A S )
   105. Before 1986 there had been no SYMAS representative routinely present at H illsborough matches. T h e
Club was content, as indeed are m any o th e r clubs, to rely upon the St J o h n ’s A m bulance Brigade an d a 999 call
if necessary. F ro m 1986 onwards, after representations, the C lu b p rovided two seats in the so u th stan d for
SYMAS staff at League matches. At o ne stage it was suggested they would be best placed in th e north stan d
close to the gy m n asiu m which h ad been designated as the casualty centre in the event o f a m a jo r incident. T h e
south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYMAS staff closer to the players’ tu n n el sh o u ld a player be
injured. These seats were, however, not available at C u p semi-finals. SYMAS representatives nevertheless
attended at the sem i-finals by arran g em en t with the police in 1988 an d again in 1989. T h e SYMAS officers
stood on the r a m p leading to the pitch at the north-east corner. They h ad on e am b u lan ce outside the ground
and one on standby.

   106. O n 15 April 1989, Officers Higgins and Eason were at th e ground w ith an am b u lan ce and crew. T hey
noticed fans on th e track and went to the Leppings L ane en d whilst the game was still in progress. T hey began
to attend to casualties. Meanwhile, at 2.59 pm. there h ad been a call from Police C onstable W augh at police


                                                                         17
H ea d q u a rte rs to the Hillsborough police control asking if am bulances were required. This was on the
instruction o f C 'h ie fln sp ec to r E d m u n d so n who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise a n d snatches of speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no reports o f injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
g ro u n d tha t there might be injuries, police H eadquarters notified SYMAS th a t am bulances m ight be required
T hen, seconds later. M r M urray's request for a fleet o f am bulances was relayed to SYMAS. They reacted at
once. A m bulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entra n ce at 3.13 pm a n d at the Penistone Road
en tra n c e at 3.17 pm. In all. som e 42 am bulances a tten d e d . 31 o f th e m from SYMAS a n d 11 from
neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm , they had conveyed so m e 172 casualties to the N o rth e rn General
H ospital a n d the Royal H allam shire Hospital.

Gymnasium
   107. T h e gym nasium had been in use for serving meals to the police. W h e n the M ajor D isaster Plan was
ordered, it was cleared a n d d ivided into two. O ne e n d b ec am e a temporary m o rtu a ry : the o th e r was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed a n d im provised, brought in m ore a n d more
casualties, the scene was initially a n d inevitably chaotic a n d harrowing. T here was intense distress amongst
the in ju re d a n d bereaved: relatives were reluctant to be p a rte d from the dea d a n d sought to revive them . There
were people looking for missing friends a n d relations; the re were recrim inations, there were scuffles. Some of
those involved were the worse for drink. D octors a n d nurses h ad followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to atte n d the injured as best they could in the adverse circum stances. T hose in m ost urgent need of
hospital tre a tm e n t were taken to am b u lan c es as they arrived, triage being em ployed to d e te rm in e priorities.
D octors were requested by the police to exam ine each person thought to be deceased to c o n firm a n d certify
death. A police C onstable was detailed to atte n d a n d g uard each o f the d e a d a n d a photograph o f each was
taken by a police p h otographer so that relatives com ing to identify bodies could be spa re d the ordeal of
searching am ongst all who had died.

The Dead and the Injured
    108. O f the 95 w ho died, the evidence suggests tha t at least 16 a n d probably 21 cam e through gate C after it
o p en e d at 2.52 p m . T hat is established by the statem ents o f relatives an d frien ds w ho cam e through with them
but survived.

    109. By co m m e n d a b le h ard work, a team o f pathologists headed by Professor U sh e r com pleted
p o st-m o rte m e x a m in a tio n s on all the deceased w ithin 48 hours. T hey found th a t 88 o f the victim s were male
a n d seven female. Thirty-eight were u nder 20 years o f age, 39 were between 20 a n d 29 years a n d only three were
over 50. In virtually every case the cause o f death was crush asphyxia due to com pression o f the chest wall
against o th e r bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all but n in e cases th a t was the sole cause.
In one. pressure on the chest h a d been so great as to ru p tu re the aorta : in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck or chest: in the rem aining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. T hirteen o f those were rib fractures. However, one was a fractured femur, one a fractured
r a ^ 'u s a n d the rem aining three involved fractures o f bones or cartilages ro u n d the voice box. These injuries
s .. st the v ictim s m ay have been tro d d en while on the ground.

    110. Blood sam ples were taken from the dead. N o alcohol was found in any o f the females. O f the males. 5 1
h a d n o m ore than 10 milligrams per cent in their blood which is negligible: 15 h a d over 80 m illigram s per cent
a n d six over 120 milligrams per cent.

  111. A lthough the great m ajority o f those w ho died were in pen 3. at least five were in pen 4. M ost deaths
occurred at the front o f the pens but there were a few fatalities further back.

   112. In all. som e 730 people co m plained o f being injured inside the ground a n d 36 o utside it. O f the 730,
a bout 30% are thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm. T he largest category o f injury was
brursing. especially to the ribs a n d chest.

           113. I have given my findings as to the basic factual background a n d the main sequence of events in
        narrative form. There was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to som e tim ings and num bers.
        Indeed, the consistency of the evidence has been a rem arkable feature o f this Inquiry. T he experiences o f most
        witnesses were unforgettable a n d no d oubt the early hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
        existence o f tim e d v ideos and ph o to g rap h s a n d o f logged and ta p e d messages provided reliable checks by
        which to pro m p t a n d test witness recollection. Accordingly. I have n o t for the most part b u rd en e d the narrative
        with citations from the evidence o f individual witnesses.

            114. However, there were several instances o f detailed evidence a n d assertions being highlighted by the
’       media in d ra m a tic a n d em otive te rm s during the hearing. Since som e o f those m uc h-publicised incidents gave
         rise to unfair criticism, they ought to be the subject o f specific findings. I have therefore dealt with them

grossly overcrowded. They were unco m fortably overcrow ded by 2.50 pm at least to a degree which requirt

                                  T H E LAYOUT AT T H E L E P P I N G S LA NE E N D

  118. 1 have already observed that the layout o f the turnstile area, o f the terraces and o f the concourse
between th em was the result o f piecemeal changes. A brief history o f these changes is now necessary-.


The History
   119. Before 1965, the Leppings Lane en d consisted entirely o f terracing like the Kop. In th a t year, the west
stand was built a n d the terraces rem aining in front o f it were tru n c a te d to their present depth, front to back. As
to width, they consisted o f a single standing area with no d iv id in g fences. D u rin g th e early 1970’s, hooliganism
an d pitch invasions m a d e it necessary to prevent access to th e playing area a n d the p e rim e te r fences were
therefore erected in 1977.


   120. Section 1 o f th e Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Act 1975 em pow ered the Secretary o f State to designate a
sports sta d iu m having, in his opinion, ac co m m o d atio n for m ore than 10,000 as a sta d iu m requiring a
certificate from the local authority. H illsborough was so designated with effect from I J a n u a r y 1979 by SI
1978/1091. In anticip atio n o f that date. Sheffield Wednesday instructed E astw ood a n d Partners, a firm o f
consulting engineers, to act on the ir beh a lf especially in th e ir dealings with th e local authority. D r Eastwood,
the principal o f the firm , is a highly experienced civil an d structural engineer a n d has advised several m a jo r
football clubs. H e rec om m e nded that a n u m b e r o f ad ditional crush barriers should be a d d e d since those
already in place were insufficient to comply with the G reen G u id e (1976 edition). T h a t work was approved
and carried out d u ring 1979.


  121. T h e relevant local auth o rity at the tim e was the S outh Yorkshire C oun ty C ouncil. It set u p an Officer
Working Party consisting o f representatives o f the police, the fire service, its own building surveyor’s division
and its own legal a n d ad m in istra tio n d e p a rtm e n t. The Working Party m ade in s p e c tio n sa n d consulted with the
Club a n d D r E astwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 D ecem ber 1979 for a n indefinite p eriod. It has
remained in force ever since an d has not been am ended.


   122. Schedule 3 o f the certificate sets out th e m a x im u m crowd capacity for vario u s areas in t h e ground. T he
figure for the west terrace is 7.200 a n d for the north-west terrace 2,900. These figures were in te n d e d to be in
accordance with the G reen G u id e (1976). Paragraph 15.4 prov ided for a m a x im u m “p ack ing density" of
between 54 a n d 27 persons p e r 10 square m etres depending on the condition o f the terrace. D r Eastwood h ad
calculated 8.000 for the west terrace on the basis o f 54 per 10 square metres. H e thought this a ju stified starting
figure in view o f his im proved system o f barriers. However, he reduced it to 7.200 because there were no
gangways on the terrace a n d he d id not think it feasible to p ro v id e any. So. the total figure for the Leppings Lane
terraces was a n d is 10 . 100.


The 1981 Semi-Final
   123. As already m entioned, there was crushing at the C u p semi-final in 1981. T he m atch was betw een
T ottenham H o ts p u r a n d W olverham pton Wanderers. T h e police debriefing m inutes after the incident
prophetically refer.


  “to the late arrival o f a large n u m b e r o f spectators w h o were still waiting to enter the L eppings L ane
  enclosure w hen the m atch started. T he flash p o in t occurred w hen T ottenham sc ore d” (at the K o p end) “after
  only three m inutes. T h e spectators just entering pushed forw ard to see w hat was h ap p e n in g a n d caused a
  crush, which resulted in the injuries".


   124. T hose being crushed called for the p erim eter gates to be opened on to the track. T h e re was n o
im mediate reaction, according to M r Vaux w ho was there, b u t fortunately a police Inspector gave instructions
and the gates were then opened. A bout 250 cam e out onto the track. T h ere were broken arms, legs a n d ribs a n d
38 were treated either in hospital or by the St Jo h n A m bulance Brigade. It is clear from the d o c u m e n ts (a) tha t
the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure o f 10.100 h a d been exceeded by over 400 (b) t h a t the police
shut off further access to the terraces because o f crushing, a n d (c) the police view after the event was tha t the
capacity figure o f 10,100 in the Safety Certificate was too high. T his latter view was c o m m u n ic a te d to t h e C lu b
by the C h ief S u p erinte ndent then in c o m m a n d o f F Division but it was not p ursued.
T hree Pens
    125. A fter this incident in April 1981 the police requested tha t the terrace should be d iv id ed into sections.
The object was to improve crowd control by reducing sideways m ovem ent. D ivision w ould enable m ore even
d istrib u tio n to be effected when there was a capacity crowd. It would also enable the west end to be used for
both hom e a n d away supporters w ho could be segregated in separate pens, if necessary with an em pty pen
between them .

     126. T h is proposal was agreed by the Club a n d the Officer W orking Party an d was ap proved by the local
authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in N o vem ber 1981. They are the fence now separating pens
2 a n d 3 a n d tha t now separating 5 a n d 6. T he result was to div id e the whole terrace into three pens. Access from
th e concourse to the m iddle pen was through th e tunnel a n d to the wing pens roun d the sides o f the west stand.
D r E astw ood suggested a n d illustrated an altered layout which w ould have provided separate access through
separate banks o f turnstiles to the no rth stand, to each e n d o f the west stand, an d to each o f the three pens.
Whilst the m a in object o f this was segregation, such a layout w ould have e nabled each o f those areas to be
m o n ito re d num erically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its m a x im u m capacity was not exceeded. T h e plan was
n o t ad o p ted . T h e m axim um capacity for the new centre p en w as calculated at 2.200. but n o alteration was
m a d e to the Safety Certificate so to limit it n o r was there an y m e a n s mechanically o f counting the n u m b e rs
going into th a t pen.

T he 1985 C hanges
    127. By 1985. Sheffield W ednesday had been p ro m o te d to the First Division a n d was draw ing larger
crowds. T h e im p ro v e m e n t o f the Leppings Lane e n d was raised again by the Club a n d D r Eastwood prepared a
n u m b e r o f draw ings. These illustrated various schem es for achieving segregation by p roviding more turnstiles
in separate b a n k s an d divisions o f the concourse. T h e police w anted further divisions o f the terrace itself,
again to im prove control a n d segregation. T here was m uc h discussion o f these sc hem e s which included
suggestions o f 29 a n d even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, the following a lteratio ns were carried out in
1985.

New Radial Fences
   128. O n th e terraces, two m ore radial fences were fitted. O n e d iv id ed the existing central pen into the
prese nt pens 3 a n d 4. G ates were fitted at the m o u th o f the tu n n e l to enable each o f those pens to be closed off.
T h e second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. U ntil
those two fences were add ed there existed only peri m e te r gates 1 .2 .4 . 5 a n d 6. T h e creation o f pen 3 required a
new gate 3 to b e fitted which was done.

Barriers
    129. T h e lines o f the new radial fences ran across existing crush barriers so that w ithout m odification those
b arriers would have run through the fencing. T h e police considered the barriers w ould be used by fans as
conv e n ie n t m o u n tin g points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating the ir object. They therefore wished
spans to be rem oved from the barriers. H ad the ir wishes been m et in full the result w ould have been an
u n im p e d e d run in pen 3 from the m o u th o f the tunnel down the south side o f the new fence to the perim eter. D r
Eastwood dug his heels in against that proposal which he rightly regarded as dangerous. H e d id however agree
to som e m o d ific atio n to the m iddle row o f barriers in the newly created pen 3. chiefly to facilitate access.
Likewise in the new pen 5. T h e 1985 m odifications to the p e n s a r e shown on the plan A p p en d ix 4.

The Turnstiles and Concourse
    130. At the e n tra n ce , m odification but no increase in n u m b e r was m a d e at the turnstiles. T h e b ank 1 to 16
was d iv id ed from A to G by the m etal fence now in place an d th a t d ivision was projected across the concourse
inside the turnstiles in the form o f a brick wall. A personnel gate was p rovided for access through that wall but
was enlarged to its present size at the request o f the police. T hose a ltera tio n s were m a d e in the interests o f
segregation. T he m o re elaborate d ivisions which D r Eastw ood h ad suggested, giving se p arate access to each
sub-division o f th e ac co m m o d atio n , were not p u rsu ed for financial reasons. In May 1985 the Bradford
d isaster occurred. T h e south stand at H illsborough h ad w ooden decking a n d th e C lub realised it would have to
u n d e rta k e expensive remedial works there. T he cantilever ro o f o f the sam e stand was also discovered to
require expensive repairs.

    131. In fact, shortly after the new dividing fence a n d wall had been built at the Leppings Lane entrance an d
concourse, the C lub, by agreement with C h ie f S u p erin te n d en t Mole, ceased to a c c o m m o d ate ho m e supporters
a t the Leppings L ane end. There was therefore no longer any n ee d for segregation at th a t end, but the wall
rem ained.
   132. Also in 1985. electronic c ounting e q u ip m e n t was installed at all turnstiles. T h is conveyed the running
count for each bank of turnstiles, for exam ple A to G. to a television screen in the Club control room where the
figures were displayed. In 1986. an electronic eye was installed in each turnstile b o oth to catch and record
anyone who clim bed over the turnstile.

Barrier 144
   133. In J u n e I 986. the police requested that th e crush barrier nearest to the tunnel at the entrance to pens 3
and 4 should be rem oved to assist the flow o f fans into the pens. T hey found it caused o b struction because it
was in a good viewing position a n d spectators liked to stand against it in t i m b e r s th e re b y blocking access by
others further into the pens. T he police also suggested it m ight h a m p e r effective evacuation through the tunnel
especially in an emergency. D r E astw ood considered the pros a n d cons o f this proposal a n d accepted the police
view. T he O fficer W orking Party approved the proposal at a m eeting on 7 August 1986 on site. A uthority was
given then a n d there by M r Bownes on b ehalf o f the Sheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility
for the Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council on I April 1986. Two spans o f the b a rrie r were
therefore removed, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on A ppendix 4.

Effects of the Layout
   134. T he result o f these changes was to divide the terrace into a n u m b e r o f small areas w ithout providing
any co m puterised o r m echanical m eans o f limiting entry num erically into any one a re a i f all areas were open
for choice. Before the fences an d pens h ad divided the terrace, the overall figure o f 10.100 could be m onitore d
via the turnstiles a n d in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was n o t possible strictly to
ensure com pliance with Schedule 3 Part 1 o f the Safety C ertificate which prescribed a m a x im u m o f 2.900 for
the north-west terrace a n d 7.200 for the west terrace. P aragraph 3 o f Schedule 2 o f th e Safety Certificate
provides:

  "T h e n u m b e r o f spectators ad m itted to the S tadium a n d to the several areas o f sp e c ta to r a c co m m o d atio n
  within the S tad iu m shall not exceed the figures specified in Part I o f Schedule 3".

  T he C lub had to rely upon visual monitoring.

   135. T he situ atio n becam e worse however with the division o f the west terrace in to pens. N o t only were
there m ore an d sm aller discrete areas but some were likely to attract m o re th a n their a p p r o p r ia te share o f the
 10.100 total. It is well recognised tha t the area b eh in d the goal is very popular. Moreover, th e p o sition o f the
tunnel vis-a-vis the turnstiles A t o G . its labelling a n d the absence o f signposts advertising th e wing pens would
draw to it those w ith terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely that pens 3 an d 4 w ould fill to capacity a n d
indeed exceed it unless preventive steps were taken. H ad D r E astw ood's plan for se p arate turnstile access to
separate sections with separate toilet an d refreshment facilities been im plem en te d , total c o m p u te rise d control
could have been kept.
                                                                        CHAPTER 8

     136. In 1981. w hen th e terrace w as d i v i d e d int o th r e e areas. D r E a s t w o o d gave the C l u b the figure of 2.200
c a p a c i ty for th e ce n tr e p en. H e b as e d th is o n ih e G r e e n G u i d e , m a k i n g such al low anc es as h e t h o u g h t right. N o

were in use wer e filled sequentially, b u t n o t othe rwi se.

   137. After the 1985 changes. D r Eastwood did not h im self give any figures for the new pens 3 and 4.
S om eo n e on his staff however split the figure 2.200 into 1,200 for pen 3 a n d 1.000 for pen 4. T hose figures did
not even take account o f the fact th a t pen 5 had been carved out o f pen 4 w hich was b o u n d to have a reducing
effect on capacity. Nevertheless, th e figures o f 1.200 a n d 1,000 were put on a draw ing e m an a tin g from
Eastw ood a n d Partners a n d the figures have been notionallv regarded since as applicable by the C lub and the
police. They are in fact too high.

    138. D r Nicholson, at the Research an d Laboratory Services D ivision o f the H ealth a n d Safety Executive,
h a s calculated that the figures for pens 3 a n d 4 respectively would be 1.015 a n d 1,036 if the strength and
spacing o f the crush barriers had com plied with the G reen G u ide. But they d id not.

Departures from the Green Guide
    139. In pen 3, four out o f five gaps in the lines o f crush barriers do n o t c onform with paragraph 115 o f the
G re e n G u id e (1986). In pen 4. nine out o f ten do not conform . In particular, the spans taken out o f the barriers
in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess o f the m a x im u m o f 1.4 m etres prescribed. O n e gap was 57% w id e rth a n
th e G re e n G u id e m axim um . Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from the m o uth o f t he tunnel to the
b a r r ie r w hich collapsed. D r Eastwood justified these larger gaps by the absence o f gangways. Fans had to be
ab le to get in a n d out a n d standard gaps te nded to get blocked up. T h e effect o f his reasoning was that the
ab sen c e o f gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice o f a second safety feature,
n am ely gaps o f strictly lim ited width.

     140. Again, the removal o f barrier 144 was bound, as D r Eastwood conceded, to affect capacity. In fact it
d i d m o re, as I shall indicate later.

    141. C apacity should also have taken account o f two fu rth e r departures from the G reen G uide. If. as was
th e case, the p erim ete r gates were not regarded as exits, som e 40% o f those in pens 3 an d 4 were more than 12
m e tr e s from an exit (and there was no gangway) contrary to th e aim o f paragraph 96. Four out o f fine o f the
crush b arriers in pen 3 a n d six out o f nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
were the old barriers which had been repaired an d plated w here the ir bases h a d corroded a n d fresh concrete
h a d b ee n applied, raising the level o f the steps. T h e point is not a c ad e m ic since, in the event, m any fans were
b e n t painfully over barriers u n d er great pressure.

   142. D r N icholson calculated tha t w hen all relevant factor* regarding the configuration a n d the Green
G u id e are taken into account, the m a x im u m capacity for pen . jltf h ave been 822 an d for pen 4 .8 7 1 .

Safety Certificate
   143. W hatever should have been th e m a x im u m capacities for pens 3 a n d 4, th e fact is that n o figures at all in
respect o f th e m were put into the Safety Certificate. D espite all the changes in layout o f the fences an d barriers,
the two figures, 2,900 for the north-west terrace an d 7.200 for the west terrace, have rem ained as the only
m a x im a with which the Club has to comply.

   144. Section 2(1) o f the Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Act 1975 provides (so far as is relevant):

   "A Safety Certificate shall contain such term s an d co n d itio n s as the local auth o rity c o n sid er necessary o r
   e x p e d i e n t to se cu re re a s o n a b le safety at the s t a d i u m w h e n it is in u s e ..

   Section 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):

   " W i t h o u t p r e j u d ic e to su b- sec ti on ( I ) ab ov e, a Safety C e r t i f i c a t e -
   (a) shall specify the m a x im u m n u m b e r o f spectators to be ad m itte d to the stadium :
   (b) m a y sp eci fy th e m a x i m u m n u m b e r to be a d m i t t e d to d if fe re nt pa rts o f it;
   (c) shall include term s a n d c o n d itio n s-
   ... (iii) as to th e n u m b e r , st rength a n d s i tu a t io n o f a n y c ru s h b arr ier s. "



                                                                                 24
S ection 2(2)      was repealed by t h e Fire Safety and Safety o f Places of S port Act 1 9 8 7 . section 1 9 , which
gave      power to the Secretary of State to lay down, by order, term s and conditions. No o rd e r has yet been
made a n d guidance from the H om e Office has rec om m e nded local au th o ritie s to a p p ro a ch their
function u n d er section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2 ( 2 ) . (See H om e
O f f i c e C ircular 7 1 / 1 9 8 7 dated 25 N ovem ber 1 9 8 7 . Annex A, paragraph 6 . )


  145. It is clear that when the certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire C ounty Council went
further than sim ply to fix the m a x im u m n um bers for the whole S tadium . T hey prescribed figures for
each part o f the ground not merely by the four points o f the com pass but by specified sections.

   146. Section 8(1) o f the 1975 Act requires the h olde r o f the certificate before carrying out any
proposals to alter o r extend the stadium o r any o f its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
operation to give notice o f those proposals to the local authority. T h a t obligation is specifically
repeated in Sheffield Wednesday's certificate at Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2), T h e C lub com plie d with
the requirem ent. H aving received notice o f the alterations to the p en s a n d the barriers, the local
authority ought, in my view, to have a m e n d e d the Safety Certificate accordingly. They did not d o so.

Why was the Safety Certificate not Amended?
  147. Although D r Eastwood acknowledged tha t the various changes to the layout would have had
an effect on capacity, he d id not take active steps to see that ap propriate a m e n d m e n ts were m ade. He
says he m entioned from tim e to tim e th a t the alterations would have a n effect on capacity a n d that he
did not realise the Safety Certificate was not regularly updated. However. 1 find two m e m o r a n d a in
early 1987 highly significant. D r Eastwood's assistant M r Strange was concerned with q ueries from
the FA as to H illsborough’s capacity for a semi-final. M r Strange recorded these questions in a
mem orandum :-

 “ Has any account been taken for alterations d one on Leppings Lane over the last few seasons? Is th e 10.200
 or so figure still correct? I said that in m y o pinion it needs to be adjusted, b etter do it now than later."

  148. M r Strange's next m e m o (a few days later) records as follows:-

  " D r Eastwood says leave the capacity a t Leppings Lane end as it is. providing police have gates u n d e r West
  stand o pen so that people can distribute throug hout the terrace evenly."

Although he says the last nine words d o not report him accurately. D r E astw ood accepts the rest o f that
message.

   149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought to have been reviewed and
altered. T h e u n happy situation is that the police believed even the overall figure o f 1 0.100 to be too high as far
back        '? 1 . T h at was reported to the C lu b but ap paren tly not to D r Eastv"'^^. M eanwhile, that global figure
had b>^>. rendered acad e m ic by the sub-division o f t he terrace w hich was            tV   A in the Gaiety Certificate
at all. If p ro p e r m a x im u m figures had been inserted in th e certificate for each o f the pens, the Club and the
police might well have been prom pted to find some m eans o f lim iting the n u m b e rs entering those pens other
than by visual m onitoring. T his could have been d o n e by im plem enting one o f D r E astw ood’s plans fo r totally
separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It could have been d o n e by insisting on sequential filling o f pens at
all m atches: alternatively, by counting fans into each viewing area.

The City Council
  150. T h a t the Safety Certificate was not a m e n d e d a n d individual capacities not reviewed c a n n o t be laid
solely at D r Eastwood's door. He was. afte r all. consulta nt engineer to the C lub a n d responsibility for the
certificate was that o f the local authority. W hen the S outh Yorkshire C o u n ty C ouncil h a n d e d over to the
Sheffield City Council, the latterdelegated all its powers a n d duties u nder the 1975 Act to its G eneral Purposes
Panel. Apparently, therefore, the decision-m aking body on beh a lf o f the C ouncil was that Panel, although two
specific functions were delegated to the H ea d o f A d m in istratio n and Legal D e p a rtm e n t - the power to issue a
prohibition u n d e r section lO o f th e 1 9 7 5 Act a n d the power o f entry and search u n d e r section 11 o f the Act.

  151. In practice. M r Bownes. the C o u n c il's C h ie f Licensing Officer in the A dm in istration a n d Legal
D epartm ent, bore the b ru n t o f th e C o u n c il’s duties u n d e r the Act.
    152. T he Officer Working Party was superseded by a Safety o f Sports G ro u n d s Advisory G roup, but
apart from the change of the nam e the system continued as before. M r Bownes a tten d e d the inspections
and meetings of the Advisory G ro u p together with the representatives o f the police, the fire service, the
d e p a rtm e n t o f health and co n su m er services, an d the building engineer's division of the Council. The
latter was an engineer and ought therefore to have been alive to the same issues as D r Eastwood.

  153. T h e Advisory G ro u p seems to have w orked in a very inform al m anner. A short passage from M r
Bownes' evidence gives the flavour o f it:—

       Q     W h o was taking the lead in the working party as you u n d ersto o d it?

       A     T h a t is a good question, sir. Leads were com ing from several different directions really.

       Q     W h o chaired it. if anyone?

       A     Nobody as such. sir. It was an inspection rather th a n a m e etin g as 1 u n d ersta n d it.

       Q     W h o decided w hat should be inspected?

       A     Effectively the group itself, sir. it seem ed to me. T h ere was also som e input from the Club
             representative as to. if you like, an elem ent o fd ire c tio n as to what should be looked at.

       Q     A part from the inspections the working party m et. presumably,                        or d id they only m eet on
             inspections?

       A     N o, sir. 1 have referred to three previous meetings.

       Q     W h o took t he c h a i r w h e n it met?

       A     1 suppose it could be said that 1 did. to some extent.

       Q      T h ere is n o point in having inspections unless you form conclusions as a result o f tha t inspection, is
              there?

       A     T h a t is correct.

       Q      T here must presumably have been som e meeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
              together a n d decided w hat, if anything, should be done.

       A     T h ere was not. to my recollection, no.

       Q     How did you decide w hat should be done, if anything n ee d ed to be done?

       A     T h ere were discussions on the site, particularly in relation to b arrier 144. which took place at the
              time.

       Q     N o thing more th a n that a n d no record anyw here o f any decisions that were m ade?

       A     N o. sir."

T he decision to remove barrier 144 was assented to on behalf o f the City Council by M r Bownes. It was not
referred to th e G eneral Purposes Panel. W h e th e r M r Bownes strictly had any power to assent to it is to say the
least very dou b tfu l. But he h im self ad m its that he was ill-equipped to d o so. H e knew very little ab o u t football
grounds. H e had read the file passed o n from South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council a n d assum ed all had been run
satisfactorily by them.

  154. It was recorded, however, in a report which M r Bownes d rafted that “the co nditions (in the Safety
Certificate) give som e cause for concern as they a p p e a r to be in a d e q u a te o r in a p p ro p ria te in some a re as”. T he
report to the G eneral Purposes Panel suggested that new Safety Certificate conditions should be drafted.

   155.      T h e task ofrevising the Safety Certificate was begun in J u n e 1986. In July 1987, a draft was sent to the
fire service to w hich they replied in August. In S eptem ber 1987, the Panel was inform ed tha t th e redrafting was
ul    "progressing steadily ' a n d sh o u l d be s u b m i t t e d to the Panel in O c to b e r. T h e final d ra ft was not ci rc u la t e d until
1S    30 Mar ch 1989. 16 d a \ s before this disaster.

        157. Sheffield U n ite d Football Club was designated u nder the 1975 Act on 3 July 1984. A Safety Certificate
      was about to be issued by South Yorkshire C o u n ty Council at the tim e it handed over to the Sheffield City
      Council on 1 April 1986. N o certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

         158. T he explanation given for these delays was pressure o f work. M r Bownes as C h ie f Licensing Officer
      was responsible for 32 o th e r licensing systems w hen this o ne was a d d e d to his burden. H e h ad a s ta ff o f only
      five. 1fully accept that th e a d d it io n o f further statutory responsibilities to the already heavy w orkload o f a local
      authority with curbs on its expenditure creates problems. But it is clear that the a tten tio n given to this
      important licensing function was woefully inadequate.

      Summary
         159. T he Safety Certificate contained no m a x im u m figures for individual pens. T h ere was therefore no
      sanction or provision focussing attention as to the need lo limit entry to the pens by num bers. T he layout at
      Leppings Lane as it evolved m ade electronic or mechanical control over n u m b e rs entering individual pens
      impracticable if all pens were to be available. G iven an im p o rta n t m atch a n d a capacity attendance, fans were
      likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 a n d 4. Those p ens were likely to b ec o m e overfull well before
      warning cam e from the turnstiles that num be rs were a pproa ching the terrace m a x im u m o f 10.100. Control
      over num bers a n d the avoidance o f overcrowding therefore d e p e n d e d entirely on visual m o nitoring o f the
      crowd.

                         LACK O F EFF E C T IV E M O N I T O R I N G O F T H E T E R R A C E S

    160. M o n ito rin g the spectators on the terraces so as to av o id overcrowding involves observing the n um be rs
a n d their d istrib u tio n in each area, m aking decisions as to when an area is “full”, taking steps to close it o ff
a n d moving spectators from on e area to another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problem s. 1) W ho
sho uld carry it o ut? 2) W hen is an area "full”? 3) Fear o f hooliganism.

Who should M onitor the Terraces?
   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? S hould it be the police? Should it be both? O r should it be by
arrangem ent, d ep e n d in g upon the gro u n d o r sect ion o f the g r o u n d in question?

   162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a m atch on its prem ises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at th a t event. The G re e n G u id e (1986) provides:

       " 23. T h e safety o f the public inside the g r o u n d is the responsibility o f those who stage the event a n d
             ad m in iste r the g ro u n d in which it is held, ie the “ m anagem ent". This responsibility applies in
             both norm al a n d em ergency situations...

         195. ...there are five basic d uties which stew ards are called up on to carry out. T hese are:

               (a)    controlling o r directing m e m b ers o f the public who are entering o r leaving the ground, to
                      help achieve an even flow of people to th e viewing areas an d safe dispersal o f spectators on
                      the terraces o r viewing slopes:

               (b)    patrolling the gro u n d to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarm s o r extinguishing
                      fires:

                (c)   m a nning entrances, exits a n d o th e r strategic points, especially exit doors a n d gates which
                      are continu ously open whilst the ground is in use:

                (d)   assisting police as ap p ro p riate o r as requested with crowd control: an d

                (e)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency."

The Interim Popplewell Report
   163. T here was considerable controversy in t h e course o f the public inquiry held by M r Justice Popplewell
in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club an d th e police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report, M r Justice
Popplewell q u o te d from a report p roduce d for th e M inister o f H ousing an d Local G o v ern m e n t in 1969 as
follows:-

  “T he responsibility for controlling crowd beh a v io u r is d iv id ed between the police a n d the club operating the
  ground. T h e b ro ad line o f division being that police are responsible for m ovem ent o f spectators in public
  thoroughfares a n d from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the control o f
  spectators once they are on the club’s premises . . . "

M r Justice Popplewell said he d id not quarrel w ith tha t view a n d went on to observe that in practice the police
have to take charge a n d be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph 3.8):

   "It follows, therefore, that as a m a tte r o f practice, while th e physical safety o f the building a n d the
   m a in te n a n c e a n d good housekeeping o f the g ro u n d m ust always be the responsibility o f th e club, the police
   have to take the de facto responsibility of organising the crowd, with all that entails, d uring the gam e . . .’’

M r Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation o f the grou nd as a procedure in which only the police
could bear the responsibility o f supervising the organisation o f the crowd.

The Final Popplewell Report
   164. He h a rk e d back to this subject in cha pte r 4 o f his Final Report. There, he cam e d ow n m ore firmly in
favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “Because, as a m a tte r o f


                                                              28
practice, police officers have regularly attende d in large num bers at football grounds, it has somehow been
assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed from
them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcem ent o f law a n d order. Those responsible
for organising a private function, however, have the primary a n d co n tin u in g obligation a n d responsibility to
ensure reasonable safety for those w ho are invited on to their prem ises." Mr Justice Popplewell e n d e d that
section as follows: i t ca nnot be too strongly em phasised tha t it is upon the club, or the o c c u p ie r o f the g r o u n d
who is putting on the function, that the primary a n d continuing obligation rests.”

    165. There remains, however, the question w hether there are som e g rounds or parts o f grounds where the
club may need to rely upon the police (w hom they pay to atte n d ) to control filling o f pens a n d m o nitoring them
for overcrowding. In o th e r words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they m ay need,
and by agreem ent be entitled, to em ploy the police to act as their agents in certain circum stances. This very
difficult a n d grey area as to club a n d police responsibility will need to be reviewed in greater d epth at stage two
o f this Inquiry.

A rrangements a t Hillsborough
  166. W hat is clear, however, is tha t de facto the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility for
control o f the pens at the Leppings Lane end. T he evidence o f the se n io r officers who h ad been concerned with
policing at Hillsborough over the years was all one way on this point. Only M r D uckenfield. w ho h a d not
policed at H illsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.

   167. M r Lock is now security officer at Sheffield W ednesday a n d was formerly a police S u p erin te n d en t at
Hillsborough m atches occupying M r M urray’s role. H e claim ed there h a d been a form al although unw ritten
agreement between the Club a n d the police in ab o u t 1982. w hereby the police agreed to steward the Leppings
Lane end o f the ground. Such a form al agreement is d enied by o th e r se n io r officers a n d I do not accept tha t any
formal agreem ent was reached. Nevertheless, a practice o r arran g e m en t d id develop which was know n a n d
accepted by both C lub a n d police. Its effect was tha t throughout the g r o u n d the stewards were responsible for
m anning exits a n d entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for assisting spectators to their seats in the
stands a n d for helping to control the exits after the m atch. T hey were also responsible at the Kop end o n the
terraces for keeping gangways clear an d helping to control the crow d which usually consisted o f h o m e
supporters. At the Leppings L ane end. however, there were no gangways on the terraces a n d the crowd
consisted usually (an d always since 1987) o f away supporters. M r M ole a n d o th e r se n io r officers accepted that
it would have been unreal an d unrea sonable to expect stewards to go o n to those Leppings Lane terraces. T hey
would not have been effective there: moreover, they could well have been in som e d an g e r from hostile away
supporters. T h e police accepted, therefore, tha t the p ro p er filling o f the pens a n d m o n ito rin g them for
overcrowding could a n d would not be carried out by stewards. M any stewards have te nded to be either
extremely young or somew hat elderly. They are p a id only a m odest s u m (£9 at H illsborough) an d they are not
suitable either by physique or by trainin g to cope on a crow ded terrace w ith no gangways.

Case for the South Yorkshire Police
  168. Notw ithstanding the overw helm ing evidence from senior police as alR Jy m e n tio n e d a n d from the
Club. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police co n tin u e d thro u g h o u t the h earing to co n te n d that the C lub a n d
not the police were responsible for filling a n d m o n ito rin g the pens a n d th a t this was well known to b oth parties.
He m a inta ined tha t the police were the re essentially to secure a n d preserve Iaw a n d order. Q u ite ap a rt from the
police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance o f the South Yorkshire Police has not always
been to that effect.

argument was tha t they h ad add itio n a l duties. In his ju d g e m en t. B o reh am J su m m arise d the instructions for
policing as providing for:-

  ■(a) the m a in te n a n c e o f enforcem ent <?f la w a n d order:

  (b) the e nforcem ent o f the C lu b ’s gro u n d regulations, m a n y o f which are concerned with law a n d order;

H e ref e rr e d to t h e a r g u m e n t o f C o u n s e l fo r th e S o u th Y ork sh ire Police as follows:-

   "Thirdly. here the police were not discharging their own d u ty to the public: they were in fact discharging the
   C lu b 's duties to the spectators whom the Club invited to the ground. T h e Club chose to invite large num bers
   to the ir private premises: it was th e C lu b ’s d uty to provide for their safety, health a n d com fort. They could
   have em ployed a security firm as banks a n d others have to d o to protect their interests: they chose to request
   the police to perform those duties know ing that the police expected paym ent. Fourthly, the police within the
   g r o u n d p rovided services which it was not w ithin the scope o f their public duty to perform . For instance,
   they assisted in crowd m a n agem ent a n d in the enforcem ent o f such g ro u n d regulations as refused entry to
   those who tried to enter without paying or prohibited spectators encroaching on parts o f th e ground which
   the ir entry fee d id not entitle them to enter. It m a y b e , su b m its M r Bentley, that the m a in te n a n c e o f la w a n d

   h a n d to assist in the event o f some em ergencies such as fire o r accidental injury."

Police Practice at the Leppings Lane End
    170.      At League m atches at H illsborough, the police practice was to decide in advance how m a n y an d which
pens w ould be used. If a m odest crowd was a n ticip ate d only o n e or two pens might be needed. It was better to
co nfine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent them ru n n in g about a n d (b) to reduce the n u m b e r o f police
required. T he practice was then to fill th e pens o ne by one. T h is involved m ak ing a judge m ent as to when a pen
was full. T h ere would then be a police decision to close tha t p en an d fill anoth er. It was regarded as impractical
a n d unsafe for police officers (just like stewards) to go on to the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
T h is m e an t tha t m o nitoring the num be rs in any pen h ad to be d one from vantage points o utside it. Here, the
police were m uch better placed than the stewards. T here w as a good view from the control box an d the
television screens there. T here were officers on the p erim ete r track. N o stew ards were placed there because
having both police an d stewards interfered with the viewing. T here were also police in the west stand w ho
could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the police a good appreciation o f
th e state o f th e terraces. W hen it was necessary to shut off access to th e pen s officers on the concourse could be
info rm ed by radio an d could take the necessary steps.

“Find Their Ow n Level”
   171.       At C u p semi-finals, a different approach was ad o p ted . All th e pens were op en e d from the start an d the
policy was “to let th e fans find their own level” . T his phrase was repeated again an d again by police officers at
the Inquiry. W hat it m eant was that n o specific direction was given to fans entering through the turnstiles.
T h ey were free to go wherever they w ished on the terraces. If they becam e uncom fortable o r wished for any
o th e r reason to move their position, th e n theoretically they co u ld move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
the fans on the terraces would level them selves out a n d th a t d istrib u tio n w ould be achieved w ithout police
intervention. O n these occasions, the gates at the top o f the radial fences were locked in the o pen position. It
was sought to argue, therefore, th a t there was freedom o f m ove m ent from one pen to a n o th e r enabling fans to
“find th e ir level”.

    172.       This argum ent was bad both in theory an d in practice. In theory, the w h oleobjec t o f the radial fences
had been to achieve even distribution by directing fans into desired positions. To say then that they could move
freely from one pen to a n o th er would defeat the object a n d enable fans to go from a less p o p u la r to a more
p o p u la r area w ithout inhibition. In practice this did not h a p p e n because the p osition an d size o f the gates was
such tha t once a substantial n u m b e r o f spectators were in. the gates were unnoticeable a n d inaccessible
especially to those towards the front w ho might have m ost need o f them.

  1 73. T he sam e argum ent was deployed to suggest that individual m a x im u m capacities for individual pens
nee d n o t be assessed since the presence o f the open radial gates still m e an t tha t the terrace was one area. In
practice this sim ply was not so. T he p h o tograph at A ppendix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.59 pm shows
very clearly the congestion in pens 3 a n d 4 contrasted with the sparseness in pen 6. This gives the lie to the
suggestion tha t the fans could, if uncom fortable, "find the ir own level".

   174.    T he effect o f this policy was th a t w hereas at League m atches the police h ad to make a positive decision
w hen to close o ne pen an d open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was m uch m ore likely, the police


                                                                          30
left it tei the tans themselves to "find their own level". Effectivelv they were left to m o n ito r their own com fort
and safety so as to a\ oid o\ ercrowdi ng. The police would only intervene w hen there was some overt sign that an
area was "full".

When is an Area “ Full"?
   175. O ver the years, spectators on terraces have co m e to accept co nditions which are often very
uncom fortable a n d not infrequently dow nright dangerous. They are subjected to buffeting and squeezing to
get in and out o f the terraces. They are packed tightly an d exposed to surging a n d swaying during the match.
They put up with these conditions because they are devoted to the gam e a n d because there is little they can do
about them. They believe the discom fort will pass an d nothing very unto w ard will happen. Usually that is the
case an d they are reassured by it. Most clubs have not. until very recently, consulted their supporters as to the ir
grievances or suggestions. The practice has been to pack th e m in on the assu m p tio n that if they are prepared to
put up with it the co nditions must be tolerable. A lthough crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased p ro p o rtio n o f seating as against standing
accom m odation. Terraces have still been packed.

   176. It is said that many fans enjoy these features o f terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
discomfort, w eathering sways an d surges together an d c h a n tin g the sa m e songs a n d slogans en m a sse do evoke
good h u m o u r a n d have produced a spirit o r cult o f the terraces which m a n y enjoy. Equally there are m any who
sim ply endure these things for the football, for a cheap ticket o r indeed for the chance o f getting in at all. A nd
before Hillsborough most fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had not realised the narrow
margin o f safety between an uncom fortable crush a n d a fatal one.

    177. The G reen G u id e sought to im prove safety an d com fort by laying down criteria for m axim um
capacity, te defining what is "full". T he sta n d ard set was 54 persons p e r 10 square m etres in favourable
conditions but fewer, down to 27. in less favourable conditions. T he t e n d en c y m ay have been to aim off too
little from the higher figure for shortcom ings in the layout. Certainly th e figures considered ap propriate in
pens 3 and 4 at H illsborough were too high, as already indicated.

   178. Even taking the highest figure suggested in the G reen G u id e, the problem rem ained that those
supposed to be m o n ito rin g pens visually had a n d have little idea o f w hat 54 p ersons per 10 square m etres look
tike. M r D uckenfield's opinion was th a t w hen a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be “shoulder to
shoulder and chest to back". T hat view may derive from seeing the s o n o f density crowds regularly endure
w ithout injury resulting. But it is m uch m ore dense th a n the G reen G u id e m a x im u m .

   179. The South Yorkshire Fire Brigade provided the Inquiry with p h otographs o f people standing in an area
of 10 square m etres at various densities o f packing. Together w ith my Assessors and others. I took part in a
sim ilar expe rim e nt at the Health and Safety Executive's Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a room o f m easured
area at densities o f 54. 80 and 100 p e r 10 square metres. It was clear from the ph otographs an d from o u r
experim ent that the m a x im u m density set out in the G re en G u id e left considerably m ore room than those
monitoring the terraces would have left before declaring an area ''full” .

   180. T he tendency has been to allow' the pens to fill until the fans co m p la in o r show signs o f discomfort. If
the density at the front appeared less th a n at the back, the T annoy w ould invite the fans to move forward to
make room for more. T he evidence before the Inquiry an d m a ny anecdotal letters I have received clearly show
there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, n o t only at Hillsborough, has caused
discomfort an d som etim es, for brief periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
eases and the incident passes unrecorded.

   181. After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final. H illsborough was n o t chosen again by the FA until 1987.
T here was evidence that the central pen s were uncom fortably overcrowded on th a t occasion and again at the
1988 C u p semi-final, although entry to the tunnel was blocked o ff by police shortly before kick-off in 1988
because the pens were deem ed to be "full".

Fear of Hooliganism
   182. O ver the last few years, hooliganism at a n d associated with football m atches has strongly influenced
the strategv o f the police. In their plans a n d m an ag e m en t they have conc en tra te d on averting o r containing
threats to public order. T his is und ersta n d ab le an d indeed com m en d a b le . But it has led to an im balance
between the need to quell a minority o f troublem akers an d the need to secure the safety an d com fort o f the
majority. In the police O perational O rder, the em phasis was upon prevention o f disorder a n d in particular
prevention o f access to the field o f play. T h ere was no express requirem ent tha t o f f e r s on the p erim ete r track
o r in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed, the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together o n the terraces assisted in controlling the unruly since
the less room they had the less scope there was for misbehaviour.

Sum m ary
   183. Although the police had accepted de facia responsibility for m onitoring the pens, the ir policy on the
day was to leave fans to “find their own level” and to conc entra te their own attention on possible disorder.
Whilst in theory the police w ould intervene if a pen b ec am e "full", in practice they p erm itte d the test o f
fullness to be w hat the fans would tolerate.

  184. By 2.52 pm when gate C was o pened, pens 3 a n d 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncom fortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries: to allow in a large stream was
courting disaster.
 was                                                          C H A P T E R 10
'ince
                                              T H E B U I L D - U P AT T H E T U R N S T I L E S

              185. T he decision to open gate C. an d subsequently gates A a n d B too. was forced on to the police by the
i the    c r o w d conditions which developed outside the turnstiles. T he crush was so severe that injuries were being
rder.    suffered an d deaths were feared unless the pressure could be swiftly relieved. Why the crowd pressure had built
st o f   to such intensity was one o f the principal issues during the hearing. The suggested causes must be considered in
         turn.

a ere    The Physical Layout
 was       186. 1 have already described a n d illustrated the ap p ro a c h to the turnstiles (Appendices 1 a n d 2). At
         Penistone Road and at many other grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced a n d with a
         sufficient waiting area for queues to form. N ot so at Leppings Lane. T he building line, the bridge over the D on
         and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to p erim ete r gates set in an arc, a n d across a short
         forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. T h e pairs o f turnstiles were close together a n d the forecourt, especially
         asdivided by the m etal fence, provided little space f o r a w aiting crowd.

         The Number of Turnstiles
            187. T he decision to fill the whole o f the no rth stand from the Leppings L ane en d required the 23 turnstiles
         there to ad m it 24,256 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G ) serv ing the terraces h ad to adm it
         10.100. ie an average o f just u n d e r 1.450 through each turnstile. At the Pen istone Road en d . 29.800 were
         served by 60 turnstiles, o r just u n d e r 500 p er turnstile.

            188. T he G reen G u id e recognises (paragraph 47) th a t the rate at which spectators can pass through
         turnstiles depends on a variety o f local circum stances but states “ in general based on observation and
         experience, it is unlikely that the m a x im u m notional rate p e r turnstile w ould exceed 750 per hour". Since the
         semi-final was an all ticket m atch requiring no cash transactions, the C lub considered that a higher rate o f
         about 1,000 p er h o u r p e r turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assum es th e turnstiles
         working at m axim um efficiency non-stop, it would have ta ken nearly 1/; h ours to ad m it all those with terrace
         tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

            189. The G reen G u id e provides (paragraph 44):-

           “Turnstiles should be o f such num be rs as to ad m it spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
           kept waiting for a d m is s i o n . . . ” .

            190. The Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need, a n d D r E astw ood 's various schemes, for
         improvement o f the turnstile arrangem ents. T he m a th em atics are elementary. Both the police a n d the Club
         should have realised tha t the Leppings Lane turnstiles and th e waiting area outside th e m would be u n d e r strain
         io admit all the Liverpool supporters in time. Success d e p e n d ed on the spectators arriving at a ste ad y rate from
         ,in early h ou r and upon the m a x im u m turnstile rate being m a in ta in ed . In fact n e ith e r o f these requirem ents,
         u Inch are inter-linked, was fulfilled. T hat they might not be so was in my view foreseeable.

          1he “Late” arrival of Liverpool Fans
            191. Between 2.30 p m an d 2.40 p m the crowd waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5.000 a n d becam e
         unmanageable. T he case m ade for the police was that large n u m b e rs o f Liverpool supporters a rriv ed late: a
         high proportion o f them were d ru n k a n d unco-operative: a high p roportion had no tickets: all o f them were
         hell-bent on getting in on time. T hey say this was unforeseeable an d explains why they lost control.

             !‘)2. W hether those w ho arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm were "late" was m uc h debated. T h e ticket
          simply requested its h olde r “to take up [his] position 15 m inutes before k ick-off'. T h at may have been
          intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be unreasonable for a
          standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 p m an d 2.40 pm. W h e th e r they were " la te ” o r not,
          however, there was certainly a large co ncentration o f Liverpool fans arriving at a b o u t 2.30 pm a n d after.

          1raffic Delays
             I ‘>3. It is unlikely that traffic conditions had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
          1 iverpool traffic routes. T here were roadw orks on the M62 which was the rec o m m e n d e d route. A t various
          points the carriageway was reduced from fo - lanes o r three lanes to two. but no serious delays were reported.
O n the M63 there were longer delays due to a contraflow an d at its ju n c tio n with the A560 there was heavv
congestion due to volum e o f traffic. However, the Liverpool routes were clear by 2.20 pm an d those witnesses
w ho co m plained o f delays en route had nevertheless m anaged to be in range o f th e ground in a m p le time.

Fine W eather and D rinking
   194. T he likeliest explanations for the sparse Liverpool atten d a n ce in the ground before 2.30 p m were four­
fold - the warm weather, drinking, disinclination to e n ter the ground early and prolong the standing, a n d a
tendency o f Liverpool supporters to cut it fine.

    195. T he police em phasised that at the 1988 semi-final there was no com parable build-up o f “ late" arrivals.
They claim , therefore, that they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988. although the w eather
was fine, it was 11 ° F cooler than in 1989. 15 April was the s o n o f fine spring day which te m p te d fans to sit or
sta n d ab o u t in the sun with a drink. If you had a ticket it would seem m o re pleasant an d sensible to relax in that
way th a n to e n te r th e ground early a n d stand on the terrace for an extra hour. Pre-m atch e n te rta in m e n t in the
g ro u n d had been advertised but did not take place. Even if it had. it m ay not have been a n encouragem ent to
many fans to e n te r so early.

W as D runkenness a M a jo r Factor in the Crisis at the Turnstiles?
    196. O f those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very m any had been drink ing at public houses o r had
brought drin k from ho m e o r an off-licence. 1 am satisfied on the evidence, however, tha t the great majority
were not d ru n k n o r even the worse for drink. T he police w itnesses varied on this. S om e described a high
p ro p o rtio n as d ru n k , as "lager-louts" o r even as “an im als". O th ers described a generally n o rm a l crowd with an
unco-operative minority who had d ru n k too much. In my view som e officers, seeking to rationalise their loss
o f control, overestim ated the dru n k en elem ent in th e crowd. T here certainly was such a n elem ent. There were
youngsters influenced by drink a n d b ravado pushing im patiently at the rear o f th e crowd thereby exacerbating
the crush. But the m o re convincing police witnesses, including especially Detective S u p e rin te n d e n t McKay
a n d C h ie f Inspector C reaser as well as a n u m b e r o f responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this elem ent as a minority. Those witnesses a ttrib u te d the crush to the sheer n u m b e rs o f fans all
an x io u s to gain entry. There was no criticism o f the crowd by any o f th e witnesses in th e p eriod u p to 2.30 pm
o r even 2.35 pm . W h a t happened then was not a sudden d e terio ratio n in the m o o d o r sobriety o f those
assem bled there. N o d o u bt those com ing behind would have h ad m ore to d rin k a n d w ould have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd becam e p acked into a confined
tu rn stile area a n d its very density ham p ered its passage through the turnstiles.

   197. S up erin te n d en t Marshall a n d o th e r officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police
ex h o rta tio n s to stop pushing and to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In tha t crush most people
h ad no control over the ir m ovem ents at all. Two incidents involving police horses illustrate th e point. One
horse was found afterw ards to have cigarette burns on its ru m p . Clearly tha t was the despicable work o f a
hooligan w h eth e r in d rin k o r not. However, there were also eyewitness accounts o f a horse being physically
lifted o ff its feet by the crowd. T h a t occurred, as the police accepted, w ithout m alice o r intent but as an
involuntary consequence o f crowd pressure which those by the horse's flanks could not resist any m o re th a n the
horse itself.

Reduced Efficiency of the Turnstiles
    198. T he labelling o f the turnstiles in the order A. C. B was confusing. A fan with a B ticket who went by
m istake to the w rong side o f the metal fence would have had the greatest difficulty in getting back a n d round to
th e correct side. T he colour coding was inefficient because the coloured w ooden panels were affixed to the
tu rn stile walls so low that they were not easily visible through a crowd. T h e inform ation o n the ticket printed by
Sheffield W ednesday Football Club was misleading an d its layout unhelpful, as M r Mackrell frankly conceded.

    199. T h e result was that in the early stages, police officers were pestered by fans for help as to where they
sh o u ld go. Later, as the crowd becam e more dense, fans were presenting the ir tickets at the w rong turnstiles.
T h ere were also Liverpool supporters who h ad acquired tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Leppings
Lane. They caused delays in the turnstile o pera tion when entry was refused an d afte r a while the police
instructed the o p era to rs to let them through. T here was further delay because the crush m a d e it difficult for
fans to get into the turnstile entrances. O nce there, the pressure from b ehind was such as, o n occasions, to ja m
th e m in the d oorw ay o r against the p ad dle o f the turnstile. Finally, there were fans w ithout tickets who sought
to e n te r by offering paym ent, by seeking to go over o r u n d e r the paddle o r by sliding through with a ticket
holder. All o f these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst period was only about 600 per
h o u r p e r turnstile. T h e waiting crowd therefore ex p a n d ed and as the m inutes passed frustration grew. Visitors


                                                              34
who had paid for tickets and travelled from afar realised they were m aking little forw ard progress. F rustration
increased pressure an d induced panic at the front. D ete rm in a tio n to get into the m atch was intensified by
determ in a tio n to get out o f the crush.

Were Fans W ithout Tickets a M a jo r Factor in the Build-L'p?
  200. It has becom e a fact o f football life that fans d o turn up at all-ticket m atches w ithout tickets. It is not
possible to give an accurate figure o r even a reliable estim ate o f the n u m b e r w ithout tickets on 1 5 April. Police
estimates varied from about 200 to about 2.000. T here were certainly frequent requests for tickets o r “spares”
during the hours before the build-up. Many o f those warned off by the police were seen to return to the area.
Some were hanging abou t on the bridge. Again, however, the police witnesses who most im pressed m e d id not
consider the n u m b e r o f ticketless fans to be inordinately large. T h is accords with two o th e r sources o f
evidence.

   201. First, there was a wide range o f witnesses who observed inside the ground th a t the Liverpool en d was at
a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 a n d 4. The n orth sta n d still had m a ny em p ty seats an d the wing
pens were sparse. The m atch being a sell-out. there were clearly m any ticket holders to co m e a n d they could
account for the large crowd still outsid e the turnstiles. H ad the Liverpool a c c o m m o d a tio n been full by 2.40
pm. one could h ave inferred that most o r m uch o f the large crowd o u tsid e lacked tickets.

   202. Secondly, such figuresas are available from the C lub's electronic m onitoring system an d from analyses
by the HSE suggest tha t no great n u m b e r entered w ithout tickets. T hey show th a t the n u m b e r who passed
through turnstiles A t o G plus those w ho entered through gate C roughly equalled th e terrace capacity figure o f
10,100 for which tickets had been sold. The C lub's record showed 7.038 passed through turnstiles A to G.
However, th e co u n tin g m echanism on turnstile G was defective, so the HSE did a study using the video film
and projecting figures from the o th e r turnstiles. T his gave an assessm ent o f 7.494, with a m a x im u m o f 7.644
passing through A to G . Again, using the video, the HSE assessed th e n u m b e r who entered the gro u n d whilst
g ateC was o pen at 2.240 with a m a x im u m o f 2.480. Accordingly, the H SE 's best e s tim a te o f t h e total entering
through gate C a n d turnstiles A to G was 9.734 with a m a x im u m o f 1 0 .1 2 4 .1 recognise tha t these can only be
rough checks because, for exam ple, som e with terrace tickets were allowed through turnstiles 1 to 16 a n d there
would be o th e r sim ilar factors which have not form ed part o f the assessm ent. N evertheless, the figures do
suggest that there was not a very significant body o f ticketless fans in the crowd w hich built up.

The “Conspiracy" Theory
  203. O n b e h a lf o f South Yorkshire police, the theory was ad v a n c e d that the “ late” arrival o f so m a n y
Liverpool su p p o rters was planned to buck the system. T he suggestion w as that fans w ithout tickets conspired
to arrive late a n d create such trouble as would force the police to a d m it them to the m atch. T h e slender
evidence u p o n w hich this theory rested cam e from two sources: o verheard conversations in public h o u s e s a n d
the antecedent history o f Liverpool supporters at away matches.

  204. O ne w itness said he heard three Liverpool supporters saving, in effect, that they w ould m a nage to get
in w ithout tickets by causing trouble so that police would open a gate, a n d that th e y h a d d o n e this before.
Another witness h eard two o f a group o f Liverpool supporters say they had no tickets, th a t they would go to th e
ground ju st before kick-off. that no-one would stop them getting in a n d tha t they h a d n o t been sto p p e d yet.
Statements were put in relating to two o th e r small groups talking in sim ilar terms.

Liverpool Supporters at Away M atches
  205. T he S o u th Yorkshire police prepared a dossier o f reports o n the b ehaviour o f Liverpool fans at away
matches with the object o f showing a pattern o f troublesom e b eh a v io u r by large n um bers e ith e r w ithout tickets
or with forged tickets. W ithout setting ou t the whole history, it can be su m m arise d as follows.

  206. O n three occasions Liverpool fans w ithout tickets were allowed into all-ticket m atches u p o n p aym ent.
(At Watford o n 13 February 1988. 1.500 were a d m itted : at S o u th a m p to n on 24 S ep te m b er 1988, 150 were
admitted; at S o u th a m p to n again on 12 D ecem ber 1988. 750 were a d m itte d .) At N o rw ic h o n 1 April 1989,
Liverpool su p p o rters arrived w ithout tickets but 1.272 tickets h ad been retu rn ed and fans from both Liverpool
and Norwich were allowed to buy th e m for cash. A sim ilar situation o cc u rre d at W im b le d o n o n 13 M ay 1989.
There were six o th e r occasions from 1986 to date, including the C u p finals o f 1986 a n d 1989, w hen n u m b e rs o f
Liverpool su p p o rters tu rn ed up w ithout tickets o r otherw ise behaved badly.

   207. Four p o in ts must be noted, however. On n o ne o f the occasions w hen ticketless fans were a d m itte d for
 payment was th e m atch a sell-out. T h ere was therefore room in the gro u n d o n each occasion. At a sell-out fans


                                                             35
might not expect to be allowed in. even for paym ent. Secondly, no trouble o f the kin d alleged was encountered
at the 1988 semi-final when Liverpool visited Hillsborough. Thirdly. Liverpool visited H illsborough again in
January 1989 without any trouble. Finally, no forged tickets were in use on 15 April apart from three crude
photocopies.

No Conspiracy
   208. I have already found that th e re was not an a b n o rm a lly large n u m b e r o f fans w ithout tickets on this
occasion. With one o r two exceptions, the police witnesses them selves did not subscribe to the "conspiracy"
theory. I a m satisfied tha t the large co ncentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 p m to 2.50 pm did not arrive
as a result o f any concerted plan. T h e re were. I accept, small groups w ith o u t tickets who were willing to exploit
any ad v e n titio u s chance o f getting in to the ground. They, together with the m inority who h a d d ru n k too much,
certainly aggravated the p roblem faced by the police. But th a t m ain p ro b lem was simply o n e o f large n um bers
pac k ed into the small area outside th e turnstiles.

T he Police Operation at Leppings Lane
    209. T h e O perational O rd e r for 15 April followed closely that laid dow n for the 1988 semi-final. T he
em p h a sis was on m aintaining law a n d order. Side roads were to be blocked o f f to prevent dam age in residential
areas. Pairs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent "clash o f rival supporters". Officers were to watch public
houses, shops an d superm arkets “w here lootin gcould take place”. O utside the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
s u p p o rte rs entering d id not have banners, weapons, missiles o r alcohol.

    210. Unfortunately, hooligan beh a v io u r has m a d e all these steps necessary- But the only w ritten prov ision
a i m e d at effecting controlled entry to th e turnstiles was one enjoining officers “to ensure o rderly queues are
fo r m e d ” . T h ere was no provision for controlling the entry o f th e crowd in to the turnstile area.

  211. As long ago as 1924. the D ep a rtm en tal C o m m itte e on Crowds stated:-

  “T h e control o f crowds should begin at a point som e considerable distance from the entrance to the ground.
  T h e advantages o f an arrangem ent o f this kind a r e ... in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds."

T h is was particularly im p o rta n t at Leppings Lane where the turnstile area was so small a n d awkwardly laid
out. I f a large crowd was p erm itted u ncontrolled entry through the p e rim e te r gates, the fo rm in g o fq u e u e s at the
tu rn stiles a n d control by officers, w hether on foot o r m ounted, w ould becom e im practicable. T h o se waiting at
the turn stiles would becom e a single growing mass. O nce that h ap p e n ed , it would be difficult to retrieve the
s ituation.

   212. W h e th e r steps were taken a n d w hat steps to avoid this h ap p e n in g was left to oral briefing and ad hoc
in stru c tio n s on the day.

Previous Experience
    213. T h e senior police officers said it h ad never h ap p e n e d before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two previous occasions when the Leppings Lane terraces had been used to fill the whole o f the north
a n d west sides o f the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987 a n d 1988. In 1987. the match was on a Sunday,
sched u le d for 1 2 noon, and kick-offwas p o stp o n e d f o r a q u a rte r o f a n h ou r because o f late arrivals.

Policing in 1988
   214. As to 1988. there was a very large a n d consistent b o d y o f evidence that, on the day. the police in
Leppings L ane con ducted a n efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those w ithout tickets and
control the flow o f fans towards the ground. I d o not believe tha t so many witnesses without either opp o rtu n ity
or reason to put their heads together could be mistaken ab o u t w h a t they experienced o n that occasion. Yet, the
police m a in ta in that no filtering exercise o th e r than on a r a n d o m basis was co n d u c te d in 1988 an d that their
policy a n d practice then were no different from those o f 1989.

  21 5. T h e answ er to this conflict m ust. 1 think, be that whilst the policy m ay have been n o different, in
practice th e policing in 1988 was mofe efficient a n d was not p ut to the same test a n d strain as a year later. T here
was not so large a swell in num bers a pproa ching the g r o u n d from 2.30 p m to 2.50 p m as in 1989.
Nevertheless, there had been warning signs in 1988. D etective S u p erinte ndent McKay gave the following
evidence:



                                                                36
 ■Q     Were you aw ar e o f a b ui ld -up o f n u m b e r s last year to w ard s the la tt e r stages at the tu r n s ti le s 0

 A      Y e s . . . T here was a huge build-up aro u n d 1 0 m inutes to 3 when many, many Liverpool supporters
        cam e at that time. They had been drinking, the ones that 1 saw a n d there was quite a sizeable crush
        built-up - sizeable queue.

 Q      Queue or crush0

 A      C o m p ac ted queue, built-up in the area by the turnstiles which 1 believe are m a rke d A to G. T h a t crowd
        reached back alm ost to the gates. It never got any bigger th a n that a n d the turnstiles opera ted relatively
        freely a n d they dealt with that crowd. Fans were still arriving at a b o u t 10 past 3 but by then the . ..

 Q      T h is crowd th a t you have described o f the late arrivals at about 10 to - was it an orderly crowd?

 A      O h no. No. T h e orderly crowd h ad gone in, a n d when I say they w ere not a n orderly crowd, obviously
        m ixed a m o n g st those people w e r e . . .

 Q      O f course, but taking it generally?

 A       But by a n d large they had taken a lot o f d rin k on b oard an d they were in such num be rs tha t excluding
         th e m from the ground was completely out o f the question.

 Q       Were they standing in an orderly queue or was there som e pushing a n d shoving?

  A     T h e re was a lot o f pushing and shoving. T here was an urgency to get into the ground.

  Q     But fortunately it does not a p p e ar to have been in nearly such n u m b e rs as this year.

  A     It wasn't."

Police Intelligence in Advance
  216. A part from tha t experience in 1988. the tendency                      o f Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
unknown. W itnesses said tha t they get through the turnstiles                 at the ir hom e ground. Anfield. quite quickly and
tend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent                   tendency to po stp o n e arrival was noted by the
Sheffield City Council Advisory G ro u p , with police present,                on 23 M arch 1988. T h e m in u te rea d s:-

  “ As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed o f people arriving som e 15 minutes
  before the start o f the gam e hoping to gain adm ission. T h is tren d may b e d u e to the banning o f alcohol at
  sports grounds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshm ent prior to the football m atch. As
  the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for the m ajority o f the time, a n d tha t the late arrival
  problem could p erh a p s only be dealt with by ed ucatio n o f the spectators" (sic).

  217. In so far as Liverpool s u p p o r t e r s ’ beh a v io u r at away m atches may have been indicative o f what police
problems m ight arise on 15 April, most o f the facts should have been available at the planning stage. As in other
forces. S outh Yorkshire Police had a liaison officer whose j o b was to seek, receive a n d collate relevant
inform ation as to the visiting supporters. T h e Association o f C h ie f Police Officers G u id e to Policing Football
highlights the im p o rta n c e o f such liaison:-

  "It is im p o rta n t that the officer responsible for policing the m atch d eterm in e s the pre-m atch p la nning in the
  light o f t h e intelligence at hand. W hilst tha t intelligence can be obtained from a variety o f sources, the p rim e
  source for football intelligence is the Police N ational Intelligence System which is based on th e n etw ork of
  police liaison officers. S um m a rie s com pleted by police officers o f the h o m e club force are forw arded to the
  visiting club's liaison officer making available intelligence a bo ut fans’ b e h a v io u r at both ho m e a n d away
  fixtures. T his in fo rm atio n will be collated an d m a d e available for future m atches involving th a t club”.

  218. T h e FA had also laid down in a m e m o r a n d u m issued in the 1985/6 season m easures to be ad o p te d by
the away club w hich included the following:-

   "lt is the responsibility o f the away club to advise the h om e club o f the recent b ehaviour o f th e ir supporters
  at away m atches, irrespective o f w hether the b eh a v io u r has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
  Association o r not".

     219. It does not seem that inform ation o f this k ind was passed to th e Sheffield W ednesday C lub o r played
any pari in the South Yorkshire Police plans. H ad the latter been inform ed o f the history contained in the
dossier an d su m m arise d above it may well have influenced police strategy in Loppings Lane

  220. T here ispresently a proposal that a n ation al com puter-based police football intelligence system should
be set up to m ake the necessary inform ation readily available.

Police Intelligence on the Day
    221. T h e unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures for entry available from the
C lub's c o m p u te r an d observations on the video screen should have enabled those in the co n tro l room to
m o n ito r the n u m b e rs arriving and still to arrive at Leppings Lane. R adio contact with mobile (Tango) patrols
detailed to m o n ito r licensed premises in the district could have indicated the n u m b e rs still to come. But at 2.30
pm w hen M r M urray told M r D uckenfield they would "get them all in by 3 o 'clo c k ” he seems no t to have
a p preciated tha t in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were m any m ore still to come. Certainly. Mr
Marshall ou tsid e the turnstiles was not told an d could not otherw ise have known that there were still many
Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.

Mr M arshall and Mr Greenwood
  222. T he div isio n o f c o m m an d between these two officers d id not help. M r M arshall was in charge o f the
serials o u tsid e the perim eter gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
inside a n d ju st outside the turnstile area. M r G reenw oo d's area as G ro u n d C o m m a n d e r extended from the
pitch to the p erim ete r gates. He in fact stationed h im self near the players' tunnel. He was wholly unaw are o f the
growing p ro b lem s at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers w ho were u nder
pressure there. N o-one in the control room thought to tell him.

Control Lost
   223. In the result, the large concentration o f arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrained into
the turnstile area through the perim eter gates which were full) open. W hen tha t area was full, later arrivals
swelled th e crowd out to the forecourt an d even into the road. As already recounted, the foot officers at the
turnstiles b ec am e trap p e d and endangered a n d retired through the turnstiles. T he m o u n te d officers could not
operate a m id st such a dense crowd in a confined space. They cam e o ut o f the tu rn stile area. T h ere were then
the belated a tte m p ts to close the perim eter gates an d prevent m o re fans joinin g the m ass until it had a chance to
d im in ish through the turnstiles: still later the a tte m p t to put a cordon o f horses across the entrance.

   224. D espite knowledge o f the difficult layout, the very large n u m b e r o f fans to be got th ro u g h so few
turnstiles a n d the tenden cy o f fans to arrive in the last half hour, no contingency plans were m a d e to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the day. the need to close Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 p m and the
o th e r available intelligence already su m m arised, should have p ro m p te d those in c o m m a n d to take precautions
against such a crush. If som e o f the perim eter gates had been closed a n d c ordons o f m o u n ted an d foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those gates, the flow o f fans into the tu rn stile area could have been
controlled before tha t ;..ea becam e engulfed. It was the crush itself w ^^'n p roduce d the frustration and the
panic an d brought out th e worst in those w ho had drunk too m uch Va/ln.-' control of entry would have
p revented the crush and m a inta ined the good m ood which h a d prevailed until 2.30 pm.

  225. It should m oreover have been obvious by 2.40 pm. if not earlier, tha t a large part o f the crowd could
not be ad m itte d until well after 3 pm. H ad a decision to p ostpone kick-off been m a d e an d ann o u n c ed much o f
the frustra tion an d with it the im petus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A co m b in a tio n o f
controlled filtering an d a postponed kick-off would probably have obviated the need to open the gates.

Postponement of Kick-off
    226. At vario u s stages in his evidence. M r Duckenfield gave three accounts o f why he thought it to o late to
p o stp o n e kick-off. O nce it was that one o f the te am s had already com e o n to the pitch. T hen it was tha t a group
o f p h o to g rap h e rs at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think tha t the te am s were com ing out. Finally, he did not
know why he tho ught the team s were com ing out. They did not in fact co m e o n to the pitch until 2.54 pm. two
m in u te s after gate C was opened. Police Constable Buxton h ad asked for a p o stp o n e m e n t o f kick-ofTbefore
gate C was o pen ed. It should not. however, have needed a police C onstable in the thick o f th e crowd (an d there
were o th e rs o f like m in d ) to think o f p o stp oning the kick-off. T he need should have been clear in the control
room.

   227. T he tr u th was that Mr D uckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with Mr Murray.
K ick-off w ould not be postpon ed unless there were some m a jo r cause for delayed arrivals eg a ja m on the
    I




        m o t o r s a > or tog. 1 accept that th e th in k in g b e h i n d this policy was not callous or p u n it iv e . If kic k-off is
        po st po n ed w h e n e v e r a p r o p o r ti o n o f fans choose to leave the pu b lic h o us e s late, the p ra c t ic e mav grow a n d
        kick-off times w o u ld b e co m e me an ing le ss. But. a c o m m a n d e r mus t de al with the p r o b l e m o f th e das. Faced
        with a s itu at io n w h ic h was b ec o m in g da ng er ou s, cro wd safety sh o u l d have be e n his p a r a m o u n t c o n s i d e ra t io n ,
        k i c k -o ff sh ou ld h a v e been delayed.

        Summary
           228.      The layout o f the turnstiles a n d the num ber they were required to serve left no m argin o f safety against
        an uneven flow o f fans. Because police strategy in ad v a n c e an d on the day did not cater for it. the arrival o f a
        large num ber o f supporters between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm created an unm anageable crush. T h e presence o f
        a substantial m in o rity o f fans who had d ru n k too m uch aggravated that problem. H aving lost control an d
        rejected the o ption o f postponing kick-off. the police were faced with a serious danger o f d ea th s or injuries.
        They were left therefore with n o alternative but to o pen the gates. S u perinte nden t M arshall was right at that
        stage to a sk fo rit an d M r Duckenfield was right toagree. But the possible e f f e c t s o f s o d r a m a t i c a step required
        other action.

                                  T H E B L U N D E R O N O P E N I N G T H E GATES

   229. T h e decision to o rder the opening o f the gates was not accom panied o r followed by any o th e r order 10
deal with the consequences. W hen gate C was opened, a steady stream o f a b o u t 2.000 fans poured through it
over som e five m inutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground som ew here and unless they were diverted
their likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. N o w arning was issued from the control
room that the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. N eith er the Club control room
no r the C h ie f Steward at the Leppings Lane en d was w arned. N ot even M r G reenw ood, the G round
C o m m an d e r, was inform ed. From 2.47 pm w hen M r M arshall m a d e his first request until 2.52 pm w hen Mr
D uckenfield acceded to it, there were five m inutes in w hich orders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not done. In evidence. M r D uckenfield began by saying tha t no officer m a d e any
wrong decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he d id not consider w here the people
would go w hen the gate opened. Even after it o pened, w hen he could see the influx o n the television screen, no
o rd e r was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. M r Duckenfield said it d id not cross his m in d to detail
officers on the concourse to shut off the tunnel. T hose officers could not have know n from th e ir position how
full pens 3 an d 4 were. T h at was a m a tte r for the control ro o m to m o n ito r from its own o bservations and using
intelligence from a ro u n d the ground.

    230. Since pens 3 a n d 4 were full by 2.50 pm. the tunnel should have been closed o ff w h eth e r gate C was to
be o p en e d o r not. T he exercise was a sim ple one an d had been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was
f o r a few officers to act as a c ordon at the en trance to the tunnel an d divert fans elsewhere. U nfortunately, the
1988 closure seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It d id not figure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the pla nning for 1989.

  231. P lan n in g a part, however, it should have been clear in the control ro o m where there was a view o f the
pens a n d o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If o rd e rs had been given to that effect
when gate C was o pened, the fans could have been directed to the em pty areas o f the wings a n d this disaster
could still have been avoided Failure to give that o rd e r was a b lu n d e r o f th e first m agnitude.

   232. Significantly, when permission was given to open gate A. M r D uckenfield d id o rd e r serials to go to that
part o f the concourse to m o n ito r the influx tow ards the n o rth stand. H e d id this because he feared that if fans
w ent to the n o rth stand w ithout tickets, they would not get seats and. there being no p e rim e te r fences at the
n o rth side, they m ight invade the pitch, T h is illustrates again the p reoccupation w ith avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety and the risks o f overcrowding. Because those entering th ro u g h gate C could not get o n to the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to m o n ito r them . The possibility o f overcrow ding simply
was not considered.

Barrier 144
   233. T he removal o f barrier 144 in 1986 should have reduced the notional capacity o f pen 3 as already
mentioned. But it did more. In the absence o f barrier 144. the influx o f fans after 2,52 p m m et no retarding
structure as it c a m e into pen 3. T h e pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
the lowest line o f barriers. The pressure diagonally from the tunnel m o u th down to barrier n u m b e r 124a which
collapsed was u n b ro k en by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen
through the gap in the barrier above it created in 1985.

  234. Inspector Bullas. positioned in the west stand, described w hat he saw looking dow n on the pens
around 3 pm.

  "... I saw from the direction o f the tunnel a kin d o f m o v e m en t down the te rr a c in g ... the type o f th in g that you
  see on the n atu re program m es, the m olten lead flowing down the side o f the m o un tainside, the m olten lava ...
  a "riv e r o f p eo p le” ... goingdirectly towards the pitch but there again spreading . ..o u t.”

   235. D r Eastwood conceded in evidence tha t the removal o f b arrier 144 was likely to have co ntributed to
the collapse o f 124a. Later, he sought to resile from that answer, but I th in k his earlier adm ission was correct. It
was argued th a t if b a rrie r 144 had rem a ine d, the influx from gate C would have built up fu rth e r back and the
tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel o r might have broken barrier 144 itself. T h is is speculative a n d I
th ink unlikely. W hat rem ained o f b a rrie r 144 in pen 4 d id not cause a build-up; n o r d id it collapse. But its
rem aining in p o sition m ay well have accounted for no b a rrie r further dow n pen 4 collapsing a n d for the lesser
carnage in that pen.

W hen did Barrier 124a Fail?
  236. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police sought to argue that this b arrier collapsed o r may have
collapsed at a bout 2.47 pm . His p urpose was to suggest tha t the opening o f gate C was not causally linked with
the crushing a n d fatalities resulting fro m that collapse. I have already found that whilst the evidence does not
permit the tim e o f collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 pm . I now give my reasons:

  (a) I have several tim es watched the BBC video tape on w hich Counsel relied. I d o not find the incident he
      identifies at 2.47 p m suggestive o f a collapse at th a t time;

  (b) the evidence o f fans w ho were n e a r o r at the b arrier was overwhelmingly to the effect tha t th e collapse
      occurred at or afte r 3 pm;

  (c) the biggest group o f witnesses was that w hich related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley’s
      "ne ar-m iss" at th e Kop end at 3.04 pm:

  (d) the appe ara nce on video and photographs o f fans in the area o f barrier 124a after the incident at 2.47 pm
      an d before the final crush is not consistent with it having collapsed so early;

  (e) it is highly unlikely tha t if so catastrophic an event had occurred as early as 2.47 pm . the p olice on the
      track an d elsew here would have ta k en until nearly 3 o'clock to realise s om ething was seriously wrong.
      Indeed, if C ounsel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his tim in g o f the collapse, the failure of
      the police to respond for so long would expose them to even graver criticism than that m a d e in this
      Report.

Dr Eastwood's Testing of the Barriers
   237. Two sections o f b a rrier 124a in pen 3 collapsed as a result o f the overcrowding. T h a t collapse caused a
n u m b e r o f deaths. D r E astw ood and his s ta ff had underta k en the periodical testing o f crush b arriers required
by the G re e n G u id e and by the Safety Certificate. Barrier 124a h ad been tested in July 1988 an d passed.

  238. The test h ad been carried out in accordance with D r E astw ood’s interp retation o f Annex C to the
Green G u id e. That requires an evenly distributed force o f 6.0 k N /m etre w idth to be applied for 3 five m in u te



                                                                41
periods, the interval between applications to be as short as possible. A record has to be kept of the a m o u n t o f
d efo rm atio n d u ring each loading and of the percentage o f recovery. If the recover} is less than 50% after the
third application o f force, the barrier has failed the test. If recovery is between 50% an d 75%. there must be a
re-test. The question is: 50% or 75% o f what? Is the recovery to be in relation to the position o f the barrier
before the first application o f force or before the third? If the former, a span o f 124a recorded 53% at the 1988
test and should have been re-tested. If the latter, it recorded 100% an d passed. U nfortunately the G reen G uide
is unclear as to the correct interpretation. D r Eastwood took the latter view an d so passed the barrier. He
justified his interpretation in evidence. H e said failure to recover to the original position could be due to a
"shake-dow n" effect related to som e giving in the ashes under the concrete or to som e other extraneous factor
rather th a n to any defect in the m aterial o f the barrier itself.

   239. I think, after consulting Professor M aunder, that safety ought to have dictated recovery should be by
reference to the position o f the barrier before the first application o f force. I accept, however, that the G reen
G u id e is a m b ig u o u s and D r E astw ood’s interpretation is tenable. It has som e support from the British
S ta n d a rd s tests on steel structures. Clearly, however, for the future, the G reen G u id e should be clarified on this
point.

Corrosion
  240. Inspection o f b a rrier 124a. an d indeed o th e r barriers at Hillsborough, by th e HSE showed
considerable corrosion o f the m etal at vulnerable points where w ater could accum ulate. D r Eastwood agreed
that if a significant degree of corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a b arrier should be condem ned.

  241. T he G reen G u id e d o e s not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, inter alia:

  "C rush barriers a n d b alustrades should be exam ined for d e fo rm a tio n o r any o th e r overt signs o f weakness".

P aragraph 6 o f A nnex C provides:

  " I f d u r in g any test, even though the b arrier ... satisfies the above loading requirem ents, d o u b t should arise
  for any reason (including such m atters as cracking o f the terracing o r distortion o f connections) as to the
  safety o f the b a r r i e r ... a d etailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results of this investigation
  remove the d o u b t as to safety o f the b a r r i e r ... (it) should be d e e m e d to have failed the test".

  242. Since corrosion is a likely cause o f deterioratio n, a revision o f the G reen G u id e should m ake specific
reference to it.

Causation
  243. Tests d o n e by the HSE suggest tha t although b a rrier 124a passed the loading test in 1988 a n d probably
would have been able to sustain a force which did not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist the load
im posed upon it by reason o f the n u m b e rs in pen 3. the excessive gap in the b arrier higher up th e pen and the
absence o f b a rrie r 144. Corrosion probably played a part, b u t the effective cause o f the collapse was the
excessive a n d unanticipated pressure to which the barrier was exposed.

Observation from Control Room
   244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control room could be expected
to keep a close w atch on pens 3 and 4. They had a direct view o f them from an elevated position through their
window. A lthough they had n o field-glasses, there was the zoom facility on the TV cam era. T he radio was by
then working again an d although reception was difficult d u e to crowd noise a n d possibly excessive a i r traffic
on channel 25. atte m p ts could have been m a d e to alert officers on the p erim ete r track to w atch for
overcrowding an d report their observations. In the event, pens 3 a n d 4 becam e m ore an d m ore crowded, surges
took place, fans were showing and signalling distress. N one o f this was seen o r recognised in the control room.

Officers on the Track
  245. T h e 20 officers detailed to the perim eter track were distrib u ted round the pitch so that so m e five
officers were at the west end. T h e ir w ritten instructio ns m ade n o reference to the avoidance or detec tio n o f
overcrowding. T h e sam e applied to the officers in the west stand. M r G reenw ood a d m itte d th a t his oral
briefings also c o n tain e d n o m e n tion o f m o n ito rin g the pens for overcrowding.

   246. T he O p era tio n a l O r d e r for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone “access to the track from the
terraces w ithout the consent o f a senior officer (except to receive medical atten tio n )” . At the end o f th e 1988
semi-final, there was a m in o r pitch invasion. Accordingly, tha t pro hib ition was em phasised in th e 1989
O perational O r d e r b y b e i n g p u t into capital letters. T h e co m bination o f no instru ctions as to overcrowding and
a strong p ro h ib itio n on opening the gates was likely to m ake police recognition o f crushing slow a n d their
response reluctant. Small w onder that the growing pressure a n d congestion between 2.50 pm a n d 2.59 pm
went u n hee ded o r certainly unrem edied. Even w hen officers recognised there was a problem , the rule required
consent o f a se n io r officer before a gate could be opened.

  247. "S en io r officer” m e a n t an officer o f Inspector rank or higher. T he Inspector in charge o f the 20 officers
on the track was M r Darling. He stationed h im self by the players' tunnel, the m ost central position for
supervising his m en. In evidence he said:

  "I would only take action if I thought crowding had got to such a stage th a t the fans were in danger. I'd then
  inform gro u n d control an d I would expect som eone deployed to the back o f the sta n d .”

  T h at u nderlines the inhibition against opening p erim eter gates. So did the evidence o f one C o n stab le who
said it had been so d r u m m e d into officers not to o p en the gates tha t when he saw distress in pen 4. he “ d e b a te d ”
with h im self before opening the gate, thinking: “ If I'm wrong. I’m going to get a right bollocking for this.”
Naturally, o n e w ould hope th a t co m m o n sense an d h u m a n ity would m ake some officers cut through th e rules
and open a gate if fans were clearly in distress,

   248. T h is is w hat h ap p e n ed , b ut not until officers recognised the distress and even then not im mediately.
Hence, gates 3 a n d 4, having been opened, were shut again before they were finally open e d an d at first those
seeking to c lim b out over the fence were pushed back. This reaction o f the police d id not go on for as long as
some w itnesses believed. T hey probably m isinterpreted the h a n d m ovem ents from M r G reenw ood a n d others
aimed at p e rsu a d in g fans to move back an d relieve the pressure as atte m p ts to stop those climbing o u t at the
front.

  249. Nevertheless, there was a period d u rin g which the failure to recognise the pro b lem and the inhibition
against tackling it caused vital tim e to be lost.

T he Officers in C om m and
    250. Even when realisation o f the problem cam e to officers on the track, it was som e m in u te s before it
reached the control room . W hen spectators first appeared on th e track, the im m ediate a ssu m p tio n in the
control room was th a t a pitch invasion was threatened. T his was unlikely at the beginning o f a match. It
b e c a m e still less likely when those on the track m a d e no move towards the pitch. M r M otson, the BBC
co m m e n ta to r, recognised and said, well before the m atch was stopped, th a t th e trouble seem ed to be
overcrow ding and n o t misbehaviour. Still, th e assum ption to the con tra ry persisted in th e control room . Until
M r M u rra y radioed f o r a fleet o f am bulances, about 3.06 pm, M r D uckenfield continued to treat th e incident
as a threat to the pitch an d to public order. T he message calling u p all available officers m e n tio n e d a pitch
invasion. O p eratio n S upport was initiated a n d dog handlers were requested.
    251. U ntil C h ie f S uperintendent N esbit arrived, th ere was no effective leadership either from control or on
the pitch to harness an d organise rescue efforts. N o orders were given for officers to enter th e tu n n e l a n d relieve
pressure. Som e officers did this on th e ir own initiative. Apart from the T annoy request to clear th e pitch, no
a tte m p t was m a d e to clear and m ark o f f a casualty are a where first-aid could b e given w ith o u t h in d ran c e by
fans a n d photographers milling ab o u t between the bodies. T here w as no co-ordination o f th e early provision o f
first-aid o r o f stretcher parties o r o f the rescue effort through gates 3 a n d 4. N o request for help was broadcast to
do cto rs a n d nurses in the crowd until a b o u t 3.29 pm w hen it was to o late. Probably, there was little tha t could
have been achieved in most cases however soon doctors had b een s u m m o n e d , b u t there w ere m arginal cases
w here earlier atten tio n might have m a d e a difference.
  252. T h e plight o f those behind the fencing an d the existence o f injuries were known to officers at the scene
from 3 pm . But th e M a jo r D isaster Plan was not started until 3.06 p m a t earliest when th e am b u la n c e service
was called. N o request for cutting gear o r for the fire brig ad e was m a d e u ntil 3.13 p.m. Again, it is unlikely that
these services could h ave saved lives if they had been called promptly, b u t it is possible.
Police on the Pitch
    253. D espite th e initial lack o f leadership, m any officers did all they h u m a n ly could to rescue a n d revive the
victims. M any su p p o rters who gave evidence paid trib u te to these efforts. It is also fair t o say th a t the n u m b e r
o f officers who could at first be usefully involved at th e two o pen gates was necessarily lim ited.
    254. C h ie f S uperintendent N esbit’s action in deploying a line o f officers across the m id d le o f the pitch has
already been m e n tio n e d . I can well u n d e rsta n d the rese n tm e n t it caused. However, th e police assertion th a t a
rush by som e fans towards the Kop end raised fears o f conflict are well b o r n e o u t by th e v id e o tape. In my
ju d g e m en t, C h ie f S u p erinte nden t N esbit was well ju stified in using so m e o f th e m a n y officers called u p
p u rsu an t to O p eratio n Support to prevent possible violence. To have h a d open fighting in a gro u n d where
s o m e 90 spectators already lay dea d w ould have been an u n th in k ab le an d obscene developm ent.
Fans on the Pitch
   255. M any fans w ho escaped o n to the pitch alive were in a state o f collapse o r close to it. M o st o f those who
retained th e ir stre n g th strove m agnificently to assist the victim s. They helped pull them clear, they helped w ith
first-aid; they helped carry the im provised stretchers.
  256. T h ere were fans, however, who were distraught, angry, d ru n k , o r all three. T h e ir c o n d u c t in abusing,
assaulting and spitting a t the police was disgraceful, the m ore so since earlier police failures h a d little to do
with those officers now doing th e ir best for the injured. In a d d itio n , the re were abuse a n d assaults on
am b u la n c e m en a n d firemen in th e course o f th e ir rescue work. T h is was probably b ecause the ir sim ilar
uniform s caused th e m to be m istaken for police. However, although the abuse was w idespread, the n u m b e r o f
assaults a n d spittings was on the evidence com paratively small. In deploring them , o n e m u s t recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience which those responsible had j u s t suffered a n d were still suffering.
False Reports
    257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reported in the press, an d said to have em an a ted from
police officers present at the m atch, o f “ mass d runkenne ss". It was said th a t d ru n k en fans urin ated on the
police while they were pulling the dea d a n d injured out, th a t others had even urinated o n th e bodies o f the d ea d
a n d stolen th e ir belongings. N o t a single w itness was called before the Inquiry to su p p o rt any o f those
allegations although every o p p o rtu n ity was afforded for any o f th e represented parties to have any w itness
called w hom they wished. As soon as the allegations I have m e n tio n e d were m a d e in th e press, M r Peter
Wright. C h ie f C onstable o f South Yorkshire, m a d e a dignified statem ent dissociating h im self from such grave

   258. The p e rim e te r gates in the pens were not designed as exits. They were in ten d ed to afford access by the
police to cope with any local d iso rd er o r with an emergency. T he kind o f emergency co n tem p lated was not
massive crushing but. for example, the collapse o r illness o f an individual. Emergency evacuation o f the pens
had been considered by the O fficer Working Party. Although fire risk was m inim al since the terraces, west
stand a n d tunnel were o f concrete construction, the fire brigade were the principal arb iters o f evacuation
procedure. T hey a im e d to be able to em p ty the pens in six m inutes. T he plan was to eva cua te spectators via the
tunnel. If for any reason tha t op tion becam e im practicable, eg d u e to a b o m b threat, th e n the alternative route
would be along the back o f the terraces, through the gates in the radial fences an d r o u n d the sides o f the west
stand. T h e fire brigade were satisfied that each o f these routes would enable the pens to be evacuated in less
than six m inutes, w ithout relying on the gates to the pitch. T hose gates would also be available, but th e ir use
was excluded from the calculation o f evacuation time.

  259. T he need to provide for speedy and large scale evacuation from th e front o f th e pens to th e pitch was
not anticipated. T h e G reen G uid e (1986) provides as follows:

  “ 209. Access to the pitch must be m a d e as difficult as possible in n o rm al circum stances while at th e sam e
  tim e ensuring that the police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose o f crowd control an d
  enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event o f serious emergency . . .

  214. . . . at som e m a jo r soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd m ovem ent form s a necessary part o f the
  safety m easures, it may be necessary to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in norm al
  circum stances . . . b u t allows foraccess in emergency.

  215. For most m a jo r stadia, w h eth e r used for association football o r o th e r sports, th e pitch p erim eter fence
  will be required eith er to prevent access to the pitch as m e n tio n e d above, or at least to discourage a ttem p ts
  by spectators to e n ter the playing area. Gates o r o th e r access points (m in im u m w id th 1.1 metres) should
  nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency . . . Provision o f such gates or access points is particularly
  im portant to allow full access to th e playing area (o r track) w here it is likely to be used as a place o f safety in
  an emergency.          Such gates o r access p o in ts should be properly stew arded a n d                         clearly
  m arked so th a t im m e d ia te access to the playing area o r p erim ete r track can be en s u re d ” .

  260. G ate 3 was .82 metres in width: gate 4 was .79 m etres in w idth. T here were therefore clear depa rture s
from the G reen G u id e standard.

  261. T he Safety Certificate provided (by Schedule 2 Paragraph 24) as follows:

  T h e (club) shall arrange for the S tadium to be inspected by a suitably qualified C h a rte r e d Engineer . . . at
  least once each period o f 12 m o n th s . . . and . . . shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
  the . . . Council a Certificate by the said C h a rtered Engineer as to th e c u r re n tc o m p lia n c e o rn o n - c o m p lia n c e
  with . . . the ap p ro p ria te provisions and r e c o m m e n d atio n s o f th e (G reen) G uide o f all structural parts o f the
  S tadium . . .

  262. It was argued that there was no breach o f th e Safety C e rtificate since the G re en G u id e specifically
provides for flexibility. However, in my view the Safety C ertificate cannot and certainly should not be
interpreted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic requ irem ents as the size o f exit gates to th e total
discretion o f the club a n d its advisers. O ne o f the m a tte rs for consideration at stage two o f this inquiry will be
whether, an d in w hat respects, the G reen G uide nee ds to be clarified a n d toughened.

   263. D r E astw ood explained the small width o f the gates by reference to the d ile m m a facing th e police. T hey
w anted a gate sufficient for its in ten d ed purpose ie police access an d small scale emergencies. O n the o th e r
h an d , they d id not w ant a flood gate o f such size as to end a n g er the p rim e principle o f preventing pitch
invasions. In the light o f Hillsborough, this is p erhaps the m ost poignant exam ple o f th e difficulty o f achieving
a balance between s topping hooliganism an d ensuring crowd safety.

   264. Even if th e w idth o f gates 3 a n d 4 had com plie d with the present G reen G u id e s ta n d ard , they would
have been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure a n d release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
G reen G u id e says nothing ab o u t th e n u m b e r o f gates required for a pen o f given size. Whilst the Club,


                                                                   45
D r Eastwood, the Officer Working Party and the local a u th o rity can be criticised for failing strictly to conform
to the G uide, the real failure was c o m m o n to all those who have been responsible for considering safety on the
terraces. T he anxiety to protect the sanctity o f the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk
o f a crush due to overcrowding. C ertain it was. that once the crush o ccurred on 15 April gates 3 an d 4 were
w holly in adequate for rescue purposes.

  265. T h e im m e d ia te cause o f the gross overcrow ding a n d hence the disaster was the failure, when gate C was
opened, to cut o ff access to the central pens which were already overfull.

  266. T hey were already overfull because no safe m a x im u m capacities had been laid down, n o a tte m p t was
m ade to control entry to individual pens num erically an d there was no effective visual m onitorin g o f crowd
density.

   267. W hen the influx from gate C entered pen 3. the layout o f the barriers there afforded less protection
th a n it should a n d a b a rrier collapsed. Again, the lack o f vigilant m onito ring caused a sluggish reaction an d
response w hen the crush occurred. T he small size an d n u m b e r o f gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So.
in the initial stages, did lack o f leadership.

   268. T he need to open gate C was d u e to dangerous congestion a t the turnstiles. T h a t occurred because, as
both C lub a n d police should have realised, th e turnstile area could not easily cope with the large n u m b e rs
d e m a n d e d o f it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. T he O perational O rd e r an d police tactics on

    269. T h e FA were strongly criticised by th e Football Supporters' A ssociation a n d others for having
im p o sed the H illsborough v en u e on Liverpool for a second year running. T h e Liverpool supporters had to
travel m uch fu rth er to Sheffield than th e ir N o ttin g h am rivals. T h e police req u ired th a t if th e m atch was to be a t
Hillsborough at all. L iverpool would h av e to have the west a n d north side ac co m m o d atio n . T h e disadvantages
o f th a t a n d th e d is p a ra te n u m b e rs of h o m e sup p o rters o f th e two clubs have alread y been set out. Liverpool h a d
h a d to knuckle u n d e r to th e arran g e m en t in 1988. T hey resented having it im p o sed in 1989. To h old the m atch
at O ld Trafford w ould h av e been a perfectly g o o d a n d accep tab le alternative. Indeed, th e FA n o m in ate d O ld
Trafford as th e v en u e for th e replay s h o u ld there be a d raw at Hillsborough.

   270. M r Kelly, th e FA’s C h ie f Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring Hillsborough, b u t th eo n ly o n e
w hich seem ed to have any validity was th a t th e 1988 m a tch h ad been co n sid ered a successfully m anaged event.
H e a d m itte d th a t a telep h o n e call from th e C h ie f Executive o f th e Liverpool C lu b protesting and p u ttin g
L iverpool's case h ad n o t been m en tio n e d to th e FA c o m m itte e which finally decided th e venue. M r Kelly
frankly co n ced ed th a t “ th e re was an elem e n t o f un fairn ess" to Liverpool in choosing Hillsborough for a second
tim e. I th in k th e d ecision was ill-considered. N o d o u b t in future th e FA will b e m o re sensitive a n d responsive
to reasonable representations.

  271. However, it was n o t suggested th a t th e choice o f v e n u e was cau sativ e o f this disaster. T h e only basis on
which th a t could be said would be th a t, because o f its layout, the Leppings L ane end was incapable o f b eing

   272. T h e re was m uch bitterness am ongst Liverpool su p p o rters that they h ad to m ake do again for the
second year w ith th e Leppings Lane end. But, cogent as their c o m p lain ts were, they am o u n te d to reasons for
choosing a different g ro u n d altogether. G iv en Hillsborough as th e venue. 1 th in k th e police were right to
allocate th e sections o f th e ground as they did. T h e directio n o f arrival an d the n eed for segregation m a d e it
sensible a n d to reverse th e 1988 a rrang em en ts would have m a d e for confusion. As w ith choice o f venue, 1 do

Police Planning
   273. T h e O p eratio n al O rd e r for 1989 left m u c h unsaid. A part from th e lack o f an y provision for late o r
congested arrivals, o r any provision for th e av o id an c e o f overcrow ding on th e terraces, there was a n u m b e r o f
oth er om issions. For exam ple, there was no specific d ep lo y m en t o f officers to m a n th e p erim eter gates. T h e
O rd e r d id n o t detail the d u ties o f th e m o u n te d officers deployed at th e Leppings L an e entrance, who included
Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling th e ir own fans. T h e d u ties o f S u p erin te n d en ts (especially M r
G reen w o o d a n d M r M arshall) were not d efin ed so as to ach iev e clarity a n d efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision req u irin g m o b ile (Tango) patrols to assist the em ergency services was o m itte d from th e text.

   274. T h e 1988 O rd e r was never substantially reviewed save to reduce th e n u m b e r o f officers deployed in
sh opping areas an d to em ph asise in capital letters the em bargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
with th e 1988 event led to complacency. T h a t so m e thought th e pens overfull in 1988 an d that th e tu n n e l was
closed o f f on th a t occasion d id not figure in o r influence th e plan for 1989.

   275. M r D uckenfield was p ro m o ted a n d p u t in charge o f F D ivision only 21 days before this semi-final. T h e
pre-p lan n in g was already in progress u n d er M r M ole who h a d been in c o m m a n d bo th in 1987 a n d in 1988. It
m ight have been wiser to have left M r M ole in charge o f this operation. O n th e o th e r h a n d , it is quite
u n d ersta n d ab le th at M r Duckenfield sh o u ld have been exp ected to take c o m m a n d o f events in his Division
from th e d a te o f his p ro m o tio n . In view o f his lack o f experience a t H illsborough a n d o f a semi-final m atch,
however, it was im p erativ e th a t he be fully briefed an d that he sho u ld also b rie f himself.

   276. H e was n o t in fo rm ed o f th e crushing incid en t in 1981 n o r d id he m a k e inquiries w hich w ould have
revealed it. H e d id not know the arran g e m en t as between C lu b a n d police for m o n ito rin g th e Leppings Lane

Policing on the Day
   277. O n e o f th e regrettable features o f th e football scene as it has developed is th e e n o rm o u s e x p e n d itu re o f
money, tim e an d effort in em ploying large n u m b e rs o f police all over the c o u n try to guard against th e sort o f
d iso rd er a n d m isb eh a v io u r which have b e c o m e endemic. Police m a n ag e m en t o f a g a m e o f football has b eco m e
a m ilitary operation. T h e problem s faced a n d th e responses received m u st be d ish earten in g a n d m a y have
ten d ed to h ard e n police attitu d es to sup p o rters in general.

  278. It is fair to state th a t over m any years th e South Y orkshire Police have given excellent service to the
public. T hey have h an d le d crowd p roblem s sensitively a n d successfully at a large n u m b e r o f football games
including m a jo r m atches, durin g strikes in th e coal in d u stry a n d the steel industry, an d in o th e r contexts.
Unfortunately, their policing on 15 April b ro k e down in th e ways already d escrib ed and, although th e re were
oth er causes, the m ain reason for the disa ste r was th e failure o f police control,

   279. In all so m e 65 police officers gave oral evidence at th e Inquiry. Sadly I m u s t report th at for th e m ost
part th e q uality o f th e ir evidence was in inverse p rop o rtio n to th e ir rank. T h ere w ere many young Constables
who as w itnesses were alert, intelligent a n d open. O n the day, they a n d m an y o th ers strove heroically in ghastly
circ u m sta n ce s aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victim s. They inspired confidence a n d hope,

   280. By co ntrast, w ith som e n otable exceptions, the se n io r officers in c o m m a n d were defensive a n d evasive
witnesses. T h e ir feelings o f grief a n d sorrow were o b v io u s a n d genuine. N o d o u b t th o se feelings were
intensified by the knowledge th a t such a disaster had o ccu rred u n d er th e ir m an agem ent. But, n e ith e r their
h an d lin g o f p ro b lem s on the d ay nor th e ir acco u n t o f it in evidence showed th e qualities o f leadership to be
expected o f th e ir rank.

   282. W hen M r M arshall s request came. M r D u c k e n fie ld s cap acity to take d ecisio n s a n d give o rders
seem ed to collapse. H aving sanctioned, at last, th e o p ening o f the gates, he failed to give necessary
consequential o rd ers or to exert any control w hen th e disaster occurred. H e m isin te rp reted the em ergence o f
fans from pen s 3 a n d 4. W hen he was unsure o f th e problem , he sent others down to "assess the situ atio n "
r ath e r th a n d esce n d to see for himself. H e gave no in fo rm atio n to th e crowd.

   283. M ost surprisingly, he gave M r Kelly an d o th ers to th in k th a t there h ad been a n inrush d u e to Liverpool
fans forcing o p en a gate. This was n o t only u n tru th fu l. It set o ff a widely rep o rted allegation against the
su p p o rters w hich caused grave offence an d distress. It revived against football fans, a n d especially those from
Liverpool, ac cu satio n s o f hooliganism which cau sed reaction n ot only natio n w id e b u t from Europe too. I can
only assu m e th a t M r D uckenfield’s lack o f c a n d o u r on this occasion w<as o u t o f character. H e said his reason for
not telling th e tru th was that if th e crowd b ec am e aw are o f it there m ight be a very hostile reaction an d this
m ight im p e d e rescue work. H e d id n o t wish to divulge w hat h ad h ap p e n e d until h e h ad spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell M r Kelly th e tru th d id not req u ire th a t he be to ld a falsehood. Moreover,
alth o u g h A ssistant C h ief Constable Jackson was at h an d . M r D uckenfield d id not disclose th e tru th to him
until m uch later.

   284. T h e likeliest explanation o f M r D uckenfield's co n d u c t is th a t he simply could not face th e en o rm ity o f
th e decision to o p en th e gates a n d all that flowed therefrom . T h a t would explain w h at he said to M r Kelly, w hat
he d id n o t say to M r Jackson, his aversion to ad d re ssin g the crowd a n d his failure to ta k e effective control o f the
disaster situ atio n . H e froze.

The Police C ase at the Inquiry
   285. It is a m a tte r o f regret th a t at th e hearing, a n d in th e ir subm issions, the S o u th Yorkshire Police were not
p rep ared to co n ced e they were in any respect at fault in w hat o ccurred. M r D uckenfield, u n d er pressure o f
cro ss-ex am in atio n , apologised for b lam ing the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But. that ap art, the police
case was to b la m e th e fans for being la te a n d d ru n k , a n d to b lam e th e C lu b for failing to m o n ito r the pens. It was
argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate C b u t was d u e to b arrier 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic a p p ro a ch gives cau se foranxiety as to w h eth er lessons have been learnt. It would
have been m o r e seemly an d encouraging for th e fu tu re if responsibility h ad been faced.

       286. T he p e rfo rm an c e by the City Council o f its duties in regard to the Safety C ertificate was inefficient a n d
    dilatory. T h e failure to revise or a m en d the certificate over the p erio d o f three years preceding this disaster,
    despite im p o rta n t changes in the layout o f the g ro u n d , was a serious breach o f duty. T h ere were, as a result, no
    fixed capacities for the pens. T h e certificate took no acco u n t o f th e 1981 a n d 1985 a lteratio n s to th e ground.

      287. A n u m b e r o f breaches o f G reen G u id e sta n d a rd s were p e rm itte d a n d persisted eg th e spacing o f th e

      288. T h e A dvisory G ro u p lacked a pro p er structure; its p ro ce d u re was casual a n d unbusinesslike. Its

                                           T H E CLUB A ND DR EA STW O O D

    289. It sh o u ld be recorded th a t in general th e Club has over th e years a d o p te d a responsible an d
conscientious ap p ro a c h to its responsibilities. It retained the services o f D r E astw ood as co n su ltan t engineer
a n d a b id e d by his advice. For his part, D r Eastwood is skilled a n d experienced in this field, as already
indicated, a n d he sought I have no d o u b t to act efficiently and professionally in his ad v ic e and practical work.
T h e Club also reta in e d M r Lock who had ac q u ired great experience an d knowledge o f H illsborough during his
police service. A n u m b e r o f witnesses d escribed Hillsborough as a very good g round, “o n e o f the best in th e
co u n try ” . T h e police agreed th a t relations between th e m an d th e C lub were good. O v e r th e last fo u r years, th e
Club h ad sp en t som e £ 1'/: m illion o n ground im provem ents.

   290. N evertheless, there are a n u m b e r o f respects in which failure by th e Club co n trib u te d to th is disaster.
T h ey were responsible as occupiers a n d in v ito rs fo r the layout a n d stru ctu re o f th e g ro u nd . T h e Leppings Lane
en d was unsatisfactory an d ill-suited to a d m it the n u m b e rs invited, for reasons alread y spelt out. T h e Club was
aware o f th ese p roblem s a n d discussed solving th e m in various ways between 1981 a n d 1986. In the result,
there r e m a in e d the sam e n u m b e r o f turnstiles, a n d th e sam e p rob lem s o u tsid e a n d inside them. T h e plan for
this sem i-final, involving as it did th e loss o f 12 turnstiles for the n o rth stand a n d large n um bers to be fed in
from Leppings Lane, was o n e agreed betw een th e Club a n d the police. T h e C lu b knew best w h at rate o f
a d m issio n th e turnstiles could m an ag e a n d o ught to have alerted th e police to the risks o f the turnstiles being
sw am ped.

   291. T h e alteratio n s inside the turnstiles a n d on the terraces clearly affected capacity, b u t n o specific
allowance was m a d e for them . In th a t respect, b o th D r E astw ood a n d the Club sh o u ld have ta k en a m ore
positive a p p ro a ch . Either a schem e such as o n e o f those D r E astw ood p u t forw ard sh o u ld have b een ad o p ted
giving m o re turnstiles and total separation o f areas o r at the very least th e capacity o f th e new pens and o f th e
te rraces as a w hole should have been treated m o re cautiously. T h e police view in 1981 th a t 10.100 was too high
a figure was know n to the Club (although D r E astw ood says n o t to him). Yet. d esp ite th a t and the sub-division
in to pens, th e figure rem ained.

   292. A lthough the police h a d ass u m e d responsibility for m o n ito rin g the pens, the Club had a duty to its
visitors a n d th e C lu b ’s officials ought to have alerted th e police to th e grossly uneven d istrib u tio n o f fans on the
terraces. T h e C lu b o perated a n d read th e closed circuit television a n d th e c o m p u te r totaliser. Liaison between
C lub a n d police on th e day failed to alert th e latter to th e n u m b e r o f Liverpool su p p o rte rs still to come. T h e
o n u s here was on th e Club as well as on th e police.

    293. T h e rem oval o f b arrier 144 was th e responsibility o f th e C lu b alth o u g h it clearly acted on th e advice o f
 D r E astw ood a n d the Advisory G ro u p w hich in this instance was m isguided.

   294. Likewise, th e breaches o f th e G reen G u id e were m a tte rs u n : h m e C lub sh o u ld have ap p reciated an d
 rem edied.

    295 Lastly as already indicated, the p o o r signposting on th e conco u rse te n d ed to p ro d u ce under-filling o f
 th e w ing pen s a n d over-filling o f pen s 3 an d 4. Poor signposting o u tsid e th e tu rn stiles a n d the unhelpful form at
 o f th e tickets also led to confusion aggravating th e build-up in th e tu rn stile area.

    No Fault by the Emergency Services
       296. I say a t th e outset o f this ch ap ter that no valid criticism can be m a d e o f th e response by th e St Jo h n
    A m bulance Brigade. b y S Y M A S or by the fire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represen ted party v en tu re d any
    criticism o f th e m . T h e only a ttac k on SYM AS c a m e from two L iverpool doctors. O n e claim ed th a t am b u lan c es
    did not a rriv e swiftly or w ith sufficient eq u ip m e n t a n d that th e re was a lack o f triage. H e was proved to be
    wrong in all three respects. U nfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 15 April w hen he said m o re
    lives could have been saved if sta ff an d e q u ip m en t h a d arrived earlier. A part from being proved w rong in fact
    as to the tim es o f arrival o f am bulances, he co n ced ed in evidence that it was not possible to say w h eth e r lives
    could have b ee n saved. His co m m en ts on television were irresponsible. T h e o th e r d o cto r co m plain ed o f th e
    absence o f defibrillators. I a m satisfied on overw helm ing evidence that to atte m p t to use a defibrillator on th e
    pitch w ith people milling a b o u t would have been highly d angerous owing to the risk o f injury from the electric
    charge.

      297. I find th a t all three o f th e emergency services nam ed above responded p ro m p tly w hen alerted , th a t
    they b rought a p p ro p riate e q u ip m e n t an d th a t th e ir personnel o p era ted efficiently.

      298. It w ould be u n reaso n ab le to expect, at any sports stad iu m , m edical facilities capable o f dealing with a
    major d isa ste r such as o ccurred. To have in ad v a n ce at the g ro u n d , oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, o th e r
    eq uipm ent a n d m edical sta ff sufficient to deal w ith over 100 casualties is n o t practicable.

      299. W h a t is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid. for professional m edical a tte n tio n a n d for
    am bulance atten d a n ce , together with a system o f co -ordination w ith th e em ergency services w hich will b rin g
    them to the scene swiftly in w hatever n u m b e rs are required. W h a t will a m o u n t to a n a p p ro p riate basic
    provision for the future eg the eq u ip m e n t in a first aid room, req u ires ex p ert ev aluatio n a n d advice.

       300. O n th e day, there was no clear u n d ersta n d in g between the C lu b and D r Purcell as to his role. H e
    believed he was prim arily there to attend to the players. T h e C lu b regarded him also as th e “physician available
    to attend at the first aid ro o m if required”, as laid down in the Safety Certificate.

      301. T h ere was insufficiently close co-operation between th e police a n d the em ergency services. It is clear
    that SYMAS a n d the fire b rig ad e should have been called earlier th a n th ey were. However, in view o f the n atu re
    and extent o f the crushing, the tim e w hen police rescue began an d the pathetically short p erio d for w hich those
    unable to b re a th e could survive, it is im probable th a t quicker recourse to the em ergency services would have
    saved m o re lives.

       302. Finally, there was ev id en ce th a t an ad v ertisin g b oard h ad to be k n o ''1 1 d ow n at the north-east co rn e r
    o f the g ro u n d to allow an am b u lan c e o nto the pitch an d that at the to p o         r?m p leading to th e pitch the
    access for am b u lan c es was inadequate. T h ere was also evidence th a t the pre-m atch arran g em en t for
    ambulances to use th e two gates from Penistone R o ad at the no rth -east en d o f the gro u n d as in a n d out routes
    was frustrated by the presence o f vehicles ju st inside the ground. In the event, n o n e o f these m atte rs affected
    operations. T h e h o ardin g was quickly knocked down. T h e difficult access to the r a m p was negotiated an d
    ambulances used one en tran ce satisfactorily by backing out w h en loaded.




                                                                  53

    303.      O n e problem which im p ed ed police control a n d the gathering o f intelligence was the in term itten t
failure o f co m m u n ic a tio n by radio. T here was the period o f two or three m inutes w h en the control ro o m was
o u t o f radio contact. Even when that was rem edied, it was only by using a hand set in the control room. This
m ean t that control could not o verride any o th e r messages. N o effective radio c o m m u n ic a tio n seems to have
reached control from the p erim eter track at the relevant tim e. M r G reen w o od 's request for the m a tch to be
stopped a n d various messages from Constables reporting the distress in the pens d id not register. Likewise,
co m m u n ic a tio n from Leppings Lane to control was unreliable. U ndoubtedly these b reakdow ns m a d e it more
difficult for those in c o m m an d to m ak e prop er assessm ents an d exercise effective co m m a n d .

Limited Objectives
  304. It is im p o rta n t to stress the lim ited objectives o f the in terim rec o m m e n d a tio n s 1 can m ake in this
Report. My purpose is to propose instant m easures capable o f being im p lem en ted forthw ith and where
possible before the c o m m en c em en t o f the 1989/1990 season. T hey are designed to prevent overcrow ding an d
crushing on terraces in the short term and to im prove safety procedures. They d o not an d can no t m eet all the
problem s or address all the issues o f post-H illsborough football. W ider issues such as m e m b ersh ip schemes,
identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia an d long term re c o m m e n d a tio n s fall to be considered in my Final
Report. So d o a n u m b e r o f o th e r specific m atte rs such as a co m p reh en siv e review o f the G reen G u id e, the
problem o f excessive pre-m atch drinking, fans w ithout tickets an d ticket touts. I m en tio n these m a tte rs lest it
be th o u g h t I have d ecided no reco m m e n d atio n s need be m a d e concerning them . I have not. But before
deciding w hat if any rec o m m e n d atio n s to m ake ab o u t these a n d o th e r m atters, more evidence and study is
required.

   305. Accordingly, the m ain thrust o f these interim rec o m m e n d atio n s, as a holding exercise, is to reduce
n u m b ers on the terraces, to increase vigilance and to achieve a pro p er balance in crowd control between
prevention o f d iso rd er an d m aintenance o f safety.


P erim eter Fences
  306. It would be im practical and unwise to rec o m m e n d w orks o f constru ctio n o r radical structural changes
now. before c om pleting the extensive study an d consu ltatio n w hich will form stage two o f this Inquiry. Hasty
interim r e c o m m e n d a tio n s o f that kind m ight well prove to be ill-judged after further study and require to be
changed in a m a tte r o f m o n th s.

   307. In particular. 1 d o not at this stage m ake any re c o m m e n d a tio n as to rem oving p erim eter fences or
replacing th em with stru ctu res o f different design. U n d erstan d ab ly , there was a wave o f p o p u lar feeling against
such fences in the im m ed iate afterm ath o f H illsborough. T h e horrifying spectacle o f people being crushed
against the fencing focussed blam e for th e disaster on th e fences themselves. T here were pleas to dism antle
them a n d em o tiv e references to the fans being treated like "cag ed an im als” . S o m e clubs rem oved th e ir fencing
straightaway. It was therefore very te m p tin g to consider at an early stage m ak in g a re c o m m e n d atio n that the
fences sho u ld be rem oved. I confess to being so tem pted.

  308. Regrettably, only a m o n th after H illsborough, there were incidents w hich showed that violence and
hooliganism are still liable to erupt at football grounds. O n 13 May at Selhurst Park. Birm ingham City
supporters invaded the pitch and fought with supporters o f the hom e club. C rystal Palace. Five police officers
and 16 su p p o rters were inj-'red and required trea tm e n t at a local hospital. O n the sam e day at a m atch between
Bristol C ity an d Sheffield I nited. spectators spilt o n to th e pitch an d there ■■    , u i r ngonthu: t r a c e s . At the
Cup Final between Liverpool and Everton on 20 May. there was a pitch invasion, albeit a com paratively
benign one.

   309. Even the Football Supporters' A ssociation (FSA) felt it necessary to say in their final subm ission.

        " W ith som e reservations, the FSA accept th a t p erim eter fences are necessary for crowd control."

   310. Bearing in m in d those matters, a n d the need to co n sid er fu rth er ex p ert evidence. I have decided that it
would be unwise an d p re m a tu re for me to m ak e any re c o m m e n d a tio n s now e ith e r to remove or to preserve or
to alter the structure o f perim eter fences. 1 shall m ak e re c o m m e n d a tio n s ab o u t th e m in my Final Report.

  311. For the present. 1 would em p h asise that, although the fencing p revented escape, the real cause o f the
Hillsborough disaster was overcrowding an d it is against th at d anger that m y interim rec o m m e n d a tio n s are
prim arily directed. W hilst declining to re c o m m e n d the removal o f the fences. I d o consider that the gates to the
pitch sh o u ld be kept o p en whilst the terraces are occupied. T h is will have. I hope, three beneficial effects.
Obviously, an o p en gate is a more ready escape route th an o ne w hich has to be locked. Secondly, th e sight o f
open gates will be reassuring to spectators on the terraces. Thirdly, the existence o f gaps in the fencing by
reason o f the o p en gates will concentrate the m in d s o f police officers or stew ards on the track to th e need for
careful m o n i to r i n g o f those on the terraces.


                                                              55
    312. It will o f course be necessary to have a police presence sufficient to prevent pitch invasion for im p ro p e r
reaso n s through th e o p en gates. However. 1 a m encouraged to think that this is not an in su p erab le problem by
th e fact that, for ex a m p le at Anfield, L iverpool's g round, there were no gates in the p erim eter fencing before it
w as tak en down. T h ere were instead gaps o r "access p o in ts" as they are called in the G reen G u id e (paragraph
21 5). T h e ir existence d id not. so far as 1 am aware, prevent the a u th o ritie s from m a in ta in in g order. Also, the
gates were o p en th ro u g h o u t the replay o f this ill-fated semi-final a t Old Trafford on 7 May 1989.


Reduced Numbers
   313. In the assessm en t o f figures for capacity, the criteria in C h a p te r 16 o f the G reen G u id e were n o t at
H illsborough, a n d m ay not elsewhere, have been applied with sufficient rigour. T herefore, in a d d itio n to

figure for m a x im u m capacity in acco rd ance w ith the G re en G uide, 1 rec o m m e n d red u cin g th a t figure by a
fu rth e r 15% as an in terim measure.


Safety Certificate
   314. T h e Safety C ertificate p ro ced ure should, if it is properly a d m in iste re d an d enforced, go far tow ards

au th o rity issuing the Certificate, 1 d o not know w h eth e r the p o o r p erfo rm an ce o f th e local au th o rity at
H illsborough was typical. A rgum ents have been pu t to m e suggesting the need for som e natio n al oversight o r
in sp ectio n o f local au th o rity certification procedures. T h is raises co m p lex issues which 1 shall want to c o n s id e r

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
★         1. W here a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
        should specify the maximum number o f spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

        A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained" notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
        another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

★        2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 o f the Green
        Guide (“the Green Guide figure” ) subject to the following qualifications:-

        (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
            which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
            in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

        (b) after assessin g “the Green Guide figure", a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
            margin.

★        3. Arrangements should be made:-

        (a) to limit the number o f spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
            figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
            ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

        (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
★          4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
        responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
        . ‘her terraced area and the monitoring o f spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
        variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

    ★     5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
        area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
        sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
        period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
        or police presence. H e should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
        below, and by radio to the control room.


    Fences and Gates
          6.    All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
        duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
        crowd densities, to the recognition o f signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
        demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
        different crowd densities.

    ★     7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
        different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency Exit”.



                                                             57
★        8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
        when spectators are on the terrace.

★         9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
        a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
        The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be s o by all
        stewards and police officers in that vicinity. H e should be able to make radio contact with the control room
        either him self or via an officer close at hand.

★         10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
        are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
        necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
        brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W hether to use it should beadecision of a
        nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
★          11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
        to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

★         12. The layout o f barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
        complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 o f the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessm ent of the
        maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
        reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
          13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
        which should consult the club in respect o f w hich the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
        ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection o f the stadium. Its
        object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
        substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
        recommendations in this report.

          14. Any local authority within w hose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
        which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

          15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
        Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


           16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, mt storing, enforcing, reviewing,
        amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
        accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
        effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
        with the local authority 's rules.

           17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
        of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives o f the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
        the building authority, of the club and o f a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group's terms of
        reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
        ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
        and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
        w ritten reports for consideration by the local authority.


    Duties of each Football Club
    ★      18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
         inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable o f admitting spectators at the rate
         anticipated.
★       19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
      as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
      turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity o f that viewing area should be reduced
      accordingly.

★       20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
      reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
      operators for this purpose.

        21.    Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, w ithin
      concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

★       22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
      reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
      and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
      area.

★       23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, sim ple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
      the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
      should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

★      24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
      by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
      admitting spectators to the ground.

        2S. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
      entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
★       26. The C hief Constable o f each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
      should nominate a ch ief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
      concerned in respect of the safety and control o f crowds.

★       27. T he Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
      officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
      is detected, o f taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

★       28. T he Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
      any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
      sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

★      29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion o f the officer in command at the ground.
      Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

          30.     There should be available in the police control room the results o f all closed circuit television
       monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting o f numbers
       at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area o f the ground. O fficers in the control room should be skilled
       in the interpretation and use of these data.


    Communications
         31.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
       received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
       priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the sam e channel. Additional channels should be
       used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding o f the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
       sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.




                                                           59
      32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
    with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

      33. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
    areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
    announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
    noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
    match.

      34. U se should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
    Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a sim ple code o f hand signals to indicate to
    the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
★      35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
    liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★     36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
    ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
    spectators expected, their likely routes o f entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
    concerning the control or movement o f the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
    rooms of each of the emergency services.

★     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium o f emergency vehicles from all three
    services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
    within the ground itself.

★     38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
    the arrival o f emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
    they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
★     39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
    club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

      40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number o f such rooms and the
    equipment to be maintained w ithin them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
    medical advice and should be made a requirement o f any Safety Certificate.

★     41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at es>ch match and available to deal with
    any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. H e should be
    present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
    match. H is w hereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
    contactable.

★     42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
    attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

      43. The number o f ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
    be specified bv the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement o f the Safety Certificate.

                                                   S P E C IFIC IN C ID E N T S

M r H icks' Evidence
    1. M r an d Mrs H icks' tw o daughters died in the disaster. They had arriv ed early en famille b u t had tickets
for different sections. T h e tw o daughters h a d standing tickets: they went in to p en 3. Mrs H icks h ad a seat in the
n o rth stand. M r H icks took up a standing position in pen 1ju st below a n d to the west o f th e police box at ab o u t
2.15 p m F rom there, he had a view o f th e centre pens. H e kept an eye on th e m as they filled up since he knew his
d au g h ters to be there.

    2. H is evidence was th a t by 2.50 p m he could see people were in distress. At ab o u t 2.55 pm he a n d others
called to a senior police officer at the to p o f the steps to the control box to d raw his atten tio n to the crushing. M r
H icks was only a b o u t 10 feet from the officer. H e d escribed him as w earing a flat cap w ith gold o r silver b ra id
a n d a light colo u red anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officer who sto p p e d the match. M r G reenw ood, w ho
d id stop the m atch , was certainly not wearing a light coloured ano rak , as can clearly be seen on the video.

  3. M r Hicks says th a t he a n d others shou ted several tim es to this officer in a tte m p ts to alert him to the
distress in th e pens. T h ere was no reaction although M r Hicks believes the ofificermust h av e been in earshot.

   4. T h a t officer descen d ed from the steps an d tw o cam e ra m e n w h o m M r H icks believed were from
television cam e a n d ap p e are d to direct th e ir cam eras towards the pens. A n o th e r senior officer ap p eared two
steps dow n from the platform . He was a stocky figure; he also wore a flat cap b u t with black braid. M r Hicks
says th a t he a n d tw o o r three others tried several tim es to cap tu re this officer’s atten tio n w ith o u t success. T h en
M r H icks says he sh o u te d “ For Christ’s sake! C an’t you see w hat’s going on? We can, an d you have cam eras” . T h e
officer is said to have replied dismissively “ Shut your fucking p ra ttle ”.

  5. W h en the d isaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. V ictoria was p u t in an am b u lan ce a n d M r
Hicks ac c o m p a n ie d h er to hospital where she was fo u nd to be dead. S arah d ie d at the ground.

  6. M r Hicks was an impressive w itness an d , d esp ite his grievous loss, rem a rk a b ly stoical. He gave his
evidence clearly a n d w ithout rancour. H e was certainly m istaken a b o u t M r G re en w o o d being o ne o f those on
the steps a n d it has n o t been possible to identify eith er officer from M r H ick s’ d escriptions. H e may well also
have been im precise as to timings. Nevertheless. I see no reason to d o u b t th a t w hat he d escribed did occur in
relation to tw o officers. As M r Hicks generously said himself, the d ism issiv e abuse fro m the second officer
(although reprehensible) may have been d u e to his b eing p reoccupied w ith trying to see w h at was h ap p e n in g at
pens 3 a n d 4 a r o u n d kick-off time.

T h e G oalkeeper and G ate 4
   7. M r B a m b ro ck , a Liverpool supporter, said he went through th e tu n n el. H e w ould have liked to have
tu rn ed back when he saw how crowded the pens were. H e went wi;n his fa, u “r a n d 13 y ea r old b ro th e r Stephen
tow ards the front o f pen 4. H e saw the team s com e o n to the pitch. C ondit o -.s a t the fro n t were, he said, alright
until a b o u t 2 m in u te s to 3. T h en the pressure in the p en increased a n d he a n d his father b ecam e separated. His
feet c am e o ff the ground. H e shouted to police officers through the fence to get th em o u t a n d help them . T h e
police d id not react. T h e Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce G robbelaar. spoke to a policem an on the track. T h e gate
was then o p en e d by a blo n d e policew oman a n d a b o u t 25 to 30 people w ent th rough it. T h ey included th e
witness’s father a n d his b ro th e r Stephen who had a broken arm . A police C on stab le s h u t the gate. It was th en
reopened by the sa m e policew oman, the witness thought, a n d he got out.

   8. M r Eccleston. a m ale nurse a n d an im pressive witness, was sitting in th e n o rth stan d . H e noticed pen s 3
a n d 4 were full a n d realised som ething was wrong w h en fans started co m in g over the p erim ete r fence b u t d id
not invade the pitch. H e said the Liverpool goalkeeper ap p e are d to n otice th is too.

  9. M r G ro b b e la a r was o u t o f th e co u n try du rin g the Inquiry a n d was therefore n o t called. However, he
m ade a sta te m e n t w hich was put in as his evidence. In the course o f it he s a id :-

   “ Kick-off h a p p e n e d a n d we got in to o u r stride p retty quickly - we forced a co rn er pretty early on an d the ball
   cam e dow n to my en d - I rolled it o u t t6 the full back once a n d play w ent on until Peter Beardsley hit the
   crossbar o f th e N o ttin g h a m Forest goal from a co rn e r a n d cam e back in to play. I re m e m b e r ju st after that
   there were sh o u ts a n d scream s from th e crowd ju s t b eh in d m e, it was different: not th e o rd in ary crowd noise
   a n d I tu rn e d a r o u n d to look. W h a t am a z e d m e first wus the c o n c en tra tio n a n d squash o f fans in the centre
section, the end areas still had plenty o f space. It was only then 1 becam e conscious th a t the crowd was
squashing forw ard and wasn't able to go sideways and that's when I noticed the fencing alongside them
holding them in. I saw fans being pulled up in to the stand above the terraces. I saw fans clim bing over into the
em p ty areas a t the side a n d I saw fans clim bing o u t over the front onto th e pitch which was particularly
difficult because o f the spikes on the top o f the fencing b u t they were getting out.
    "Play was still going on a n d I was in a terrible position trying to co n cen trate on play a n d having my
a tte n tio n tak en by w hat was happening b e h in d me. The ball cam e down to o u r end a n d N o ttin g h am Forest
won a corner, it was taken a n d we cleared o u r box area a n d as play was going forw ard over the centre line 1
heard a shout, ‘Bruce - please help' - a desperate shout from a fan sq u ash ed u p against the fencing to the
right o f my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces. H e scream ed, ‘Please get th e fucking gate open - Help,
help'. All th e peo p le w ho could speak were p leading for help. T here were tw o policem en near the gate right
alongside th e fan w ho h ad shouted to m e a n d so I sh o u ted to them , ‘G et th e gate o pen ’. I was still trying to
co n c en tra te on play a n d was still having my a tte n tio n taken by w hat was h a p p e n in g b eh in d m e - there were
lots o f fans on the pitch b e h in d the goal area by th e m too. 1 called again to th e policem en, ‘O p en the fucking
gate’ a n d o n e ju s t tu rn e d away from m e a n d looked back at the crowd b u t the o th e r went to the gate and
o p en e d it a n d it was like taking the top o ff a shaken coke bottle - people w ere everywhere on the play area
a ro u n d m y goal. Play was still going on a n d it cam e down tow ards m e again for the left h a n d co m er. It was
a N o ttin g h a m Forest throw-in, away to my left, th e ball was o u t o f play a n d a fan cam e u p to m e on the
pitch a n d said. ‘Bruce, they ’re killing u s’. I said ‘W h o ’s killing you?’, an d he said ‘T h e y ’re crushing us-our
fans’. I said ‘G o a n d get so m e help’, a n d th en a policem an cam e on an d spoke to this fan. I d o n ’t know
who th e fan was, a n d then he led him off. It was ab o u t this tim e I saw a p o licem an ru n n in g o n to th e pitch
from m y right across m y box and to the referee w ho blew up. recovered th e ball an d told all players to clear
the p itc h .”
   10. It is clear from th e video that M r G ro b b e la a r’s recollection o f th e sequence o f events, even w ith regard
to the gam e, is in accu rate in a n u m b e r o f respects. For exam ple, the two N o ttin g h a m Forest c o m e r kicks
o ccu rred m in u tes before Beardsley struck the bar. Further, it seems highly p ro b a b le from o th e r evidence that
gates 3 a n d 4 were o pen continuously well before M r G ro b b e la ar says the fan asked him to get the gate open. It
seem s su rp risin g to o th a t w ith all the noise M r G ro b b e la ar would hear the precise words o f an ind iv id ual fan,
let alo n e resp o n d twice to them , whilst th e gam e was in progress.
    11. As to M r B a m b ro c k ’s account, the evidence o f P C F iona R ich a rd so n was that she was the only
p olicew om an on the track in the early stages although others cam e from the seated area as the incident
developed. PC R ic h a rd so n began at gate 1 a n d , although she d id go a n d h elp peo p le o u t th rough gate 3, she
d id n o t go to gate 4, a n d d id n o t open it twice or even once. T h e tw o officers w ho sp o k e o f o p en in g gate 4 were
b oth male.
   12. 1 th in k M r G ro b b e la a r did beco m e conscious o f distress in the crowd b eh in d h im a n d d id speak to a
police officer a t so m e stage, probably earlier than he now thinks. N ot to reach th a t b ro ad conclusion would
involve a ttrib u tin g his whole account to invention or fantasy a n d I see no g ro u n d s for d oing so. However, his
d etailed a c c o u n t was n o t tested in cross-exam ination a n d its inconsistencies a n d erro rs w hen co m p ared with
o th e r in co n tro v ertib le evidence would m a k e it unsafe to derive m ore than th e b ro ad conclusion stated above.
T he in c id e n t shows how ho n est witnesses can beco m e confused and their ev id en ce flawed w hen recollecting
events ex p erien ced u n d e r tension o r em o tio n .
   13. As to the o pen in g o f gate 4 there was an ap p a re n t conflict o f evidence. P C Illingworth said th a t about
five m in u te s to 3 he o p en e d it and guided fans em erging th rough it to gate 5. P C H o o so n said th a t it was he
who o p e n e d gate 4 ju st before kick-off. I am satisfied from th e evidence o f a n u m b e r o f fans th at, like gate 3,
gate 4 was o p en e d m o re th an once. T he pro b ab ility is. therefore, that whilst P C Illingworth was shepherding
fans to gate 5. gate 4 h a d been closed again u ntil it was re-opened by P C H o o so n two o r three m inutes later.

   14. It was alleged by a d o cto r th a t an oxygen cylinder pro v id ed to h im on th e pitch was e m p ty D r Phillips, a
Liverpool supporter, h a d been in pen 3 w ith his b ro th e r a n d others. H e ca m e u n d e r pressure a n d clim bed into
pen 2. W h en the disaster occurred and gate 2 was o pened, he went through it, injuring his h ead as he d id so. He
cam e o n to the pitch so m e tim e after 3 . 10 p m an d started resuscitation p rocedures. H e was given an oxygen
cylinder. H e believes this was from St J o h n A m bulance. It was, he thought, to o early to be the fire service. The
cylinder was sw itch ed on b u t Dr Phillips says it gave no oxygen since it was empty. T h ere was o n e oxygen
cy linder on the St J o h n ’s am b ulan ce w hich c a m e to the scene. M r Wells, th e D iv isio n al S u p erinte n d en t of St
Jo h n , took th at cy lin der o n to the pitch. H e said it was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a p atien t being
treated by D r Phillips a n d says that oxygen was flowing into th a t p atien t. Moreover, M r Wells tested the
cy linder afterw ard s a n d fo u n d it was still h a lf full. It has a capacity th a t will last for 5 hours 40 m in u tes on a
high setting.
    15. T h ere was evidence from A ssistant C h ief Fire Officer H ornsby th a t a M a x am a n resuscitator h ad failed
to work properly. It was delivering an oxygen flow ap p ro p riate to a "c h ild " setting rath e r than a full " a d u lt"
flow. O n ex a m in a tio n , it was found that a retaining n u t in the control k n o b h ad worked loose, possibly du e to
v ib ratio n in tran sit, a n d this h ad affected the flow o f oxygen. T h e device had last been tested on 10 April 1989.
   16. I accept the evidence o f M r Wells th a t the St Jo h n A m bulance cylinder was charged with oxygen an d
working properly. In my view, D r Phillips m ay have been m istaken as to the cylinder o f which he c o m p lain s
being empty. He agreed he was u n d er great pressure, in an aw kw ard situation; his h ead was injured a n d he
b ecam e very angry at w hat he regarded then as wholly th e fault o f th e police. H e conceded th a t if the cylinder
was n o t e m p ty there was a possible alternative - th a t the m aster tan k to p valve was shut. It seems unlikely that
he could have b een referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was clear th a t the b o ttle he received w as a
sim ple piece o f e q u ip m e n t not designed to b reathe for the patient b u t merely to supply oxygen.
  17. I conclu d e th a t on a balance o f probabilities the evidence do es n o t justify a finding th a t an em p ty
cylinder was b ro u g h t to th e scene.
C alling the Fire Service
    18. P C B ic h a rd ’s call to police H ea d q u arte rs a t 3.13 pm for the fire service to brin g hydraulic cutting
eq u ip m e n t to cut metal fences (see paragraph 101 supra) was heard by C h ie f Inspector E d m u n d so n . H e went
in to the ad jac en t o p era tio n s ro o m to give instructions for the message to be passed to th e fire service. T h ere, a
te m p o rary control ro o m assistant was already speaking to the fire service ab o u t a h ouse fire. M r E d m u n d so n
in terru p te d the call a n d ask ed the assistant to tell the fire service th a t cutting e q u ip m e n t was w an te d at
H illsborough. T h e re followed a conversation between th e assistant a n d M iss Davies a t the fire service in the
following terrr?:

  Police              C an we have cutting gear for Hillsborough, please - straight away?

  Fire C ontrol       Ju st a m in u te. R ight - w hat’s the address?
  Police              C u ttin g eq u ip m e n t for Hillsborough football gro u n d - straight away.

  Fire C o n tro l    H illsborough football ground?

  Police              Yes, Hillsborough football ground.

   Fire C ontrol      W h a t ro ad is that on? D o you know?

  Police              T here has been a m ajo r accident, all th e am b u lan c es are u p there.

   Fire C ontrol      W h a t ro ad is it on?

  Police              I have n o idea; Hillsborough football ground.

   Fire C o n tro l   W h at ro ad is it o n? D o you know?

   Police             “ H illsborough football ground - w hat road is it o n ? ” (this was said to som eone in Police
                      Force C o n tro l) - “ Penistone R o a d ” (to Fire Control).

   Fire C ontrol      P enistone Road.

   Police             P en isto n e Road, OK.

   Fire C ontrol      P enistone Road, ju st a m in u te - w h at’s exactly involved?

   Police             It's football, a big m atch, Liverpool v N otts Forest.

   Fire C o n trol    Yes. b u t why d o you w ant us; you said it was an RTA [Road Traffic Accident],

   Police             No, no. no; m ajo r incid en t inside th e ground.

   Fire C ontrol      M a jo r incident inside - d o you know exactly w hat it is?

   Police             No, 1 d o n ’t: they want all the cutting gear.

   Fire C ontrol      For w hat - d o you know?

   Police             H an g on a sec.
   At th a t p o in t C h ie f Inspector E d m u n d so n intervened a n d spoke for the police. T h e conversation
c o n c lu d e d :-
   Police             (M ale voice) - Hello!
   Fire C o n t r o l   Hello! N o w you wnt so m e c u t t i n g g e a r - w h a t ex ac tly is it for?

   Police               There has been a m ajor accid en t at H illsborough football g ro u n d where the semi-final is.
                        the crow ds have forced th e ir way in, they have broken fences a n d gates down. I do n 't know
                        exactly w hat it is but there are people trap p ed .

   Fire C o n trol      Right! O K - leave it with us.

   T h a t co nversation to o k 1 m in ute 13 seconds. It was p u b lish ed in a n u m b e r o f new spapers w ith strong
critical c o m m e n t mostly against the fire service. T h e th ru st o f th e criticism was th a t valuable tim e was w asted
by the fire serv ice asking unnecessary q uestions as to where a n d why cu tting e q u ip m e n t was required.

   19. T h ere was a m eetin g o f th e emergency services in A ugust 1988 to discuss procedure in the event o f a
m ajo r disaster at Sheffield W ednesday’s ground. It was p o in te d o u t a n d m in u te d th a t “It was im p erativ e th a t
the Police C o n tro l give the exact location o f any fire or in c id en t a n d as m u c h detail as possible. N o senior fire
officer is on d u ty a t the m a t c h . . . Fire service will atten d v ia P en isto n e R o ad o r Leppings Lane as directed by
the police.”

   20. T h e message from P C Bichard co n tain ed all the necessary in fo rm atio n - Leppings Lane end, hydraulic
cutting eq u ip m e n t, to c u t m etal fences. Regrettably, it was n o t passed on by H ea d q u arte rs in th o se term s. Miss
D avies h a d rightly been tra in e d to require a precise location a n d n eeded to know the problem w hich would face
the fire service so th a t th e ap p ro p riate response could be m a d e. In fact, there are several football g rounds in the
Hillsborough district alth o u g h clearly Sheffield W ed n esd ay ’s g ro u n d is the principal one. In the result,
although C h ie f In sp ec to r E d m u n d so n clarified, to an ex ten t, the n ature o f the problem , the locus which
em erged in the course o f th e conversation (Penistone R o ad ) was n o t th a t co n tain e d in the original message
from g ro u n d control (ie “ Leppings Lane end.") W hilst on th e face o f the co n v ersatio n the fire service may seem
to have been slow in th e u p ta k e or perhaps pedantic, in m y view the police ought to have been m o re specific.
They h a d the necessary in fo rm atio n to be so.

   21. I am satisfied, however, that the delay o f 1 m in u te 13 seconds over the call, a n d even the delay
o ccasioned by the c u ttin g eq u ip m e n t going to Penistone R o ad rather th an Leppings Lane, d id n o t affect the
o u tco m e. Even h a d th o se w ith cutting e q u ip m e n t gone directly after a briefer ’p h o n e call th ey w ould not have
arriv ed a t a stage early enough to m ake cutting the fencing a helpful exercise.

M r Kenny D alglish
   22. W h en the L iverpool m anager w ent to the control ro o m a n d agreed to m ake th e a n n o u n c e m e n t
b road cast at 3.56 pm , he says in a sta te m en t th a t he co u ld n o t get the Tannoy to work. S p ectators cou ld see
him trying to ad dress th e m a n d in d icated to him m an u ally that n o th in g could be heard. A n officer pressed
b u tto n s on the m a c h in e a n d M r Dalglish says he tried again with sim ilar lack o f success. H e was then taken
u n d er the police box to the ro o m used by th e disc jockey to b ro ad c ast pre-m atch m usic. T here, the m icro p h o n e
w orked a n d he b ro ad c ast his message.

   23. M r Dalglish w as n o t called. T h ere was n o o th e r ev iden ce ab o u t this incident. I accept it occu rred as he
described. W hy the Tannoy could not at th a t tim e be successfully o p era ted from the police box is, however,
strange a n d u n explained. U nlike the radio, it had o p era ted satisfactorily from th e police box a t the critical
tim es save th a t its messages m ay not always have been h e a rd above the prevailing noise. It h a d w orked at about
3.30 pm w hen it called for medical staff. I can see no g ro u n d s for criticising the police in regard to this incident
a n d certain it is th a t the b rie f delay in relaying M r D alglish’s message can have h a d no significant effect.

    7. ACTIONS AFTER DEATH

   Introduction

      At common law a person's death extinguished all rights of action that he
   m ight have had. In particular, if the death was a result of the tortious acts of
   another, the deceased's family would have no right of action in respect of
   the death.13 The position is now governed by statute.
      If a person dies as the result of the tortious acts of another there are two
   ways in w hich an action m ight be brought. First, by reason of the Law
   Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934, certain causes of action w hich
   were vested in the deceased at the tim e of his death survive for the benefit of
   his estate. Secondly, certain “dependants" of the deceased now have a right
   of action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976.


   Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934

     By section 1( 1) of the 1934 Act it is provided that all causes of action, w ith
   the exception of actions for defamation and seduction which were vested in
   a person on his death shall survive for the benefit of his estate.
     It is expressly provided, by section l{2){a) that the damages recoverable for
   the benefit of the estate "shall not include any exemplary damages." Where
   the person's death has been caused by the act or om ission which gives rise


   12 [1979] Q.B. 722.

to the cause of action the damages recoverable for the benefit of the estate
shall be calculated w ithout reference to any loss or gain to his estate conse­
quent on his death, except th at a sum in respect of funeral expenses m ay be
included.14 Damages for "loss of expectation of life" and for the "lost years"
cannot be recovered if the death occurred after January 1, 1983.15
  It follows that an action can be brought by the estate of a person who died
as a result of police misconduct. Compensatory and aggravated damages can
be recovered by the estate.
The Fatal Accidents Act 1976

   The 1976 Act gives a right of action to "dependants" of a deceased person
whose death was caused by any "wrongful act, neglect or default" such as
would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the person injured to recover
damages.16
   D ependants are defined in section 1(2) and include spouses, parents and
grandparents, children and grandchildren, nephews nieces and cousins and
any person who had been living w ith the deceased in the same household
for a period of at least two years im m ediately before death as husband or
wife and any person treated by the deceased as a parent or as a "child of the
fam ily."
   A husband or wife or the parents of an unm arried m inor are entitled to
damages for "bereavem ent"17 in the sum of £3500.18 O ther damages are
awarded as are proportionate to the injury resulting from the death to the
dependants respectively. Such damages are assessed on the basis of the
"value of the dependency," in other words, the dependants are entitled to
th a t sum of money th at will replace the "m aterial benefits" provided to
them by the deceased.19
   It should be noted that the dependants cannot recover if the deceased
earned his living by crime, because their claim w ould be defeated by the
defence of ex turpi causa.20
   The damages recoverable can be reduced.to take into account any "con­
tributory negligence" by the deceased.21
   The dependants of anyone killed as a result of police wrongdoing will,
therefore, have an action against the police under the Fatal Accidents Act.


8. LIMITATION

  All the causes of action discussed in this chapter are "founded on tort."
The basic tort lim itation period of six years "from the date on w hich the
cause of action accrued" therefore applies.22

   T he cause of action accrues at the m o m e n t at w h ic h th e plain tiff could
first sue. W hen a tort is actionable per se, tim e w ill run from the m o m e n t at
w h ic h the w rongful act w as com m itted. T hus, a cause of action in lib el w ill
run from th e m o m en t of publication and w ill be tim e-barred six years later.
O n th e other hand, w here damage is essen tia l to th e cause of a ction and it
w ill only arise w h en th e dam age actu ally occurs. Thus, a cause of a ction in
negligence, m isfeasance in a public office or conspiracy w ill o n ly arise w h en
the plaintiff actu ally suffers loss or dam age as a result of the defendant's
breach of du ty or m isfeasance. In th e case of a breach of statutory d u ty the
date of accrual of the cause of action w ill depend on w h eth er th e sta tu te is
construed as giving a cause of action w h ich is actionable p e i se.23 If a statute
does give rise to a breach w h ic h is actionable pez se then tim e w ill run from
the date o f th e breach, oth erw ise tim e w ill run from th e date o n w h ich
dam age takes place.
   W here th e action is "in case” th e cause of action w ill accrue w h eth er or
n o t the plain tiff k n ow s that the dam age has taken place.24 T h us, for
exam ple, if property is dam aged by n egligen t police a ctio n tim e w ill run
from the date of damage, n o t th e date w h en the plaintiff discovers th a t it has
happened.
   Where the dam ages claim ed by th e plaintiff " co n sist of or include
damages in respect of personal injuries25 to the plain tiff or any other per­
son" then th e applicable lim ita tio n period is three years.26 In su ch a case the
tim e period runs from either th e date on w h ic h the cause of action accrued
or th e date of know ledge (if- later) of th e person injured.27 T h e court has a
d iscretion to extend th e lim ita tio n period under sectio n 33 of th e L im i­
tation A ct 1980.28
   If the person injured dies before the expiration of th e three year lim ita tio n
period then the lim ita tio n period for a cause of action surviving for th e ben­
efit of th e estate under sectio n 1 of th e Law Reform (M iscellan eou s Pro­
visions) A ct 1934 is three years from th e date of death or th e date of the
know ledge of th e personal representative, w h ichever is th e later.29 If the
person injured dies after the expiry of the lim itation period then h is per­
sonal representatives can ask the court to override th e lim ita tio n period.30
   A n action under th e Fatal A ccidents A ct 1976 can n ot be brought if the
death occurred w h en th e person injured could n o longer m aintain an action
in respect of the injury, w h eth er because th e action is tim e-barred or for any
other reason.31 W here the action w ou ld have been barred by th e three year
tim e lim it in respect of personal injuries there is n o statutory discretion to
override th e tim e lim it under section 33.32 N o action under th e Fatal A c c i­
dents A ct can be brought after the expiration of three years from th e date of
death or the date of know ledge of the person for w h o se b enefit the action is

of death then the court does have discretion to extend time under section
33.34
   Where any fact relevant to the cause of action is deliberately concealed by
the defendant the period of lim itation does not begin to run until the plain­
tiff discovered the concealm ent or could, with reasonable diligence have
discovered it.35
1   Fatal Accidents Act 1976

The Fatal Accidents Act 1976 allows dependants to claim against anyone who
causes death by their wrongful act, neglect or default, provided the wrongful

act, neglect or default would have been such as to allow the person who died to
have made a claim if they had not died. In other words the act, neglect or
default must constitute a civil wrong; if the police would have had a good
defence to the civil wrong, the claim for the death also fails.

Who can sue?
Most members of the family o f the dead person can sue, including:
(a) spouse;
(b) parents or grandparents;
(c) children or grandchildren;
(d) siblings, uncles and aunts, and all their descendants;
(e) common-law spouse o f two years’ standing (lesbian and gay relationships
    are therefore excluded);
(0 anyone treated as a child o f the family following a marriage;
(g) anyone treated as a parent.

 Wrongful act, neglect or default o f the police
It has to be shown that the wrongful act, neglect or default o f the police caused
the death.93This may be fairly straightforw ard if, say, the death resulted from
a deliberate assault or from a road accident caused by a police officer’s
negligent driving. It is less clear-cut if the death arose partly from the act of the
person who died, say in the case o f someone who died from alcohol or drugs.
The police have a detailed Code o f Practice (see Appendix Two) on the
treatment of people in their custody concerning such matters as the conditions
o f detention, the treatment o f detained persons and medical treatment. Whiie
a breach of the Code does not o f itself render any individual officer liable to a
separate civil action, a breach of the Code might be evidence o f negligence.94
    A problem might arise where someone dies because the police fail to act to
prevent the death. This might occur where the police arrest someone who is ill
or someone becomes ill after an arrest and the police fail to call a doctor. In the
ordinary law of negligence a “ pure omission” to act, such as where a passer-by
fails to call an ambulance after a ro a d accident, does not make the passer-by
liable. However, the position is different if the person who fails to act has a
legal duty of care:95 police custody officers are under a statutory duty to ensure
that anyone detained at a police station is treated in accordance with the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act and the Codes of Practice.96 Under the Act,
failure on the part o f an officer to comply with any provision o f the Codes does
not of itself render that officer liable to any civil proceedings.97 However, it
seems that the special duty to take care o f people in police custody existed
before the Act was passed98 so this provision should not defeat a claim based
on an act o f omission by the police. Even if the courts decided it was an
obstacle, it seems only to protect the officer who failed to comply with the
Codes. A claim against the chief officer o f police should therefore still succeed,
see p 101.
   A further problem may arise where someone commits suicide in police
custody. If the suicide was induced by a wrongful act o f the police, a claim can
still succeed even though the person who died took their own life.99 There
must, however, be a clear link between the wrongful act and the suicide, such
as where a person is falsely imprisoned or assaulted and becomes depressed
and suicidal as a result. If the police have a good defence to the false
imprisonment or assault allegation, the claim for damages arising from the
death would also fail.
   It is arguable that a claim can be made if the police negligently fail to
prevent a suicide. This might arise where the police take into custody someone
they know to be prone to suicide,100 and then fail to prevent them harming
themselves by, for example, failing to keep them under regular and frequent
observation.101 It is impossible to say with certainty that this is the law, as it
appears that there has never been a reported case directly o n the point, in
England. However, in a case which decided that it was justifiable to force-feed
a suffragette on hunger strike, the Lord Chief Justice said “ It was the duty,
both under the rules and apart from the rules, o f officials to preserve the health
and lives o f the prisoners, who were in the custody of the C row n” .102 This
however does not deal with the crucial problem that in the general law of
negligence if someone consents to a risk, such as consenting to a surgical
operation, their claim fails. Normally a person who carried out an act
themselves would be taken to be clearly consenting to the risk. The question
that remains to be decided is whether someone o f unsound m ind can be said to
“ consent” .

Damages are only awarded for:
(a) bereavement; and
(b) the loss o f reasonable expectation of financial benefit.
Damages for bereavement are a fixed am ount, currently £3,500.103 They are
only awarded to the spouse o f the deceased or the parents of someone under 18
who never married.
   Damages for reasonable expectation o f financial loss can include such
things as loss o f a parent’s financial support, or loss of a son’s voluntary gifts
during a period o f employm ent104 or loss o f free services as where a wife who
was killed acted as a housewife.105 However, if the person who died earned his
or her income from a life of crime, the dependants are not allowed to claim for
loss of the benefits o f crime.106

            is clearly a mental state, and a type of legal fault. Another
In te n tio n
type of legal fault, not necessarily involving a mental state, is
negligence.
   Some accidents (or other events) are so unexpected that when they
happen we can only say that they were unavoidable—in legal language,
■'inevitable.-' We cannot think of anything that a careful person would
have done to avoid the evil result, if he had been in the shoes of the
defendant.
   Other accidents happen because of the neglect of some precaution that
a reasonable man would have used. (The reasonable man is sometimes,
and better, called a prudent man.) Such accidents are the products of what
we call negligence, or carelessness.
   Negligence, then, is failure to conform to the standard of care to which
it is the defendant's duty to conform. It is failure to behave like a
reasonable or prudent man. in circumstances where the law requires such
reasonable behaviour. (In this context, of course, as nearly always in law,
the word "man" includes ''woman.") An employer may for example be
negligent as to whether safety precautions are being used by his
workpeople.

You mean the defendant was thoughtless?
   Yes. or incompetent in a job (such as driving a car) in which he should
have been competent. Or. worse still, he may actually have seen the
danger and "chanced his arm.” In the latter case he is advertently
negligent, or in other words reckless. If he did not advert to the danger,
or in other words realise there was a risk, when he ought to have, he is
inadvertently negligent. Negligence means forbidden conduct where the
defendant's liability depends on the fact that he failed to realise (foresee/
know) what he ought to have realised, and failed to conform his conduct
accordingly, or, a fo rtio ri, that he did realise it and yet failed to conform
his conduct as he should.
   The test of negligence in terms of the prudent man is called an
"objective" standard, because it does not depend upon a finding of what
passed in the defendant's mind.
 Why do you bring in the prudent man in defining negligence? Is it because
 otherwise the standard would vary for everyone?
   There would be no standard at all. Every judgment of a man's conduct
 implies judgment measured against a standard external to him.
 Who is this “ prudent m an” ? Is he the man in the street?
   The man in the street, that legendary combination of sage and
ignoramus, does not quite represent the idea. The “prudent man" or
“reasonable man" of the lawyer’s imagining is the exemplary man: the
cautious, circumspect, anxiously calculating paragon who is held up by the
judges as a model of behaviour. Sometimes, it is true, he is described as
the ordinary man. or the average man. But little effort is made at trials to
find how ordinary men behave; and it would not be a cast-iron defence to
a charge of negligence to show that other people are prone to do exactly
as the defendant did. (At least, that is the position in the law of tort.)
H o m o juridicus is the ideal man. the moral man. the conscientious man—
not setting the standard so high that life becomes impossible in ordinary
terms, but nevertheless requiring the most careful consideration to be
given, so that harm is avoided and the law obeyed.
Why not eliminate talk of reasonable men by asking simply whether the
harm was probable?
   Probability is a matter of varying degree. Negligence consists in taking
a risk of harm with such a degree of probability as to be socially
unacceptable. This depends on what it is that is at stake. A surgeon may.
if there is no other way of alleviating his patient's suffering or prolonging
his life, perform an operation that carries a very high risk of killing his
patient, without being adjudged negligent. An employer w'ho. in order to
increase production and profits, takes what is. statistically, a much smaller
risk with the lives of his workpeople may w'ell be held to be so.
W hat should a prosecutor do to prove negligence?
  In an action in tort for negligence the plaintiff must give particulars of
the alleged negligence in his statement of claim. For example, in a running-
down case he will say that the defendant drove too fast, on the wrong side
of the road, without keeping a proper look-out, and so on. There are no
similar pleadings in criminal cases, but the prosecutor who alleges
negligence must be prepared to say what the defendant could and should
have done (or refrained from doing) in order to avoid the accident or other
occurrence.

Do I gather that when considering negligence you entirely ignore the
defendant’s state of mind?
   That would be going too far. One can imagine circumstances where an
ordinary driver would not be careless in running a blind man down, if he
did not know he was blind and had no reason to suppose he would proceed
as he did. But a driver who knew that the man was blind might on such
facts be guilty of careless driving.

Is negligence a form of mens rea?
   Some judges assume this, but there are substantial arguments the other
way.

• Negligence is not necessarily a state of mind, so it is not properly called
     mens rea.
• The most serious and severely punishable crimes are defined to require
  intention or recklessness. If it were allowed that negligence is mens rea.

   ’4 S . 2 0 2 ( 2 ) ( d ) .
      the judges might extend the concept of recklessness to cover negligence
      (which some of them are in any event strongly inclined to do), and might
      hold that all crimes at common law can be committed negligently (which
      would result in a great increase of severity). The argument does not
      involve saying that negligence should not be punished: only that it
      should not generally be punished on a par with crimes requiring a mental
      element/''



 § 4.2. THE JUSTIFICATION OF PUNISHMENT FOR NEGLIGENCE

The reason for punishing negligence is the utilitarian one, that we hope
thereby to improve people's standards of behaviour.

Is n ’t the question one of moral wrong? It is wrong not to exercise
consideration for others.
   If inadvertent negligence results from not caring about other people, it
is a defect of character and may be regarded as morally wrong. But what
lawyers call inadvertent negligence is not always of this kind. Negligence
may be just a slip by a w'ell-disposed person, and whether that should be
accounted morally w'rong is open to debate.

Even though the offender did not realise the danger on the occasion in
question, he would have realised it if he had taken due precautions. So he
was morally to blame.
   I do not dissent; but we should keep our eyes open to the facts. Apply
what you say to the particular case of a forgetful person. A man with a bad
memory can often take steps to remedy his deficiency—by keeping a diary
of his engagements and consulting it frequently, and so on. But his memory
may be so bad that one day he forgets to look in his diary, or forgets an
item recorded in it. Perhaps, to overcome this risk, he takes additional
steps, such as asking his wife to remind him of a particular engagement.
But one day he forgets to ask his wife. Is he to think of another device to
remind him to look at his diary or to ask his wife to remind him? Is it moral
fault not to do so? What we are faced with is the plain fact that on the
particular occasion the thought of the engagement never comes into his
mind. That is a deficiency in his mental make-up which he cannot help. To
search back into his past for the purpose of finding some defect in the
arrangements he made to remedy his failing, and blaming him on that
account, often wears the appearance of being an unrewarding exercise in
moralism.

in a d v e rte n t factual ris k " ta k e n by a careless p erso n .
   It is not only a question of memory. Many studies have been made of
accident proneness; and it has been found that large categories of people
are more accident prone than others, Old people are worse than younger
people, men worse than women, unmarried people worse than married.1
But some individuals are particularly accident prone. They are born
negligent, so to speak, or become so through their experiences. A person
has an innate temperament, which may in course of time be modified by
many circumstances over which he has no control. The result may be that
he is impulsive, unable to stop and consider the consequences of what he
is doing, or too dull in mind to imagine them: that he is selfish, preferring
his ow-n convenience to the safety of others; that he is clumsy, unable to
control his own movements (or those of a machine he is using) with due
precision, or with a slow reaction-time in case of emergency.

If, as you say, the individual is unable to help these aspects of his mind or
body, how can he be said to deserve punishment?
   This objection to imposing liability for negligence appeals particularly to
those who take the "determinist" position, according to which all events
(including human acts) are governed by pre-existing events which are their
causes. Everything we do is the product of our genetic constitution and
personal history.
   We need not go into the voluminous arguments for and against
determinism. Sufficient to say that the determinist philosophy, though it
may be true, is of little interest either to the lawyer or to the moralist. The
question in law and morals is whether the offender could have acted
otherwise if he had willed. If he could, he is morally and legally
responsible.2 The further question "Was he able to will?" may be
speculated on by philosophers, but is eschewed in law' and morals for a
pragmatic reason. The object of the law and of a moral system is to
influence our wills in a socially desired direction. Once this simple point is
grasped, the apparent difficulty of reconciling the philosophy of
determinism with ordinary moral attitudes disappears. However,
malfunctioning of the will is given moral and legal significance when it is
associated with childhood or is regarded as a symptom of mental disorder.

   Liability for negligence is a way of sanctioning (punishing) common
sense rules that in themselves have no legal force. There are well-known
rules of prudence relating to the management of firearms, that one should
never leave them loaded, or point them at anyone even though believed to
be unloaded, and so on. Again, it is only a rule of prudence, not explicitly
one of law. that one should not pass on a blind corner (except that there
is a law on the subject of not crossing double white lines). Failure to
observe these rules (which will generally be an intentional or reckless
failure) will readily be held to be negligence, founding a charge of careless
driving or of manslaughter.

The reason why drivers do not pass on blind corners is because they
apprehend a consequence much more immediate and terrifying than what
may afterwards happen in a court of law.
  That is true, but the law of reckless and careless driving can add to the
pressure to make bad drivers change their habits and in the last resort to
give up driving.
   Carelessness with firearms is in a different legal position from careless
driving. Such carelessness is not an offence in itself, and it is not an offence
even if it causes severe injury, the reason evidently being that accidents
with firearms are too uncommon to attract particular attention from the
law. However, if the victim dies, a charge of manslaughter may be brought.

When comparing the physically handicapped (blind, maimed, etc.)
defendant with the reasonable man, we suppose that the reasonable man
suffers from the same handicap. The defendant need only do his best with
the body he has. But it would generally be negligent for a handicapped
man to undertake something that could be done safely only by an ordinary
man, if he has the opportunity not to do it.

What if the defendant is substandard in abilities?
   The reasonable man is not imagined to be substandard in intelligence or
foresight.

But wouldn’t it be more just to have different standards of care for experts
at one end of the scale and people of poor intelligence at the other?
   We were all born green. Some people remain that colour, but even
dullards are not immune from the conditioning processes of life, including
the law.

10. Negligence and
Other Civil Actions


1. INTRODUCTION

   In Part II of this book the "traditional tort actions” against the police were
considered. These actions are by far the most important. They cover the
areas where citizens w ill be most concerned with unlawful police activity:
assault, unlawful arrest and imprisonment, interference with land and
goods and unjustified prosecutions. Nevertheless, the law provides a wide
range of other causes of action which may be relevant to the citizen's pos­
ition in relation to the police. This chapter deals with six areas: negligence,
breach of statutory duty, defamation, conspiracy, misfeasance in public
office and actions after death.


2. NEGLIGENCE

Introduction

  The common law action in negligence has, in recent decades, become of
central importance to the law of tort. Large areas of tortious liability have
been gradually redefined and assimilated to it. Nevertheless there have been
very few attempts to fix the police with liability for negligence in relation to
their "operational policing" functions. Complex and difficult questions
arise concerning matters such as the existence of a duty of care, the policy
limitations on such a duty, and the intervening acts of third parties.


The elements of the tort

  The elements of the tort of negligence are clear and well established.
There must be:
     (1)   a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff-
     (2)   a breach by the defendant of this duty;
     (3)   damage to the plaintiff;
     (4)   which is caused by the breach of duty.
(1) D u t y o f care. The generally accepted test1 to be applied to establish
whether or not a duty of care is owed by the plaintiff to the defendant is set
out in the speech of Lord Wilberforce in Anns v. M erton2:
     "the question has to be approached in two stages. First one has to ask
     whether, as between the alleged wrongdoer and the person who has suf­
     fered damage there is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neigh­
     bourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of the former,
     carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to the latter, in
     which case a prima facie duty of care arises. Secondly, if the first ques­
     tion is answered affirmatively, it is necessary to consider whether there
     are any considerations which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit
     the scope of the duty or the class of person to whom it is owed or the
     damages to which a breach of it may give rise."
Thus, if it is forseeable that the plaintiff will be damaged by the defendant's
lack of care, a duty of care will arise unless there are policy considerations
which restrict or negative the duty. Policy considerations may "negative" a
duty of care if it is not "just and reasonable” that a duty be imposed.3

(2) B reach o f d u t y . The defendant will be in breach of his duty if he fails to
take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances. The standard of care
is that of the reasonable man. This is a matter of law and the court will take
into account matters such as the degree of risk if the duty is not fulfilled,
the seriousness of the risk, the utility of the defendant's acts and the cost of
avoiding the harm.4 In police cases the standard of care will often not be a
high one, because the police act under considerable pressure, with compet­
ing demands on their resources, often in situations of some danger.5
Whether the defendant is in breach of his duty in a particular case is a ques­
tion of fact and degree.

(3) D a m a g e . Because negligence is an action on the case, there will only be
a complete cause of action if the plaintiff can show some "special damage”
such as personal injury, nervous shock or economic loss. If economic loss is
the only damage caused then there are strict "policy limitations” on recov­
ery. The plaintiff can only recover for "pure economic loss” if he can show a
"very close proximity” to the defendant.6 In general, the plaintiff can only
recover for damage which is "reasonably foreseeable.”7

(4) C a u s a tio n . Even if the plaintiff was damaged and the defendant was in
breach of a duty owed to him, there will be no action unless the damage was
in fact caused by the breach. The defendant will not be liable if, on a proper

understanding of events, the plaintiff's damage was not in fact caused by the
negligence of the defendant but by some intervening "new act” (novus
actus inteiveniens). Human action does not, of itself, sever the connected
sequence of events.8 The basic rule was summarised by Greer L.J. in the
leading case of Haynes v. Harwood9 as follows:
      "If what is relied upon as a novus actus interveniens is the very kind of
      thing which is likely to happen if the want of care which is alleged
      takes place, the principle embodied in the maxim is no defence."
In police cases the first element will often be the most difficult to establish.
Special considerations may arise if the police are acting under "statutory
powers."10 Even if the plaintiff can establish a prima facie duty of care this
may well be negatived by "policy considerations." When it is alleged that
there has been a negligent failure to carry out proper investigations special
difficulties arise concerning liability for the acts of independent third par­
ties.


Negligence liability and independent third parties

  Difficult legal issues arise when the plaintiff's claim is based on damage
caused by an independent third party who, it is said, was placed in a position
to cause the damage by the defendant's negligence. It is clear that the simple
fact that the damage was caused by a third party:
      "does not, of itself, preclude success of the claim, since breach of duty
      on the part of the person against whom the claim is made may also have
      played a part in causing the damage."11
Nevertheless, the situations in which such an action may succeed have
been strictly limited although the precise basis and extent of this limitation
have been unclear.
  There is no doubt that there will be liability if there is a "special relation­
ship" between the defendant and the third party by virtue of which the
defendant is responsible for controlling the actions of the third party.12
There will also be liability if the defendant negligently causes or permits a
source of danger to be created in a situation where it is reasonably foresee­
able that third parties may interfere with it.13
  There have been, however, considerable difficulties as to liability in cases
where there is no "special relationship" or situation of danger.14 The auth­
orities revealed two different approaches with different practical conse­
quences. These can be called the "policy" and the "foreseeability"
approaches.
  The first approach treats the limitation as a question of policy. On this

view, policy excludes liability in the absence of a special relationship or
other special circumstances. This was the analysis of Lord Denning M.R. in
L am b v. C a m d e n 15 and was partially supported by Oliver L.J. (as he then
was).16In P. Perl (Exporters ) v. C a m d e n 17 Goff L.J. (as he then was) applied
Lord Wilberforce's test in A n n s 18 and suggested that "policy consider­
ations" negatived a duty of care in the absence of a special relationship
between the defendant and the third party. More recently, Lord Goff has
refined his analysis of the absence of a duty of care in this area stating that
the fundamental reason for it is "that the common law does not impose
liability for what are called pure omissions."19
   The second approach treats the question as being a matter of foreseeabi­
lity: if the third party intervention is foreseeable with a sufficiently high
degree of probability there will be a duty of care. In D orset Yacht v. H om e
Office 20 Lord Reid said that there would be liability if the "intervening
action" of the third party was "very likely" (or perhaps just "likely")21 to
happen. In subsequent cases it has been suggested that the defendant may
be liable where third party intervention is "likely or very likely to
happen,"22 that there must be a "very high degree of foreseeability,"23 per­
haps "amounting almost to inevitability.'24
   This conflict was resolved by the decision of the House of Lords in Smith
v. L ittlew o o d s25 when this second approach was endorsed by a majority. It
was said that "mere foreseeability of damage is certainly not a sufficient
basis to found liability."26 Nevertheless, as Lord Mackay (with whom Lord
Keith and Lord Griffiths agreed, Lord Brandon taking a similar approach)27
said:
      "what the reasonable man is bound to foresee in a case involving injury
      or damage by independent human agency, just as in cases where such
      agency plays no part, is the probable consequences of his own act or
      omission, but that, in such a case, a clear basis will be required on
      which to assert that the injury or damage is more than a mere possi­
      bility."28
The result must be "highly probable or very likely" and the needle that

measures the probability of a particular result must be "near the top of the
scale."29 It is submitted that this is the correct approach and is in line with
the older authorities which deal with the problem as one of causation. As
Greer L.J. put it in a passage which has often been approved:
    "it is not true to say that where a plaintiff has suffered damage occa­
    sioned by a combination of the wrongful act of a defendant and some
    further conscious act by an intervening person, that of itself prevents
    the court coming to a conclusion in the plaintiff's favour if the accident
    was the natural and probable consequence of the wrongful act.''30
The fact that the third party's acts are unlawful is no objection to liability.
As Lord Reid has said:
    "Unfortunately, tortious or criminal action by a third party is often 'the
    very kind of thing' which is likely to happen as a result of the wrongful
    or careless act of the defendant."31
It is submitted, therefore, that in the absence of "special relationships," a
person will be liable for the tortious acts of third parties if these are reason­
ably forseeable consequences of his own negligence. Liability will depend
on the facts of each particular case.
9. GENERAL DEFENCES


Introduction


  There are a number of general defences which are potentially applicable
to all the tort actions considered in this chapter. The most important of
these are as follows:
        (1)   contributory negligence,-
        (2)   consent;
        (3)   necessity,-
        (4)   the plaintiff is a wrongdoer.



Contributory negligence


  At common law contributory negligence was a complete defence to an
action in negligence or breach of statutory duty but does not seem to have
been applied to any other cause of action.36 The position is now governed by
the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945. If a plaintiff in an
action for negligence suffers damage "as the result partly of his own fault"
his damages are reduced "to such an extent as the court thinks just and
equitable having regard to the claimant's share in the responsibility for the
damage.37
  The position when the plaintiff's claim is a tort other than negligence or
breach of statutory duty is unclear. "Contributory negligence" will only be
a defence to an action for defamation, conspiracy or misfeasance if it can be
shown that the defendant's acts were themselves tortious,- mere "careless­
ness" by the defendant will not be sufficient38

Consent

   The maxim volenti non fit injuria, that to which a man consents cannot
be considered an injury, is of general application in the law of tort.39 The
defence of consent takes two forms: as consent to the invasion of interests
or the willing assumption of risk of injury.40
   No action will lie in respect of acts which were authorised by the plain­
tiff. The defendant must establish that the plaintiff's consent was fully and
freely given. This form of the defence applies to intentional torts such as
trespass to land or goods. It also applies to actions for defamation41 and pre­
sumably to misfeasance and conspiracy.
   The defence of volenti also applies in "non-intentional torts" when the
plaintiff has agreed to "assume the risk" of suffering damage. The scope of
the defence of consent as "assumption of risk" has been considerably
restricted by judicial decision. It is necessary for the defendants to show
that:
      "the plaintiff voluntarily and freely with full knowledge of the nature
      of the risk he ran impliedly agreed to incur it."42
It is not enough that the plaintiff had knowledge of the risk; he must be
shown to have consented not to hold the defendant liable:
      "The plaintiff must agree, expressly or impliedly, to waive any claim
      for any injury that may befall him due to the lack of reasonable care by
      the defendant."43
The defence must be specifically pleaded.44
  The defence of volenti is very rarely successful in actions for breach of
statutory duty or negligence.43 Although it was held to be applicable in A s h ­
ton v. Turner.46 This was a negligence action by one of two burglars who
had been drinking against the other who had injured him by crashing their
getaway car. It was held that no duty of care was owed by the driver to the
passenger in that situation but that the action failed, in any event, because
the passenger had assumed the risk of such injury by taking part in the bur­
glary and attempted escape.


Necessity

  There is no doubt that "necessity" is a defence to an action in trespass,
especially when human life is at stake.47 The defence probably applies to
"intentional torts." It will apply if the defendant takes "reasonable

measures" to deal with a "real and imminent danger."48 The police may be
able to rely on it to justify taking reasonably necessary steps to prevent
crime.49 The defence will not, however, be available if the necessity has
arisen from the defendant's own negligence.50
  In the case of R ig b y v. Chief C on stable51 the police successfully relied on
this defence to an action for trespass when they had set the plaintiff's gun
shop alight by firing CS gas canisters into it to "flush out" a dangerous
armed psychopath. Although the trespass was justified by necessity it was
no defence to an allegation of negligence in making arrangements to deal
with the consequences of the intrusion. The defendant was, therefore,
found guilty of negligence for firing the gas canister when no fire fighting
equipment was on hand.52


The plaintiff is a wrongdoer

   This defence has been discussed in relation to trespass to the person53and
interference with goods.54 Its scope remains unclear but it seems that the
plaintiff's wrongdoing may, in some circumstances extinguish any right of
action in reliance on the maxim ex turpi causa non oritur a c tio ; an action
does not arise from a base cause. In the case of Thackw ell v. Barclay’s
Bankss Hutchison J. suggested that the Court should consider whether
there was any illegality of which the court should take notice and whether,
if there was, giving relief to the plaintiff was contrary to public policy
because it would be indirectly assisting or encouraging him in his criminal
act.
   The fact that the plaintiff was engaged in a criminal act may mean that he
cannot recover for damage caused by the defendant's tortious conduct. In
M urphy v. Culhane56 it was held that a man who takes part in a criminal
affray may be said "to have been guilty of such a wicked act as to deprive
himself of a cause of action."37
   On the other hand, the plaintiff's wrongdoing may mean that the defend­
ant's acts were not, in the circumstance, tortious. In the case of A sh ton v.
Turner58 Ewbank J. held that:
      "The law of England may in certain circumstances not recognise the
      existence of a duty of care by one participant in a crime to another parti­
      cipant in the same crime, in relation to an act done in connection with

    the commission of that crime. The law is based on public policy, and
    the application of the law depends on a consideration of all the facts."
He went on to find that, on the facts, no duty of care existed between the
plaintiff and the defendants.
   This defence is, however, limited in scope and "Cases where an action in
tort has been defeated by [it) . . . are exceedingly rare.'09 It is submitted that
it will only succeed in two situations:
     (1) where, to establish his cause of action the plaintiff has to rely on
         criminal activity to found his claim60;
     (2) where, by giving the relief sought the court would be "indirectly
         assisting or encouraging" him in his criminal act.61
Thus, for example, a claim that the police had not shown proper care in
looking after a person in police custody, would not be defeated simply
because the person being held was being held for admitted wrongdoing. On
the other hand, a plaintiff who was injured following a negligent failure by
the police to deal with his 999 call in relation to a criminal affray which he
had instigated would not succeed in a negligence claim.
NEGLIGENCE

Negligence and police activities


     There is no doubt that in many spheres of activity the police are liable for
 negligence and that no special principles of law apply. One example which
 lies outside the range of this book concerns "accident at work" negligence
 actions brought by serving police officers. Such actions are common and are
 governed by the same principles which cover ordinary negligence actions by
 employees.
    Similarly, actions against the police in respect of negligent driving are
 common and usually uncontroversial in law. It has been held that police
drivers, acting in the course of their duties owe the same duty of care as all
other road users.46 This applies even when they are answering emergency
 calls.
    The fact that the police are engaged in "policing" activities does not
 exempt them from ordinary duties of care. These duties of care are not
 "negatived" just because the police are engaged in difficult or dangerous
work—but the nature of the work is taken into account in assessing the
applicable "standard of care." The principle is clearly illustrated by the case
of Marshall v. O s m o n d 47 which involved injury to a suspected criminal at
the end of a chase by a police car. The Court of Appeal reversed the trial
judge on the law and held that a police officer owed the same duty of care to
a criminal he was pursuing as to anyone else, namely a duty "to exercise
such care and skill as is reasonable in all the circumstances."48 They went
on to support the trial judge's conclusion and held that the officer was, in
fact, not in breach of this duty.
    If police conduct, in all the circumstances, falls below the standard
expected of "reasonable police officers" the courts will impose negligence
liability. Thus, in the case of K n ightley v. Johns 49 the police had been called
to an accident in a tunnel. The police inspector in charge, in contravention
of standing orders, had forgotten to close the tunnel to traffic. He therefore
ordered the plaintiff, a police motorcyclist, to ride back down the tunnel,


45   [1985] 1 W.L.R. 1242 a t 1251A.
46   See G a y n o r v . A l l e n [1959] 2 Q.B. 4 0 3 ; W o o d s v. R ic h a rd s [1977] R.T.R. 20.
47   [1983] Q.B. 1034.
48   Ibid. a t 1038.
49   [1982] 1 W.L.R. 349.
 against the flow of traffic, to close it to traffic. The plaintiff collided with a
 car and the Court of Appeal held that the Chief Constable was vicariously
liable for the inspector's negligence. The case raised complex questions con­
cerning novus actus interveniens but the point to note is that there was no
discussion as to whether the police should be held liable for a negligent per­
formance of their duties. The Court assumed that, if the inspector did not
come up to the standard of the "reasonable police officer" (and there was no
novus a c tu s ) then negligence liability followed.
   In general then, when the police are acting (as opposed to failing to act)
they will owe a duty of care to people who are likely to be directly affected
by their actions. No policy considerations will "restrict or negative" this
duty of care. This is illustrated by four cases in which such a duty of care
was accepted.
   The briefly reported case of Bryson v. N orthum bria Police Authority50
concerned a young man who had been arrested for drunkenness, kept in a
cell to sober up for some time and then released at 4.55a.m. In the cell he
had been vomiting and it seems unlikely that he had fully recovered by the
time of his release. Wandering home in the wrong direction he was killed in
an accident on an urban by-pass. In those circumstances Reeve J. held that
the police, in exercising their discretion whether to release or detain an
arrested person owe him a duty of care, but that, on the facts they had dis­
charged that duty. No policy considerations appear to have limited the duty.
   A similar approach was adopted by Taylor J. in the case of R igby v. Chief
Constable of N o rth a m p to n .3l This involved police attempts to "flush" a
psychopath out of a gun shop. They did this with CS gas which was gener­
ated by a canister which got very hot and which the police knew was likely
to cause a fire. The police originally had a fire engine on hand but it left and
they made no attempt to replace it. A CS canister was then used with no fire
fighters at the scene. The canister did in fact cause a fire which destroyed
the plaintiff's shop. In these circumstances he was able to recover damages
for negligence. No "policy considerations" limited the duty of care.
   The county court case of Charles Wilson A u to m o b ile Engineers v. Chief
Constable of Greater M anchester52 involved a claim for the negligent
release of a car from police custody. The police stopped the car and arrested
the occupants on suspicion of theft. Although the occupants were of no
fixed abode, with no documents and were not the registered keepers of the
car they were released two hours later with the car and they disappeared.
The judge held that:
      "a police officer owes a duty to the owner of goods which he has seized
      to take reasonable care for their safety, to make such enquiries as may
      be reasonable to ascertain their ownership and to take reasonable steps
      to return them to their owner if that is possible."53
The duty owed by the officer was said to be "to take such care as is reason­
able in all the circumstances."34 As the judge said:

51 [1985] 1 W.L.R. 1242; see also ab o v e a t p. 301.

         "One has to take into consideration all the circumstances of the case
         including, for example, the difficulty of any problem facing the officer,
         the nature and extent of the information available to him, the need in
         some circumstances perhaps to make a swift decision and the myriad of
         other considerations which may arise in any particular case."53
 On the facts, it was held that the police were negligent.
    The Scots law in this area is the same as that in England and the Court of
 Session case of Allan (or Wilson) v. Chief Constable of Lothian e) Borders
 Police36 provides a useful illustration of the applicability of ordinary negli­
 gence principles to the police. The pursuer (plaintiff) was a widow whose
 husband had died of hypothermia in a field after having been taken away in
 a police car. The police had been called after a domestic dispute in the
 middle of the night. The deceased had been drunk and aggressive and the
 police were removing him from the place where he had been causing
 trouble.
    Although Lord McCluskey was not prepared to hold that the police had
 "deliberately decided to teach . . . (the deceased) a lesson by depositing him
 in the remote outskirts of Edinburgh"37 he was of the view that:
         "there is no escape from the fact that had the police officers given any
         thought to the weather conditions, the deceased's condition, the
         deceased's clothing, the remote location in which they left him, the
         conditions underfoot they would have been bound to realise that he
         was a danger to himself. "38
He held that the police had a choice, whether to release the deceased or to
hold him and:
         "In deciding how to exercise that choice they had a duty to exercise a
         reasonable care to have regard to the reasonably foreseeable conse­
         quences of his being released."39
Although it was not reasonably foreseeable that the deceased would die of
hypothermia the damage suffered by him was of a "reasonably foreseeable
type"—that is harm by adverse weather conditions—and could, therefore,
be recovered for.60
  The judge concluded that "the police failed in their duty to take reason­
able care for . . . (the deceased's) safety''61 and his widow was, therefore,
awarded damages of £62,537 calculated on ordinary "fatal accidents" prin­
ciples.62
  In summary when police officers act in a negligent way they will in
general be liable according to ordinary principles. However, they will not be
subject to high standards of care in situations in which there is an important
discretionary element in the activity in question.

 1. The Legal Status
 and Organisation of the
 Police


1. INTRODUCTION


   The legal status of the British police is complex and suffers from many
 obscurities. Modem statutes governing the position have, according to the
 familiar pattern, been constructed on common law assumptions which have
 never been fully clarified. Despite the central importance of the police in the
 legal system there are considerable doubts as to such fundamental matters as
 their precise duties, the legal status of the organised “police force" and the
 extent to which they are obliged to follow the orders of police authorities.
   Many civil actions against the police turn on the extent of their powers.
These powers flow partially from statute and partially from their status as
 "constables" at common law. An understanding of the "office of constable"
 and the duties which flow from it remains fundamental to any analysis of
the legal position of the police. The powers which the law gives to the
police are, almost always, vested in individual constables. It is important to
distinguish between the different types of powers involved. These areas
dealt with in the first section of this chapter.
   Although the law has taken very little direct cognisance of the fact that
the police operate in "forces" an understanding of police organisation and
hierarchy is.sometimes of great importance in considering the civil law pos­
ition of police officers. In the second section of this chapter, therefore, the
organisation and structure of the police is considered. This involves not
only the organisation of individual police forces but the relationship of
forces to police authorities and to the Home Secretary. The police are regu­
lated by a tri-partite system designed by the Police Act 1964. The present
constitutional arrangement is that the police (outside London) are super­
vised by an ill-defined co-ordination of chief constables, police authorities
and the Home Secretary.
   The relationship between police officers can give rise to practical problems
in relation to "vicarious liability." Difficult and unresolved questions arise
concerning the circumstances in which chief constables are liable for the torts
of officers in their force and the precise legal relationship between officers.
These questions are considered in the fourth section of the chapter. In the final
section police ranks, appointment and promotion are briefly discussed.
2. THE CONSTABLE: OFFICE, DUTIES AND
POWERS


Introduction

   From the point of view of most citizens the police appear to be one more
branch of the government. They seem to be a nationally organised, hier­
archical and disciplined body of men, under the ultimate control of the
Home Secretary. In strict law, however, their position is very different.
Although they are public servants in the broadest sense, they have a unique
legal status. A police constable is an officer of the Crown and holds a public
office. He is said to exercise an original discretion in keeping the Queen's
peace which derives from the office of constable and the swearing of the
constable's oath. He is said to be answerable to the law and to the law alone.
   The position of chief constables and the Metropolitan and City of London
Police Commissioners is also unique. The conventional view of their pos­
ition is that they have complete “operational independence" from national
and local government. It is said that the responsibility for maintaining law
and order belongs solely to chief officers and no minister of the Crown or
locally constituted police authority is entitled to interfere with the way in
which they carry out these functions. This doctrine is discussed and criti­
cised in Chapter 13.1
   The roots of the unique constitutional status of the police are to be found
in the gradual evolution of the common law system of part-time, unpaid,
“parish constables'' into the modem professional police force. The first
organised “police force" along modem lines was, of course, established in
London by the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829. This force was always
under the ultimate direction of the Home Secretary although the precise
limits of his powers over it have never been clearly established.2 Outside
London, local authorities were empowered to set up police forces by the
Municipal Corporations Act 1835 (in the boroughs) and the County Police
Act 1839 (in the counties!. The next century saw the slow development of
the present policing system with the number of police forces declining
(from 237 in 1856 to 43 today), chief constables gradually asserting their
“operational independence" and the Home Office taking on an increasing
range of regulatory and supervisory functions.3The modem policing system
was substantially in place after 1945 and was confirmed and regularised by
the Police Act 1964. Although this legislation clarified the relationships
between police authorities, chief constables and the Home Office4 the basic
"element of policing" is the same as it has been for many centuries: the
common law constable. Despite the increasing numbers of statutory func­
tions given to the constable over the past 150 years, there has been no com­
prehensive statutory definition of his duties. His basic legal status is still
defined by the common law.

The office of constable

  The 1929 Royal Commission5 described the police in the following
terms:
     “The police of this country have never been recognised either in law or
     tradition as distinct from the general body of citizens. Despite the
     imposition of many extraneous duties on the Police by legislation and
     administrative action, the principle remains that a Policeman, in the
     view of the common law is only “a person paid to perform, as a matter
     of duty, acts which if he were so minded he might have done volun­
     tarily."6
Although these remarks are often quoted they do not recognise crucial dif­
ferences between the common law powers of constables and those of private
citizens. At common law a constable could arrest a person whom he had
“reasonable and probable cause to suspect" was guilty of treason or felony
(both of which at common law were capital offences). Furthermore, the
common law also gave constables, but not ordinary citizens, a range of
powers of entry and search.7
   Although the distinctive role of the individual police constable was recog­
nised by the common law, the police force as an organisation of constables,
was not. Thus, H a ls b u iy ’s Laws of England states that:
     “notwithstanding that the police have numerous statutory powers and
     duties, in essence a police force is neither more or less than a number of
     individual constables whose status derives from the common law,
     organised together in the interests of efficiency."8
  A member of the police force when carrying out his duties as a constable
acts as an officer of the Crown and a public servant.9 Consequently, as a
public officer, a constable commits a common law offence if he wilfully and
culpably neglects to perform any duty which he is bound to perform (either
at common law or by statute) unless the discharge of the duty would
involve greater danger than a man of ordinary firmness and authority might
expect to encounter.10
  By virtue of the office itself, a constable acts on his own responsibility
when exercising his powers (unless executing a lawfully issued warrant).11
Therefore, although a chief constable commands his force, he cannot give
an officer under his command an order to do acts which can only be lawfully
done if the officer himself forms a suspicion on reasonable grounds.12

Similarly, he cannot divest policemen of their powers of arrest and any
attempt to do so would be unlawful.13
   A distinctive feature of the "office of constable" is the swearing of the
constable's oath. Every constable upon his appointment must be attested as
a constable by making a declaration that he does—
      "solemnly and sincerely declare and affirm that . . . (he) will well and
      truly serve Our Sovereign Lady, the Queen, in the office of constable
      without favour or affection malice or ill will; and that . . . (he) will to
      the best of his power cause the peace to be kept and preserved and pre­
      vent all offences against persons and properties of Her Majesty's sub­
      jects; and while . . . [hej will to the best of his skill and knowledge,
      discharge all the duties thereof faithfully according to the law."14
The declaration must be made before the Commissioner or Assistant Com­
missioner of the Metropolis or in any other case, a justice of the peace with
jurisdiction within the police area.13 The Royal Commission on the Police
suggested that the constable's claim to be independent from outside control
is reflected in the terms of the constable's oath.16 However, it is difficult to
see how such a suggestion can be supported by an examination of the words
of the attestation itself.17


The “independence" of the constable

  Lustgarten has suggested that the precise nature of the constable's "orig­
inal authority" and "independence" can be subjected to further analysis.18
He argues that "discretion" plays a central role. Perhaps the most important
aspect of a constable's discretion is whether or not to invoke the criminal
law in the first place.19 Yet, the obvious dangers inherent in selective law
enforcement have not troubled the courts. In A rrow sm ith v. Jenkins10 the
Divisional Court dismissed such a complaint. Lord Parker C.J. said:
      "I think the defendant feels that she is under a grievance because—and
      one may put it this way—she says: 'Why pick on me? There have been
      many meetings in this street from time to time. The police, as on this
      occasion have attended these meetings and assisted to make free pas­
      sage, and there is no evidence that anybody else has ever been pros­
      ecuted. Why pick on me?' That of course has nothing to do with this
      court. The sole question here is whether the defendant has contravened
      [the statute].21"

  It is also entirely within the constable's discretion what particular legal
power he exercises and what particular charge he arrests for, where several
are available to him.
  At the same time the constable works within an organisational hierarchy
which imposes substantial limitations on his "independence." He is subject
to numerous standing orders which he is bound to obey as duly arising out
of the chief constable's power and obligation to control the police force.22
His decision to arrest is reviewed by his superiors who may reject his
charge. It has, therefore, been argued that the only sense in which the police
constable is "independent" is that he alone must assess whether or not the
factual pre-conditions for making an arrest exist.23



The duties of the constable


   The duties of constable derive from his office and have long been thought
to be common law duties. However, in George v. G arland 24 it was held that
the obligations of a police officer had become statutory duties because they
are now expressed in the form of delegated legislation.25 In any event, the
question of whether the constable's duties are statutory or exist at common
law is irrelevant for the purposes of enforcing them by way of judicial
review.26 The House of Lords made it clear in C.C.S.U. v. M inister for the
C ivil Service 27 that judicial review will apply to a power derived from the
common law or the royal prerogative just as much as it does to a statutory
power.
   The primary function of the constable is the preservation of the Queen's
Peace.28 The leading case of Glasbrook Bros. v. Glamorgan C o u n ty C oun­
cil29 concerned the payment of the police by colliery owners during a coal
miners strike. Viscount Cave stated that
        "No doubt there is an absolute and unconditional obligation binding
        the police authorities to take all steps which appear to them necessary
        for keeping the peace, for preventing crime or for protecting property
        from criminal injury."30
  In Rice v. Connolly31 Lord Parker C.J. described the duties of the police as
follows:
        "it is part of the obligations and duties of a police constable to take all
        steps which appear to him to be necessary for keeping the peace, for

      preventing crime or for protecting property from criminal injury. There
      is no exhaustive definition of the powers and obligations of the police
      but they are at least these and they would further include the duty to
      detect crime and to bring offenders to justice."32
Thus, it is a constable's duty to prevent breaches of the peace that he
reasonably apprehends33 but not to protect an individual against "a mere
apprehension of future crime."34 He is under a general duty to protect life
and property33 and to execute in his area a warrant issued by a justice of the
peace 36
  There is an important discretionary element in these duties. As Sir John
Donaldson M.R. has put it:37
      "There is no doubt about the duty of the Chief and other Constables to
      keep the peace and enforce the law . . . However, Chief Constables
      have the widest possible discretion in their choice of the methods
      whereby they will discharge this duty {R. v. C om m issioner of Police for
      the Metropolis, ex. p. Blackburn [1968] 2 Q.B. 118)."38

Cases such as Glasbrook Bros. v. Glamorgan C ou nty Council 39 and Rice v.
C onnolly40 express this discretion in subjective terms: a constable must do
what appears to him to be necessary. Nevertheless, it has been established
by a number of important judicial review cases over the past two decades
that, however subjective a discretion is, its exercise is subject to objective
principles. The discretion must be exercised bona fide in accordance with
the law, relevant matters must be taken into account and irrelevant matters
must be excluded.41 Furthermore, in the Scottish case of Wilson v. Chief
C onstable of Lothian d) Borders 42 it was held that, in exercising their dis­
cretion, the police owed a duty of care to someone who would, foreseeably,
be affected by its exercise.
  In general, a constable's duties:
      "must be carried out in a fair and even-handed manner. Because his
      resources are finite he will not be able to provide perfect protection for
      all. Even if he has available resources his public duty is not boundless.
      He has a duty to protect against crime or threatened crime, particularly
      threatened violent crime. It is not his public duty to protect against the
      mere apprehension of possible crime. There is no absolute standard of
      duty and no definition of the exact amount of police protection to

       circumstances.”43



 The nature of police powers


   In order to be able to carry out their various duties in an effective manner
the law gives constables a number of special “powers." Under these powers
the police are “authorised” to do things which would otherwise be unlaw­
ful. If an ordinary citizen attempted to stop and search people in the street,
to arrest them on suspicion of having committed crimes, or to enter and
search their houses he would usually be liable to civil action. Police powers
provide constables with a defence of "lawful justification" against civil
actions in respect of actions carried out in pursuance of their duties.
   In invoking their powers the police are seeking to justify activity which
is, prima facie, an unlawful interference with another's interests.
   As a general principle of statutory construction, statutes which justify
such activity must be strictly construed against those seeking 10 reply on
them. To cite the words of Lord Diplock:
      "if the statutory words relied upon as authorising the acts are ambigu­
      ous or obscure, a construction should be placed upon them that is least
      restrictive of individual rights which would otherwise enjoy the protec­
      tion of the common law."44
The comments of Lord Scarman on the importance of express statutory pro­
vision are also relevant here:
      "it is not the task of judges, exercising their ingenuity in the field of
      implication, to go further in the invasion of private rights and liberties
      than Parliament has expressly authorised. The importance of express
      provision is that it affords the citizen the opportunity, if he chooses to
      use it, to read and understand the extent to which his rights and liber­
      ties have been curtailed."43
  Police powers are of three basic types: common law powers, without war­
rant powers and with warrant powers. Different considerations apply to
defences of "lawful justification" based on different types.

(1) C o m m o n l a w p o w e r s . Despite increasing trends towards the statutory
codification of police powers the common law position remains of crucial
importance in many cases. This is in part due to parliament's strange reluc­
tance to abolish common law powers, even when enacting statutory powers
covering the same ground. An example of this is the failure of the Police and

Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to abolish common law powers of seizure.46
Police powers at common law have been refined and adapated by judicial
decision over the centuries. The courts continue to play a creative role in
this field. The most recent example being the extension of the M aieva juris­
diction to the police.47 As a matter of general principle such extensions
should be limited in scope because the powers in question represent
invasions of the common law rights of citizens.
   Common law police powers are usually such that they can only be exer­
cised if certain preconditions of fact and belief are fulfilled. Thus a constable
has a common law power to arrest someone whom he sees breaking the
peace or who so conducts himself that he causes a breach of the peace to be
reasonably apprehended. If no breach of the peace has taken place and none
is reasonably apprehended then the constable has no common law power of
arrest and any arrest made will be unlawful.

(2) Without warrant powers. Many of the most important police powers
of arrest, search, entry and seizure are statutory "without warrant" powers.
In other words, they can only be exercised if particular preconditions of fact
or belief laid down by the statute are fulfilled. The majority of such powers
are now to be found in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. If the
preconditions of fact or belief laid down by the Act are not met then an
arrest, search or entry will have been done without "lawful justification"
and an action in tort will lie. It is important to note that the lawfulness of
the exercise of a police power must be justified at the time of its exercise, "It
cannot be made lawful or unlawful according to what happens after­
wards."48
  The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 contains a number of "proce­
dural safeguards" in relation to "without warrant" powers. It is submitted
that the proper approach when examining such provisions is as follows:
   (a) It is first necessary to consider whether the police conduct at the tim e
they are obliged to follow a particular provision is prima facie tortious: are
they detaining or searching a person, entering land or holding goods at that
time? If not then no action in tort will lie simply for a breach of the proce­
dural safeguards. A failure to carry out a procedure that must be followed
after the prima facie tortious conduct has occurred will not retrospectively
render otherwise lawful actions unlawful.49 Thus, for example, the police
will not be guilty of false imprisonment solely because they fail to comply
with a duty which arises after the suspect has been subjected to a "stop and
search."30

   (b) If the conduct is prima facie tortious it is necessary to identify the
police power in the Act which "justifies" the conduct and consider whether
the police have acted "in accordance" with it;
   (cj If the police have not acted in accordance with their statutory power it
is necessary to consider whether or not, on a true construction of the stat­
ute, the provision casts a m a n d a to ry d u ty on the police. A procedural safe­
guard which gives the suspect an entitlement but which places the police
under no duty to implement it will not render them liable in tort if they fail
to do so (although an action for breach of statutory duty may lie).31
   (d) If the police were acting in a way which was prima facie tortious and
are in breach of a mandatory duty laid down by the statute then, it is sub­
mitted, they will be deprived of the defence of "lawful justification" and an
action in tort will lie.32
  Under section 66 of the 1984 Act the Secretary of State has a duty to issue
codes of practice in connection with "searches of premises by police offi­
cers" and "the seizure of property found by police officers on persons or
premises."33 Any breach of the provisions of these codes of practice will
render a police officer liable to disciplinary proceedings.34 But, by section
67(10) a failure of a police officer to comply with any provision of a code
"shall not of itself render him liable to any criminal or civil proceedings."
Nevertheless, it is provided by section 67(11) that
      "In all criminal and civil proceedings any such code shall be admissible
      in evidence; and if any provision of such a code appears to the court or
      tribunal conducting the proceedings to be relevant to any question aris­
      ing in the proceedings it shall be taken into account in determining that
      question."
In other words, the provisions of a code can be taken into account in civil
proceedings. They will, it is submitted, be relevant to the "reasonableness"
of police conduct in particular situations. Rather like the Highway Code
they will not be definitive of this but will provide a basic framework within
which reasonableness can be assessed.55

(3) “With warrant'’ powers. Police arrests, entries, searches and seizures
are often conducted under the authority of a legal authorisation or "war­
rant."36 A warrant gives the person to whom it is issued lawful authority to
do acts which would otherwise be unlawful. A warrant provides a complete
defence to a civil action in respect of things done "in obedience to it." Even
if a warrant is, in fact, invalid the police will have a statutory defence under
the Constables Protection Act 1750 provided they act "in obedience"' to it 37

was because police constables were not "servants" of the watch committee
or the chief constable but independent "officers of the Crown." The pos­
ition was summarised as follows:
      "A constable . . . when acting as a peace officer, is not exercising a dele­
      gated authority, but an original authority, and the general law of agency
      has no application."12
  It is submitted that, on the narrow question of whether police officers are
"servants" of their watch committees or police authority this conclusion
was legally sound.13 Nevertheless, it gave rise to considerable practical diffi­
culties as members of the public would bring civil actions against individ­
ual constables who had no right to recompense from public funds against
awards of damages. The practice seems to have been to give financial sup­
port on an ad hoc case by case basis. The use of public funds by the Home
Office to settle a civil action in 1959 gave rise to stormy parliamentary
debates and was one of the factors which led to the setting up of the Royal
Commission on the Police.14
  The Royal Commission recommended that statutory provision be made
for vicarious liability and this was enacted by section 48(1) of the Police Act
1964. This provides that the chief constable of a particular police force (or,
in London, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner) is vicariously liable—
      "in respect of torts committed by constables under his direction and
      control in the performance or purported performance of their functions
      in like manner as a master is liable in respect of torts committed by his
      servants in the course of their employment."
If the officers committing the tort were being "lent" by one police force to
another under the provisions of section of the Police Act 1964 then, by sec­
tion 14(3) they are deemed to be under the direction and control of the chief
officer to whom they are lent.
   If a chief officer is found to be vicariously liable for a tort committed by a
constable under his direction and control then damages are payable out of
the police fund.13 If an action against a chief officer is settled then the
damages are payable out of the police fund only if the settlement is
approved by the police authority.16
   The provisions of section 48 give rise to a number of potential practical
problems. First, it applies unclear common law provisions to the vicarious
liability of chief constables without dealing with possible differences
between police officers and ordinary employees. Secondly, instead of deem­
ing constables to be servants for all purposes it confines this to actions in
tort. This may give rise to difficulties in questions of vicarious responsi­
bility outside the law of tort. These problems are considered in the next two
sections.

Vicarious liability and the law of tort

    The effect of section 48 is to fix a chief constable with liability in all situ­
 ations in which a "master is liable in respect of torts committed by his ser­
vants in the course of his employment.” The situations in which a master is
 so liable depend on the very considerable case law in this area. Only the
 briefest of guidelines can be given here.17
    The question to be asked in all vicarious liability cases is whether, at the
 time the tort was committed, the servant was "acting within the scope of
his employment."18 This does not mean that the servant must, in fact, be
acting in performance of his master's purposes in an authorised way. If a ser­
vant is doing an authorised act then the master will be liable even if it is
being done in an unauthorised manner.19 If a servant is doing an act which
is expressly forbidden by his master then the master will still be liable if the
prohibition deals with conduct within the sphere of his employment. If, on
the other hand, the prohibition limits the sphere of employment itself then
the master will not be liable in respect of the prohibited acts.20 The com­
mon law position is explicitly recognised in section 48 by the words "in the
purported performance of their functions."
   It is submitted that if a constable is on duty and is bona fide purporting to
carry out policing functions then there is no doubt that his chief constable
will be vicariously liable for any torts committed by him. If, however, a con­
stable is acting so outrageously that it could not possibly be thought that he
was "purporting to perform policing functions" then his chief may be in a
position to deny vicarious liability. Thus, for example, if a police officer
goes shoplifting whilst on duty it is difficult to see how his chief officer
could be vicariously liable for wrongful interference with goods. As in all
such cases liability will depend on all the circumstances of a particular case.
   A difficult which is peculiar to the vicarious liability of police officers
concerns torts committed by "off duty" police officers. In ordinary master
and servant cases there can be no question of vicarious liability if the ser­
vant is not actually working for the master at the time the tort is commit­
ted. The position in relation to the police is less clear.
   Police constables hold office under the Crown and it can be argued that
they continue to have responsibilities of such office whether or not they are
formally on duty. This is a problem which must often arise in practice in
relation to the criminal offence of "assaulting a constable in the execution
of his duty” contrary to section 51(1) of the Police Act 1964: is a person who
assaults an off-duty constable guilty of the offence? Surprisingly enough,
there is no direct authority on this point. The indirect authorities point in
different directions. In the case o iM cL orie v. O xford 21 Donaldson L.J. treats
an officer's being on duty as a necessary condition for his acting "in the
execution of his duty."22 On the other hand, the defendant in the case of

A lb e r t v. Lavin23 was convicted of the section 51 offence in relation to an
off-duty police officer. Although the point was not explicitly considered by
either the Divisional Court (which included Donaldson L.J.) or the House of
Lords the conviction was upheld.
  It is submitted that, in strict law, police constables are always on duty.
Thus, a chief constable will be liable for any torts committed by a police
officer "in purported performance of" policing functions whether or not the
officer was on duty for police pay purposes at the time.
  Although there are a number of potential difficulties in this area there is
no reported case in which a chief officer has sought to contend that he was
not vicariously liable for the actions of one of his constables.


Agency and the police

   The case of Fisher v. O ld h a m 24 not only denies that constables are "ser­
vants" of watch committees but goes on to hold that they exercise "original
authority" and are that the "law of agency has no application."23 If this
were correct then it would mean that one police officer, exercising his func­
tions as a "peace officer," could never be regarded as "acting on behalf" of
the chief constable and senior officers who were giving him orders. This
could have some impact on civil actions where questions of police knowl­
edge are at stake.
   It is submitted, however, that police officers must now be regarded as
agents of their chief officer. The contrary dicta in Fisher v. O ld h a m 26 are,
strictly, obiter as the case was directly concerned only with the relationship
of master and servant. In any event, the position has now, arguably, been
altered by the effect of section 5 of the Police Act 1964 which places a police
force under the direction and control of the chief constable. Such direction
and control suggests a subordination of the original authority of individuals
constables to that of the chief constable.27 This contention is supported by
the case of H a w k in s v. B epey 28 in which it was held that a police officer
instituting a prosecution was, in effect, doing so "on behalf of" his chief
constable.
   It is submitted, therefore, that police officers are properly regarded as
agents of chief officers of police. It would follow that the usual principles of
the law of agency apply. In particular, information which is given to a police
officer within the scope of his authority is effective as if it were given to his
principal, the chief officer. Matters which are known by any constable
would therefore, be deemed to be known by the chief officer, and hence by
all officers under his command as his agents.
   The impact of this conclusion in police cases is limited by the fact that
many police powers depend on the state of knowledge of the individual con­
stable concerned. In deciding whether an arrest is lawful the knowledge and
beliefs of the arresting officer (or the officer who supplied the information

    for arrest)29 must be considered. A chief officer cannot direct a constable to
    make an arrest.30 The lawfulness of continued detention depends on what
    was known to the custody officer.31 Whenever a statute requires a
    constable to have reasonable grounds then principles of agency will be irrel­
    evant.

     POT TCF DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

The basis of present day police duties and responsibilities lies in the
requirement of each individual officer to uphold the the fundamental
principles contained in the statutory declaration taken upon enrolment This
is required by Section 18 of the Police Act 1964 and defined by schedule 2
to that Act as follows;

 “
 L       of....___ do so/emn/yands/ncere/y dec/areandaffirm t/iatI wiff
 we//and tru/yserve OurSovereignLady 77ie QueenHi t/ie office of

preventa//p/fences against thepersons andproperties ofHerMajesty's
subjects, and that whiteI continue to ho/d thesaidoffice f wit/to the best
ofmyskiffandknow/edge discharge a//the duties thereoffa/t/i/Wy



The composition of this oath indicates a duty to Sovereign, state, people
and custom in accordance with the dictates of the law.


A police officer’s authority, therefore, arises from his having sworn to serve
the Crown and when on duty he acts as an officer of the Crown and a
public servant His powers are exercised by virtue of his office and on his
own responsibility.
                                      1
 Chief Constables and senior officers are not liable, except under certain
statutes, for the actions of their subordinates and constables are not
employees of police authority or Crown.


This unique position must be considered when looking at the responsibi­
lity of the police collectively or as an organsiation.


The precise constitutional position of the constable is still somewhat
ambiguous and little is written on the subject in government and
constitutional commentaries.


In 1959 a disagreement between the Nottingham Watch Committe and
the Chief Constable led to detailed debate about the constitutional
relationship between police authorities and police acting as law
enforcemnet officers. The Watch Committee dismissed the Chief
Constable but his re-instatment was secured by the Home Office. Their
view was that chief officers of police, as constables at common law,
exercise a discretionary authority in keeping the peace and are not subject
to control or instructions by watch committes whilst performing their
law enforcement function.


The original office of constable was held at common law and later
enlarged by the Statute of Wincester. It is debatable if, at that time, any
independence of action or freedom from control, was envisaged. The
status of constable was subject to variance and by the eighteenth century
had diminished to that of servant of the local Justices.
    The supposition of the individuality of the powers of a constable is based
    upon an interpretation of statute law which asserts that powers are
    conferred on a constable as ” original ” and not ” delegated ” from any
    other authority.


    This position has not arisen as a result of any judicial enquiry neither is
    there any principle in English public law on which it is based.

•   The only time when the position of the constable has been subject to
    judicial review has been in the area of civil liability and in particular the
    general rule that there is no master and servant relationship between
    constables and their police authorities.


    A man took an action against Oldham Corporation after being wrongly
    arrested on a warrant.


    His case was based on the fact that he considered the defendents were
    acting through their watch committee and were the police authority for the
    County Borough of Oldham and thus the employers of the police for the
£   borough.

    The mans counsel was unable to cite any English decision in which civil
    liability of a police authority for the actions of its constables had been
    determined.


    Judgement examined the relevant provisions of the Municipal Corporations
    Act 1882 which provided watch committes with the ability to make
    regulations to ensure borough constables were efficient in the discharge of
    their duties. However, this authority was complicated by the Police Act
    1919 which gave the Home Secretary, as central police authority, power to
    make regulations as to the government, pay, allowances, conditions of
    service etc.
                                            3
From these considerations and the common law view of the status of a
constable, it was clear that the police were fulfilling their duties as public
servants and officers of the Crown and the corporation were not
answerable in law for their actions. Judgement was given for the
defendents.


ffs /ie r v O ld/iam Corporation f L930Ji


The effect of the judgement wras to make it plain that the powers of a
police officer, whether conferred by common or statute law, are exercised
by him by virtue of his office and cannot be exercised on the responsibility
of any person but himself.


A number of Royal Commissions, public enquiries etc, have reviewed this
general principle but it remains essentially intact.


Following a Royal Commission in 1960, the Police Act 1964 made Chief
Constables responsible in law for torts committed by his officers.


Further cases have confirmed the independence of the constable and the
position at present can be summarised by words from the judgement in R
v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis ex parte Blackburn ( 1968 ).


” Every constable in the land should be and is independent of the executive.
No minister of the Crown can tell him he must o: must not keep
observation on this place or that he must or must not prosecute this person
or that, nor can any police authority tell him to do so. ”
The actual position of the police as an independent authority has never been
stated.


The cases quoted clearly indicate the thoughts of the judiciary but there is
evidence that this position is otherwise regarded by the executive. One such
example is contained within the Customs and Excise Management Act
1979, where customs and excise, being a revenue gathering service of the
government, have power conferred by the legislation to demand police
assistance.


We see then that each invidual within the police has a duty and responsibi­
lity to disharge his duties according to the law and is responsible for his
conduct

The police as an organisation have a duty to enforce prohibitions created by
the legislature. When a law is passed it will, if required, grant a power to
the police to enable enforcement.


Inherent in the power granted is the requirement of its use, and therefore, a
duty or responsibility to use it as circumstances dictate.

Many laws actually require a course of action by the police or chief
constables as with firearms control, immigration or licensing, and no
discretion is available in many instances.
Other laws within the criminal Held are intentionally defined vaguely to
give the police discretionary powers. Threatening and abusive words or
behaviour under the Public Order Act or obstrucing free passage along the
highway under the Highways Act are such examples which allow the
police to control a situation using their judgement, they cannot be
understood as acts against which the police are instructed to proceed.


The law and the criminal justice system do not influence the police by
direct means or instructions. They define a set of opportunities and
constraints. The powers conferred by the law are resources that the police
may use in pursuing their objectives.


It may be said that the police have a duty to enforce all laws equally and
not attempt to change the rules by non enforcement of selected legislation.


The legislature may, of course, wish to define limits of conduct and set out
codes of behaviour for the police, such as The Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984, again the police have a duty to obey.


It would be pointless to list all those statutes individually which give
powers and responsibilities to the police, any act dealing with criminal law,
traffic law, control of licensed premises etc will by its very nature
empower the police to act as regulatory body.

 LIABILITY
(7) V icarious lia b ility
   (1) Apart from the criminal liability o f corporations, dealt with at §§ 17-] ] et
seq., vicarious liability rarely arises in trials on indictm ent, as it is usually confined
 to sum m ary offences. In som e cases however, these can be tried o n indictment
w hen the defendant has the right o f election.
    W here an offence has been held to be an absolute offence, in that mens rea as
 defined above is not required, “ the person on w hom a duty is throw n is respon­
sible, whether he has delegated or w hether he has acted through a se r v a n t” : R. v,
 Winson [1969] 1 Q .B . 371, C .A ., {per curiam). See also Barker v. Levinson [1951] 1
 K .B. 342; C. Gabriel L td. v. Enfield Borough Council [1971] C rim .L .R . and contrast

    In Portsea Island M u tu al Co-operative Society L td . v. Leyland [1978] C rim L.R. 554,
 the Divisional C ourt held that w here a milk roundsm an, contrary to his
em ployers’ orders and w ithout their know ledge, em plo yed a boy o f 10 to help him
on his round, the em ployers were not guilty o f an offence under section 21 o f the
 Children and Young Persons A ct 1933. T h e C ourt held that on the authorities the
roundsman's em ployers w ould only be liable i f there w as clear evid en ce that they
em ployed the child or that a servant, for ex am p le a personnel m anager, w ho was
em ployed to take on staff, em ployed him.
    (2) In the class o f cases, where a duty is thrown on a particular category o f per­
sons, e.g. licence holders, it has been held that i f that person has delegated his
responsibilities to another the mens rea o f the delegate will be im p uted to the princi­
pal so as to m ake the latter crim inally liable. T h is form o f liability has been termed
“ vicarious lia b ility.” T h e leading case appears to be Linnett v. Metropolitan Polia

defendant was unaw are o f it.
    Lord G oddard C.J. said: “ T h e point does not, as I say, depend merely on the
fact that the relationship o f m aster an d servant exists; it depends on the fact that
the person w ho is responsible in law as the . . . licensee o f the house has chosen to
delegate his duties, powers and authority to so m e b o d y else . . . . I do not wish it to
be thought that I a m say in g that w here a statute provides that in a n y business a
certain act perm itted by the m a n ager shall be an offence on the part o f the
m anager if it is done w ith his know ledge, that if the act takes p lace whilst the
m anager h im self is carrying on that business and is in charge o f the business but
without his know ledge, so that he w as powerless to prevent it, that person necess­
arily com m its the offence. But if the m anager choose to delegate the e a r n ing on of
the business to another, w hether or not that other is his servant, then what that
other does or w h a t he know s m ust be im puted to the person w h o put the other into
that position.”
    (3) C onsiderable doubts w ere cast upon this doctrine o f “ vicarious liability by
delegation” in Vane v. Yiannopoullos [1965] A .C . 486,. H .L . T h e doctrine h o w ever
w as reaffirmed and applied by the C ourt o f A ppeal in R. v. Winson , ante, where Vane
v. Yiannopoullos w as considered. In R . v. Winson the licensee w as a b sent from the
premises, and the k now ledge o f the m anager w as im puted to the ab sent licensee.
T h e doctrine w a s applied in H ow ker v. Robinson [1973] 1 Q .B . 178, D.C. and
extended to the case where the licensee w as on the prem ises but had delegated the
control o f a particular bar to the barm an. T h e ba rm an ’s k now ledge w as imputed
to the licensee. It is su bm itted that it is at least doubtful w hether the House of
Lords w ould approve o f any extension o f this doctrine to offences w h ere it had not
already been applied before the decision in Vane v. Yiannopoullos.
   N o thing said ab o v e affects the liability o f a defendant w h o has counselled, pro-
cured, aided or abetted another to com m it an offence, see post, § 2 9 - 3 et seq.
(8) O ffences by corporations
   (1)   T h e question o f w h ich offences can be charged against corporations is con­
sidered in § 1 -2 9 ante. It is proposed now to consider for w hose acts, intention,
know ledge etc., a corporation is held responsible. T h e authorities are mainly con­
   cerned with lim ited com panies, but it is su bm itted that they will app ly to all
   bodies corporate.
       Where absolute or vicarious liability exists the sam e principles a p p ly as to the
   liability o f a personal defendant for the acts o f its servants, or its agen ts in cases
  such as Linnett v. M etropolitan Police Commissioner, ante.
      (2) A corporation aggregate m ay b e indicted, by its corporate nam e, for
  breaches o f public duty, w hether in the nature o f nonfeasance or o f m isfeasance,
  such as the obstruction o f a highw ay by a railway com pany, in a m an ner not au th ­
  orised by their A ct o f Parliament: A tt.-G en . v. London & North Western R y . [1900] 1
  Q.B. 78. It w ould seem , also, that a corporation m ay be indicted bv its corporate
  name, and fined, for a libel published by its order. See Pharmaceutical Society v. Lon­
  don & Provincial Supply Association (1880) 5 A p p .C a s. 857, 870; Triplex Safety Glass
  Co. v. Lancegaye Safety Glass Co. (1934) L td. [1939] 2 K .B. 395.
      (3) Apart from such cases, the principle seem s to be m ost clearly expressed by
  Lord Diplock in Tesco Supermarkets Ltd. v. N attrass [1972] A .C . 153 at 199: “T h e
  natural persons w h o are to be treated as b eing the com p an y for the purpose o f acts
 done in the course o f its business are those natural persons w h o by the m em oran­
 dum and articles o f association or as a result o f action taken by the directors, or by
  the company in general m eetin g pursuant to the articles, are entrusted w ith the
 exercise o f the powers o f the com p a n y .”
      (4) In other cases difficult questions h av e arisen in decid ing w hich o f the officers
 or servants o f a corporation are to be identified w ith it so that their guilt is the guilt
 of the corporation. It m ust be a question o f la w w hether, once the facts have been
 ascertained, a person in doing particular things is to be regarded as the corpor­
 ation or m erely as the corporation’s servant or agent. In Bolton ( Engineering ) Co. v.
 Graham [1957] 1 Q .B . 159, 172, Lord D e n n in g M .R . said: “ A co m p a n y m ay in
 many ways be likened to a hum an body. It has a brain and nerve centre w hich
 controls w hat it does. It also has hands w h ic h hold the tools and act in accordance
 with directions from the centre. S om e o f the p eople in the com pany are mere ser­
 vants and agents w h o are nothing more than hands to do the work a n d cannot be
 said to represent the m ind or will. O thers are directors and m anagers w h o rep­
 resent the directing m ind and will o f the c o m p an y , and control w hat it does. T h e
state of m ind o f these m anagers is the sta te o f m in d o f the c om p an y a n d is treated
 by the law as su c h .” In Tesco Supermarkets L td . v. Nattrass [1972] A .C . 153, Lord
 Reid at p. 171, w h ile generally approving the ab o ve-m entioned statem en t o f Lord
 Denning added: “ T h ere have been attem pts to apply Lord D e n n in g ’s words to all
servants o f a com p an y w h o se work is brain work, or w ho exercise so m e m anagerial
discretion under the direction o f superior officers o f the com p a n y . I do not think
 that Lord D e n n in g intended to refer to them . H e only referred to th ose w h o rep­
resent the directing m in d a n d will o f the com p an y and control w hat it d oes. I think
that is right. . . . T h e board o f directors m ay delegate so m e part o f their functions
o f m anagem ent giving to their delegate full discretion to act in d ep en d en tly o f
instructions from them . I see no difficulty in holding that they have thereby put
such a delegate in their place so that w ith in the scope o f the delegation he can act
as the com pany. It is not alw ays easy to draw the line, but there are cases in w hich
the line m ust be d ra w n .” H e cited with approval the speech o f Lord H a ld a n e L.C.
in Lennard’s Carrying Co. L td. v. A siatic Petroleum Co. [1915] A .C . 705, 713 and
expressed the view that R . C. Hammett L td . v. Crabb 95 J .P . 180 and R . C. Hammett
Ltd. v. London County Council 97 J .P . 105 and Series v. Poole [1969] 1 Q .B . 676 w ere
wrongly decided an d that in R . v. I. C. R . H aulage L td. [1944] K .B. 551 the prin­
ciples relating to the liability o f a com p an y for its agent had been too w id ely stated.
Lord Morris o f B orthy-y-G est, at page 180, said that there had been n o feature o f
delegation in the case to a store m anager, w h o did not function as th e directing
mind or will o f the com pany, but was, s o to speak, a cog in the m achine w hich had
been devised; it w as not left to him to d evise it, nor w as he within w h a t had been
called “the brain area” o f the com pany. Lord Pearson, at page 192, em phasised
that the shop m anager could not be identified w ith the co m p a n y ’s ego nor w as he
an alter ego o f the com pany, but an em ployee in a relatively subordinate post. Lord
Diplock, at page 199, laid dow n the principle set out in (3) ante.

MISFEASANCE IN PUBLIC OFFICE
6. MISFEASANCE IN A PUBLIC OFFICE

Introduction

  A police constable holds a "public office."82 One consequence of this is
that a constable who wilfully neglects to perform his duty is guilty of a
crime at common law.83 It also entails potential civil liability in the ancient
tort of misfeasance in public office.
  The action for misfeasance in public office can be traced back at least to
the eirly eighteenth century. In the famous case of A s h b y v. W hite,84 the
House of Lords upheld an action for damages by an elector who had been
wrongly refused a vote in parliamentary elections. The elements of the tort
were clarified and developed in a number of nineteenth century cases.
Nevertheless, for reasons which are not entirely clear, it appears to have fal­
len into disuse in England for a considerable period85 and the leading text­
books in the law of tort either ignore it entirely or classify it as being
"doubtful."
  Such a view is now plainly untenable. In the Privy Council case of D u n­
lop v. W oollahia M unicipal C ou ncil 86 Lord Diplock refers to the "well-
established tort of misfeasance by a public officer in the discharge of his
public duties." In the case of Bourgoin SA v. M in istry of Agriculture^7 Mann

J. provided an important and detailed analysis of the tort.88 The existence of
an analogous cause of action in Scotland was confirmed by the case of
M icosta SA v. Shetland Islands C ouncil.89


The elements of the tort

  The precise "elements" of the tort do not appear to have been set out sys­
tematically in any case or textbook. There are, it is submitted, four of them.
The tort is committed when:
       (1) a public officer;
       (2) causes damage;
       (3) to a "foreseeable" plaintiff;
       (4) by acts or omissions which are a "malicious abuse" of his office.

(1) “A public officer. ” This term covers:
      "everyone who is appointed to discharge a public duty, and receives
      compensation in whatever shape, from the crown or otherwise."90
There can be no doubt that a police constable is a "public officer" in this
sense. In Lewis v. C a ttle 91 Lord Hewart C.J. said that "a police officer is a
person who holds office under His Majesty." The point was conceded in R.
v. D y th a m 92 In the important Australian case of Farrington v. Thomson
Bridgland93 a sergeant of police was held to be the holder of a public office.

(2) Damage. This is required because misfeasance is an action on the case.
Any kind of damage will be sufficient, including, it is submitted, not only
financial damage, but loss of liberty or damage to reputation.94

(3) A foreseeable plaintiff. This element involves the issue of limitation
of the class of potential plaintiffs. In many of.the old cases the defendant's
acts were "aimed at " a particular person for malicious reasons. There was,
therefore only one potential plaintiff and no "limitation" issue arose. In the
Bourgoin case it was unsuccessfully argued that "intent to injure the plain­
tiff" ("targeted malice") was an essential ingredient of the tort. It was held
that a plaintiff would be entitled to sue in either of two situations:
       (1) if damage was caused to him by a malicious act which was aimed at
           him;
       (2) if the defendant had deliberately done an act which he knew he did
           not have power to do—with knowledge of its consequences—and
           the plaintiff had suffered damage as a result.95

On this view, the class of potential plaintiffs would embrace any claimant
who in fact suffers damage, provided that damage was foreseeable. The
"limitation" issue was not expressly considered in the Bourgoin case but
the class of potential plaintiffs seems dangerously large, bearing in mind the
numbers of people who may be affected by the actions of public officers
such as police constables. It could be argued that one possible limiting prin­
ciple would be to confine plaintiffs to the class of those to whom injury
from an unlawful administrative act is reasonably foreseeable. The test
would, then, be the same as in negligence.
   Another possibility was suggested in the Australian case of Tam pion v.
A n derson .96 It was held that the plaintiff must show that:
     "he was a member of the public or one of the members of the public to
     whom the holder of the office owed a duty not to commit the particular
     abuse complained of."
Thus, it might be argued that if a police officer stood by and allowed
someone to be injured by attackers (as in the D y th a m case), the person
injured (or, as in D y th a m , his estate or dependants) could sue but, for
example, his employer, could not.
   The whole question of "limitation" of the class of potential plaintiffs to
whom the duty to behave properly in a public office is owed awaits further
judicial clarification.

(4) A ct or omission. The fourth element is some act or omission, by the
public officer, which constitutes a "malicious abuse" of his office. It is now
clear that there does not need to be a "positive act" or "misfeasance" to pro­
duce liability. An omission, by which the officer fails to perform a public
duty will be sufficient.97 An important question arises when a police officer
orders someone to do something when he has no power to do so. Is such an
order an "act" for the purposes of this tort? In an Australian case a police
officer ordered a hotel owner to close his hotel, knowing that he had no
power to do so. It was held that this was sufficient to found liability in mis­
feasance.98


Malice

   Malice has always caused the most difficulty in relation to this tort. It has
often been argued that whenever damage is caused by a public officer doing
something beyond his powers an action for damages should lie. This argu­
ment has been rejected in the large majority of cases.99 The position is dif­
ferent, however, if the act is knowingly invalid. There is now no doubt that
in such a case tortious liability will arise. In the Bourgoin case (in an analy­
sis accepted by all the judges in the Court of Appeal)1Mann J. put the point
like this:

96 ]1973] V.R. 715 a t 749.
97 See H e n l y ’s case (1828) 5 Bing. 91 a t 107.
98 See F arrington v. T h o m s o n et) B rid g la n d {1959] V.R. 2 8 6 a t 2 9 3 -2 9 4 .
99 See D u n lo p v. W o o lla h ia M u n c ip a l C o u n c il {1982] A .C . 158; a n d T a k a i o Proper­
   ties v. i?o w iin g ]1 9 7 8 ] 2 N .Z .L .R . 3 14.
 1 ]1985] 3 A ll E.R. 585 a t 6 2 2 j-6 2 4 d , p e r O liv e r L.J.
       "There is no sensible distinction between the case where an officer per­
       forms an act which he has no power to perform with the object of injur­
       ing 'A' (which the defendant accepts is actionable at the instance of 'A')
       and the case where an officer performs an act which he knows he has no
       power to perform with the object of conferring a benefit on 'B' but
       which has the foreseeable and actual consequence of injury to 'A'."2
Thus, a "misfeasance" or "malicious abuse" is committed by the police in
one of two circumstances:
        (1) where a police officer does something for a "malicious motive"
            which causes damage to the plaintiff;
        (2) where damage is caused by a police officer "knowingly" doing
            something which he has no power to do.

(1) Improper motives. The first alternative requires "malice." As in mali­
cious prosecution cases "malice" does not simply mean "ill will" or spite.
As Lord Campbell C.J. said to the jury in Tozer v. Child (a direction upheld
by the Court of the Queen's Bench)
       "malice might be proved, not only by evidence of personal hostility or
       spite, but by any evidence of any other corrupt or improper motive."3
Any "wrongful motive" will, therefore, be sufficient "malice" for these pur­
poses. Thus, it will be a "malicious abuse of office" for a police officer to
request a person to wait for him at a police station in a deliberate attempt to
harm his business or to relieve him of the burden of conducting immediate
inquiries to enable him to go home early. The latter motive is a "wrongful"
one in law, even though no spite or hostility are involved.
  If the actions of a police officer are "malicious" in this extended sense
they do not have to be ultra vires his powers to attract liability.4 In other
words, there will be liability in damages for any loss caused by police acts or
omissions based on wrongful motives. Thus a police officer who lawfully
seizes goods which he has reasonable grounds for believing are evidence of
an offence which it is necessary to seize to prevent them being concealed
will be liable for misfeasance if his motive in seizing the goods is not the
collection of evidence but some wrongful motive such as causing damage to
the owner's business. Despite the lawfulness of his acts he will be liable
because of the maliciousness of his motive.
  The mere presence of a wrongful motive is not, in itself, sufficient to
found liability. Such a motive must be determinative of the act or omission
in question. The criminal case of R. v. Llewellyn-fones,s provides useful
guidance here. The case involved a County Court Registrar who was
accused of making an order in relation to funds under his control "in the
expectation that he would gain personal advantage from the making of such
an order." The trial judge ruled that:
       "if the registrar of a county court when exercising his power to order
       payment out of court of money held on behalf of a beneficiary were to
       make an order in expectation of some personal benefit he hoped to

      obtain and in circumstances where, had it not been for the personal
      benefit, he would not have made the order, that would be an example of
      misconduct in a public duty . . . but I would not be prepared to say that
      it would be misconduct for this purpose for a registrar to make a
      decision which did affect his personal interests, merely because he
      knew that his interests were so involved, if the decision was made
      honestly and in a genuine belief that it was a proper exercise of his juris­
      diction."6

(2) Knowing invalidity. The second alternative way that a police officer
can “abuse" his office is by doing something which he knows he has no
power to do. Thus the unlawfulness of his actions is a necessary precondi­
tion to liability. Under this second alternative motive is entirely irrelevant.
He may act out of the best of motives but, if he knows that he has no power
to act in that way then he will be liable in tort for damage caused.7It is clear
that “actual knowledge" of invalidity is necessary. “Constructive knowl­
edge" will not be enough.
   The most famous of all recent misfeasance cases was under this second
head. It concerned an order given by the prime minister and attorney-
general of Quebec to a liquor licensing authority. He ordered the cancel­
lation of the plaintiff's restaurant licence because the plaintiff had stood
bail for various Jehovah's Witnesses who were at that time responsible for
serious public order problems in Quebec. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court
of Canada found that the defendant had abused his office and awarded the
plaintiff damages of $33,123.8
   An important example is the case of Farrington v. Thom son &) Bridg-
la n d .9 The plaintiff was the licensee of a hotel which the police ordered him
to close down because they believed his licence to be forfeit. It was estab­
lished that the police, in giving such orders were “intentionally purporting
to exercise a power to give binding orders to the plaintiff which they were
fully aware, at the time, that they did not possess."10 It was held that this
was sufficient to found a misfeasance action. Smith J. also decided that the
fact that the plaintiff had obeyed the order was not sufficient to make the
resultant damage too remote.11


Applicability to police cases

   The tort of misfeasance in public office is, it is submitted, a well-estab-
lished cause of action which is plainly applicable to the police. In many
situations it will overlap with established torts. Thus if a police officer
arrests a plaintiff knowing that he has, in fact, no power to do so he will be
liable in false imprisonment as well as misfeasance. Given the fact that the
burden of justifying false imprisonment is on the police the former would
obviously be the simplest cause of action to pursue.

   Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which misfeasance may be the
only available cause of action. Thus if a constable makes a lawful arrest
with a malicious motive an action in false imprisonment will not be avail­
able but there will be a cause of action in misfeasance. To take another
example, if the police give a person orders which they know they have no
power to give and the person obeys and as a result suffers loss then there
will be no action in trespass. There will, however, be an action in misfea­
sance as Farrington's case illustrates.
   It would seem that if a police officer brings a prosecution against someone
with a malicious motive but with reasonable and probable cause then, if the
prosecution terminates in that person's favour, an action for misfeasance
will lie.
   If a person is caused damage by a police policy decision which is known to
be ultra vires then damages can be recovered in misfeasance. If a policeman
knowingly or maliciously neglects to carry out his duties then an action
may be brought. In R. v. D y th a m ,12 the police constable was accused of
"wilfully omitting to take any steps to preserve the Queen's peace or to pro­
tect the person" of a man he saw being~attacked. The man died arid the con­
stable was convicted of the offence of wilful neglect of his duty. It is
submitted that the deceased's estate could have recovered damages in mis­
feasance.

BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY
3. BREACH OF STATUTORY DUTY

Introduction

   The police have a large number of specific statutory duties under legis­
lation such as the Police Act 1964 and the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984. It has been held that the general duties of the police as constables
are now "statutory duties."90
   In line with general tort principles it is possible that a breach of some of
these duties may give rise to an action in damages for "breach of statutory
duty." In particular, such an action may be the only possible remedy for a
lawfully arrested and detained suspect who is denied his rights under Part
IV of the 1984 Act.91

 The right of action


   An action for breach of statutory duty will only lie if the statute is one
which in fact confers a right of action for damages. This is, fundamentally, a
question of policy: should the breach of a particular statutory provision be
compensated in damages? The court must consider whether or not the stat­
ute in question intended to give a right of action in tort.92There are “indica­
tions which point with more or less force to the one answer or the other."93
   The first “indication" is whether there is, in the statute, an alternative
method of enforcing compliance or penalising non-compliance.94 The
absence of any other sanction creates a presumption that there is an action
for breach of the statute.95
   The second “indication" is whether or not the duty is imposed for the
benefit of a particular class of persons.96 If the duty was imposed to benefit a
particular class an action is more likely to lie.
   The third “indication" which may point to the absence of a right of action
is a lack of precision in the definition of the statutory right which it is
sought to enforce.97
   When a statute casts duties on a public authority such as the police, diffi­
cult questions arise as to which of the duties are “public law" ones and
which give rise to "private rights." A distinction has been drawn between
“decision-making" functions, which are a matter of public law, and “execu­
tive" functions which may give rise to private law rights and obligations.98
If the public authority makes an “unlawful" decision—because the proper
procedures were not followed, because an incorrect view of the law was
applied or for general W edn esbu ry reasons99 this must be challenged by the
“judicial review" procedure. No action for breach of statutory duty can
arise. Once the decision has been made, however, private law rights do arise
and may be enforced by an action for breach of statutory duty—provided
that, on a true construction of the statute, such an action is available. The
precise limits of this distinction remain to be worked out. The mere fact
that “public law" questions arise concurrently to a “private law" right of
action will not prevent a plaintiff from bringing an action for breach of
statutory duty.99a

The elements of the tort

  Even if it can be established that the statute is one which confers a right
of action, three other things must be established in order for a plaintiff to be
entitled to recover damages for breach of statutory duty:

(1) The duty must be ow ed to the plaintiff.1There is unlikely to be any
difficulty in cases brought by suspects for breaches of duty under the Police
and Criminal and Evidence Act 1984. This requirement may, however,
cause considerable problems if a plaintiff seeks to base an action upon
general duties cast upon the police by statutes such as the Police Act 1964.

(2) The defendant m ust be in breach of the statutory duty. This a
question of fact and, of course, depends on the precise wording of the rel­
evant statutory provisions. The burden of proof will be on the plaintiff.

(3) The harm must be of the kind that the statute was designed to
preventr Difficulties under this head are unlikely to arise in actions for
breach of statutory duty under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
as the statute is designed to prevent damage of all kinds to people who are
suspected of offences.
  Although an action for breach of statutory duty is an action on the case3 it
is not always necessary to prove damage as part of the cause of action.
Whether or not damage is a necessary ingredient of the cause of action has
been said to depend on the construction of the statute involved. Thus:
     "Where, from its context, it is clear that the statute created alright in
     the plaintiff so absolute in its content that the plaintiff was to be pro­
     tected against violation, even though it caused no damage, then the tort
     is actionable per se."4
The following rights have been held to give rise to a breach actionable per
se: the statutory right to vote,3 the right to receive a statement of how
wages were made up,6a person's right to have his suitability for a living as a
minister of religion determined.7 A person's rights under the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 should be actionable per se as the interests
protected by the statute—interests in receiving information and assistance
while under police investigation—do not usually generate "special damage"
if they are violated. As Street says:
     "The courts are most likely to interpret in this manner a statute which
     protects an interest of the plaintiff other than his interest in his person
     or his goods."8

Applicability to police cases

   The availability of this cause of action to police cases depends on the par­
ticular statutory provision which is being relied upon. The Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1 9 8 4 gives rise to a number of rights to information
and assistance. No remedies for breach of these provisions is provided by
the statute. It should be noted that by section 67(10) it is expressly provided
that a failure to comply with any provisions of the Codes of Practice issued
under section 66 "shall not of itself render him liable to any . . . civil pro­
ceedings.” The only liability that this section can be seeking to exclude is
that for breach of statutory duty. It is significant that the statute does not
seek to exclude liability for breach of the provisions of the Act itself, as
opposed to the Codes. So; an action for breach of statutory duty must then
lie if the police fail to comply with the "information and assistance" pro­
visions of the 1 9 8 4 Act. The following sections would appear to give rise to
potential actions:

(1) S e c tio n 5 6 : R ig h t to h a v e s o m e o n e i n f o r m e d w h e n a r r e s te d . This
section provides that:
     "Where a person has been arrested and is being held in custody in a
     police station or other premises, he shall be entitled, if he so requests,
     to have one friend or relative or other person who is known to him or
     who is likely to take an interest in his welfare told, as soon as is practi­
     cable except to the extent that delay is permitted by this section, that
     he has been arrested and is being detained there."9
The section permits delay only in the case of serious arrestable offences10if
it is authorised by an officer of at least the rank of superintendent.11 Delay
may only be authorised where there are reasonable grounds for believing
that12telling the named person of the arrest:
     "(a) will lead to interference with or harm to evidence connected with a
     serious arrestable offence or interference with or physical injury to
     other persons; or
     (b) will lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having com­
     mitted such an offence but not yet arrested for it, or
     (c) will hinder the recovery of any property obtained as a result of such
     an offence."13
If a delay is authorised the detained person must be told the reason for it and
the reason should be noted on his custody record as soon as is practicable.14
Once the reason for authorising delay ceases to exist there may be no
further delay in permitting the exercise of the right.15 Similar consider­
ations apply to the duty to inform the "person responsible for the welfare"
of a child or a young person that he is in police detention under section 57 .

         "(1) A p e r s o n a r r e s te d a n d h e l d in c u s t o d y i n a p o l i c e s t a t i o n or o t h e r
        p r e m i s e s s h a l l b e e n t i t l e d , if h e s o r e q u e s t s , t o c o n s u l t a s o l i c i t o r
        p riv a tely at a n y t im e . . .
        (4) If a person makes such a request, he must be permitted to consult a
        solicitor as soon as is practicable except to the extent that delay is per­
        mitted by this section."
The section permits delay only where the person is in detention for a
serious arrestable offence and the delay is authorised by an officer of at least
the rank of superintendent.16 Such delay may only be authorised where the
officer has reasonable grounds for believing17 that the exercise of the right at
the time the person desires to exercise it:
        "(a) w i l l l e a d t o i n t e r f e r e n c e w i t h or h a r m t o e v i d e n c e c o n n e c t e d w i t h a
        s e r i o u s a r r e s t a b le o f f e n c e or i n t e r f e r e n c e w i t h or p h y s i c a l i n j u r y t o
        o t h e r p e r s o n s ; or
        (b) will lead to the alerting of other persons suspected of having com­
        mitted such an offence but not yet arrested for it; or
        (c) w i l l h i n d e r t h e r e c o v e r y o f a n y p r o p e r t y o b t a i n e d as a r e s u l t o f s u c h
        an o ffe n c e."

If a delay is authorised the detained person must be told the reason for it and
the reason must be noted on his custody record.18 Special provisions apply
to persons detained under the terrorism provisions.19 It is difficult to see
how, in the large majority of cases, a private consultation with a solicitor
could lead to the results which would justify the delay.

(3) S e c tio n 21: R i g h t s to a c c e s s a n d c o p ie s . The section gives the per­
son who had custody or control of something seized by the police the right
to apply for access to it20or the right to obtain photographs or copies.21 This
right is subject to a number of statutory limitations.22
   The "indications" point towards there being a right of action against the
police for breach of the provisions of all these sections. The only remedy
provided by the Act for breach is disciplinary action against the officers
involved. This does not give any right to damages to the person deprived of
his statutory entitlement. The sections are designed to protect specific
classes of people, namely, those in police custody or whose property has
been seized. Finally, the duties under all the sections are defined with preci­
sion. It is further submitted that breaches of sections 56, 5 7 or 58 will be
actionable per se.23
   It would follow that a detainedpersonwho wasdenied his rightsunder
section 5 6 or section 58 will haverights ofaction against thepolice for
breach of statutory duty. His damages for this breach would be "at large"24

and he would also have a potential claim for aggravated and exemplary
damages. Furthermore, any "reasonably foreseeable" special damages could
also be recovered. A person who was denied access to property held by the
police or copies of documents would also have a right of action for breach of
statutory duty under section 31.
   In an unreported case23 two firms of solicitors applied for injunctions to
restrain the police from breaching their statutory duty in refusing to allow
them access to clients held'in police custody. Rose J. refused the application
saying:
    "I am not persuaded that I have jurisdiction. Assuming I did have juris­
    diction were I to make the Order sought it would be unreasonable, a
    hindrance to police inquiries may be caused."
It is submitted that there was, in fact, no jurisdiction to make the order as
the proper plaintiffs were not the solicitors but the prisoners who, in the
nature of the case, could not give instructions to make the application. The
prisoner would, however, have an action for damages after his release. It is
further submitted that in such a situation the solicitors would have locu s to
apply for an order of mandamus to compel the police to discharge their
statutory duties under section 58.26

                                         § 16.1.            KILLING IN HOM ICIDE

T h e common law definition of murder, and similarly that of manslaughter,

requires that the defendant should have “killed" his victim, and that the
death should follow within a year and a day (§ 11.1).
   A "‘killing" can take place by any means. There need be no direct
physical act. If the victim asks his wav on a dark night, and the defendant,
intending to cause his death, directs him to a path that he knows will bring
him to the cliff edge, and the victim suffers a fatal fall, this is clearly
murder, though the defendant has done nothing more than utter words. So
we may say that "killing" means conduct causing death in any way that the
law regards as sufficient.1What these w'avs are has to be considered.

What o f accelerating the victim ’s death?
  This is a "killing'' in law. Since we are all fated to die at some time, every
instance of killing is an instance of accelerating death: and even if death is
hastened by as little as five minutes it is still a criminal homicide. So it is
no defence to a person who stabs another to death to show that the victim
was already dangerously ill.2 All the same, as we shall see. there are some
cases where the courts will ignore minimal causation (§ .5).

W hy require that the death must follow within a year and a day?
   In origin the rule was perhaps dictated bv the desire to limit difficult
problems of causation.3 The CLRC proposed the continuation of the rule
on the ground that it would be w'rong for a person to remain at risk of a
charge of homicide for a long time.4 He may have been convicted and
sentenced for causing serious injury; if the victim then dies from the injury,
it would be undesirable to have a fresh trial for murder.

Do problems of causation arise only in homicide cases?
  These are the most important in practice, but a causal question is
capable of arising in other offences, particularly those against the person

           they are not sure that it is untrue, they must acquit of murder—though
           D may, of course, be convicted of the attempt.
   We may summarise, then, by saying that but-for causation is of legal
interest only in the comparatively rare cases where, notwithstanding
appearances, it is absent; that when it is alleged to be absent, this raises a
question of fact for the jury, who may decide by ordinary experience but
may have to be assisted by expert evidence; and that the burden is on the
Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant’s act (or
omission) was a but-for cause.2
   The last point occasions som e difficulty in respect of expert evidence, because an expert
may not be willing to commit himself to more than the statem ent that the result would
" p ro b ab ly " not have h ap p e n ed as it did apart from the defendant's act o r omission.
Notw ithstanding that the expert will not commit himself to more, the jury (somewhat
strangely) are entitled to draw a sure inference of causation from the evidence.3 Nevertheless,
they should be reminded that they themselves must be sure: and the hesitation or reserve of
the expert should surely be a factor leading the appeal court to scrutinise a conviction with
care.

The courts assume in manslaughter cases like Stone (§ 12.3) that an
omission can be a cause. But surely a non-event cannot be a but-for cause
of an event.
  Whatever the philosophical view may be, the courts certainly assume,
and must assume, that an omission can be a cause (just as lack of oxygen
or food is commonly regarded as a cause of death).4 (However, a court
can, and should, say that a reference to causation in a statute does not
cover omissions, in the absence of express words or necessary implication:
§ 7.3 n. 10). That is not a rule of causation but a question of the legal
import of words.
  The application of the usual burden of proof to the issue of causation is
of considerable importance in cases of omission, and sometimes gives the
court the opportunity of arriving at a merciful conclusion.5 On any charge
involving causation by omission it behoves the defence to go into the
evidence of causation most carefully.

W hat about two but-for causes contributed by different defendants? D oesn’t
your definition imply the paradox that if two persons independently cause
an event, neither causes it?

  To provide for this, an exception for cases of multiple causation has to
be inserted into the definition. It is possible for two sufficient causes, Cl
and C2, to be present together, so that E follows both, when usually it

the particular situation one or other (as the case may be) was not necessary
to be present. An example is where two fatal wounds are given
independently at the same time. See more in § .9.

Suppose that D l ’s shot entered the lung and would have caused the victim ’s
death in an hour, but D 2 ’s entered the heart and killed him instantaneously?
   Then, of course, only D2 has killed him. D1 is guilty of an attempt.
   The but-for cause is sometimes referred to as the factual cause, or the de
facto cause, or the scientific cause. The important thing is to distinguish it
from cause in another sense, the “imputable” (or “legal” or “effective” or
•"direct” or “proximate”) cause, to which we now turn.




                       § 16.3.     IMPUTABLE CAUSATION

When causation is in issue, the defendant's act (or omission) must be
shown to be not only a but-for cause but also an imputable or legal cause
of the consequence. Imputable causes are some of the but-for causes. In
other words, the defendant’s act, being a but-for cause, must be sufficiently
closely connected with the consequence to involve him in responsibility.
The lawyer is interested in the causal parentage of events, not in their
causal ancestry. The Model Penal Code expresses the principle by stating
that a person is not criminally responsible for a result if it is “too remote
and accidental in its occurrence to have a just bearing on the actor's
liability or on the gravity of his offence.”1
    Several attem pts have been made to find a suitable nam e for this second notion of cause.
To call it the "direct” or "p ro x im a te " cause (as is often done) is misleading, because several
''tages may intervene between the so-called direct cause and the effect. D may send poisoned
chocolates to V, who lives at the other side of the world; if V eats the chocolates an d dies,
ihe law will certainly regard D as responsible for the death, though his act was far rem oved
in space and considerably removed in time from its effect. T o call D"s act the "effective" cause
is unhelpful, because every cause must by definition be effective— if an act is not effective to
produce a given result, it is not a cause of it.
   Sometimes (looking at the situation backwards instead of forwards) im putable causation is
'tated in terms of "rem oteness of consequen ce." To say that a particular consequence is "too
remote" is only an other way of saying that the defendant's act (o r omission) is not an
imputable cause.
   Going back to the formulation in the Model Penal Code, the use of the word " ju s t"
indicates the true nature of the problem. When one has settled the question of but-for
causation, the further test to be applied to the but-for cause in order to qualify it for legal
recognition is not a test of causation but a moral reaction. The question is w hether the result
^ n fairly be said to be imputable to the defendant. Sometimes the question of fairness is
settled by rules of law, sometimes it is left for impressionistic decision in the individual case.
I* the term "cause” must be used, it can best be distinguished in this meaning as the
  imputable" or "responsible" or " b lam a b le " cause, to indicate the value-judgm ent involved.
 The word “ im putable" is here chosen as best representing the idea. W hereas the but-for cause
 can generally be dem onstrated scientifically.' no experiment can be devised to show that one
 of a num ber of concurring but-for causes is more substantial or im portant that a nother, or that
 one person who is involved in the causal chain is more blameworthy than another.'1


 W hat are the principles governing imputable causation?
    Hitherto the judges have made little progress in establishing such
 principles. Generally, of course, no problem arises. Where causation is
 obvious, the judge may give no direction upon it, even in a homicide case,
 and even though the burden of proof of causation is supposed to rest on
 the prosecution. “In homicide cases,” said Robert Goff LJ, “it is rarely
 necessary to give the jury any direction on causation as such.”4 Even when
 a direction is given, it is usually in very general terms, without so much as
 distinguishing between factual and legal causation. The judge will use one
of the adjectives already mentioned, telling the jury that the defendant’s
act must have been the “efficient” or “direct” or “proximate” or
 “substantial” cause of the result, or something beyond a trivial cause, or
that the result must not have been too “remote” Or he may tell them that
in law the defendant’s act need not be the sole cause, or even the main
cause, of the result, it being enough that the act contributed “significantly”
to that result.5 This is good enough if the defendant's act was clearly an
imputable cause, and it may be good enough in cases where no precise rule
can be formulated. It is unsatisfactory in some of the cases to be discussed
in this chapter, where the proper result may seem doubtful to the layman
and a vague direction may produce discordant verdicts which could have
been avoided if more specific guidance had been given.
   The direction to the jury should distinguish, where necessary, between
the two kinds of causation, and the jury should be informed with some
precision of any rules of law that are involved. If the issue is one of but-for
causation, it should be enough to ask the jury whether the defendant’s act
(or omission) was a cause of what happened, explaining that this means:
would the event have happened in any case? There is no need to talk about
“substantiality.”6 But if the issue is whether the alleged cause w'as an
imputable cause, and if the proper view is that for some specific reason the
alleged cause was not or may not have been an imputable cause in law, it
should be a misdirection to instruct the jury no more fully than this.7

  Similarly,             if the       legal view is that the defendant's act was a cause

     This was the practice during the 19th century. Courts would robustly tell
  the jury whether or not the defendant was responsible for the conse­
  q u e n c e s on given facts. There are now indications that the judges will again
  do this, if the facts are sufficiently strong.
            In Pagett8 the defendant was a gunman who shot at armed police,
            using a girl as a shield. The police returned his fire in self-defence, and
            accidentally killed the girl. Pagett, charged with the murder of the girl,
            w'as acquitted by the jury of murder but convicted of manslaughter,9
            and his appeal against conviction was dismissed.

    The case will be discussed later as an application of the principles of
 causation. At present we are concerned with it only as an instance of the
  judge's function. On the question of causation the trial judge had directed
 the jury that it was for him to decide as a matter of law w'hether the
 defendant caused the death. On this the Court of Appeal commented: “No
 legitimate criticism can be made of the judge's direction. Strictly speaking
 it was for him to direct the jury on the applicable principles of law, leaving
 it for them to decide as a question of fact, on those applicable principles,
 whether the necessary causal link had been established. In practical terms
 that was precisely what the judge did.'’
    The first of these sentences seems to deny criticism of the judge, while
 the second sentence seems to express some faint criticism. Perhaps the
 court means that it is best for the judge not to say frankly that the causation
 question is for him, but that all the same he may instruct the jury in such
 terms that where the facts are clear they have no causation issue to decide.
There is no virtue in such hair-splitting.
    The theoretical problem may be clarified if we distinguish between cases
where there is and is not a relevant rule of law on the subject of imputable
causation. If no satisfactory rule can be formulated, and it is a matter of
 "gut reaction,” the proper verdict on the point being subject to legitimate
doubt, the jury can be told that they must decide whether in fairness the
result should be attributed to the defendant. (The direction is
unnnecessary if it obviously is imputable to him.) If a rule can be
formulated, which ought to govern all similar situations (which w-as the
case in Pagett). the judge should be entitled to announce it firmly to the
jury, and where necessary to exclude irrelevant evidence.
    The last proposition is supported by another recent case. M a lc h e re k ,10

          irretrievably damaged, she was taken off. On a charge of murder the
          trial judge refused to leave the issue of causation to the jury, and D
          was convicted. On appeal the defence sought to introduce evidence to
          suggest that the doctor had switched the machine off prematurely, but
          the court refused to hear the evidence. In such circumstances, the
          court declared, where a doctor decides “that the patient is for practical
          purposes dead,"’ and switches off. this does not in law prevent the
          assailant from being responsible.

    Granted, then, that rules of imputable causation are rules of law, we
 must consider what these rules are. Subject to what is to be said in § .9 as
 to the new intervening act, no problem generally arises when the defendant
 has intentionally produced the consequence.11 The chief difficulties relate
 to unintended consequences. It may be suggested that five rules are
 supported either by authority or by common sense:

—       the rule that negligence must be relevant (§ .4);
—       the minimal causation principle (§ .5);
—       the ordinary hazard principle (§ .7);
—       the reasonable foresight principle (§ .8); and
—       the principle of the new intervening act (§ .9).



                             § 16.4.           CAUSATION AND NEGLIGENCE

Where negligence (or recklessness) is in issue, a limiting rule straddles the
divide between but-for and imputable causation. The rule is that the
negligence proved against the defendant must be negligence in a relevant
respect. The case must be such that the accident would not have happened
if he had not been negligent. In other words, the defendant is not liable for
an event that is not causally connected with the feature of his conduct that
was negligent. The rule has some applicaton to manslaughter and causing
death by reckless driving.
         An illustration in the reports is D a l l o w a y } The driver of a horse and
         cart let the reins lie loose on the horse's back. This was of course a
         negligent way of driving. A child ran across the road, and was knocked
         down and killed. Erie J directed the jury that if the driver by using the
         reins could have saved the child he was guilty of manslaughter^ but
         that if they thought he could not have saved the child by pulling the
         reins they must acquit him.
            In other words, the question was this. Assuming that the defendant
         had been driving carefully, holding the reins, would the death have
         occurred? A defendant is not guilty of causing a death by negligence
         if the victim ran out at a moment when no one— not even a person
         who had been behaving carefully throughout—could have pulled up.

                   § 16.5.             THE DEFENCE OF M IN IM A L CAUSATION
O f the assorted adjectives mentioned in § .3, “substantial" currently finds
the greatest favour: and if this word is used in instructing the jury a
conviction is pretty safe from being upset on appeal. However, the Court
of Appeal regards it as being too favourable to the defendant.1 The
preferred direction is to tell the jury that they can convict the defendant if
his conduct (for example, his reckless driving) was “a cause” of the death,
being something more than a purely trivial cause (a de m inim is
contribution, as it is ungrammatically termed). The reference to "a cause”
is presumably to but-for causation, while the reference to minimal
contribution seems to express the idea that imputable causation is lacking.
This direction at least gives the jury some pointer to the fact that they are
entitled to use common sense (or moral instinct) on questions of causation.
   It may have been a notion of minimal causation that was in the mind of
Devlin J in A d a m s .2 As we have seen (§ .1), the acceleration of death is
supposed to be enough for criminal liability, so that the defendant is not
normally allowed to say that the victim would in any event have died
before long. But in A d a m s Devlin J directed the jury that when health
cannot be restored a doctor “is still entitled to do all that is proper and
necessary to relieve pain and suffering even if measures he takes may
incidentally shorten life.” The passage as a whole seems to imply the view
that what the doctor does by way of approved medical practice is not a
cause in law'. It plays such a minor part in causing the death that it can be
excluded from consideration. A more satisfactory reason would be the
doctrine of necessity, at which Devlin J perhaps glanced in his use of the
word “necessary. ”J But we may applaud his attitude without enquiring too
closely into its legal basis.



                                       § 16.6.             THE UNEXPECTED TWIST
Most problems of causation relate to what may be called the unexpected
twist, which is to occupy the rest of this chapter. Subject to what is to be
said later, an unexpected twist in the 'outcome of conduct does not

necessarily put the end result outside the mental element, or mean that the
conduct is not the imputable cause of the result.
           For example, D attacks V intending to stab him in the arm, but V
           jumps back, falls and cracks his head. Assuming that both the harm
           intended and that suffered are grievous bodily harm, there is no
           difficulty from the point of view either of mens rea or of causation in
           convicting D of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, under
           section 18 of the OAPA. The legal category is “grievous bodily
           harm.” and it does not matter that the defendant intended one form
           and did another.1
   Such facts are very similar to transferred intention, except that here the
intention takes effect upon the person intended, and the only variation is
in respect of the way in which it takes effect or in respect of the precise
description of the injury. The unexpected twist principle does not supplant
the primary requirement of a mental element for the particular crime. In
a crime of intention, the ultimate result must be as intended by the
defendant2; but the mode by which the intended result occurred need not
have been intended/
   W here, as in the case of criminal dam age, the offence is defined in broad term s so that it
covers a great variety of causal nexus, the unexpected twist principle can have unwelcome
results, particularly in making the defendant subject to conviction for doing much greater
dam age than he expected. T he solution here would be to sentence on the basis of what was
within the range of what the d efendant must have foreseen.
   A problem of justice can also arise where the defendant is still at an early stage in his effort
to commit the crim e when events are. so to speak, taken out o f his hands. Professor Smith
suggests that the defendant can be liable for the resuit if he had reached the stage of attem pt,
but otherwise no t.4 H e puts two hypotheticals.

        D prepares a poisoned apple with the intention of giving it to his wife, V, to eat
        tom orrow. V finds the poisoned apple today, eats it and dies. O r D is cleaning his gun
        with the intention of shooting V tom orrow. T he gun goes off accidentally and kills V.

   It would obviously be too harsh to convict D of m urder in the second case; his liability is
for manslaughter. A s to the first case, the answ-er may depend on the more detailed facts. If
D put the poison by his wife's bedside, intending to administer it to her when she woke up.
the jury should be allowed to find that he has launched himself sufficiently far on his ghastly
plan to be guilty of an attem pt, and therefore (according to Smith’s suggestion) to be guilty
of m urder if the wife unexpectedly wakes up and drinks the poison herself. If on the other
hand the poisoned drink is still in the kitchen, the result should probably be different. The
question of attem pt is further considered in § 17.5.
   W hatever the theory may be. the law is not always applied with full rigour. O n a charge
of m urder the trial judge may permit or encourage the ju ry to return a verdict of
manslaughter. O r he may accept a plea to manslaughter, even w hen in strict law it is murder.
T he unexpected twist principle would probably meet with general acceptance in obvious
cases. But the criminal law should, so far as possible, avoid saddling people with liability for
results markedly different from what w’as intended or foreseen. So it is im portant not merely
that the law should be applied with discretion but that we should find rules that satisfactorily

                       § 16.7.            THE ORDINARY HAZARD PRINCIPLE

This is a narrow principle and has not come before the English courts, but
it seems obvious.
          D attacks V intending to stab him to death; V runs away, and in his
          fight is struck by lightning and dies. One would say that D is not guilty
          of murder, though he is guilty of attempted murder. Why is he not
          guilty of murder? Because it was not he that killed V, but the
          lightning? But if V had jumped over a cliff or into a river in an effort
          to escape, or to commit suicide in despair, or had accidentally fallen
          over the cliff or into the river in his flight, D would have been
          accountable for the death, and we should not have said that it was not
          D who killed V but the water or the hard ground. What is it that
          makes us feel that the lightning is different?

   The most obvious answer is that being struck by lightning is an ordinary
risk of life that people do not seek to avoid. One is no more subject to
being struck by lightning when one is running away from an attacker than
when one is taking a walk. The attacker has not substantially increased the
victim’s risk.
   A n o th er example of the ordinary hazard principle is where the victim of an attack dies in
a traffic accident when he is being conveyed by ambulance to hospital, or dies as a result of
a fever which sweeps through the hospital. Assuming that his death was not contributed to
by his weak condition, th e attacker is not guilty of it, because the effect of the attack was
merely to place the victim in a geographical position where an o th er agency produced his
death. T h e attack did not substantially increase the risk of the fatal result, because anyone
may die in a traffic accident or epidem ic.1 O f course, a reasonable man mulling over all the
possible consequences of an attack might think of these possibilities: but they would not be
possibilities rendered any more likely by the fact of the attack. E ven if it could be shown that
there was slightly more risk of dying of fever in hospital than elsewhere (perhaps because of
the presence in hospital of resistant bacteria), this would probably be accounted too
insignifcant to affect the decision.
  Contrast the case where the victim died of hospital fever, but a contributory factor was the
weakness caused by his injuries, so that he would not have died if it had not been for his
weakness. Probably the attacker would then be guilty of criminal homicide (m urder or
manslaughter), for on these facts there is a medical (and not merely a fortuitous) connection
between the wound and the death. It is like the case of a w ound turning gangrenous and
causing death, where the wounding is clearly the cause of death.

  In the absence of English authority, the ordinary hazard principle is a
matter of theoretical speculation. In most but not all applications it can be
regarded as a particular application of a test of reasonable foresight, on
which decided cases can be found.

                 § 16.8.             THE REASONABLE FORESIGHT PRINCIPLE
To say that a consequence, to be imputed to the defendant, must be within
the risk that would be apprehended by a reasonable man is much wider
than the ordinary hazard principle. Under the name of the ‘‘risk principle”
it has been discussed by writers on the tort of negligence, and it also makes
an appearance in the criminal case of R o b e rts}
          Roberts was driving a girl from a party, and, according to the view of
          the facts that (in the opinion of the Court of Appeal) the jury must
          have taken, he pestered her with advances, held her coat and told her
          that he had beaten up girls who had refused him. She jumped out of
          the moving car and suffered injury. The chairman of Sessions directed
          the jury that on these facts Roberts would be guilty of an assault
          occasioning actual bodily harm under OAPA s.47. He was convicted,
          and the conviction was affirmed on appeal. The court said: “The test
          is: Was it [the injury] the natural result of what the alleged assailant
          said and did, in the sense that it was something that could reasonably
          have been foreseen as the consequence of what he was saying or
          doing?”2
  In previous cases of similar tvpeJ the test laid down had generally been
whether the victim acted reasonably in his endeavour to escape. Roberts
widens the area of liability and also puts it on a more intelligible footing.
Whether it is prudent for a woman to jump from a rapidly moving car to
avoid rape is a question on which opinions may differ, but at any rate it is
fully understandable, and the possibility of it could well have been foreseen
by the attacker.
   T h e reasonable foresight principle gives the jury the opportunity of exempting the
defendant w here what h appened is particularly unusual and it would be unfair to hold him
liable. B ut the intentional w rongdoer will rarely be advantaged by it. A lthough he has a
theoretical opportunity of escaping a consequence brought about by the victim's
unforeseeable reaction, a jury would probably be loth to describe an act done to escape as
not reasonably foreseeable. A nyone who makes a serious or distressing attack on another
should realise that the victim may try to escape, and in panic may try to escape in a very
dangerous way. However the question of causation is in the last resort decided by the jury,
and the jury may take a merciful view.4

        T h e facts of a New York case5 would seem to illustrate conduct that is not reasonably
        foreseeable, but the court did not take this view. D gave a lift in his car to an 18-year-old
        girl: and during the journey offered the girl SI toTiave sexual intercourse. The girl in
        panic jum ped from the car, when it was moving at abo u t 25 m .p .h .. fractured her skull
        and died. D was convicted of manslaughter, though he had neither m ade an attack on
        the girl n o r th reatened her, the court holding that her effort to escape was a “ natural
        consequence” of D 's act. O ne may gravely doubt w heth er it was reasonably foreseeable.

       a n d in English law there would be the fu rth e r difficulty of finding an initial act of gross
       negligence on D ’s part.

   An event may be reasonably foreseeable as part of a generic risk, even though it is
 improbable in its details. This observation is illustrated by an old anonym ous case, generally
 known as the harlot's case (1560)6.

       "A harlot w om an was delivered of a child. She laid it away, alive, in an orchard; and
       covered it with leaves. A kite struck at it with his claws. In consequence of being thus
       stricken, the child died very soon afterwards. She was arraigned of m urder: and was
       executed. . . . For she had intended the child's death; and volu ntas rep utatur p ro fa c to ."

   The last rem ark— that the will is taken for the deed— is not literally true; what should have
been said was that since the woman intended to cause the child to die (of exposure), the fact
that it died in a somewhat unexpected way was irrelevant. If the child had been killed by a
vaurant she would not on principle have been guilty of m urder, for. as we shall see. the
intervention of a responsible actor would have m ade the death too rem ote a consequence of
the infant's exposure.
   Kites were com m on in 1560. and appointed themselves scavengers to the City of London.
Now they are rare; but if the drama of the harlot's case were to be rep eated, the baby being
killed by one of these birds, the result would surely be the same. T he harlot intended her baby
to die as the result of withholding from it the hum an protection that an infant needs. This is
the way in which the baby did die, and the unlikelihood of the particular mode of death (if
it was unlikely) was immaterial. We may express the principle by saying that a risk is involved
in the d efen dant’s conduct, and an event is within the risk, if a reasonable person would have
contemplated the event as part of the general risk involved in such conduct, whether as the
major risk or as some subsidiary risk; an d it is im m a teria l that a su b sid ia ry risk was so u n likelv
in itself th a t i f it had s to o d a lo ne the c o n d u ct w o u ld n o t h a v e been n e g lig en t.7
    Another way of explaining the rule would be to say that although the test of risk is usuallv
stated as one of reasonable foreseeability, in practice it is not a question whether the
reasonable defendant, if asked beforehand w hat he foresees, would immediately respond in
terms of what later happens. W hat happens may be only one out of an infinite num ber of
possibilities, and yet it is regarded as foreseeable for legal purposes if it is the kind of thing
that does happen without causing surprise. The question is one of the normality of what
happens w hen looked at with hindsight rather than foresight. This is so, at least, in the law
of tort, where the risk principle is relatively well developed.
   Again, the victim need not be the specific victim that the reasonably foreseeing defendant
would primarily have contemplated: it is eno ugh that he belongs to the general class of
persons who in a larger view would be within such reasonable contemplation. Indeed, if one
thinks only of the particular victim (great-uncle G eorge who has paid an unheralded visit from
Australia) the likelihood of his appearance m ay be so small that if this were the only risk the
conduct would not be accounted negligent at all. W hat characterises the conduct as negligent
is. frequently, the likelihood that members of a class may be involved; and the class may be
defined merely as those who in fact come into perilous proximity.


Doesn’t the risk principle, as applied to crimes requiring intention,
contradict that requirement?
  The objection overlooks the fact that rules of causation cannot make the
defendant guilty of a crime of intention unless he intended the event
specified in the law (such as the death of a human being). All that the rules
do is to settle the question of liability where the event occurs in an
unexpected way. The foreseeability rule is a limitation upon the general
principle relating to the unexpected twist.

How does the rule in manslaughter excluding the victim’s special sensitivity
from consideration square with the risk principle?
  The special sensitivity rule is an exception from the risk principle, but it
can be justified on special grounds.
    These special grounds start from the observation that the risk principle does not operate
 to negative liability if the event happened precisely as the defendant intended. Suppose that
 he aimed at the victim with a rifle and all the experts would have said that the victim was out
 of range; but he hoped to hit the victim and by some freak did so. T he defendant is clearly
 responsible for hitting the victim. Questions of foreseeable risk arise only w hen there is some
 slight shift from the events that the defendant intended.
    All the authorities on the special sensitivity rule seem to relate to m anslaughter, where
 there was no intention to kill; but it can hardly be doubted that the sam e rule applies to
 murder. If the defendant intended to cause death and actually did so, it is irrelevant that the
injury he inflicted would not have caused a normal person to die. This is somew hat similar
to the case just put of the victim being out of normal range of the weapon. H owever, it is not
quite so straightforward. T h e defendant may have aimed to stab the victim through the heart,
but only succeeded in cutting him slightly, but the victim was a haemophiliac and bled to
death. T h ere is here a shift in the intended chain of causation, though (perhaps it may be said)
only a slight shift. A t any rate, it is intelligible that a court should refuse to pay attention to
the victim's parlous state of health, if the defendant has substantially achieved his purpose.
    T he special sensitivity rule does not or should not qualify a requirem ent o f m ens rea or fault
for the particular offence. A n attacker whose m ens rea is limited to the infliction of slight
injury cannot become guilty of murder if, owing to the victim's sensitivity, the slight injury
becomes serious and leads to death. A person who is negligent as to causing slight injury
should not be guilty of manslaughter if, owing to the special sensitivity of the victim, the slight
injury proves to be fatal. Manslaughter should require negligence as to d e a th , or at anv rate
as to grievous bodily harm.
    T he law of constructive manslaughter is anom alous, because if strictly applied it turns a
minor assault into criminal homicide if the victim dies because of his peculiar phvsical
condition. T he interpretation of O A P A s.47 as creating an offence of half m ens rea can also
have the effect that a person may be convicted of an aggravated assault although he neither
intended to inflict bodily harm nor was reckless or even negligent as to it, if bodily harm
follows because of the victim's special sensitivity. B ut if the bodily harm follows only because
of the victim's effort to escape, it is clear from Roberts that the attacker is not liable under
this section unless what the victim did was reasonably foreseeable.


Does the risk principle apply to the doctrine of transferred intention?
  Apparently not. No case decides that it does, and one suggests that it
does not.8 It may be thought that in G o r e (§ 11,5 n. 1) the defendant could
not reasonably have foreseen that the apothecary would be poisoned, yet
her intention was transferred.



                        § 16.9.     NEW INTERVENING ACT
An extreme view of criminal responsibility might be that a man is under
a duty to act in such a way that others are not led to cause harm, so that
in some circumstances he would be responsible for harm that is
directly caused by others, even though without his authorisation or
encouragement. This does not represent the criminal law. The legal
attitude is that a man is primarily responsible only for what he himself does
or incites. The fact that his own wrongful conduct provided the background
for some consequential wrong act by another, and that he should have
foreseen this act, does not make him responsible for it.
   Putting the rule in terms of causation, the new intervening act (novus actus interveniens) of
a responsible actor, who has full knowledge of what he is doing, and is not subject to mistake
or pressure, will normally operate to relieve the defendant of liability for a further
consequence, because it makes the consequence “ too rem o te." Underlying this rule there is.
undoubtedly, a philosophical attitude. Moralists and lawyers regard the individual's will as the
autonomous prime cause of his behaviour. W hat a person does (if he has reached adult years,
is of sound mind and is not acting under mistake, intimidation or o th e r similar pressure) is
his own responsibility, and is not regarded as having been caused by other people. A n
intervening act of this kind, therefore, breaks the causal connection that would otherwise
have been perceived between previous acts and the forbidden consequence. (A n intervening
wrongful omission does not break it.)
  The rule can be rationalised in psychological terms by saying that the intervention of the
responsible actor diverts our retributive w rath from the defendant, the previous actor, who
may appear to be so much less culpable than the later actor, and this switching of retributive
feeling is expressed in causal language. Sometimes, too, we may feel that making people
responsible for the subsequent behaviour o f others, merely because th e y foresaw or could
have foreseen that behaviour, would be too great a restriction upon liberty. Yet another way
of explaining the rule would be to say that part of the object of the criminal trial is to
dramatise society's rejection of the deed, and this is adequately done by prosecuting the
immediate author. T here is no pressing necessity to regard m ore rem ote authors as
responsible for the harm itself, though they may well be prosecuted for o th e r offences, such
as attempt, or in appropriate circumstances as accessories. It is im portant that the law should
not saddle a m an with liability for consequences that not only he but also the general public
would blame on som eone else.

        To take a fanciful case, suppose that D1 prepares a poisoned drink, intending to offer
        it to V. D2, who has his own score to settle with V . and who has observed D l ’s
        preparations, offers the drink to V. who takes it and dies. D 2 was not acting in
        collaboration with D l . D2 is guilty of m urder and D1 is not. If the poison which D1 left
        for V to drink had been administered to him by someone who did not know it was
        poisoned. D l would have been guilty of murder. A s it is, D2's criminal intent insulates
        him from liability.1
           As another example of the rule, a person who provokes another to kill without inciting
        him to do so does not become guilty of m urder or manslaughter, even though he realised
        or should have realised w hat the effect of his conduct would b e .2 Similarly,
        unintentionally provoking an oth er person to break the peaceJ or to drive recklessly-1 does
        not make the provoker criminally responsible.
           A painter makes a habit of painting pastiches in the style of a famous artist. He sells
        them, saying that they are his own work but realising the strong probability that
        eventually some of them will be resold at inflated prices to people who believe that they
        are genuine. Even if one of them is m ade an instrument of fraud, it would be going too

           far to say that the painter is a party to the fraud. Perhaps there should be a law against
           selling pastiches not clearly m arked as such, but there is not.

     T he novus actus rule is of fundamental im portance at common law, because it underlies the
  doctrine of accessorvship. If D2 incites D l to kill V, and D l complies. D2 has prom pted (in
  o rdinary speech, caused) D l to perpetrate the crime, and is himself an accessory to the crime,
  but he has not in law caused V ’s death. Fletcher states the principle as follows.

          “ Aiding the crime of a responsible, self-actuating perpetrator does not 'cause.' 'control'
          o r 'determ ine' the latter's conduct. The accessory contributes to the crime, but the
          execution is not his doing.”5

     A s we have seen, there are certain im portant differences between the liability of the
  accessory and that of the perpetrator. If it were not for the novus acius rule the successful
 inciter would be liable as a perpetrator, which would require the law of complicity to be
 rew ritte n.6
    T h e point just made also shows that the novus actus principle is distinct from the
 req u irem en t of reasonable foreseeability. If D2 pays an assassin D l to kill V. of course he
 foresees that D l will do the killing, so that the requirem ent of foreseeability is satisfied: but
 still D 2 is not a p erpe tra tor of the crime.
    T he novus actus rule does not prevent liability arising for joint negligence in concerted
 action, even though it is the act of only one of the parties that produces the evil result.7 The
 law o f complicity creates liability w here the normal rule for causation would n o t.8
    A lthough a novus actus rule is recognised in the law of tort, it differs from the criminal rule
 in that if A instigates B to commit a tort, both A and B are regarded as causing the result as
 joint tortfeasors. T he law of tort does not distinguish between degrees of complicity as the
 crim inal law does.

   The n ovu s actus principle is so potent that it can even rescue a defendant
from strict liability.
            In Im press (Worcester) L td. v. R ees9 the appellant company's fuel
            store leaked oil into the Severn, after an unknown person had
            tampered with the valve. Normally (it was assumed) the leak would
            have been an offence of strict liability,10 but the Divisional Court held
            that the company was not liable, because the intervening act of the
            stranger was an “intervening cause of so powerful a nature that the
            conduct of the appellants was not a cause at all but was merely part
            of the surrounding circumstances. ”

   The pollution of the river was, of course, factually caused in part by the
circumstance that the company had accumulated fuel near the river. But
this was merely the background of the matter; in law. the only operative
cause was the act of the mischief-maker. The distinction is between
something operating directly to produce the result and something

  homicide, in P a g e tt.u It was held not to prevent liability attaching on the
  facts of the case, for the reason to be considered in the next section.
    Difficult problems can sometimes arise. Suppose, for example, that D1 and D2 successively
 and independently wound V with m urderous intent, and V dies from the loss of blood caused
 by both wounds together, when he would not have died from either alone. Beginning with
 D2. the later assailant, he is guilty of murder, since he must take his victim as he finds him— in
 this case, weakened and bleeding from the first wound.
   As regards the liability of D l. the question is moot. On the one hand it may be argued that
 he is not guilty of m urder if the wound he inflicted would not alone have caused the death,
 because he is not responsible for the subsequent act of a fresh agent. T h e argum ent the other
 way is that both causes are physically operating to bring about death. Does the novus actus
 doctrine insulate D l from liability in respect of the death? (If D l and D2 acted at the same
 lime, though independently, both would clearly be responsible, since their acts would be
 concurrent causes: § .2).
    My own opinion is that D l in the hypothetical should not be held liable for the death. But
 we do not hear much of the novus actus doctrine from the courts nowadays, and it is likely
 to prove in practice to be a fragile shield for the defendant when the facts are horrific.
   The concurrent causation rule is applied in cases of nuisance. Two musical bands together
 (or two pig-farmers together) may be a nuisance when one alone would not. Two cars parked
 opposite each oth e r may render a narrow highway impassable when one alone would not.
 Each defendant is clearly liable if all started their activities at the same time. But it has been
 ruled that where one was first on the scene, and did not at that time com m it an offence, the
 subsequent act of the other does not make him responsible for causing a nuisance or
 unreasonable obstruction as the case may be. The first has not caused the act of the second,
 and what the first did, if it stood alone, would not have been an offence. (This particular
 ruling may be doubted; the offence being a continuing one. questions of intervening act can
 hardly a rise .)12




                    § 16.10.              THE NON-RESPONSIBLE INTERVENER
 We have seen, in discussing the subject of complicity, that if D incites an
innocent agent to commit a criminal act, and the innocent agent does so.
D is regarded as perpetrating the crime. Put in terms of causation, the rule
is that if D has done the last act that he intended to do (instructing the
innocent agent), he causes the result notwithstanding that the immediate
cause w'as the act of another (the innocent agent), if there was no
subsequent criminal volition of another. This principle is wider than the
simple doctrine of innocent agency, as M ich a el 1shows.
         Michael, a single woman, had an illegitimate baby boy a few months
         old whom she boarded out with a foster-mother. Intending to murder
         the infant she bought a bottle of laudanum, told the foster-mother that
         it was medicine, and directed her to give the infant a teaspoonful every
         night. The woman gave none, but put the bottle on the mantelpiece.

      where a few days later her own small boy, aged about 5. being left
      alone with the infant, took the bottle dow'n and administered half its
      contents to the infant, w'ho died. Michael was convicted of murder,
      and the conviction was affirmed by the Court for Crown Cases
      Reserved.
   No clear reason was given by the court for holding Michael responsible,
but we may rationalise as follows. Michael intended to poison her baby
with laudanum administered by the hand of another, and this very thing
happened. The fact that she intended the killing process to be spun out was
immaterial. (The trial judge in directing the jury assumed that it was
necessary for the prosecution to show that a single teaspoonful of the
liquid—the dose directed by Michael—was enough to kill the baby; but
nowadays this would be regarded as too lenient a direction. Even if the
dose of a teaspoonful each night would have killed only by reason of having
a cumulative effect, the variation whereby half the bottle was administered
at once would have been immaterial.)
   The more striking deviation from Michael's plan was the intervention of
a different, and unforeseen, ’actor. The small boy was innocent, being
under the age of criminal responsibility, and Michael was responsible for
the result that he helped to bring about, even though he was not Michael’s
intended tool. Michael had done the last act that she intended to do. and
there was no affront to the sense of justice in saying that the variation in
the chain of causation was immaterial.
   The negative rules we are now studying are cumulative in effect. It is not enough to show
that there was no new intervening act of a responsible actor: it must also be shown that what
h ap pe ned w'as reasonably foreseeable. There w’as ample evidence in M ichael that the latter
rule was satisfied. The defendant had placed the poison in the ro om where the baby wras. and
had described it as medicine for the baby. (It seems very likely that the bov of 5 who had
adm inistered it to the baby had been told or otherwise had com e to believe that it was the
baby's medicine, though the jury were not asked to consider this point.) T he fact that some
oth e r m em ber of the foster-mother's family might do the actual administering of the medicine
was clearly within the risk she created, though of course the question was one for the jury.
   T he innocent agent or non-responsible intervener may. of course, be the victim himself.
This type of problem was discussed in §.6.

   Two decisions mentioned previously provide further examples of the
non-responsible intervener: M alcherek2 and P a g e tt? The judgment in the
latter case proceeds on the basis that the police were acting in self-defence,
but the more obvious justification was that they were entitled to kill if
necessary in the course of trying to make an arrest or to prevent violent
crime or the escape of a violent offender. On any view the police were
acting under the pressure caused by the defendant, and so were not
exercising the unfettered volition presupposed by the novus actus rule.
        § 16.12.     CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF VICTIM

The principle is that the victim's contributory negligence is no answer to a
charge of crime.1 In other words, it is generally no defence that the victim
laid himself open to the act, or was himself guilty of negligence bringing it
about.
   This rule can have strange results. Suppose there are two burglars
engaged together in blowing a safe in a grossly negligent way. If one is
killed the other is presumably guilty of manslaughter, even though the
victim participated throughout in the act of negligence. It can be argued
that there should be a defence of negligent joint enterprise, but the courts
have not hitherto recognised it.

    Occasionally the contributory fault of the victim may be so great that the defendant's act
is held not to be the imputable cause of the harm. A n illustration is the "exhaustion of
daneer" principle, where the risk created by the defendant is at an end before the victim
c o m m i t s the careless act.

    In Waters (1834),2 the defendant W aters, being on b oard a ship, and V. who was in a boat
    alongside, disputed about paym ent for some goods, both being intoxicated. T here was
    a conflict of evidence as to what subsequently happened, but according to one witness
    Waters, to get rid of V, pushed away the boat with his foot; V. reaching out to lay hold
    of a barge, to prevent his boat from drifting away, overbalanced, fell into the water, and
    was drowned. Park J ruled that even if this evidence were accepted it was not a case of
    manslaughter.

   No reason was given for the ruling, but a reason can easily be framed. If V had fallen into
the water immediately upon his boat being pushed, it might perhaps have am ou nted to
manslaughter, supposing that W aters knew that V was unsteady on his feet and probably too
drunk to swim. But this is not what happen ed. V remained safe in his boat, and the only effect
of the pash was to cause him inconvenience, in having the boat drift from the place where he
w anted it to be. At that point the risk caused by Waters's act was exhausted.

(2) In v o lu n ta ry m a n s la u g h te r
   T h is is unlawful killing without intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm: R.
v. Taylor (1834) 2 Lew. 215 and see Stephen D ig.C r.L. 9th ed. p. 221. Apart from
the intent required the elements o f the offence are the same as in murder (see
§§ 2 0 -3 — 2 0-1 3, and §§ 2 0-15— 2 0 -2 7 , ante). T h e rules as to causation,0 time
limit o f a year and a day, self defence etc., therefore apply though it must be
remembered that provocation and dim inished responsibility only apply to murder
and so as to reduce that crime to manslaughter.

   T h e difficulty is to identify the elements which m ay make the killing unlawful:
see Andrews v. D .P .P . (1937) 26 C r.A pp.R . 34 per Lord Atkin. T h e law has gone
through a process o f developm ent. It was formerly held that there w as a doctrine
of constructive manslaughter w hereby death resulting from any unlawful act,
whether intrinsically likely to injure or not, was manslaughter, but this has long
ceased to be the law.
   T h e authorities on involuntary m anslaughter are difficult to reconcile, but the
following propositions appear to be established:
   (1) T he killing is m anslaughter i f it is either
    (a) T he result o f a grossly negligent (though it m ay be otherwise lawful) act or
          omission on the part o f the accused (see § 2 0 -4 9 , p o st) ; or
    ( b ) T he result o f his unlawful act (though not his unlawful om ission), where
          the unlawful act is one, such as an assault, which all sober and reasonable
          people would inevitably realise must subject the victim to the risk o f some
          harm resulting therefrom, albeit not serious harm, whether the accused
          realised this or not: Andrews v. D .P .P ., ante; R . v. Larkin (1944) 29

          plied the drug, he had not participated in the injecting o f it— the act of
          supplying the drug was not directed against the person o f the deceased and
          the supply did not cause any direct injury to him— conviction for man­
          slaughter quashed).
              In R. v. M itchell (1983) 76 C r.App.R . 293, C .A ., the Court certified the
          following point but refused leave: “ whether in order to constitute the
          offence o f m anslaughter the unlawful and dangerous act m ust first, be
          aimed at the person who died, or second, involve direct contact or impact
          upon the person w ho died.” T h e court upheld-a conviction for m a n s l a u g h ­
          ter where M becam e involved in an altercation with X , aged 72 (M having

         tried to force his way into a queue) and hit X who fell against an 89 year old
         woman. Her femur was broken and an operation was performed to replace
         her hip joint. She died subsequently, the cause of death being pulmonary
         embolism caused by thrombosis of the leg veins which in turn was caused
         by fracture of the femur. The court could see no reason of policy for holding
         that an act calculated to harm A could not be manslaughter if it in fact
         killed B. The fact that there was no physical contact between the defendant
         and the victim was immaterial. In D .P .P . v. N ew bury, ante, the House of
         Lords approved the following dictim in R. v. Larkin [1943] 1 All E.R. 217,
         219: “Where the act which a person is engaged in performing is unlawful,
         then if at the same time it is a dangerous act, that is, an act which is likely
         to injure another person, and quite inadvertently he causes the death of
         that other person by that act, then he is guilty of manslaughter.” It is
         unnecessary to prove that the accused knew that the act was unlawful or
         dangerous: D .P .P . v. N ew buiy. In judging whether the act was dangerous,
         the test is not did the accused recognise that it was dangerous, but would all
         sober and reasonable people recognise its danger: ibid. The practice of
         directing juries other than in accordance with the principles set out above
         should cease: ibid.6

 (2) R isk o f “h arm ” : meaning o f ‘‘harm ”
    “Harm” means physical harm. Accordingly, if, for example, robbers so frighten
 a person by their appearance and conduct that in consequence that person suffers
a heart attack from which he later dies, a proper direction to the jury would
involve telling them that the requisite harm was caused if the unlawful act so
shocked the victim as to cause him physical injury', see R . v. D aw son, N olan and
 Walmsley (1985) 81 Cr.App.R. 150, C.A.
   D alby, P ag ett and M itch ell were considered in R . v. Goodfellow (1986) 83
Cr.App.R. 23, C.A. It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that D a lb y was
authority for the proposition that in the case of “unlawful act” manslaughter the
action of the defendant must have been directed at the victim. This submission
was based on the following passage from Waller L.J.’sjudgment in D a lb y —(1982)
74 Cr.App.R. 348, 352—“where the charge of manslaughter is based on an unlaw­
ful and dangerous act, it must be an act directed at the victim and likely to cause
immediate injury, however slight.” Lord Lane C.J., delivering thejudgment of the
court in Goodfellow, having quoted this extract, continued: “However, we do not
think that he was suggesting there must be an intention on the part of the defend­
ant to harm or frighten or a realisation that his acts were likely to harm or frighten.
Indeed it would have been contrary to the dicta of Lord Salmon in D .P .P . v. N e w ­
bury [(1976) 62 Cr.App.R. 291] if he was. What he was, we believe, intending to
say was that there must be no fresh intervening cause between the act and the
death” (at p. 27). His Lordship referred to Pagett and M itch ell as supporting this
interpretation of D alby.
   (3) Mens tea is essential to manslaughter but it can consist of either (in (l)(a)
above) gross negligence or (in (l)(b) above) the mens rea appropriate to the unlaw­
ful act, or both; Andrews v. D .P .P ., ante; R . v. L am b , ante; R . v. L ow e, ante.
   (4) For the purpose of (l)(b) above, an act which is unlawful by the manner of
its execution, e.g. dangerous driving, is not an “unlawful act”; A ndrews v. D .P .P .,
ante.
   See further at § 20-51, post and the cases collected at § 20-55, post.
“G ross n e g lig e n c e ”
  (1)    It would have been satisfactory to have been able to say, as was suggested in
the 39th edition of this work, that “gross negligence” was equivalent to “reckless­
ness” as defined in § 17—24, ante. Certainly a direction to this effect could only be

  6 See R. v. Pagett (§ 20-5) w here a conviction o f m an sla u g h ter w as u ph eld ; the ap p e lla n t
had used a w o m an as a shield against police fire a n d she was killed.
  criticised on the ground that it was too favourable to the accused. The position
  however is not so simple, and it is necessary to refer to certain of the authorities.
      (2) The leading case is Andrews v. D.P.P. (1938) 26 Cr.App.R. 34, H.L., a case of
  “motor manslaughter.” Holding, as we have seen, that “dangerous driving” was
  not an “unlawful act” for the purpose of § 20-48 (1) (b), ante, Lord Atkin (in a
  speech concurred in by the rest of the Appellate Committee) said that in the pres­
  ent case it was only necessary to consider manslaughter from the point of view of
  an unintentional killing caused by negligence, that is, the omission of a duty to
  take care. He cited from the consideredjudgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal
  in R. v. Batemen (1925) 19 Cr.App.R. 8 the following passage:
     “In explaining tojuries the test which they should apply to determine whether
  the negligence, in the particular case, amounted or did not amount to a crime, the
 Judges have used many epithets, such as ‘culpable,’ ‘criminal,’ ‘gross,’ ‘wicked,’
  ‘clear,’ ‘complete.’ But, whatever epithet be used and whether an epithet be used
 or not, in order to establish criminal liability the facts must be such that, in the
 opinion of the jury, the negligence of the accused went beyond a mere matter of
 compensation between subjects and showed such disregard for the life and safety
 of others as to amount to a crime against the State and conduct deserving punish­
 ment.”
     Lord Atkin went on to say: “ . . . the expressions used are not, indeed they were
 probably not intended to be, a precise definition of the crime. I do not myself find
 the connotation of mens rea helpful in distinguishing between degrees of negligence,
 nor do the ideas of crime and punishment in themselves carry ajury much further
 in deciding whether in a particular case the degree of negligence shown is a crime
 and deserves punishment. But the substance of thejudgment is most valuable, and
 in my opinion is correct. In practice it has generally been adopted by judges in
 charging juries in all cases of manslaughter by negligence, whether in driving
 vehicles or otherwise. . . .
     Simple lack of care is not enough. For the purposes of the criminal law there are
 degrees of negligence, and a very high degree of negligence is required to be proved
 before the felony is established. Probably of all the epithets that can be applied,
 “recklessness” most nearly covers the case. It is difficult to visualise a case of death
 by dangerous driving caused by “reckless” driving in the connotation of that term
 in ordinary speech which would not justify a conviction for manslaughter. But it is
 probably not all embracing, for “reckless” suggests an indifference to risk, whereas
 the accused may have appreciated the risk and endeavoured to avoid it and yet
 shown such a high degree of negligence in the means adopted to avoid the risk as
 would justify a conviction.” The House of Lords has now decided that “failure to
 give any thought to the possibility of this being a risk” can amount to recklessness
 (see § 17-24, ante).
     It should be noted that in involuntary manslaughter by negligence there must
 be both a duty to take care and a high degree of negligence, which however need
 not necessarily amount to recklessness.
     (3) In'/?, v. Lamb (1967) 51 Cr.App.R. 417, C.A., a strong Court of Appeal in a
 consideredjudgment said, obiter (at p. 424) that “when the gravamen of a charge is
 criminal negligence—often referred to as recklessness—of an accused person, the
jury have to consider among other matters the state of his mind, and that includes
 the question ofw'hether he thought that what he was doing was safe. In the present
 case”—pulling the trigger of a partly-loaded revolver injest—“it would have been
 fully open to a jury, if properly directed, to find the accused guilty because they
 considered that his view of there being no danger was formed in a criminally negligent way,
 but he was entitled to a direction that the jury should take into account that fact
 that he had undisputely formed this view and that there was expert evidence of
 this being an understandable view.”
     (The court held that there was no evidence of manslaughter as the result of an
 unlawful act, because what the accused had done did not even amount to an
 assault in the absence of any hostile intent—see § 20-512,/>oj/.)
     (4) In /?. v. Lowe (1973) 57 Cr.App.R. 365, C.A., the Court of Appeal appear to
 have equated “recklessness” w'ith the high standard of negligence required, but
 this was obiter and the court were clearly intending to follow Andrews v. D.P.P., ante.
     (5) In R . v. Cato (1976) 62 Cr.App.R. 41, C.A., on the question of the degree of
negligence required, the trial judge had said that “recklessness” must be proved,
without defining that word. The Court of Appeal said (at p. 48) that definition was
unnecessary—“After all, recklessness is a perfectly simple English word. Its mean­
ing is well known and it is in common use.”
     (6) I n R . v . Dobinson (1977) Cr.App.R. 186, 192, 193, C.A. the Court of Appeal
said that it was not necessary for there to be an appreciation by the accused of the
risk of death or serious injury. They went on to say that there must be a “reckless
disregard of danger to the health and welfare of the infirm person. Mere inadver­
tence is not enough. The defendant must have been proved to have been indiffer­
ent to an obvious risk of injury to health, or actually to have foreseen the risk but to
have determined nevertheless to run it.”
     In view of the contrast in the above passage between “indifference” and “actual
foresight1’ it is difficult to understand what distinction is being drawn between
“inadvertence” and “indifference.” The passage, however, is consistent with the
opinions of the majority of the House of Lords in R . v. Caldwell and of all their
Lordships in R . v. Lawrence (§ 17-24, ante). In R . v. West London Coroner, ex p . Gray
a n d others [1987] 2 All E.R. 129, D.C., Watkins L.J. identified the ingredients of the

offence of unlawful killing by neglect.
   (7) Collisions at sea. If a charge of manslaughter following loss of life in a collision
at sea, is to succeed, it is essential that the crown should be able to prove clearly
and for certain every’ act whether of commission or omission by those against
whom that charge is brought and which is said not only to have caused death but
to have been of so grave a character that a conviction for manslaughter should fol­
low. In such cases comparable directions on the law to those appropriate in motor
manslaughter cases should be given. In Seymour (1983) 77 Cr.App.R. 215, H.L.,
the House of Lords held that the appropriate direction in motor manslaughter
cases is the same as has been suggested in Lawrence (1981) 73 Cr.App.R. 1 (see §
20-274). Thus the relevant questions are (i) Did the respective acts of navigation
create an obvious and serious risk of causing physical damage to some other ship
and thus to other persons who might have been travelling in the area of the colli­
sion at the material time? If so, did any of the defendants by their respective acts of
navigation so navigate either without having given any thought to the possibility
of that risk or, while recognising that the risk existed, take that risk: Kong Cheuk
Kw an v. R . (1986) 82 Cr.App.R. 18, P.C.

   (8) Manslaughter charge as an alternative to causing death by reckless driving. The offence
of causing death by reckless driving of a motor vehicle on a road is still manslaugh­
ter by the law of England even though it is also a statutory offence and has been
since 1956: Government o f U .S .A . v. Jennings (1982) 75 Cr.App.R. 367, H.L., (an
extradition case). The evidence to prove either offence is therefore the same.
   In R. v. Seymour (1983) 77 Cr.App.R. 215, H.L., it was held that where man­
slaughter was charged and the circumstances were that the victim was killed as the
result of the reckless driving of the defendant on a public highway, thejury should
be directed as suggested in R . v. Lawrence (see § 20-274, p o st), but it would be
appropriate to point out that in order to constitute the offence of manslaughter the
risk of death being caused by the manner of the defendant’s driving must be very
high. Lord Roskill, with whose speech all but one of the remainder of their Lord­
ships agreed, said that there could be nojustification for joining both manslaugh­
ter and the statutory offence in the same indictment and that if it were done the
prosecution should be made to elect upon which count they wished to proceed.
The suggestion that a prerequisite for a manslaughter charge is that “the risk of
death must be very high” is quite inconsistent with Lawrence and is obiter.

D uty o f care
   This belongs more to the fields of contract and tort than to this work. In prac­
tice, however, the question of whether the accused was under a duty of care
usuallv only arises in manslaughter cases where it is alleged that the accused had
 undertaken the care of a child or infirm person or the like. In other cases, such as
the medical practitioner or driver of a car or an engine, the duty is obvious.
   In R. v. Slone, R. v. Dobinson {ante), Stone and Dobinson were living together,
Dobinson being Stone’s mistress. Stone’s sister, Fanny, the deceased, lodged in
their house and they had taken some care of her. It was argued for the appellants
that they had no duty of care to the deceased. Rejecting this, the Court of Appeal
(at p. 191) said:
   “Whether Fanny was a lodger or not she was a blood relation of. . . Stone; she
was occupying a room in his house; Mrs. Dobinson had undertaken the duty of
trying to wash her, of taking such food to her as she required. There was ample
evidence that each accused was aware of the poor condition she was in. . . . This
was not a situation analogous to the drowning stranger. They did make efforts to
care. They tried to get a doctor; they tried to discover the previous doctor. Mrs.
Dobinson helped with the washing and the provision of food. . . . The jury were
entitled to find that the duty had been assumed. They were entitled to conclude
that once Fanny became helplessly infirm. . . . the appellants were, in the circum­
stances, obliged either to summon help or else to care for Fanny themselves,”
   For further examples see the earlier cases collected at §§ 20-59 etseq., post.
“Unlawful Act”
   (1) See ante § 20-48. Reasonable correction of a child by a person in loco parentis
is not unlawful—see § 20-25, ante. For observations as to the proper direction
when such an issue arises see R. v. Mackie (1973) 57 Cr.App.R, 353 and post,
§ 20-58. As to injuries caused in lawful games and contests, seepost, § 20-56.
   In R. v. Lamb, § 20-49 (3), ante, when the accused had pulled the trigger of the
revolver in jest, the Court of Appeal pointed out that this was not an unlawful act
and therefore the prosecution could only have established manslaughter by prov­
ing gross negligence.
   (2) In R. v. Cato, § 20-49 (5), ante, the Court of Appeal held that injecting
another person with heroin which the defendant had unlawfully taken into his pos­
session for that purpose, (he had exchanged syringes with the other person), is an
unlawful act, and if death results the offence is manslaughter, notwithstanding
that the victim consented to the injection and provided the syringe and the heroin.
However, cf. R. v. Dalby, ante, § 20-48, (a person who supplies the drug which is
injected by the deceased himself is not guilty of manslaughter).
   (3) An act calculated to harm A is manslaughter if it kills B and it is immaterial
that there was no physical contact between the assailant and B, see R. v. Mitchell,
ante § 20-48 and R. v. Pagett ante § 20-5.
   (4) As to death resulting from an unlawful act done with intent to procure mis­
carriage, see § 20-20, ante. .
2. COUNSELLING, ATTEMPTS AND CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT
    MANSLAUGHTER
   (1) Counselling, (see also post, §§ 29—19—29—28). A person can be indicted for
and convicted of accessory before the fact to involuntary manslaughter, but semble
not in the case of voluntary manslaughter (see ante, § 20-47): R. v. Creamer (1966)
49 Cr.App.R. 368, C.C.A., (obiter on this point but following old authority).      '
   At page 378 the Court said: “A man is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when
he intends an unlawful act and one likely to do harm to the person and death
results which was neither foreseen nor intended. It is the accident of death which
makes him guilty of manslaughter as opposed to some lesser offence such as
assault or, in the present case, abortion. This can no doubt be said to be illogical,
since the culpability is the same, but nevertheless it is an illogicality which runs
throughout the whole of our law, both the common law and the statute law. . . .
Bearing that in mind, it is quite consistent that a man who has counselled and pro­
cured such an illegal and dangerous act from which death, unintended, results
should be guilty of being acce°sory before the fact to manslaughter.”            :
   The Court’s dictum that a person cannot be indicted as an accessory before the
fact to voluntary manslaughter was based on the old authorities referred to in the

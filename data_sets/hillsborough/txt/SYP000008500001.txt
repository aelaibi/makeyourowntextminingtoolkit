            Supporters,                 I cannot         say what       club     they were              supporting        as     they were

            all       dressed           in    red   colours.           I noticed           that        th e      majority were         drinking

            from       cans       and        bottles      at    this    t ime    they were              well        behaved jm d       in h i g h

                I am Michael          Buxton,           a Police C o n s t a b l e         of 25 years       service         and    I am

                s ta ti o n e d at Bradfi e 1 d in F1 Division.                            In the     course     of my work             I

               drive       the D iv i s i o n a l       Lan d Rover         each w o r k i n g    day.      The L a n d Rover               is

               ground       control         to    take     the Land Rover               to L e p pings Lane       to as s i s t w ith

                crowd      control.           I informed Mr.               C h a p m a n of this and drove           to L e p p i n g s

               Lane     there was a mass                 of supporters.                T h e y were    simply     pouring          down

               L e p p i ng s Lane         towa r d s    the ground.              At    the    turnstiles      there    seemed to

            very     concerned.           I a p pe al ed to the           crowd to ease the s i t u a t i o n over

            the FA this had              no effect-           I told the supporters                  that    people at          the

            front were being              crushed and that              these w ere w omen and               children,

            their      own people         that       they were       crushing.             It made    no difference.               I

            repeated my m e ss ag es                several    times     to     no effect.

            I then       called m a t c h        control      on my     personal           radio and a s k e d      for the

            kick     off to be d el a y e d            in order      to offer         the    crowd s o m e t h i n g    to stop

            the    crushing        but    I was        informed      it was      too       late.

            I then became w o r r i e d and                 I realised         people were going             to get harmed


t           and    injured

                               on the PA but he
                                                               not done.

                                                             could not hear me
                                                                                     So    1 called the M o u n t e d

                                                                                             because     of the        noise

            from the          crowd but after a minute                  or     two    1 mana g e d to a t t r a c t       his

            a t t en ti on and       1 g es t i c u l a t e d to him to form the M o u n t e d Police

            Of f i c e r s    into a line across              the a rea        parallel       with the       t u r n s t i l e s and

            this     he m an a g e d     to do          however      this      had    little effect,          the      crowd was

            har d l y a f f e c t e d w i th some           simply going         under       the horses'        bellies.

            The attitude           of the        supporters         struck      me as d i fferent           because whilst

            there were           several       adults with y o u n g s t e r s            not taking any        part      in the



t
            matter      but s t a n d i n g      to one      side of the mai n stream of s u p p o r t e r s

            pouring          down L ep p i n g s Lane        the    bulk of suppo r t e r s a p p e a r e d         to be

            g r ip p e d by an u rg e n c y to get             into the         g r o u n d and get      in now and           if

            someone was hurt,                 so w h a t , it seemed as              though s o m ething more

            important          than a football              m atch was       taking        place behind the

            turnstiles.            They a p p e a r e d      fanatical         to g ain entrance.

            It was      obvious         that     the    greater      part had,            as so often       is the      case,

            been drinking an d                had    left    it too     late and on arrival                 seeing      the

            large      crowd still            w a it in g   to get    in the ground had               r e a l i s e d they

            w ou ld miss         part    of    the g a m e , a l t h o u g h    I d i d n ’t think       so at      the    time        I

            now think          the fans were            storming      the      turnstiles.

            Just    when my        conc e r n was at          its    peak,      just as       I was at my wits             end
                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                   R409

w o n d e r i n g what          I could do next the              crowd seemed to dis a p p e a r                 so fast

that              initially     I could       not be 1 ieve      it and         I realised that a large

concertina                 type gate had been opened:                     I was      immensely      r e l ieved and

very g r a t e f u l .

Seeing              that    I was     no   longer     required        I began to drive dow n towards

the          rear of the S o u t h stand w h e n              I reached a gate at the                   rear      of the

P o l i c e M atch Control                 point     I heard a radio message                 " E v e r y b o d y on the

track,             e v e r yb od y on the track".             I stopped the Land R over an d gained

e n t r y to            the gr o u n d a n d ran onto         the     football        pitch.

Initially what                  I thought       I was     seeing was            just a pitch        invasion.

T here were no players                       on the    pitch and fans were                climbing       over      the

fencing at the L ep p i n g s Lane                     end.      I was         not overly      concerned          because

I knew that                  w e're    quite easily          capable       of dealing wit h a pitch

invasion.                  I w a l k e d towards      the g o a l m o u t h area at the L e p p i n g s

Lane.              As    I did so      I saw that a L i v e r p o o l           supporter      had got          to the

Notts,             end of the         gr o u n d and was a g i t a t i n g       the Notts,       fans     by his

a cti o n s          in the     g o a l mo ut h at    that    end.        As      I walked across          to the

L e p ping s Lane             end goalmouth,           I turned and               saw that he had been

a r r e s t e d a r o u nd the mi d d l e            of the     pitch.          As   I neared to the;

goalmouth                I saw P o l i c e    officers       help i n g    fans over        the   fenc i n g an d        I

b egan to realise                   it was more than a pitch                    invasion.         I then saw a

gate              in the    fence and        fans    lying t r a p p e d on top of             one a n o t h e r    in the

gateway.                 I looked      behind       the fencing an d              saw that the        fans were all

crushed together.                      I saw a young fan amon g s t                  them and      r e a lised he was

I went              to the o pen gate and tried                 to    pull a y o u t h out         of the entrance

but he said that                    his    foot was      trapped.          W i t h other     officers           I then

t ried to pull a y o u n g                   female out       but     she was        trapped by fans             behind

her and she began                     s c r eaming and the           other      officers     stopped       pulling.

1 said              'she's got        to   come out,      come on         pull,'       We e v e n t u a l l y    pulled

her free and then               pulled out a y ou t h who                had been trap p e d under                her

but    to one     side,       a fter w hi c h       I was able          to pull     the y o u t h who was at

the    bottom     back     towards          the    fence a n d     I was able         to free         his     foot

w h i c h had been t ra pp ed between a metal                          post which       s u p ports        the

fencing and a           concrete          step.

1 was    o bliged to          recover        by resting agai n s t           the St.          J o h n ’s

ambulance.          I saw Chief Superintendent, Nesbit                           standing           on the

ad v e rt is em en t    hoa r d i n g s     and holding          onto    the fencing           trying       to get

some o rg a n i s a t i o n    but the noise was                 too much.         I ran to the Lan d Rover

an d a hand held           loud hailer an d gave                  it to Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit

who was       still     in the same           p o s ition still          trying     to get          things

organised.         He t hen        i nstructed Pol i c e           O f f icers    to form a tunnel                 down

w hi c h we    passed bodies              of the fans whi l s t           some alive,            a lot of them

were    obv i o u s l y dead.          We    passed     back      body after        body until             eventually

we    cleared the area.

I then a s s is te d       in taking          dead bodies          on a d v e r t i s i n g    hoardings         to the

opposite       end of the          pitch      clearing       the area and from there                       into the

My next       r ec ol le ct io n     is that        I drove       the L and Rover             onto P e n i s t o n e

Road and       parking        on the        central     r e s er va ti on and       p erforming            traffic

duty d i recting a m b u l an ce s            down H e r r i e s R oad and turn i n g                right       into       ^

Peni stone R o a d a n d then               into the ground.

Eventually        1 went       to the g y mn as iu m         looking        for S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Chapman.        W hen    I a r ri ve d at the gym an d                  1 saw all       the      bodies         laid on

the floor        I couldn't          believe        there was          so many,     row upon          row of them.

E ve nt ua ll y D e t e c t i v e Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Addis           began        issuing

instructions           r e g arding       p rocedures an d finding               I was        not    required,          1

went    into the N o r t h S t a n d          looking      for S u p e r i n t e n d e n t     Chapman.          He was

there w ith other             s up e r v i s o r   o f f icers    so    I sat    in the        stand.       I

          After         being       stood down by Mr C h a p m a n            I returned to the               g y m n a s i u m to

          see      if    I could assist,              but    it seemed ail          organised.          1 did a driving

          job a l l o c a te d to me by Chief                    Inspector        ESeal then       resumed to my beat.

          W he n    I a rr iv ed at, L e p pings Lane                 initially,          I was able         to travel

          freely up to the                   crowd because          there were        very few fans w a l k i n g              up

          L ep p i n g s Lane             they were all         coming     down.      The      crowd was       of three         to

          four      t h o usand strong-

          The moo d of the                  fans was a grim d e t e r m i n a t i o n         to get      in the g r o u n d ,

          no one was            laughing         or joking,         just    the    determination             to get      in,

          1 have         no    r ec ol le ct io n of any acti o n s            by any stewards.

          Radio         c om mu n i c a t i o n s were      not good so m uch so that                 on previous

          o ccasions           the        radio set    up    in the L a n d Rover            is such that          it    can be

          utilised as a radio                    room and. has         been on previous              occ a s i o n s    by

          pressing            the    correct       buttons.         It receives           and tra n s m i t s m e s s a g e s       via

          match         control.           At   one stage        I thought        that      I would     be    required for

          t his.

          My normal            f u nc ti on on m at ch days            is that      of driver         w i t h the Land

          Rover         of the Chief S up er i n t e n d e n t           arid always         in p o s ition      in L e p p i n g s

          Lane.          This       is a duty       I have       been p e r f o r m i n g    for y e a r s .

          I remember            that w h e n       I was at L e p pi ng s Lane a n d a fter                  using      the P.A.

          and having arid harv-irTtg~ no success,                        I was     joined by an           Inspector who

          climbed onto               the     roof of the L a n d Rover             and used the P.A,               with      the

          same      result.

anywhere         quickly      in the area.             On our arival            at     the s e c t i o n we

ascertained            that   there a pp e a r e d      to be a serious                situation developing

at   the ground and we                d e c i d e d to a t t e n d at     that        location.         It was

virtually         impossible          to make any head w a y            down Halifax R o a d              to the

road somewhere along H a l i f a x Road,

On our arrival at                the    ground via the m a i n Police access                         on Periistone

Road     it was       immediat 3.ey obvious               that a serious              s i tuation had d e v e l o p e d

in that        there were a number                  of a m b u l a n c e s    positioned at the             rear      of

the M o r t h Stand ana             large       numbers       of a m b u l a n c e    personnel        and Police

off i c e r e s     running a r o u n d       here,       there and everywhere.

On ap p r o a c h i n g    the    rear     of      the N orth S t a n d and           the entrance          to the

gymnasium           in company w i t h          supporters,           some     injured,       some     obviously

dead,      being      carried       from the         side of the N o r t h            stand from          the

d i r e c t i o n of the       pitch and           into   the    gymnasium.

I asked        some     officer        what was        happening        im&^'got          no reply and began to

assist      on officer w i t h an               injured       pe/ion         into    the gymnasium.

I went      into the g y m n a s i u m and             remember my first                  reaction was          one of

dis b e l i e f as there must              have      been about 30 or so bodies                      laid out         in

rows     on the floor.             Officers          were     stood by the            bodies all          obviously

dead as        they were         covered        in sheets,         blankets,          coats     etc,

Detective           Inspector S c a i f e          then   cajxTed me         over and        I joined him and DC

bodies      they could a c c o m m o d a t e           at short        notice*

Detective           Inspector      Sc a i f e      decided      that    this w o u l d take          some       time and

due    to the s i t u a t i o n at         the      ground and         in the        gym n a s i u m at    that     time

it w o u l d       be more    b eneficial           to go elsewhere.                 We   therefore        left     the

ground and a t t e n d e d          back at Foxriili             sect i o n     s t a t i o n using       the

p r e v i o u s l y a b a n d o n e d Po l i c e    vehicle as         by this        time officers             had made

one    side        of Halifax       dual      carriageway          clear.

At Foxhill           section s t a t i o n mortu a r i e s            were     contacted        in the a r e a and

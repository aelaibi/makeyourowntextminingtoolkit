     The perimeter fencing covers 3 sides of the ground.         The fencing
     immediately in front of the Main Stand Enclosure was removed 2 years ago
     following the conversion of this area to an all-seated family enclosure.

     Included in the Main Stand seating are the 300 and 500 Executive Clubs
     which are separate enclosures with Executive Dining and entertaining
     facilities.

     We would be delighted to again have an opportunity of staging a semi
     final.

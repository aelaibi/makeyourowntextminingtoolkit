           I am a single man and live at the above address with my parents

           although I travel extensively throughout Britain,                                   Ireland and Europe

           and am "seldom at home.

           On S a t u r d a y l 5 t h April          1989 <150489)            I attended the FA Cup Semi Final

           at Hillsborough Football Ground played between Liverpool FC and

           Nottingham Forest FC.
                                                                  \ OVT" \
                                                     I am a Liverpool s u p p b ^ e r having followed them

           for 25 years and have travelled all over the worla. with them.                                           I have

           been to Hi 1 IsbortKugh about 12 times and was at the /o rr es pon din g match
           O YT    O S S
           last year at that ground.     I generally prefer to sit in the stands

           rather than the terracing and was in the West Stand last year but this

           year my season ticket only qualified for a terracing ticket.                                            I bought

           my ticket from Anfield,                     paying £6 for it and it was for the Leppings

           Ln standing area.

               I travelled to the match with a group of 13 frienchk split between

                three c a r \ ione of which was mine.    In my vehicle werX,       a

                        , I don't know their address and they also had tickets for

               the North Stand.       Of the three cars I was the only one who had a

               terracing ticket.

               We left Liverpool      between 10.30 am {1030) and 10.45 am (1045) and we

               drove to a pub on the Snakes Pass overlooking X a d y b o w e r Dam to regroup j

^    q    £    and to Jiave a drink and something to eat.
                                                                    \
                                                                We arrived there at about

/TbCQtt?l_ midday (1200).            I wasn't delayed too much in traffic as I know the

               roads very well a<jd^was able to bypass any trouble spots.

               We stayed at the pub until about 1.30 pm (1330) and as one of the cars                j

               hadn't turned up we left and drove on to the ground and I parked the

               car at about 2.20 pm <1420) having been delayed in traffic and finding .

               somewhere to park.        I parked the car near to a Tile Centre and then we

               walked down to the ground.

               Whilst walking to the ground I did not see any police direction and

               received no escort from them.

               The crowds were well behaved and I saw n^et'i^sorder, drunkeness or

               violence whilst walking^to the ground.        I got to the entrance to the

               ground at about 2.35 pm (1435).

L- u           About 250 yards from the ground on Leppings Ln there are a set of

               lights.      I stood there for a while waiting for some of our friends

               from the other cariNand whilst standing there we were approached by

               three or four pol i~b^ O f f icers on horseback and some on f o o t .   The

               mounted officers ar^edh us to move down to the ground and I heard two
    A-T                                                     ---

    L L .      foot officers do the same thing.

               By the time I reached the ground I was effectively on my own as all

               the others had stand tickets and they'd gone on ahead.
                                                                                          PAGE            3
                                                                                          S1777

          On my arrival at the ground ther were no queues,               it was just a mass of

          people all       pushing and shoving.    The police officers on horseback were

          going around in the crowd in an obvious effort to restore order but in

          my opinion they were only exa^e^bating               it by disrupting any orderly

CArT      queues that were forming. , People were being funnelled through the

M 'VlN    outer wrought iron gates by vtje officers on horseback.
srree-^
CfA^SOp   I could see people by the ground being pulled up onto the walls and

          climbing       into the ground.   I decided that I d i d n ’t want to get

          involved in the crush,       trying to get to the terracing turnstiles,                  so I

          decided to go to the West Stand turnstiles.

          I knew which were the Stand turnstiles and I presumed the ones on the

          right were for the terracing although the re were no cl ear signs.

          I saw women by this time being pulled up out of the crowd by the

          terracing turnstiles and also kids.             This was strange to me as its

          usually young lads       who try and bunk into grounds.         As I got closer to

          my turnstile I saw       how crowded    it was in there and      people were being

          crushed up against the walls.

          I had no real problems getting to the W e s t sStand turnstiles.               On

          getting into the turnstile I showed myN^i cket and the steward told me

          I was in the wrong       place and I had to go round.         I tb^d him I didn't

          want to get into that cru'&h and he said "Fair enough," and let me i n .

          As I entered the ground it waVs2.50 pm ( 1 4 5 0 / .

          Outside the turnstiles where the crush was I only saw mounted officers

          and no foot officers or stewards.             Near to the turnstiles where I went

          in there were two stewards by Gate            'A*.

          On getting into the ground I initially intended going left and

          standing in Pen 7, the raised area in the corner,              but I saw two

          f r ien ds ,                      , he lives near to the           _________        ln

                         I know the house but not the exact address and

                         I d o n ’t know his address.     They were heading towards the

              toilets by the tunnel.           As I wanted to go to the toilet I followed

              them and went in.        I don't know whether they went in or not but I

              d i d n ’t see them in there.       On leaving the toilet I thought these lads

              were still just in front of me.            I followed them down the tunnel where

              I thought t h e y ’d gone.       My intention was to ask them to come and stand

 Ca t         round the side with me as the view would be better and waited to stand

              I dicN^not see any police officers or stewards directing people at or
■S17WD
              in the tumnel although there were a number of officers and stewards

              inside the ground near to the turnstiles.

              On getting to the bottom of the tunnel           I saw that the crowd was

              already backed up to the exit from the tunnel.              I got in the crowd

              about two or three foot and was looking round for                  anc           |aut

              the crowd was so packed you couldn’t move forward.             When I just

              walked down the tunnel my passage was quite free.

              When I couldn’t see the lads I turned round to come back out by now

              the tunnel was full and I could only go back a couple of foot.

              Suddenly I couldn ’t move at all and my back was to t h i K ^ t c h .

5-o.£         As I ’dKcome out of the tunnel          I ’d gone slightly left and into Pen 4.

At            B y now it «*as 2.35 pm (1455),         the teams were on the pitch by now.      I

              could see        now people to my right being pulled up into the stand

              aboveix Then there was a sudden surge           that came from the tunnel and I

              was pushed backwards and to the left of the goals,            there was one big

              face the side fence.            Suddenly I fell over on my back so I was     looking
     fizf\
              up at the barrier abo>e me.            There were a number of other people on

              the 4^1 oor about me.       I was\trampled on a little bit and somebody

              m a n a g e d X ^ pull me up.

              I was by then between the barrier and the front fence.              I managed to

             pull some other people up on their feet.                    I ended up with my back to

             the side fence and the barrier to my right.                    There was a lot of

             screaming and shouting.                    I managed to remain quite calm and composed

             somehow.       It was still           crowded but I was able to move slightly and

             b r e a t h e ^ N ^ h e r e were people climbing out over the fences out of the

C/¥T         pets.    There were people trying to climb out over the front fence onto

             the pitch.

             I   realised I had to get out although I d i d n ’t feel any pain.              Suddenly

             there was art easing of pressure.                   I saw people kicking the front fence

             and f or c i n g ^ h o l e ^ n       it.    The flow of the crowd took me out through

             it and onto the pitch.

             I helped other people out onto the pitch.                    There were people all    round

             the net.      I saw a steward start to pull the net down so I went to help

 ^           him.     The next thing I remember was an ambulance coming onto the

             pitch.     A policeman asked me to make way for the ambulance and I

             walked over to the touchline by the North Stand.                    I saw people laying

             a wall and we sat down,

                                    joined us then and the other people who knew us from

             the North Stand came out and joined us.

             A policeman asked us to move on out of the way and I got off the pitch

             by the corner f>as onto the terracing and stood there for a while. , I

             saw more and more pechole being brought out and people were obviously

             dead but I d i d n ’t think many had died.               People were being given

             resusitation but I olNin’t know who had died and who was injured.

T M S ON

            At no time did I witness anything I consider to be a crl>i<inal offence.

            My own opinion of how the incident was handled are tjTat the senior

            officer in charge of crowd control was at fault>\n that he obviously

ADvaast     didn't use the information from the closed circuit television.         They

            were obviously thinking    it was a crowd trouble problem not a crowd

            safety thing.    Once people realised there was a problem they reacted

            well,    they helped everyone did what was needed.   I think initially

            they were caught by surprise.     The police officers were misdirected

            but the officers behind the goal worked well as individuals.      I

            c ould n’t understand why the officers who were sent to guard the North

            Stand touchline could stand there and allow people literally yards

            behind to die when they could have used their first aid skills to save

            lives,    it was as if they were like automatons and the people dying

            were beyond their responsibilities.

            I don't think this could happen at Anfield or Goodison as there you

            have the same farvs but they are better controlled both inside and

            outside and also thffvground design is better as you cannot keep

            filling a small area w\th people who are penned in all round.

            The F.A. are also partly responsible as they were advised that

              1 lsborough should not be used for this match because of the problems

            last year in the terracing and if you have to use that ground why not

            reapportion where the crowds are kept in that Liverpool should have

            the larger end having the ^sarger following.

         pulling them up out of it.            ived at the ground at about the same

         time and there was a cordo            ficers around the ground checking

         tickets and the queues wer          rly and there was no mass of people,

         We were stopped from pulling people out by a police officer who I told

         that   people were being crushed.     He told me if I didn't shut up h e ’d

         throw me out.

         I ’d also   like to stress that if the end is not good enough for

         Liverpool   then i t ’s not good enough for Nottingham Forest or any other

         suppo rte rs.

         I also would like to mention that I find it strange that four years on

         from the Popplewell Enquiry which stressed the need for good radio

         communication the system failed on the day.       I find that hard to

         believe it ;must have happened in the past.

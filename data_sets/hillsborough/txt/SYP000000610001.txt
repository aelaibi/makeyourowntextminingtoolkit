At    this       point,             some        people          asked        the d r i v e r        if    they       could          alight           the

wriggle          free       and        drop       down       on    to       the       s a f e t y SSQsgs t h e         g r o u n d.

 he    was    giving             orders          via       radio       and       pointing           directions.                          I was

 too    frightened                to     go      back       and       help,       then        an    announcement                         came          over

 the    tannoy          asking           everyone            to       leave       in a n       orderly                fashion.                 We

waited        until          a    lot       of       people       had       left       in     case          we    got       squashed                   on

 the    way       out,       even         if     there       were          three       or     four          people          near          me       I

 c o u l d n ’t    stand          it.          It     made       me    feel       creepy           and       shivery!                    As    we

walked        back          to    our       coach,          the       streets          were        almost             silent.                 Even

 though       there          were        thousands               of    people,           the       only          real       sound             were

 people       crying             and     then         the    screach             and     wail       of       amublance                   sirens

 flying       passed.                 Our      thoughts           concentrated                 on       telephoning                      home          but

 the    queues          for       a     phone         were       tremendous.                  We    kept          walking                like

            assured          me       she       would        keep        trying         until       she    got       through,            she      wa:

a    woman        of    her       word.              At    5.15        pm    (1715)          she    got    through           saying          "We

were        all    w e 11".            The       family           back       home       were       devastated              until       the       news

reached           them       we       were       all       O K.        Then       they       all    had    a    good        cry,       but       were

not     as    relieved                as    they          might        have       been       because       of       the i r c o n c e r n         for

everyone           else       at       the       ground.

We     found       our       c o a c h , on           boarding              it    everyone          was    silent.               After       a

while        the       driver          who       did       not      attend         the       match    broke          the     silence             by

saying        the       seven          people             had     not       returned          and    asked          t he

passengers, "Should                             we    wait        or     1eave" almost               in    unison           everyone

said,        "Wait".              A    further             half        hour       past       with    only       two        seats       to

fill,        again       the          driver          asked         shall         we    leave?       the       reply        was    "Yes".

As     1 was       sitting             near          the     front          of    the       coach,    I    could           hear    the

driver        talking             to       an    am:ious            boy      who       had    been    waiting              for    h is

friend        to       return.              The       driver           was       saying       he    suspected              something

was     seriously             wrong             at    the       start        of    the       match    as       he    saw     coaches

and     van       loads       of       Police             be i ng      drafted          to    the    g round         at     speed.

This        was    still          happening                as     we     left      Sheffield,             Police           arriving          to

the     scene,          in    our          minds          they      were         too    bloody       late       and        should        they

have        been       there          e a r 1 i-«r :-

( 1)    You       rnig'FHx s a y           this       catastrophe                 may       never    have       h a p p e n ed     if       the

Police        were       better             organised.




(2)     If    they       were          better             organised              and    already       been          at     the    scene

it     still       wmH^have                     happened            because            of    the    way    the       Police        acted,

or     should          I say          did       not       act.

In     my    opinion,             a    combijQation                 of      factors          contributed             to     this

             tunnel,       directly             behind          the     goal,          that       it    was    impossible             to    fan­

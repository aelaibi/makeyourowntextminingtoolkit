             DHG.       F rom t h e r e           we w e r e     transported               to S h e f f i e l d       for     d u t y at    the

             briefed        by s e n i o r         officers.

             At     1 1 . 1 5 a.m.       in       company with Police                     Constable            1 43S W r i g h t , I t o o k          up

             metal      barriers          across          Vere         R o a d at    the       junction          to    prevent        persons

             other      than       residents             entering          i n to V e r e        Road.         This        junction was a

             busy      junction         having           a n off        licence          on    one    corner and a               f i s h arid chip

             shop      o n the       other         c o rn e r.         Both were          open       unt il      around        kick    off

             t ime.        Both      shops         were       k ep t    very      b u sy,      having         queues        onto     the

             pavement         at     t im e s .         The    shops are            situated          at      the N o t t s     Forest         end    of

             Vere      Road and         the        people        using      the      shops        appeared            to    be N o t t s   Forest

             supporters.              Customers               coming       ou t     of    the     off      licence were              carrying 4

             ca n    packs      of    beer         or    lager,         bottles          of w i n e      or    cider-         Knowing          they

             could      not     take      the       drink        into      the      ground,          they      drank       theljr d r i n k ®        in
the    vicinity,              sitting          on w a l l s ,     on     the    ground,          and    on    the    central

reservation             in P e n i s t o n e         Roa d .      There        were    two       occasions          when      they had

to    be    spoken         to.        Once      when Police              Constable        Wright          spoke      to      some

youth*       who were              standing          outside        the      of f   licence        chanting          and

shouting.              They        moved       on.

The    second          time was           when Police             Constable           Wright       h ad      to   go a c r o s s

Penistone          Road        to     speak       to      some you th s         who    were       throwing          beer      cans,

some       of w h i c h       contained            beer,       onto      the    roof     of a n e a r b y         building.

They moved             on a f t e r       being          spoken     to.        Supporters          started          to a p p r o a c h

us    in P e n i s t o n e         R o ad ,    having        come      from     the    direction             of S o u t h S t a n d

and Spion Kop                 entrance.              They were           in t w o ’s a n d        t h r e e ’s.      They      showed

us    tickets          f or    the N o r t h and West                  Stands        a n d we     directed          them along

Penistone          Road where                 they       could    gain access            to L e p p i n g s       L a ne .     Some

of    these       sup p o r t e r s , mainly                adults       with       children,          middle       aged      p eople,

some women,             asked          if t h e y        could    go a l o n g V e r e       Road       to L e p p i n g s     Lane.

We    allowed          a few         of    these         through       the     barriers          but    the       greater

majority          we    directed              along Penistone                Road.       After         a while,        I am        not

sure       what    time,           supporters             came    along        Vere    Road       from Leppings               Lane,

not    in a n y        great         numbers,            showing       us    tickets        for N o r t h a n d W e s t

Stands.           Some        we     directed along               Penistone           R o ad ,    but     others,         realising

they       had    c o me      from North and West                      Stand        entrances,          returned along

Vere       Road    to L e p p i n g s          L a ne .      Some      time     before       k i ck     off,      maybe       ten    or

fifteen minutes,                     I am      not       sure,    a Police           Inspector          instructed            us    to

let    no one          enter        Vere       R o ad ,     except       residents.              Supporters          were      still

approaching             along         Vere       R oa d ,    from Leppings             Lane.           The    off     licence

West       Stand,       making            their      way     to L e p p i n g s      Lane    shortly after                kick

off.        Police Con stable                    Wright,         who     had    brought          his    radio       from

               messages           over     the       radio.           Supporters           were      then       coming        from     the

               ground,        shouting           abuse          at    us as       they     passed.           None made           any      physical

               move     towards           us.        Emergency           vehicles          arrived,          we    did what          we     could        to

               assist       their         passage.

               We    r e m a i n e d at       our     posts          in P e n i s t o n e R o a d        because        of    the a t m o s p h e r e

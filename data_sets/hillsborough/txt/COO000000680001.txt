HEYSEL JUDGMENT


As you know judgement was passed today on 24 Liverpool
supporters.                          10 were acquitted as the case against them was
not proven.                          The full text of the judgment is available on
Tuesday.


14 were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and given
three-year custodial sentences.                                          In each case half of the
        —   — . . I ' . «— ■*» . .                                                        ........ . ..   .........           ,,

sentence was suspended for five years (i.e.                                          if re-arrested
                                     "-■■■-T -' "-I * ■ ..... t   1""

within five years they would be obliged to serve that
remaining part of their sentence).                                          In addition they were
fined about £900, payable to the Belgian National Victims Fund
(this fund is not related to Heysel).                                          If they do not pay this
they are liable to an additional three-month sentence.                                                                                               All
but one of the convicted supporters forfeited their £2000
bail.       All face heavy civil damages (though it is not clear
how they will pay) as does an Inspector of the Belgian
gendarmerie and a Belgian football official who also received
                                                                                     ,—                           ............................. V.

suspended sentences.


None of the convicted supporters was today committed for
arrest and all have since returned to England.                                                            There is now a
15-day period during which either side can appeal against
today's judgment.                                          At the end of that time the public
prosecutor can issue the equivalent of a warrant "requesting"
their return to serve their sentences.                                          It is not clear
precisely how this mechanism wilT~work.                                          The prosecutor merely
said darkly that "if they refused it may be necessary to bring
them back".                          The prosecutor refused to say whether he would
seek the return and arrest of the convicted supporters.                                                                                               The
amount of time that they have already spent in prison (6-8
months) will no doubt weigh with him in reaching a decision.


Two cases were not dealt with today.                                          That of ______                                            who is
currently in jaiTTTere on other charges.                                          The question of his
extradition remains to be considered when he is released in
                                -   2   -




June.   The other is          against whom the Belgian
charges remain outstanding.    He was in jail here, on charges
of assault and burglary, when the Heysel trial began, though
he has since finished his sentence.


So far as reactions to the press go, the Home Secretary has
been keeping a low profile saying simply that the judgment has
been a matter for the Belgian court who considered all the
evidence.    As to what happens to the convicted supporters if
the prosecutor requests their return and they refuse, he has
been advised to say simply this is at present a speculative
question, that most (18 out of 24) went voluntarily to their
trial and that we hope that if necessary they would return.
If not this is something we must discuss further with the
Belgian authorities.                          '


This approach is probably right since we are now in the appeal
period and it would be risky to say anything which prejudiced
the final outcome either of the appeal or of the prosecutor's
decision whether to seek arrest.        One or two newspapers have
sought to cause mischief by asking our press office for a
reaction contrasting the Belgian authorities' actions on the
             case with ours on Heysel.      They have resolutely
refused to be drawn on this saying simply that the two are
completely separate issues and that we have fully met our
obligations on Heysel.


I have checked with the Home Office whether those convicted
could if necessary serve their sentence in the UK.          It depends
on the timing of the appeal but seems unlikely since the
Belgians are not due to ratify the Council of Europe
Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons until later
this year.                                              "

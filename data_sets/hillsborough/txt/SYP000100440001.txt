    Our serials were responsible to Chief Inspector Purdy.

    From 11.15 a.m. in position.

    Noted Travellers Rest - closed.

    The Gate public house - OPEN (side door to locals only).

    We were directing coaches down Claywheels Lane and during                         the   first few hours the

    crowds were steady.They were making their way to the ground and no trouble                                       was

    seen.

    There were a lot of people (maybe 20 in total) asking for ’The Sportsman’ which I

did not know where it was and          there was a gradual increase of people coming from

the ground side        asking if any pubs were open.          Some Liverpool        fans did get into

The Gate public house through the side doors (door men on duty).

All who enquired were told most public houses were closed for                       the day but those

who enquired     still made their way away from the direction of                    the ground and up

Penistone Road North.

The supporters'        train arrived at Wadsley Bridge at 1.50 p.m.             (some 15-20 minutes

earlier than expected).

About   800 - 1000       supporters who all made        their way under separate            escort down

Leppings Lane     to the ground.       This   crowd was orderly and I saw no incidents                   at

all.    Little singing - well behaved in general.

Traffic   was    now    building   up and     it was   noticed    a lot   of   the    spectators     were

carrying drink. The time now about 2.10 p.m. Some were drinking from 4 packs and

others from large bottles.

Pedestrian traffic now was fairly heavy and a lot were sat on the walls drinking

before making their way to the ground.

At 2.15   p.m.    approximately     instructions       received    via radios        to   close   Leppings

Lane to vehicular traffice - DONE.

Coaches   were    still     arriving   but    these    were    now parking     on     Halifax     Road   as

Claywheels Lane was full. Very few cars.               Pedestrian traffic now very heavy.

Obvious that some had no tickets as they were in a group asking for tickets.

The general behaviour I would describe as good. Some had been/were drinking, many

were not.     By this time all making towards the ground.              Could hear over the radio

of problems at Leppings Lane end and at a certain time, I believe after the match

had    started,   an   instruction      "ALL   AVAILABLE   OFFICERS   TO   THE   GROUND".   My     few

serials were soon gathered together and we made our way to Leppings Lane side of

the ground.

On arrival could see a large group of Police Officers and argument taking place

with    supporters.         I thought   this was a public     order situation and I formed a

cordon across the turnstiles to keep spectators away.                 The turnstiles were closed

but people were        arguing that they had tickets and were demanding entry.                These

were kept back and it was some minutes later when people were leaving the ground,

directing abuse        to    the Police,   that   I realised something else was        drastically

wrong.

I entered the ground itself behind the West Stand. A large number of people were

injured, some were obviously dead.             Others were in a state of shock.        People were

tending to the injured. After the initial shock, I remember giving first aid to a

youth who had obvious internal injuries.

I cannot remember if the radio was working at this time - but I do not recollect

hearing any transmissions.

Together with another officer I moved the injured youth, who was conscious,                         to

the sterile area behind the West and South Stand.                 I remember a doctor arriving
GRAHAM MILLETT                                 -   H   _
                                                                                           ElkO




and I said I wanted the injured prioritising.                This he did.     I noticed another

doctor certifying the dead.

Initially, the ambulances were slow. They would find it difficult getting through

traffic and pedestrians.

One would arrive and the injured near the turnstiles would get on - although they

were   not   the   more   urgent   cases.   This   was     eventually   overcome   and   with   more

ambulances now arriving all the injured were removed.

The dead were then removed and the officer dealing with the dead taken with it.

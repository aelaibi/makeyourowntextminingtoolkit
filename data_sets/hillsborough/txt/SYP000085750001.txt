    just walking              into the ambulances.                      This was              fruitless.                      I took             over

    this       role for a while.                      A doctor        then took            over          from me.                  We       carried

    people         into      the a m b ul a nc e s       on his orders.                    I was then a sk ed to take my

    crew and             check the         ground to see              if there were any more                                  casualties.

            '^None were         found.        At   that    time a radio mess ag e      instructed all       crews

              not     in the         sports   hall    to   return to their appliances,          as   the   ground

We were         g/ven the       location as Penis tone Rd but we w e r p                   not told the

nature        o r the    incident      only that     cutting      equipmjsrm, was          required.           We

a r ri v e d at the Penis tone Rd entrance                  to t h ^ g r o u n d    at    152S hours and

met a m ou n te d        policeman at the gates             to /th e    directors         entrance.        I

a sk ed    the    policeman what          had h a p p e n e d and where we were             required.           He

said that         he d i d n ’t know where we ^ e r e          to go and that all                he knew was

that      the    fans had been fighting.              We    drove      into   the ground,          parking

the engines         just       past the directors'          entrance at the              rear of the S outh

Stand.          We had no trouble          getting    to the ground           or a ct ua l ly entering,

there were         no traffic        problems.

We w a l k ed     into   the s t ad iu m via a path at            the              of the Police

pitch     I could see bodies              strewn all       over   the    giQ^rtma uth at the L e p p i n g s

Ln end of the ground.                  I a s s e ss e d the sitij^fxion quickly and decided

that we did not            need the       cutting    e q u i d n e n t , what we really w a n t e d was

cutting gear and told them to JSring                       r es u sc i ta t io n equipment         and the

            FLETCHER       decided that       he w ould try to find out exactly what                          had

            h a p p e n e d so he w al ke d across       the    pitch to the area of the                    gymnasium,

            leaving me       in charge.        I                                                              art m ou t h

            to m ou t h and heart m as sa                                                                      not       been

            approached       by any Po li ce                                                                  d to tell

            us what      had happened.

            I could see that there w                                _                                          gates         in

            the    perimeter      fencing     behind     the g o al mo ut h so I went across                  to see         if

            I could help.          I saw two       policemen and a number                of fans       pulling         people

            thro u g h the gate.        As    I got    closer       I could see that            there were            piles

            of bodies       inside     the    gate    on the terrace           right up against the wall.

            There were       still     large    numbers        of fans     in the terrace            but    it was not

            packed.        In fact    some    fans were        still      standing     on top of the

            u nconsious     bodies.        I a sk ed the       policeman what was              happening.           All      he

            said was       “What you      can see,     what you          can see."

            This    p o l iceman was 35 yrs          old,   b la nd i sh    curly hair,         not w e ar i ng        his

            helmet,      clean shaven,        wea ring      his tunic,         3 i:"10 tall.

            X decided that the          best    thing was          to get these         bodies       out of the

            terrace      onto   the    pitch so that my men                could work        on them.        I saw one

            m an   in particular who was amongst                   the    pile of bodies.            He was     just         to

            the    right   of the     gate as      I looked from the              pitch.       His   head and torso

            were    expo s e d above    the    rest    of the       - - i-~-        r * ■-           1- -      1 •*      ~ the

            easiest      to get    out.      I reached thr                        gate ana pulled him from

            the    pile.    He was     so close       to the             e that    I was able        to     reach him

            with o u t   having    to enter     onto     the    terrace         myself.        I pulled him free

&CA Tof£~   on my own and         carried him onto           the    pitch edge where            I lay him down

                      was     clean shaven.                He w a s i n g          an oatmeal       coloured tee shirt with

                      As    I h a d' d r a g g e d    this ma n out from the              terrace       his    body was      completely

                      lifeless and             I felt       that he was         dead.     I left him on the               pitch to see

                      if    I could help others                  on the terrace.              Also as     1 had pulled this man

                      out     from the         pile    of bodies          I saw a young w om an also amongst                  the

                      bodies.           Her    position was almost               d ir ec t ly    in fj^rfft of the gate about

                      a mo ng st     the      pile.        I will ytist      clarify that          the gate        1 had drag ge d the

                      I. reached         it I was a p p r o a c h e d by two men who stated that                          they were

                      f ir em en from Liv er po ol               and asked me          if they     could help.            I told them

                      to get as man y bodies                     out from the terrace as             possible and that we

                      w ould then try to               resusc it at e       them.       I then went       to see my men who

                      were     all      a ro u nd giving m ou th to m ou th and heart massage                         to various

                      bodies.           I told them to             carry on doing         that as there was               nothing     else

                      we    could do.           I told       them that       if they had wo rk ed on someone who                      they

                      could       not    revive and who was o bv i ou s ly dead,                    they were        to    pull    that

As yo u       look        to the s tand from the              pitch this second mans               position          was

just     on        the edge of the           pitch to the            left of the goal           betw ee n the six

ya rd are a and the              18 y ar d box        lines.         His    feet were just on the edge

of the        cinder        track whi 1 st his head was                  on the           TT7    This man was

5 3 - 5 4 yrs old,           b la nd is h hair       going    grey, /> m c k         on the sides,        receeding

  i sti n c t i v e    beer belly.           He w a s R e a r i n g      an off white          tee shirt w hi ch

was     riding up above              his    b ellvf khaki           drill      t r o u s e r s , grey a nd white

attempt        to     revive     him,y5      was using m o u t h to m ou th and heart m a s s a g e .

 I was     soon joined b y /a w o m a n who said she knew first aid and offe re d

 to help.           She     did y f\e    m ou t h to m o u t h whilst              I did the heart massage.

We    used my         r es u s i -a id w hi ch      I had also used                on the tattoed man.              The

 w o m a n was about 2 2-23 years                   old,    wearing a dark either                 blue              or     ma

mack.         I c a n ’t give a n ym o re           d es c ri p ti o n of her.          As we     were              working

 the ma n      I saw an a m b u l a nc e           drive    right up behind the goal.                     It

 pulled up about 6 ’ a wa y at first                        but then         came     closer    to us.         It

 s t o p p e d and one of the wh ee ls was                   d ir ec tl y on top of the mans                   right

 foot who we were               trying      to revive.            E v e r yo n e   shouted to the driver to

mov e and after              10 seconds        or so he did.               The man did not flinch at

all,     he        too was o b v i o u sl y dead.            We had w o r k ed on him for 3 to 4

minutes            but gave up and           pulled his tee shirt over his                      head.

 I told all           the    people a r o u n d me to get              this man        into the a m bu la nc e

 just    in case there was                 the slightest            chance and         I left him as the fans

were     picking          him up,       th ou gh   I d i d n ’t see him a ct ua ll y go into the

a mbul a n c e .

 I then went           back to the          t at tooed man but he had gone.                      I a s su m e d that

he had been put               in the a m b u l a nc e       but    I d i d n ’t see this          done.

 I then went           to a girl         who was d ir ectly            be hi nd the goal          just              on     th

up by the wall               outside         had now been         removed.        The fans      left the ground

and we       remained wit h             the       engine.     We were      told that we         could

stand down at a p p r o x i m a t e l y              1700 hours         but we    remained at       the gr ou nd

I gave m ou t h to m o ut h and art i fitial                    resuscitation.          I could not

revive      her and        left her       lying       in the same       position,     pulling       her shirt

over      her    face.


                     //
I have      beeps shown a p ho t og ra ph of the                 clothing worn by S a ra h Louise
                 /
HICKS      ( & V > on 13 April           1989    (130489)       (Ref N A 6 4 ) (Exh           ).     I do not

re cognk/5e the           pullover       but    the    rest of the       clothing     is very similar             to

that worn by the girl                   to w hich      I refer.



I have      viewed a m o r t u a r y       p hotogragh         (Ref         ) (Exh          ) of Sarah

L ouise HICKS.             I am happy that             this    shows    the face of the girl              that    I

have      just made m e n t i o n of;           the hair       colour    in the m o r t u a r y    photographs

seems      very dark and           I recall       the girls       hair    being    lighter,        this may

just      be the       photograph.



I have      i ndi cated on the sketch                  plan of the H i ll s b o r o u g h Pitch,          the

approximate            position at w h i ch the girl              I refer was        lying.        The

p o s ition      is i n d icated by a blue dot.                  I have    signed this        plan

(Ref A A H / 1 ) (Exh               ).



A third         person that        I gave       first aid       to was a white m a l e , a ge d about

22 years,        mousey        coloured wav y hair,            medium     build,     he was w e ar in g         very

dark      trainers,        blue    jeans,       light    c ol oured short       sleeved     *T * shirt with

a pocket         on the     left    breast.           I remember a ten         pound note         being    in the

*T*      shirt       pocket,    it was     sticking       out and       I pushed     it back       in.



The man had numerous                h eavy tattoos            on both arms.


                                                                                                          GO
I came across             this man on the             pitch,    r en dered first aid and after

failing     to     revive him,         I left him      in the same           position,


                                                                                                 T

(Ref           ) (Exh            ).     The    face on this        p hotograph        iSK i dent i cal to

the man     I refer;       the hair       is too dark        but this may be the                qual it y of

the    photograph

to that     of the man that             I refer to except             the    ’T*    shirt w h ic h     J. seem

to    recall     was    lighter       than the one shown           in the      photogra

                    Generally         the suppo rt er s at the            pub were          good humoured, they were

                    e x p e c t e d to be in plenty           of time      to take our            seats    before      the game

                    started.

                    At the L ep pings Ln e nt rance                I saw a mass            of    people filling a ro u n d both

                    to be a bout          4000    people all       trying      to get       into the ground,             there was

                    also    lots of supporters               still walking along Leppi ng s Ln from the

                    Some    people        in the    crowd a pp ea r e d angry at the apparent                      lack of

                    a p p e a r e d to me that       the Police         had    lost       copftrol.    I saw a Pol ic e

               On the outer           side of the blue gates              I could see only about                half a

               d oz en P ol ic e Officers,             but ytfly one of them a pp e a r e d to be a ct iv el y

               e ng ag e d    in crowd       control^the         others were         just     standing around.          The

               one Of fi ce r was           expla in in g    in a patient and g o o d - h u mo ur ed manner                   that

               people        should wait,        because      there was      little      chance of       people getting

               in .

               One or two of the m o u n t e d O ff ic er s              lost    their tampers and the               crowd

               reacted a g g r e s s i v e l y , f ru s t r a t i o n a p p e a r e d to be on both sides.                I

               h eard      several     fans     shouting at Police,             "Get y ou rs el ve s     o rganised."

               M ys el f and Steve           both knew the ground so knew where                     to get      in but         it

               appeared        to me that marry fans             did not know where             to go and were

               looking        for some guidance,

               The       time was     now about 2 . $ 0 p m      (1450),     the      crowd was     still      one big

               mass,       I realised we had no              chance of getting           in so we deci de d to wait

               by the P ol ic e L a n d Rove/            until    the    crowds       thinned.     I was a bout        to

               a p p r o a c h the Of f i ce r Nuii/th the m e gaphone           to ask       if the kick       Q.ff was to

               be delayed,          w hen    I heard him say through                 the megaphone,        /«e are        trying

               to get the k ick-off              d el ayed."

               At a bout       this    time     one    or more    of the blue          p erimeter/gates were              closed

               by P ol ic e O f f i c e r s . I think         this a p p e a r e d   to helo the situation,                   they

               re ma in ed     closed for about a minute                 or so and when they opened                  it

               appeared        less    crowded        inside and then        i ni tially as        people moved

               forward,        it eased the           c ongestion o u t s i d e , .although it a g a i n soon

               became        very   congested again.

               I heard the Offi ce r w it h the meg ap ho ne                    call    out,    "Mounted       Inspector,"

               to     "form a line,"          he meant       for him to      line the h or s e / up.           The m o u n t e d

O f fi c e r s   quite      quic kl y formed themselves                         into a line stretching                   f rom

the    shops to the           left of the entrance as you                              look    leaving a gap for

fans     to funnel          t hro ug h on the/right                  hand side as you                look.

It was       now about                                  , I heard           cheers from          inside the          ground

as    if things were              happening,          a minute         or two          later                a nd myself

s t a r te d to move         toward the turnstiles,                     moving          through the funnel                made

by the P ol ice            horses,        up to this         stage      no-one          had a sked to see our

t ickets.

As    I en te red the         inner area              inside the blue g/tes I saw the blue

conce rt in a steel           gate         on my left o p e n i n g , tpis               gate    is to the          left of

tu rn s ti l e      one,    w h i c h gives access              to the Q< S t a n d . The gate stayed open

for only a m inute                or    less,     during which A                 saw hundreds          rather than

t h ou sa nd s      of    people       rush thro ug h the 'jate, ttoeir tickets were

o b v i o us l y not       checked.        It was about\|/ow th/at I saw about a dozen fans

climb onto a dividing                      fence on my          rights/and climb onto a balcony

above,       I saw a single Police Officer j/p there                                   but     he was        powerless to

s top them.          Eventually a mounted o W i c e r                       cut off this entrance and

s to pp e d others          climbing,           but the dozen or so had by this                             time    had got

into     the g round unlawfully.

W hi l s t w ai ti ng       to go t h r ou gh the turnstile                       I saw at       least two          people

in front          of me w ith tickets                 for the N S t a n d trying                to get       into    the W

Stand.       The g a t em an was           told by a PC and a WPC                       standing       just       inside     the

t u r ns t il e s    to a l lo w them           in despite           the tickets.             The Officers          a pp e a r e d

w o r r i e d and        looked     ’a s h e n ’ and     I think their mai n                   concern was          to get

people       into the ground.

Eventually           we    entered        the    inner     courtyard             having       passed    through             /

turnstile           13 or    1/4.      I visited        tbfe t o i l e t s       and    we    eventually          arrived        at

our    seats        at    abVut     3.06pm       (ISQfo).       We    sat       more    or    less    immediately

behind       the     goal    at     the    Leppings        Ln    end    and       about       half    way    up    the

seating          area     overlooking           the    pitch     from       a    seated       position       I could        see

the w hole         of the      pitch and as          far beneath me as the first                f e# feet      of

the     standing area bene at h us.                  T h a t ’s the first      few feet      nearest     the

perimeter          fence.

T he re were        large      numbers        of   people    in the aisles        between the seats who

did not a pp ea r          to have seats.            At this time        the    players a p p e a r e d to me

to be still          warming         up,    however    I soon       realised tiiat in fact            they

w ere    leaving         the   pitch,       I did not know          if the \jame had star te d or not.

I saw       people       starting       to get onto the          pitch,      I did not know what was

going on.          I then saw people               climbing over       the     perimeter     f ftnee onto      the

pitch,         then the Police             began hauling       people over        the fej/ce a nd onto

the     pitch.      I can remember             the one gate d ir e c t l y b e h i m x thfe goal was

open and         people were           getting      onto the     pitch through t h ys g a t e , but

there was          not    really a steady flow of                people,       just        occasional         one

s ee m ed      to be getting           out.

S l o w l y events        s ug ge st ed that        the standing are a          below,,-was c o ng es te d and

I saw       people       being   c arried out and            laid onto       the / i t c h , man y a pp e ar e d

H o w e ve r    I cannot       remember        particular      details.

E v e n t u a l l y we    left the ground at 3. 4 5 p m              (1545),     w h ic h was   before       the

official        a b a n d on me nt     of the game.         We did not       really    realise     the true

extent of the d isaster at this                       stage,     although       I did see more         frodies

o utside       the Leppj/nqs L n,             these were      being s cr ee ne d by P o l i c ^ / Q f f i c e r s .

In my o pin io n the kick                  off time    should have         been dela ye d to a llgw the

crowd       into    the ground.            I also    feel    that    the m o u n t e d Po 1 i ce ^cj/u.1 d have

been better          o r g a ni se d    in funnelling         fans    into     the ground.

I w ou ld       like to stress             that    the make up of the groyfid a t the L ep pings

L n end of the ground w it h turnstiles                        to both W and N stands mai--:es it

very difficult             for fans         not knowing       the grourn^/ to locate            the    correct

turnstile.

            not      hear any tannoy          requests     for medical         a s si st an ce   until about 3.20ptfi

            (1520),      this     seemed to me to be very                late.    I also     heard tannoy

            requests        for   people      to   clear   the     pitch at about         this      time,   this was

            not made        clear to the fans and o b v i ou sl y              it was     not    possible     for them

            to    return to the terraces,                I did not hear any            information t an no ye d to

            the      crowd t elling      them what was           happening.

            I w o u l d also      like   to    point     out that      the gate      I w i t n e s s e d open was     not

            the gate that          I u nd er s t a n d   is the one m e n t i o n e d     in the media.        This

            t he re fo re    shows more        than one gate was opened.

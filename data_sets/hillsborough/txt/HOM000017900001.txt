HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to thank you for your letter of
17 May, which he has seen.
Lord Justice Taylor would find it convenient if the Sheffield
Trades Union Council could put their detailed submission to him
in writing on the matters you raise in your letter. If you would
like to send it to me at the Inquiry address above I will see
that Lord Justice Taylor sees it straightaway.




                                        R M WHALLEY
                                   Secretary to the Inquiry

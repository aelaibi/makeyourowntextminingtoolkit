could        see        clearly          football           supporters              from       both     teams,            but    at     this

t i me     it wa s           more    family          supporters               arriving.

We    drove         into       town       via P e n i s t o n e         Road.         When        we    set       out,        I was

surprised               to    find       the     Police         had     not     already           blocked            off      the     road     in

view       t h at       supporters             had already              started           to     arrive.

We we re          in the           town       for a f e w         hours        and    returned              home      to      leave      our

car      outside             the    house.           Both                     and    I then        decided            to w a l k        across

to    th e      ’G a t e w a y "     Supermarket                in H a l i f a x      Road        to    fetch         some       other

i t e ms     of     shopping             at    twelve          thirty.              Our    friends           still         h a d n ’t

arrived           so we        continued             to     the      shops.

We w a l k e d          down       our    road       to L e p p i n g s        Lane       and     I remember               now      that      the

barriers            were       in    place          across        the    ends        of    our     road an d P ol i ce

Officers            were       manning           them.

As    I got         into L e p p i n g s            L a ne,     I could         see a          number        of      f an s     making

their        way        to    the    ground,           but      as     I passed           t he    junction            with       the     island

at H a l i f a x         Road ,      it w a s        now       I could         see    hoards           of    fans         arriving.

There        wa s       hundreds          of     fans       off      loading         by    the     Niagara            Police          Club.

In fact,            I would          go as          far as        to    say     t ha t     there        was       thousands             of

football         fans.         I presume           t h at      they were           Liverpool              f a n s as        they        spoke

with    a Liverpool                accent       and wore           red a n d w h i t e .            They        were        all

excitable          and      in h i g h      spirits,           but      t h e y w e r e n ’t g o i n g          to     t he      ground.

I h e a r d a fe w say              'Let's        find a         pub,      w h e r e ’s t h e r e         a    pub'       and      they

went    up H a l i f a x       Road       with     a sense           of    urgency.

As               and     I w a 1k e d       up Hal ifax R o a d , we                  could       see         Police        O f f i cers

along      the     way,       but    th e    Police          presence           was     heavier           near       to     the     public

house,      w h i c h was,          obviously,            to m o n i t o r        the      fans     by        the    pubs        going           in

and    out;      where        the    Police        presence             was     more       sparce,            that     is     between

the    pubs,       we w e r e       approached            by    several           fans      asking            if we       had any

spare      tickets.                I say     they were             fans,        it w o u l d      only         be a n a s s u m p t i o n

if    I said they were                ticket         touts.             We a s s u m e d      also        that       they were

from Liverp oo l              by    there       accent.            All     of     them      that       asked         us w e r e

all    white,       between          late       ’t e e n s     to m i d - t w e n t i e s        and      t h a t ’s all           I can

say.       This made           me    think,        in fact,                           commented               that     last        year,

it w a s    quite        the       opposite        thaJ^iThere             wa s    plenty         of      people          selling

tickets       as    if t h e y       had     excess          amounts.                                I 9 8 S           O f e M          I

We    continued          up the       road w it h            the     supporters             and,       at      this       time,         there

were    fans       coming          back     down     the       road/farrying                cans       and      bottles            of       beer

and    they      were       drinking         from        the^e       and       down     the      r o a d as         fast      as    they

could they were                carrying           four       p a c ks     of    beer       and    drinking             one       after

another       as    if t h e y       had     to    drink        them       before          they     got        to w h e r e v e r           they

were    go i ng .        We    continued           up to W a d d s l e y           Bridge         a n d we          noticed         the

density       of    drinking          supporters               had      thickened,            but      the      other         thing             wa s

the P o l i c e     presence          had       j us t    stopped          near       tp    the     s h op s .         This        I found

strange       be c a use       this       was     o b v i o u s l y whes^e the              fans       were         b u y i ng     all

heavily       but      were        certainly         notydrunk,                just     in h i g h        spirits

           and     I crossed          the       roa/to          the       Supermarket             a n d we          could        see        a

number      of     f an s     sitting        and     standing             outside          consuming            alcohol            and

talking.            We       both     saw      that       the      number       of       fans    going          in a n d       out      buying

alcohol         was      a    constant          s t r e a m a n d a ll          they were             buying           wa s    alcohol.

           and      I went          into       the    store          and went            to    buy    s om e     lager         ourselves

and whilst            at      the     display,            f an s     were      discussing             which          lagers        were        the

strongest           and       that     it w a s       the       strongest            they       should          be     buying.            We

again       presumed           they were             fans       by t h e r e        accents.

We     bought       our       lag er      a n d as        we    s t o o d at        the       checkout          we     noticed          t ha t

the      lager      the       supporters             were       purchasing               were    not       cheap        name        brands

but     expensive             strong        ones      and       each        fan was           buying       on a v e r a g e        at     lea s t

t wo     ’f o u r ’ p a c k s       each.

In m y     mi nd,        I could          see       that       from      the    quantity             and      t yp e    of     beer       they

were      buying         an    element          of    the       supporters               were    out       to    drink         as m u c h         as

they      could       in o r d e r        to    get       drunk.            Again,        I c a n ’t r e a l l y          describe             any

of     the y o u t h s ,       there        were      s o me       fifteen          to    eighteen            pass      t h r o u g h as

and     in the        time       we    purchased               our      beer.        They       were       all       male      and      in

there       late      tee n s.

We     left     the      store        and      began       to      c o me    back        quite       quickly           for     fear       of

keeping         our      friends          waiting.              We      returned          home       again       vi a H a l i f a x

R o a d , across             Waddley        Bridge         and       down      into L e p p i n g s           Lane      and        home.

During        our     return          journey         home,          there      were          more    people           approaching                us

fo r    tickets          and     the      number          of    fans        drinking           did    not       decrease.               The

fans      were      quite        excitable            but       they were            well       controlled              by     the      Police

along       the     route.

I would         say      in a s p a c e         of 2 0 0        yards,         we    were       approached              by     some

thirty        people          looking          to    buy any            spare       tickets.

We a r r i v e d      home,         received          our       guests         and       had    so m e     lunch.             We    set      of f

again      at     approximately                 quarter            to    two w a l k i n g       to      go     to     the     football

match       vi a P e n i s t o n e        Road,       along          our     route        to    the      football             match       along

Penistone           R o a d.        The     only      comments              I could make              are       that     there          was       a

distinct          lack        of a l c o h o l       in    comparison               to    our    earlier             experience              of

        being        mixed with             the L i v e r p o o l          fans.           I know          it     could        be    said       t ha t

        t his    wa s      because          we    were        nearer        to    the        ground,            but      I honestly             d o n ’t

        think        these       people          had    drank           so m u c h .         I c o u l d n ’t s m e l l             any    alcohol

        o n them,          t h e y w e r e n ’t c a r r y i n g            alcohol,             t h e y w e r e n ’t c h a n t i n g            or

        singing,           but    they were             just        as     excitable.                 We m o v e d        to    the       turnstile

        and although              there          was    a     l a rg e a m o u n t         of    fans,          we    got      into       the

        ground        surprisingly                easy.            There        was    no       pushing          or      jostling,             we    were

        in     the    ground        for a p p r o x i m a t e l y           ten       to    two.

        I stood         looking           around        the        ground        looking            at    various           pens        and

        sections.                I watched             out     of       interest           as    to      the     quantity            of    fans

        entering.             I noticed            and        found        it    unusual            that        there       was     a     s m al l

        triangular            section            between           the    Spion Kop and                   the        North      Stand          which

        w as    filled with Liverpool                          fans.

        Looking         around         the       ground,           we    could        see       f a ns    coming          in a n d        at    about

        twenty        past       two      the W ^ 4 t         Stand       seating           area         was     quite         full       and       so

        was     pens       three       a n d y f o u r.        It was           obvious          to me          th a t    the       people

        arriving           in g o o d / t i m e        were        interested              in s t a n d i n g         behind        the        goal

        mouth        the     ’W i n g s *    below          the     West        Stand were               s t il l     quite         sparce.

        From     twenty          past       two    to       the     a bi n t     of    kick-off             there         is not          really

        much     more       I can s a y           except           dt a p p r o x i m a t e l y t w e n t y to thr e e,                        the

        football           teams       came       out       fo/ a w a r m         up a n d at             t hi s      t i me    pens       three

        and     four were           full         but    p e i W ^ o ne,         two,       f i ve     and       six      still       had       spaces.

        diagonal           from     r i gh t      tcyl ef t .            I thought              a barrier             had      g i v e n way.

        I presume            through         a gate           at    the     front          of    the      pens.           People          were

        being        lifted       from       the       pens        into     the       stands          above.

        The     next       thing       at    about          te n     past       three       when         the     players            had     left

C a t   the    pitch was            that half a dozen                       ^      fans made a charge                   from the

        Spion     Kop,       t h e ^ gesticulated with                           the re       fists     enticing         the    opposing

        supporters.

        Police       Officers           formed a              line a c r o s s       the       football          pitch       obviously         to

        prevent       further           fans          who     had      spilled       out       of    the    pens,       crossing       o v er

        the    ground        to     the      Nottingham Forest                      f an s     enclosure.

        I could       not      describe               the     youths         in a n y     detail,          other     than      they were

        Liverpool          f an s      of    varying            a g e s,     the    majority          of w h i c h      were    wearing

        At    4.10    p.m.        the       crowd          received          tha^first          public       announcement             to   the

        effect       that      we      should/remain                   i/r the      ground          to a l 1 ow    emergency

        services       through,

        The    Nottingham Forest                       supporters             were      clapping           whilst       the    emergency

        services       went         about         there         jobs.         In m y      opinion          the    supporters          were

        clapping       in a c k n o w l e d g e m e n t              of    there     efforts          attending          to    the    injured.

        The    only    other           thing          I could          say was       that       watching          the    incident,         it

        s u r p r i s e d me      to    see       that        nobody         took    the       l e a d to    tend       to    the    injured

        or    generally           organise             everybody.

        One    thing       that        stood          in m y m i n d w a s          that       a group       of    fans       brought      a

        man    onto    the        pitch a r ea              on a n a d v e r t i s i n g        board.           There       were    several

        people       attending              to    him       giving         him     heart       massage       and mouth          to m o u t h

        resuscitation               and,         after        a while,           they     stopped and             covered       his    face

        with    a jumper.

        Some    further           fans       came          o v er    to    h i m and,         for    some    r ea son,        the    apparently

        d e a d m a n wa s        stripped             to     his      underpants,             they     began      to    dress       him and

        once    dressed,            carried            him      from       the     pitch and          out    of    the       ground.       T he

        ma n who      wa s     apparently                  dead,       I would       describe           as a w h i t e        male    of a

            very     stocky       build,       in fact,         he   had a beer          belly.        He   looked about

             twenty      five     years      of a g e      and wore      only      green      underpants-              When

             carried      onto     the      pitch,      he wa s      dressed and           carried      from     the     pitch    on

            an advertising              bo ar d ,    but     I couldn't        describe         the    clothes         they    placed

            0 n him.

            The    people       w ho    were    trying         to    revive    him      I c o u l d n ’t r e a l l y    describe,

            there       was    so m u c h    going      on     for me    to    remember.

             1 can't      say an yt hi ng           else abou t        the    day,      there    was    so m u c h      going    on.

            We    left    the    g r o u n d at     about       quarter       to   five     that      afternoon        and     went

            straight          home.

            1 would       like     to    say    that       I will      gladly      go    to a n y     hearing     if     I am

            required.           The     emergency          services      performed          a marvellous          job a n d      can

      Description       INDEXERS POLICY FILE - 2




           250690



           106 Database created (between 010690-150690 by DSU COBB) to assist with

           the CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION.




           PROCEDURES FOR DEALING WITH TAPE TRANSCRIPTS/CONTEMPORANEOUS NOTES.

           ARISING FROM THE INTERVIEWS OF POLICE OFFICERS, OFFICIALS ETC.



           To assist in future research of the information contained in the above

           documentation, there is an emphasis to provide Free Text Retrieval via

           status.



           The current main database 102 still suffers a considerable backlog of

           documentation awaiting transfer into the Free Text DB. There is no

           immediate solution available from BULL to assist in this area. There is

           no selective option available to force through the more important

           documentation and hence it is a question of first in queue, first to

           transfer.



           To overcame same of these problems and to push through the interview

           transcripts, a new database has been created. This is in turn linked to

           the main database 102.
                                                                  PAGE    2
                                                                  D3825

Hie procedures to be followed in relation to TRANSCRIPTS,

CONTEMPORANEOUS NOTES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS ARISING FROM THE INTERVIEW OF

POLICE OFFICERS, OFFICIALS ETC, is thus



a) The Receiver will clearly mark the document for registration etc in

   106.

b) Registerthe documentation to the new database 106.

c) Create askeleton nominal for the person interviewed,     Page1 with

   some reference on Page 3 should suffice.

d) Type thetranscript etc in the new database via +TS.

e) Any actions arising should      be     raised in the new DB, linkedtothe

   Nominal.



Because the two databases are linked, then all of the previously

recorded information held on the Nominal in DB 102 is available for

research.



When researching, where it is known that the information required is

held within the interview record of that person, then it is more

efficent to log into the new database and not to make the link to 102.

If however, the purpose of the research is to compare the content of

the interview record with the written recollection and/or judicial

inquiry transcript, then there will be a need to link into both

databases.



If a pattern of common searches should emerge, then it might be

possible to set up a series of global macros (DSU COBB will execute).



When it comes to filing, there is a need to be aware that there will be

some duplication of numbers i.e. the new database will commence at
                                                                PAGE       3

Transcript/Contemporaneous notes will be typed on and registered as

On Datatbase 106 in order to assist indexing information gained from

the Interviews a SEQUENCE OF EVENTS has been created for each person

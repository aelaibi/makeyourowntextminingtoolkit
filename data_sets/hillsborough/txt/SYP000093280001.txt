               At 8.00 am (0800) Saturday 15th April              1989 <150489)     I commenced duty

               at- West Bar Police Station, Sheffield,              Following a briefing relating

           ’   to the Nottingham Forest v Liverpool Football Match at Hi 1Isborough

                F,ootbal 1 Ground. I attended the Midland Railway Station with PC 1125
               A///&07          ~
                SAUNDERS and other officers.   With PC SAUNDERS 1 escorted a double-

               decker bus loaded with Nottingham Supporters to Hillsborough Football

               Ground.

               At £.30 pm (143 u )"H[ commenced my meal           in the gymnasium of the stadium

               with the rest of my serial?           (under the control of Sgt 2916 K N I G H T S ).

               At 2.50 pm (1450) with Sgt KN I G H T S , and other officers;             I attended the

               Leppings Lane end of the ground,, where there was a report of trouble.

               On arrival at this section of the ground,               I was immediately met with a

               torrent of abuse from the Liverpool supporters who had come through
                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                   53754

            the turnstiles.          They were aggressive and using offensive             language,

            saying,    "Open the g a t e s , people are getting killed ou lr there," and

            " Th er e’s fucking trouble out there,          y o u ’d better ><fo so me th in g,"

            Almost all the       people who spoke to me smellejfr^strongly of a l c o h o l.

            Thi s abuse      came from the majority of peo s n e      entering the ground and

            was directed at myself and other offi/ers.                I then looked through the

            turnstiles and I could see somebody in the crowd outside on the floor

            and struggling to get to his f / e t .          Also people were climbing over the

            wall,    over the t urnstile i ryfo the ground and everyone              entering was

            extremely agitated,         and A number were phys i c a 1ly aggressive.

            The    concertina gates j £ \   the side of the turnstiles were obviously

      yt ^ under extreme        pres/ure from the outside as they were bending towards

    I/'s r^y^me.    After a t iyfe    (which seemed longer that        it actually w a s ) the

            concertina g^£es were opened by a Police Officer                 (u n k n o w n ) and a

            steward.        T/ixs released a flood of people who were           in a distressed and

            shocked condition,         clearly gasping for breath.          Again we were hit by

            ahail of abuse from some of these people about the crush outside.

            After the initial wave,         some people attempted to show us tickets,                 but

            most just rushed         past towards the pitch.

            As a unit we then made our way to the front of the Leppings Lane

            terrace,    via a gate between the terrace and the stand.                  We continued
      ,v
            onto the pitch behind the goal where             I saw the people        in the terrace

            pushed up against the perimeter fe n c e , due to the number of people is

            that section of the terrace.           The people at the front of the terrace

            were unable to move at all, and even at this sta<fe,                 it was apparent

            that some people were dead or close to deatja^

            I made my way to the emergency exit gate/situated to the                    left si,de of

            the g o a l .   This gate was o p e n , but d                     erne

            people,    it was extremely difficul                                           te r race.

          from the terrace back onto the pitch.         Some officers attempted to get

          the crowd in the terrace to move back by shouting & making gestures,

          but they received verbal abuse and and I even saw items, mainly coins,

          thrown at them.

          A number of Liverpool supporters who were on the pitch then made a

          charge to the Nottingham fans        in the opposite end of the ground,     As a

     (^^P^result     I was   instructed by a senior officer   (unknown),   to stand on the

          half-way line and prevent Liverpool        supporters getting to the

          Nottingham fans.

          As the ground cleared of people, with PC SAUNDERS,          I went to Penistone

          Road and escorted Nottingham supporters to the Midland Railway Station,

          on a double-decker bus.

          I subsequently went off duty at West Bar Police Station at S.00 pm

          (2000 ).

          Throughout this      incident,   the majority of the Liverpool Supporters

          with whom I came into contact with, were abusive and aggressive,           and

          those with whom 1 had encountered        in conversation,   smelled of

          i nto xicants.

          This was highlighted by the contrasting        behaviour of the Nottingham

          fans with which a family atmosphere existed.

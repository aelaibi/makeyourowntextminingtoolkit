Dear Mr Croston

David Duckenfield - Hillsborough Disaster

Thank you very much for your letter of 27th July and enclosures. We will of course consider
the content of the correspondence and come back to you in the near future, but are very
grateful for you setting out the terms of the CPS review. We will of course endeavour to
assist in that process as much as possible, given our request for the DPP to take over conduct
of the matter and discontinue the present proceedings.

As soon as we have considered the matter further, with the benefit of Counselâ€™s advice, we
will come back to you. In the meantime if you have any queries please do not hesitate to
contact me or Simon Eastwood.

Yours sincerely




 N A F OWSTON

           At 9,45 a.m. on Saturday 15 April            1989,    I came on duty at

           Hillsborough Football Ground in S h e f f i e l d .        I then joined my alloted

           Serial Number       18,    in the North Stand where I was responsible to

           Pol ice Sergeant 758 Morgan,         who was   in charge of the ser i a l .



           About 10.00 a.m. we were briefed regarding the semi-final                          football

           match about to take place between Liverpool F.C.                    and Nottingham

           Forest F.C. by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Inspector

           Sewell.     Immediately after this briefing we had a packed meal provided



           About 11.00 a.m.          the same day my Serial attended at the rear of the

           West Stand where we received a further briefing by Inspector Sykes

           before being deployed to our positions on the turnstiles at Leppings
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 R118

Lane side of the ground.          Myself and Police Constable 3342 Blount

were stationed at turnstiles numbers 9 and 10 respectively which

gives access to the North Stand.



At this location there are 16 turnstile entrances set up in pairs for

access to the North and West Stand.              There are gates allowing entry

from Leppings Lane       into the area in front of the turnstiles.             The

area within the gates was partitioned by a steel,                interlocked

temporary barrier to split the North Stand entrance turnstiles from

the West Stand entrance turnstiles.              The turnstile number     10 was at

the side of this barrier and numbers 11-16 gave access to the West

Stand.



We were responsible for the searching of fans to ensure that

prohibited articles were not taken into the ground and that fans

entering behaved in an orderly f a s h i o n .           Initially there were only a

small number of fans in the area of Leppings Lane who were behaving

in a peaceable manner while waiting for the turnstiles to be opened.



About 1200 mid-day the same day,            some of the turnstiles were opened

and fans started to enter the g r o u n d .         A short while later all of the

turnstiles were o p e n e d .    Fans entering were searched where this was

a p p r o pr ia te , as they entered the g r o u n d .   Gradually the number of

fans entering i n c r e a s e d , but there was still only a relatively small

number enter ing and it was noticeable that some fans were bringing

alcohol with them which they were then disposing of in the bins

provided.     Many fans were milling around on the pavement outside the

gates before finally coming into the turnstiles.                 The number of

people entering the ground gradually increased until about 2.00 p,m.

when the entire area from the front of the turnstiles up to the metal
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            R118

entrance gates was filled with fans, but at this stage there was

only a little pushing and everyone was behaving in an orderly fashion

as best I could see.



It was noticeable that many fans were confused by the coloured ticket

system in use and that they were trying to gain entry to the wrong

section of the ground.       At this stage it was possible for them to be

let back out of the turnstiles and then to gain entry through the

correct turnstile    into the correct section of the g r o u n d .



About 2.40 p.m.    the same d a y , the pressure of people had increased

such that people were being pushed forward into the turnstiles by the

pressure of the people behind and they were four or more deep trying

to gain access    into two turnstile e n t r a n c e s .   This resulted in people

pushing to gain entry to the turnstiles as well.               At this time I

noticed that there seemed to be a large number of f a n s , who had

obviously been drinking, who were pushing forward regardless of the

people in front of them,      causing distress to many p e o p l e .    Also these

fans were arguing with whoever they c o u l d , but no violence was

possible due to the tightly packed c r o w d .        When these fans went down

the wrong turnstile they were extremely abusive and often refused to

back out of the turnstile,       forcing their way t hr ou gh .



Others who had come to the wrong turnstile did push back against the

crowds and try to gain entry through the correct turnstile.               However,

sometime during this period this also became impossible and they

could not make their way back against the flow of the crowd behind

them.   This resulted in their having to be let through the turnstile

into the wrong section of the g r o u n d , a 1 though they were being let

into the North Stand which was all seats and not into the West Stand
                                                                       PAGE
                                                                       R118

which their tickets were f o r .



At several    times during this period elderly and young children were

pushed down the side of barrier towards me and as best as I was able

I forced the crowd back      (and in most cases was assisted by those in

the crowd)    to let them through into the tu rns ti le. It was also

necessary to 1et a pregnant woman t h r o u g h .   I not iced that some fans

who were intoxicated didn't care for this and would not let these

people through and I received a great deal of abuse from them.



Eventually I was pushed back against the wall beside the turnstile

and up against the partitioning barrier by the pressure of the crowd

and was unable to move.      Many people were complaining regarding the

pushing of the crowd,     but in view of my position and the fact that I

had lost contact with the other members of my serial,         I was unable to

help them.     At this time it seemed to me that things were getting out

of hand and it was quite frightening to be penned into this corner

and unable to m o v e .   I was very relieved when the numbers of people

dropped off and I was again able to move about freely.          The crowd

eventually dwindled away as all the fans gained access to the ground.



About 3.05 p.m.    the same day,   there was a report that Liverpool fans

were on the pitch and I therefore went through the turnstile and made

my way onto the pitch with my serial,      by going down the south side of

the Vest Stand.



On arrival at the pitch I could see that the crowd in the central

north terrace were pushing forward and that the pople at the front of

the terrace were being forced up against the front fencing to the

terrace.     It was apparent that those at the front were being crushed
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           R118

by the pressure of the crowd behind them and that some of the people

up against that fencing were at least unconscious,           and possibly that

they were dying if not already dead.           I could see Police Officers

climbing the fencing shouting at the crowd to move back.             It was

obvious that the fans to the rear of the crowd were unaware initially

of what was occurring at the front of the terrace.



I saw that the gate into the central mouth terrace was open and that

officers were inside lifting people over the interal barrier which

separates the central North and South terraces.            These people were

then being carried onto the terrace and they were brought out through

Gate number 3 onto the p i t c h .     I immediately went over to this gate

and assisted out several people who were either afraid to remain or

in j u r e d .   These people then went over onto the pitch where they sat

or laid down and were attended to by first aiders or other Pol ice

officers.         It appeared to me that many of these people were in s h o c k .



Next I saw Pol ice constable 159 Marsh who was carrying a young boy

who I now know to be Lee N i c o l , out of the central south t e rr ac e.        I

assisted him with Nicol and we carried him onto the pitch where

Pol ice Constable Marsh commenced mouth to mouth resuscitation,




At this point we were joined by two people who identified themselves

to us as doctors and they took over          the resuscitation of Nicol.

Myself and Pol ice Constable Marsh then had to keep other Liverpool

fans away as they kept trying to help but only succeeded in hindering

the d o c t o r s .   Finally a stretcher arrived and Nicol was taken away to

an ambulance with Pol ice Constable Marsh accompanying him.                           ]

                                                                                   R118



I then went back to the terraces where I saw that gate number 4 was

open and that bodies were being removed from the terrace through it.

I went over to this gate and assisted a Police Sergeant                   in taking a

youth out of this terrace.             We then took this youth onto the pitch

and between us placed him in the recovery position and then I covered

him with my anorak.          I then remained with this youth to ensure that

he continued breathing as it was d i f f i c u l t .       W h i 1st I was looking

after this youth I was joined by two other officers who I do not

know.    One was a woman Pol ice Constable and she was extremely

distressed and in t e a r s .        She told me that someone had just died who

she was trying to r es u sc it at e.       The other officer squatted down

watching this youth with me and just could not believe                   it.    Whilst

sat there we counted over ten bodies             just laid on the pitch around us.



A short time later an ambulance was about to leave the ground and

this youth was placed in the floor of this ambulance as two other

casualties were already on the two trolleys.                 There was another

Pol ice C o n s t a b l e , PC 851 Wicker already in the a m b u l a n c e .   As the

ambulance was about to 1e a v e , it was stopped and another youth who I

now know to be Anthony Bland of

K e i g h l e y , was then placed on top of the youth         who       was    already on th

floor of the a m b u l a n c e .   He was not breathing       but       had    a pulse and i

was necessary to give him mouth to mouth resuscitation continually on

the journey from the ground to the Northern General H o s p i t a l .              On

arrival at the h o s p i t a l , Bland was placed on a trolley and he started

to breathe by himself.             I continued to assist with Bland at the the

hospital until he was taken away to be X - R a y e d .



I then assisted hospital staff with a youth who was suffering from

         fits.   He was eventually sedated by doctors and I was released from           !

         duty with other patients as by this time most had been dealt with.

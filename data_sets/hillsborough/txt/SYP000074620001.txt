pushed along              with       the    crowd.           It was       now about             2.43pm and              people       were

shouting          for     people          behind       to    stop       pushing       and       it was         complete            cha o s

of a big          b lue      ir on    gate       in f r o n t      of me       and    to my        r i g ht       being     opened.

I was          unable     to    see       who    opened        the      gate    but     remember             noticing          a

Policeman             stood     on a w a ll           about       13 f o o t    up    looking           over       at    the       crowd.

    pon    the    gate       being        opened       it was        definately            opened         by a P o l i c e m e n           but

I couldnot             say what           they       looked       like,       people       started           to    quickly walk

through          the    gate,        there       was       no m a s s    rush,       but     we     had      no    choice          but     to

go    through          the     gate       there       was     no w a y    you       could       have      not      g one    through.

As    the       packed       crowd        eased around             us    through        the       g a t e ________ fell               over

few       people       behind        her    were       unable        to a v o i d      her      and     stumbled           over       her.

After          picking                     up we m a d e          towards       the     toilets           w h i c h were

Most       people       who     had       entered          through       the    gate       which        had       been     opened

were       heading        the       same    way       as    us.

                was    feeling        sick       and whilst             she    went     to      the     toilet          I waited           in

a    tarmaced          area     behind          the    West       Stand.        I was        aware        of      people       s t ill

flooding           in t h r o u g h       the    opened        gates      and also           people          were       s t ill

entering          via     the       turnstiles.

opened          gates     I had       noticed          a    couple       of P o l i c e      officers             and Stewards

but       they werent           attempting             to     take      anyones       tickets           or     c h eck     them       as

 After                      came       out       of    the                      we    made       our       way     to    the        s ide

 Upon    getting            to    the       side       terrace            I could          see       t hat      it wa s        full       but     it

 was    not      so     packed that               you were               unable       to m o v e ,         whilst        making           our    way

 down again             onto      the       floor.             I picked          her       back       up     but      could         see     she was

 not    v e r y w e l l.          She was             very white               and ap pe a re d            to    be     going        into a

 I took                       b ack        out    of      the       terrace          and    towards             a fence         seperating

 the W e s t       Stand and               South       Stand.             A steward             sat    her       down and            gave        her    a

 glass      of wate r .

 A Police          l a dy     then         came       up a n d       took       us    to    the       back       of     the     West        Stand

 refreshments               booth          and    sat         her    down.

 I then       left                         /ith t h e m a n d w e n t                back       to    get                      and     tell       th§

 others       what       was      happenings.

 Upon    getting            back, to T e r r a c e              I csfuld see               that       the m a t c h        had       just        been

 stopped and             loads         of    people           w^re        climbing          over       the       railings            and     fences

 onto    the       pitch         from       th^cenCre                pens.

 I could         see     t ha t     the      ctmt^fe           pens w e r e          full       but    d i d n ’t k n o w           they were

 being      crushed.              I thought               people were                climbing          o ver       to    get        out     of    the

 way    because          of      the       crowds         within          the    pens a n d           would wait               to    be     placed

 in a n o t h e r       pen as         sometimes               happens          when       it    gets        full.

 I then       went       b ack      to w h e r e          I left                       but       was       told       t ha t    the P o l i c e

 had    taken         her a w a y .          I asked a friend who                           said       they        he    thought            he    had

 seen    the P o l i c e          take       her a w a y a n d             she       had    gone away              in a m b u l a n c e .

 It w a s     by      no w a b o u t        3.10pm and               I then went                outside          the     ground           via     the

    'There    was     still        quite       a few        people        milling        around         outside        but,        I can

     remember        seeing        load s      of P o l i c e      officers          and ambulances.

     I also     reca l l      upon       leaving          the     terraces          to    go    b ack    to    the     refreshment

     stall    & get                      I saw a          lot     of   people        being       bought        out     of       the

     tunnel     to    the     bac k      of    the     stand and           being         placed       on the        floor        and

    aided      by P o l i c e      and ambulancemen.                      In f ac t      whilst         I was       looking           at

     these     and walking              along     by      the w a l l      alongside            the     gate       t hat    had       been

     opened     I nearly,           tripped          over a man            lying         on the       fl o o r .     I in f act

     stepped       over     him and           thought        he was        sunbathing.                Upon     stepping            over

     him    I looked        back a nd          realised           t hat    he m u s t      be dead.            He a p p e a r e d

     lifeless        and    had a brown              leather           jacket       covering          the w h o l e        of     his

     head.      He was        a white          male       who     looked about             m y age,          height        and     build

     although        I c o u l d n ’t see         his       face,       he was       wearing          a baggy         light

     coloured        tee    shirt        and    blue        jeans       and    training           shoes.           No-one        was       in

     attendance           by h i m a n d       I only        l o o k e d at     him       quickly and              continued            to

     look    for                   as    I was       by     now g e t t i n g       very worried.

     On    going     out    of     the    ground          I spoke         to a P o l i c e m a n a n d a s k e d            him where

                would       have        been    taken        to    but     he was         unable        to    s a y as      he     t o l d me

     he    d i d n ’t come       from     the a r e a .           I then w al ke d             further        down Leppings

     We    eventually         then       caught        the      7.45prn S h e f f i e l d         to L o n d o n     train         from

                With    hind       sight    I feel        that     the     fact      that     t h e r e was      only 8 turnstiles

                for    so m a n y     supporters          and     the    fact      that      people      were     funnelled        into a

                small     c o mpound was         asking         fo ;sr p r o b l e m s .

                Also    in    comparision          to     a/evious         years       the P o l i c e    organisation           both

                inside       was    non    existent.            In m y     opinion          I feel     t hat     the    gate    had   to    be

                o p e n e d as     more    and more         people were            arriving         a n d we w e r e     gradually

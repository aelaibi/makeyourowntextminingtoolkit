          Re: Coaches

                        I have his statement tut not his questionaire which
                        I think will give his time of arrival in Sheffield
         PC Hall        Describes late arrival of coaches I think

         Caroline has found 4 coach drivers but they all arrived
         relatively early. Do we have any statements fran the managers
         of the finns eg Amberline as to the number of coaches and their
         arrival time. I am writing to Mr. Tootle and Ms Kermah both
         of vihcm have asked for seme evidence on caoch arrival to give me
         specific names but in the mean while I think it would be useful if
         we could find seme drivers who came on the late side. We might then be
         able to dispense with PC Hall.. I think that we might be able to produce
         the evidence of seme of the coach drivers as documentary evidence.
         The names of the four drivers are:




     ( I                                    '

         Finally I think wfe have had a letter frcm Hanmond Suddard re Mr. Seaman
         It enclosed a statement tut I cannot remember what has becane of either
         the letter or the statement. Can we see if we can retrive it?

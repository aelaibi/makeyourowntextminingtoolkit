You recently sent us a note on electronic
tagging which Lord Justice Taylor found very
helpful. In your note you said that you were
awaiting results on tests on tagging and Lord
Justice Taylor has asked wkk progress there has
been on evaluating the experiment.
I should be grateful if you would let us have a
note giving us the up to date position as soon
as possible which I can show Lord Justice
Taylor.

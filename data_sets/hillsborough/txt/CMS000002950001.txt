MEETING 3RD MAY - HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP (HFSG)

I enclose, as requested, briefing material for Lord Ferrers to
meet the HFSG. I gather that the meeting will take place in the
'television interview room' at the House of Lords; and that
pre-meeting briefing will be 1000 here in QAG.   I shall attend
both meetings as will Mr Smith, F8. Mr Mould will accompany me
at the meeting with the HFSG.

2.   If Lord Ferrers is content perhaps we can deal with the
police issues first at the 1000 meeting.

BACKGROUND BRIEFING


MEETING - 3 MAY: WITH HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP


INTRODUCTION


Lord   Ferrers will     recall that Mr Robert Hughes MP wrote to
Mr Brandon     Bravo    asking    Home     Office    Ministers     to     meet
Mr Trevor Hicks and members of this group.           Lord Ferrers replied
(see Annex A ) .


MR HICKS


Mr Hicks lost two teenage daughters at Hillsborough.                    He has
since been active in the Hillsborough Family Support Group of
which he is the chairman.


Annex B is a newspaper article which provides more background
information     about   Mr   Hicks.      Our   limited   contact   with    him
suggests he is a sensible, level headed individual deserving of
a sympathetic hearing.        He gave evidence to Lord Justice Taylor
(see Annex C) .


HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP (HFSG)


This Group has had a number of meetings with MPs at Westminster
including the Leader of the Opposition.


The HFSG is understood to be voluntary group to help victims and
their families, and to lobby for them.              The objectives of the
group are    summarised      at Annex D.       Secretary to the HFSG is
Mr Barry Devonside who         is understood     to have   lost    a son at
Hillsborough.      He will accompany Mr Hicks as will Mrs Sefton and
a Mr Pemberton on whom we have no information.
ITEMS FOR DISCUSSION


No advance information is held about specific issues which the
group      wish   to   raise.   They   may   however    be    critical   of   S.
Yorkshire police and Chief Constable Wright.             The group are also
likely to raise


        a)    what the Government is doing to achieve all seated
              accommodation at football grounds;


        b)    the arrangements for setting up the Football Licensing
              Authority;


        c)    safety standards, particularly pitch perimeter fencing.


CORONERS INQUEST


The subject of the inquest may be raised.             Lord Ferrers may wish
to know that the present stage of the Inquest will be adjourned
on 4 May, when the medical causes, place and time of death of
the victims will have been established.                The inquest will not
risk prejudicing police inquiries.             (Mr Hicks should be aware of
this). Details of the police investigation are described below.


POLICE INVESTIGATION


Line to take


Hillsborough tragedy shocking for everybody - terrible loss for
the bereaved, who all have our deepest sympathy.


In relation to the main inquiry all questions of blame must be
very carefully investigated - that I am afraid takes time and
must be completed before any comment can be made.


On   the     specific    complaint   against    Mr   Wright   I gather    that
Mr Sharp visited you (Mr Hicks) and Mr Devonside and Mr Hammond
within the last week to explain his conclusions.               I do hope this
was helpful, and that it indicated the care and thoroughness with
which all this must be examined.


Background note


The main policy inguirv. by West Midlands Police, centres on any
possible criminal actions by South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield
Wednesday      football   club,    Sheffield      city    council   and    their
advisors,    or disciplinary matters in relation to the police.
While   each    element   is being examined        in    its own right,      all
aspects are inter-related and there is close co-operation between
the police conducting the investigation, the Director of Public
Prosecutions, and the Police Complaints Authority.


The initial      (very detailed)    assessment of evidence is nearing
completion and interviews with those directly involved on 15
April 1990 will shortly begin.            No conclusions on criminal or
disciplinary matters are likely for some time - perhaps three
months or more.


Separate     police   inquiries     are   being    pursued     personally     by
Mr Sharp. Chief Constable of Cumbria, concerning the involvement
of senior police officers of ACPO rank (Assistant Chief Constable
and above)     - ie Mr Jackson, the then ACC             (operations)    and the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Mr Wright.                Consideration of
Mr Jackson's actions may be on a similar timescale to the main
inquiry.     Mr Sharp has also recently take charge of all police
investigations related to Hillsborough.


Mr   Sharp   has however    just completed his           investigations     into
alleged remarks bv Mr Wright which were reported in the press
as being critical of supporters, eg for being drunk.                    This has
cleared Mr Wright of any impropriety in this matter: essentially
because the press reports were exaggerated from the more cautious
words spoken by Mr Wright - a tape recording of the interview,
by the journalist concerned, was crucial in establishing this.
Although entirely outside his obligations, Mr Sharp decided (with
the agreement of Police Complaints Authority) to visit Mr Hicks.
Mr Devonside and Mr Hammond who had made the complaint against
Mr Wright - all three are from the Hillsborough Family Support
Group - to explain why Mr Wright had been exonerated.                 These
visits took place in the last few days.             A bland statement in
writing along might well have been painful to the complainants
and hard to understand.


The suggestion for the visits was compassionate and touching,
and    Mr   Hicks   greatly   appreciated   this   initiative     (Mr Sharp
visited him on Monday 30 April) .           He agrees that no blame for
the press reports lies with Mr Wright.              Indeed,    he commented
that this was the first time he had been "treated like a human
being"      (by officialdom).      This may therefore be an opportunity
for Lord Ferrers to emphasize that those investigating the case
are very      sympathetic     to   the bereaved,   but   are   also tightly
constrained in what they can say until their work is complete.


ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION


The Group's view on all seater stadia is not known but it is
likely to be favourable.


Line   to take:     the Government      support the recommendation      for
football league grounds and see all seated accommodation as a
significant step towards improving conditions for spectators.
We expect clubs to make the first steps.           The Football Licensing
Authority will monitor the position and the provisions of the
Football Spectators Act 1989 will be used to enforce the changes,
if that proves necessary.


FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY


The concept of the FLA is likely to be supported by the Group
who may well press for early implementation.
Line to take on:-
a)    responsibility for the FLA is likely to become a Home Office
      responsibility now that the national membership scheme is
      not to be introduced;


b)    functions of the FLA will be:


      (i)     to   issue   licences      under    the    1989    Act    which     will
              contain,     as    necessary,    conditions       directed     by    the
              Secretary of State on seated accommodation; and


      (ii) to keep under review safety certification by local
              authorities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
              with power to amend safety certificates;


c)    commencement: the FLA will be set up on or after 1st June
      although it will be a little longer before it becomes fully
      operational;


d)    membership:- FLA membership is not finally decided but we
      envisage that it will comprise some people with relevant
      knowledge      or    technical      background       (eg    in    particular
      engineering, fire safety, policing of football matches) , and
      others with knowledge of the professional game or with other
      skills felt to be of value;


e)    staffing;      the FLA will also have an inspectorate.


SAFETY STANDARDS FOR FOOTBALL GROUNDS


The   group    may   press       for   government      action    to    set   minimum
standards at football grounds and the removal of pitch "barrier"
fencing.


Line to take:        Finally the FLA will keep under review safety
certificates       and    will    have   its     own    power    to    direct     that
particular conditions should be included in them.
The Green Guide is being revised in the light of Lord Justice
Taylor's recommendations ?


When that has been done we will ask Parliament to consider an
order   under   section    15A   of   the   1975   Act   to   implement
recommendation 24 of the Final Report, and which will require
local   authorities   to   address    particular   matters    in   safety
certificates;


Background Note: Recommendation 24 says that the Secretary of
State should exercise the power available to him so that safety
certificates must contain terms and conditions about the maximum
number of spectators, entrances/exits and crush barriers.


Pitch Perimeter Fencing


Line to take:- understand the concern.       The Final Report did not
recommend its removal.     The need for such fencing is for local
decision by the club in conjunction with the police and local
authority.   If it is not necessary to prevent disorder, it is not
required for safety purposes.

                                                   APPENDIX 6

                                             SPECIFIC INCIDENTS
Mr Hicks’ Evidence
   1. Mr and Mrs Hicks’ two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived early en famille but had tickets
for different sections. The two daughters had standing tickets; they went into pen 3. Mrs Hicks had a seat in the
north stand. Mr Hicks took up a standing position in pen I just below and to the west of the police box at about
2 .15 pm From there, he had a view of the centre pens. He kept an eye on them as they filled up since he knew his
daughters to be there.

  2. His evidence was that by 2.50 pm he could see people were in distress. At about 2.55 pm he and others
called to a senior police officer at the top of the steps to the control box to draw his attention to the crushing. Mr
Hicks was only about 10 feet from the officer. He described him as wearing a flat cap with gold or silver braid
and a light coloured anorak. Mr Hicks believed he was the officer who stopped the match. Mr Greenwood, who
did stop the match, was certainly not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can clearly be seen on the video.’

 ^3. Mr Hicks says that he and others shouted several times to this officer in attempts to alert him to the
distress in the pens. There was no reaction although Mr Hicks believes the officer must have been in earshot.

   4. That officer descended from the steps and two cameramen whom Mr Hicks believed were from
television came and appeared to direct their cameras towards the pens. Another senior officer appeared two
steps down from the platform. He was a stocky figure; he also wore a flat cap but with black braid. Mr Hicks
says that he and two or three others tried several times to capture this officer’s attention without success. Then
Mr Hicks says he shouted ForChrist ssake! Can’tyouseewhat’sgoingon?Wecan,andyouhavecameras”.The
officer is said to have replied dismissively “Shut your fucking prattle”.

  5. When the disaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. Victoria was put in an ambulance and Mr
Hicks accompanied her to hospital where she was found to be dead. Sarah died at the ground.

   6. Mr Hicks was an impressive witness and, despite his grievous loss, remarkably stoical. He gave his
evidence clearly and without rancour. He was certainly mistaken about Mr Greenwood being one of those on
the steps and it has not been possible to identify either officer from Mr Hicks’ descriptions. He may well also
have been imprecise as to timings. Nevertheless, I see no reason to doubt that what he described did occur in
relation to two officers. As Mr Hicks generously said himself, the dismissive abuse from the second officer
(although reprehensible) may have been due to his being preoccupied with trying to see what was happening at
pens 3 and 4 around kick-off time.
The Goalkeeper and Gate 4
   7. Mr Bambrock, a Liverpool supporter, said he went through the tunnel. He would have liked to have
turned back when he saw how crowded the pens were. He went with his father and 13 year old toother Stephen
towards the front of pen 4. He saw the teams come onto the pitch. Conditions at the front were, he said, alright
until about 2 minutes to 3. Then the pressure in the pen increased and he and his father became separated. His
feet came off the ground. He shouted to police officers through the fence to get them out and help them. The
police did not react. The Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, spoke to a policeman on the track. The gate
was then opened by a blonde policewoman and about 25 to 30 people went through it. They included the
witness’s father and his brother Stephen who had a broken arm. A police Constable shut the gate. It was then
reopened by the same policewoman, the witness thought, and he got out.

  8. Mr Eccleston, a male nurse and an impressive witness, was sitting in the north stand. He noticed pens 3
and 4 were full and realised something was wrong when fans started coming over the perimeter fence but did
not invade the pitch. He said the Liverpool goalkeeper appeared to notice this too.

 9. Mr Grobbelaar was out of the country during the Inquiry and was therefore not called. However he
made a statement which was put in as his evidence. In the course of it he said:-
  Kick-offhappened and we got into our stride pretty quickly - we forced a corner pretty early on and the ball
 came down to my end - I rolled it out to the full back once and play went on until Peter Beardsley hit the
 crossbar of the Nottingham Forest goal from a corner and came back into play. I remember just after that
 there were shouts and screams from the crowd just behind me, it was different; not the ordinary crowd noise
 and I turned around to look. What amazed me first was the concentration and squash of fans in the centre

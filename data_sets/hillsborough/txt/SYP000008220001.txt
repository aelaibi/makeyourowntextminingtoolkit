  I ended                       up     in b e t w e e n          two    railing             fences    which        I would           s a y was        only

  about                    9    feet        apart,          I can't          recall          being    pushed        through           any       open       g ate

  to           get             to    this        position.

      I have                   been       shown        a    plan       of    the       Leppings       Lane        terraces           and       from       t hat

  hand                 fence.

  I was                    subjected              to       one    continual              crush,      just        getting        squashed and

  s q u a s h e d , and                      squashed/there                      didn't       appear        to    be a n y      particular                surge

      involved                      t hat                   recall .

  When                 I ended              up    in       this    narrow             pen    ( pen 5)       1 was       crushed           my    hands          were

  across                       my    c h est      there          was    a man          up a g a i n s t     me    facing        me    he a p p e a r e d

  alright,                          I was        facing          the    pitch,           behind      t he    man who         was      pushed          up

  against                       me    was        another          man who             was    also    facing        me,    I can't              remember

  what                 this          other        man       looked          like       other       than     his    eyes      were         closed          a n d he

  was              just             being        bobbed around                   in the       crush,        I can't       say        if    t his      m a n was

  dead                 but          it j u s t        seemed       stange             that    his    e yes       were    closed.               I can't

      recall                   if his        colour          was       unusual.

  On           the             opposite           side       of    the       railings          I was        pushed       up a g a i n s t        I could

  see              that             the     terraces             were       fairly          clear    with        plenty      of      room,       there          was

  a m an who                         was     on       that       side who             had    put    his     knee    through           the       railings

      f or         people              to    stand          on    to    use       as     a step      to     climb       o ver     the      railings             to

  escape                       the     crush.

^ I        climbed                   over        the       railings          using          this    mans     knee       and when           I got          o ver

  I did                    the       same        to    help       other          people       over    from        the    crush.

  When                 I was           involved             in    the       crush        I wasn't         with     anyone         I k n e w as            we    had

  been                 seperated                 as    a    result          of    th e      crush    in the        tunnel.

At    the     e n d1 of     the      pen    I was       in the jMfrrow              one     (Pen 5)       there       was    a

could       see     he w a s       down     by    the       w a 11    trying       to    pul 1 b a c k    the    perimeter

fencing.            I remember             this    because           a man        by me    was     shouting       about          the

police        not     doing        anything        and       I pointed            out    the    policeman        to    him.

The    only       thing      t hat     I can       say was           a     factor       in the     deaths       and    injuries

was    the      crush.

We    finally         left     the     ground          at    I think           about     4.30     pm we    left       of    our    own

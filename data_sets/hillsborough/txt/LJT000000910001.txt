                                              OPENING STATEMENT
                                                                                   2
Lord Justice Taylor:

       As   the whole         nation    knows,         there        was    on   the      15th April       a

horrendous      disaster at Hillsborough Football stadium in                               this     city.

95    people    lost       their    lives     and many            were    injured.       I have        been

appointed       by    the    Home     Secretary          to       hold    an    inquiry       into      the

disaster.         I   wish    first     to    express          my    deepest       sympathy       to    the

bereaved and injured.               In saying that I am sure that I also speak

for everyone associated with this inquiry.                                My terms of reference

are as follows:-
      "To enquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on
      15th April 1989 and to make recommendations about the needs of crowd
      control  and safety    at sports grounds".

Although I      alone am responsible for the conduct of the inquiry,                                   for

making recommendations and preparing the report,                                 I shall have           the

welcome assistance            of two     assessors.               Sitting on        my             ^.s Mr

Brian Johnson,         the Chief        Constable of Lancashire.                      On my              1s


Professor Leonard            Maunder,    Professor            of Mechanical           Engineering in

the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.                             I am very grateful to them

for    agreeing        to    assist      me       with        their       expert      knowledge        and

experience.

       Toda y's proceedings            are    by way         of     preliminary hearing.                The

objects     are       to    indicate     the       nature           of    the    Inquiry      and      the

procedures I propose to follow.                     As already announced,                 I will also

consider applications from parties wishing to be represented.

       First,     as to      the character of                the Inquiry.          It is not a law

suit in which one party wins and another loses.                                  It is not akin to

the legal process of a criminal or civil court.                                 No one is on trial

or being sued here.                This is an          Inquiry to discover,               first,       what

happened,      secondly,      why    it happened and thirdly,                    what lessons

these issues I shall of course consider them and make any necessary

finding.         But       it        is not       the jiriimnwy              purpose      of   the   enquiry     to

apportion blame.                 I hope therefore,                 that everyone concerned both at

the enquiry           and outside                it will         play tneir
                                                                      their parts responsibly                   and

without rancour.                 I want to find the facts and learn from them.^ It

would be a further tragedy if that constructive purpose were to be

prejudiced by emotive accusations and counteraccusations.

         Secondly, the scope and length of the Inquiry.                                               Because of

the    numbers        at    the        ground       and      the       intense       public      reaction,      the

number     of        potential              witnesses         runs          into    thousands.         The     West

Midlands     Police         who        are,       through         their Chief             Constable    Mr    Dear,

directly responsible to me for conducting                                          the investigation,         have

launched a massive exercise to gather the evidence.                                              There has also

been     a spontaneous response from the public.                                       I have already read

hundreds of letters.                    It is vital that all relevant evidence should

be made available.                     But it is equally important that this enquiry

should     be    conducted              as       speedily              as    possible,         consistent     with

thoroughness, so that recommendations can be made and action taken

promptly        to    avoid           danger       in       the    future.          Accordingly,       the    oral

evidence before the Inquiry must be kept within bounds. There will

be many many witnesses who will not be called because their account

does not        add to          evidence already                  given.           Those not called          should

not feel aggrieved.                    Their statements will have been considered and

their points noted.

       The      task       of        preparing      and          presenting         the    evidence     will    be

Bernard Phillips.              They are         instructed by the               Treasury         Solicitor

and their role will be one of strict impartiality.                                     4 11 witnesses

who give oral evidence are to be regarded as called on my behalf in

order    to     elicit     the     facts    and      not    as     called       by    any    particular

party.        Although for the most part Counsel to the Inquiry will call

and examine the witnesses,                 where a witness is represented he wj-11

be called by his own advisors.                       No witness shall be called to give

evidence unless he or she has first given a written statement. Once

a witness has been examined there will be an opportunity for cross-

examination         but    ‘ati&h cross-examination                will   be      subject         to   such

limits as I think it necessary to impose.

        If and when any allegation is made against a person or body,

that    person       or   body     should       be    informed       of   the        allegation.         The

substance of the evidence supporting it will be given                                       so that the

person    or     bodyma^— be— -able— fe© deal               with     it by       cross-examination

o^evidence.         Accordingly Counsel              to the Inquiry will see that                        this

procedure is carried out,                                                   .

        The    first      phfase    o f » tne    Inquiry will         concentrate            upon      what

happened on the 15th April and why.                         That part of the Inquiry will

be held in public unless for any reason,                           which I do not at present

foresee,       it    should    become      necessary        to depart           from    that      course.

The second phase of the Inquiry will relate to the considerations

bearing upon what- ought to- be recommended^for the future.                                       I shall

give directions later               as to how        that part of           the Inquiry will               be

conducted.          I appreciate that there will inevitably be some overlap

of   evidence        bearing       upon    the    two      phases.        I     shall       be    glad     to

receive as soon as possible any written submissions from any source

        I    turn    now     to     representation.                    It    is       entirely          within    my

discretion as to which pflart-Apc^ are allowed to be represented at the

oral    hearing.           Since     this    is not              litigation            there       are    strictly

speaking no parties.                However,       it is right that certain persons or

bodies should         be     allowed to       be       represented                 so that         they     may be

able to       cross-examiney®*®             lead evidence               and make          submissions.              I

would       expect    representation              to be           by lawyers             although          I would

consider other forms of representation where appropriate.

        A   person     or    body     wishing          to    be    represented             must          show   good

cause.       I must be satisfied that the person or body has an^interest

       Inquiry       which as       a matter       of fairness               requires protection                   by

such representation.                If a number of persons have such an interest

but for present purposes there is no discernible difference between

their       interests,        I     would    not        be disposed              to     grant        separate

representation.             The correct course would be for them to be jointly

represented by             one advocate       or team.                 Any       decision I make                today

about       representation          will    not        be    final.          I    will     be      prepared       to

entertain an application for representation at any time.                                                 It may be

that a party will only wish to be represented at a later stage in

the Inquiry.           It may be           that some             parties are             undecided         whether

they    wish     to be       represented          or       not)    they          may    wait       to    see    what

emerges.         I    will    deal    with     later             applications            in     the      light    of

circumstances as they develop.

        I    should        stress    that          if a           person          does     not       wish to      be

represented but merely wishes                     to make his evidence available to the

Inquiry      the     correct      course     is     for          him   to        submit    a statement            or

offer to make one in written form as soon as possible.                                              I emphasise

that    during       the    first    phase     of       the       Inquiry         what        is   required       is

             I     should            say            a word           about       costs.           There                  are no        statutory

provisions governing                                     this     Inquiry,          but        the     Secretary of                     State     is

able to meet the costs incurred by any person for the purposes of

the          Inquiry.                He          will       look         to me           to    assess             costs          and    to    make

recommendations to him.                                          I propose             at      the end               of        the Inquiry        to

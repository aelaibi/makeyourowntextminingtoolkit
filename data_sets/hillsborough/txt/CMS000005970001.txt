Thank you for your letter of 18 October inviting myself and
colleagues to attend a presentation about the National Plan for
Stadia on 26 November.

I am afraid that the Minister will not be able to attend,
however, both myself and Tony Baden from the DES and Roger Miles
and David Peters from the Home Office will be happy to join you.
I should point out, however, that I may only be able to attend
the afternoon session.

It would be helpful if you could let us know in advance of the
presentation the main topics to be covered by your consultants
during the two main sessions.
Yours sincerely

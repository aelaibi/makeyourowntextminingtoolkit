been helping with the injured and a group of Liverpool fans grabbed!

I,    STUART     ROWLAND THORPE of
               WILL SAY as FOLLOWS:


I was born on                  I am employed as a fork lift
truck driver by                                I have been a
steward for 22 years at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and
for the last 15 years have been Chief Steward for the West
Stand.

I     am    in overall charge of the stewards and gate           men   at    the
West       Stand.     Mr Albert Marsh is the Assistant       Chief     Steward
and        is normally responsible for the gate men at B and C              gates
and the stewards who are positioned at the bottom of the
stairsleading to  the West Stand seated area. In the seated
area there are six gangways known by the letters U, V, W, X, Y
and Z.There is a steward   for each gangway. Normally, there
are 26 staff in total in attendance at the West Stand area
excluding           the     turnstile   operators   for   whom   I     am     not
responsible.          This arrangement has remained for about the            last
three years.

It is normal for stewards and gate men to turn up at least two
hours before    a match, but for an important match it may  be
necessary to attend four hours before the kick-off.


I     am responsible for paying the stewards and gatemen. When the
stewards        and gatemen arrive they hand over their passes and              I
also take a ticket from their booklet. I keep the jackets in
a cupboard in the snack bar at the rear of the West Stand
seated area.   Before the end of a match the stewards and
gatemen hand back their jackets and I provide them with their
passes and their payment for the match. I have a radio to
enable        me to       keep in contact with Doug Lock, the Club Security
Officer.         If       there   is any crowd trouble or injuries in         the
crowd        I would radio Doug Lock to inform him of the            situation.
I would also obtain the assistance of the nearest Police
Officer.   If there are insufficient numbers of stewards, I
would also contact Doug Lock by radio.

For FA Cup matches, stewards and gatemen must be in attendance
at least four hours before the kick-off.

Before the commencement of each season, the stewards and gate
men attend a meeting at Hillsborough.      Registration takes
place when the stewards and gatemen are provided with passes
containing their photographs. Briefing also takes place with
regard to evacuation procedures, ticket systems, and each
steward   or gateman is issued with a document known as
"Instructions for Match Day Staff". Representatives from the
Fire Brigade and Police are present to take part in the
briefing.


The   evacuation     procedures    are   important   particularly     with
regard to any fire and we are informed as to the code                which
will be broadcasted over the public address system.                   This
briefing has only occurred in recent seasons and no           doubt     is
as a result of the Bradford fire disaster.

We    are told what to do in the event of an evacuation and           also
where     thefire extinguishers are kept      in the   Ground.   I      do
brief     the stewards under my control on a regular basis       as     to
the     positions of the fire extinguishers in the West Stand.           I
do not do this for every match, but it is done on            a   regular
basis and certainly before any big match.

The task of the stewards is to direct spectators to their seats
and     to assist them where possible together with complying with
the     evacuation    procedure.    The gatemen are    responsible     for
ensuring     that    the gates are manned at all times to allow        the
Police and other officials access to the ground, to open the
gates   in the event of an emergency, and to open the gates
shortly before the end of a match.
                                           - 3 -



    Both   the gatemen and stewards are not responsible                         for
    controlling crowds inside the ground or for dealing with                    any
    problems of crowd violence or misbehaviour. The Police                      are
    responsible for such matters.


    On    match days either Albert or myself picks up the            keys      from
    the main        office area to check whether B and C gates are
    unlocked.        Normally we find that the gates are unlocked.  The
    caretaker       is              Lnd he goes round in the morning to
    unlock the gates to the ground. I normally take up position to
    the right hand side of the seated area near the fire escape if
    of course I am not walking around the West Stand supervising
    and dealing with any problems that may arise.


    Before the match is over, I am responsible for paying                       the
    stewards and once the match is over I am also responsible                   for
    ensuring that the West Stand is clear of any supporters. About
    ten minutes before the end of the match the gates are opened.
    It is not normal to keep the away fans behind for a period of
    time as often happens at many other grounds. The West Stand
    has     for    the last few years been used only for away           fans    and
    the    access       ways     leading to the West Stand area do      not    lead
    directly       to    other    access   ways serving other   parts     of    the
r   ground.

    I now turn to my involvement in the events which took place                   on
    15th April 1989 at Hillsborough. I left work at about 10                    am,
    having worked since 6 am doing overtime. I walked to                        the
    ground which took about 20 minutes. I picked up my radio and
    made my way to the West Stand. I was told at the previous
    match by Doug Lock that ten temporary stewards were reporting
    to me for the FA Cup semi-final. He also told me that all the
    stewards had to arrive for the semi-final by 11 am and I told
    my stewards this at the previous match.


    I     was     told by the Chief Steward in the North Stand          by     radio
that two Liverpool stewards were arriving and that 7 or 8 more
would be coming.    The two stewards are known as the Lloyd
brothers and attended the ground for the semi-final held the
previous year.   It is also common practice for the Lloyd
brothers to travel with the Liverpool supporters attending
away matches, and they were obviously well known to the
Liverpool supporters.   During the 1988 semi final, the Lloyd
brothers  had stewarded the terrace with about 6         other
Liverpool stewards.

My     intention was to do the same this year.            The Lloyd brothers
duly turned up and we chatted together for about 10 minutes.                  I
know    them     both quite well and we are on very friendly             terms.
After about 10 minutes another 7 or 8 Liverpool stewards joined
us.   At that time I was standing with the Lloyds at the bottom
of the steps nearest to C gate. These stewards asked if they
could also steward the stand, but I explained that my stewards
had already been allocated to the stewarding of the stand, and
that     they     (the Liverpool stewards) were needed to look            after
the     terraces       as   before.   I realised that all       the   Liverpool
stewards     would have prefered to work the stands, but I am sure
that they accepted the position and realised why I would not be
prepared to send my stewards onto the terraces.

I arranged for six of the temporary stewards to take up
position with an experienced steward from each of the gangways
to     the seated area.         The Lloyd brothers        told me that a    lot
of   fans were coming from Liverpool without tickets. They also
said that they thought there was going to be a lot of trouble.
At   the previous year's semi-final held at   Hillsborough, the
Grand National was held the same day and a large number of
Liverpool     supporters had attended that event. The Grand
National was not held on the same day this year.


As     the stewards and gate men arrived, I issued the                steward's
jackets.        At about 11.30 am, a police inspector, whom I know by
sight     but     do    not   know by name, asked    me    to    assemble   the
stewards from the seated area. I do know that this police
inspector is nicknamed Captain Birdseye owing to his big
beard.   He took the names of the two stewards who would be on
the fire escapes. He told the stewards that if there was any
trouble they must fetch a police officer; they were not to get
involved.   He also explained that there was a different colour
ticket to the seats compared to the standing area.          The
inspector showed them the two types of ticket.

I did     mention to the police inspector that at the previous
year's    semi-final a number of police officers had stood in the
gangways which prevented the stewards from carrying out their
duties ie. to keep the gangways clear.     He confirmed that
police officers would not be standing in the gangways. I did
ask the Lloyd brothers to stay with me on the stand because I
and my own stewards had already experienced problems and alot
of abuse from the Liverpool supporters going into this stand.
Until the Lloyd brothers started to help us the Liverpool fans
had    refused        to    let us follow our usual practice           of   tearing
corners        off    the tickets as they enter the stands (to              prevent
the practice of tickets being thrown down to fans below).                        Once
the Lloyds were standing with us, we had no further problems in
persuading the fans from allowing us to tear the corners off.
This all took place at about 2.15 pm.


At     about     2.40 pm Malcolm Bain, one of the gatemen to C                  gate,
told     me     that more Liverpool stewards were trying to come                  in,
but he had stopped them. I said that was fair enough as I
suspected they simply wanted to get in to watch the game.
Apart from the Lloyd brothers, I never saw any Liverpool
stewards again after about 2.40 pm.


Everthing        went smoothly until about 2.30 pm.            From my position
at     the rear of the seated area at that time I was able to look
down     upon        the turnstiles behind the West Stand.             I could    see
the    build up of supporters outside.                 I went to the stewards by
the     two     sets       of   steps   leading   to    the   seated    area.     One
complained that there were no police nearby. I asked a senior
officer, I do not know who, to arrange for police to be in
attendance by these steps.     He arranged for four police
officers to be positioned at the bottom of each door leading
to the stairs. At about 2.45 pm i noticed supporters climbing
over the turnstiles. I saw the officers at the bottom of the
right hand steps (iethose nearest C gate) going over to stop
the     supporters,       andthey then proceeded to eject a number        of
them through C Gate.

At 2.50 pm C Gate was opened and there was a surge of
supporters who gained entry through the gate. I shouted to
the stewards at the bottom of the right hand steps to shut the
Gates     to those steps and to only let in those who showed          seat
tickets.   I could see that the stewards were suffering a lot
of verbal abuse    in the seated area. I went    over to the
stewards in the seated area including my two sons who were in
V and W gangways.


I     then   went to the bottom of the right hand steps. It was           at
that     point   that      C Gate was opened again and      there   was    a
massive      influx     of supporters.   I do not believe    that   anyone
could have stopped them. I said to the stewards at both sets
of steps that they must ensure the gates to the steps were
kept shut.   I had asked for these gates to be provided some
five to six years ago as I explained at that time the problem
of those with tickets for the standing area attempting to gain
access to the seated area. The police agreed with the                 idea
and the Club very soon afterwards installed the gates.


The police at the turnstiles were knocked to one side. I did
not   hear any request or     order forthe gate   to be opened,nor
did   I see who opened the gate.      I went upstairs to    the
stewards to make sure that they were allright.


One     police officer told me that I should tell the stewards            to
discard      their jackets as otherwise the stewards could expect a
                                   - 7 -


lot of abuse. The swearing was much worse than usual and the
police officers were being subjected to a great deal of abuse.
There were two to three officers for each turnstile for the
terraced area and I remember there were about 20 police
officers in total in position behind these turnstiles.    This
is quite normal for a big match.

I went off to tell the stewards in the seated area to remove
their jackets. This was at about kick-off time. I told them
to     roll   up the jackets and put them in their pockets.       Albert
Marsh    went      off to tell some of the stewards and   gatemen    the
same.

I remember going back to the bottom of the right hand steps.
Albert Marsh was present. Two of the stewards said they were
going to go onto the pitch as there was a lot of trouble. At
this stage none of us really knew what was happening.


After the game was stopped, my son came over to me and brought
along a Liverpool supporter. The Liverpool supporter said that
his brother was on the pitch. He was crying.     I took him down
to the pitch and noticed the chaos. There      were police and
supporters on the pitch. Some of my stewards went down onto
the pitch to try and help.


I    went     back to C Gate and noticed people   being   brought     out
through the central tunnel either injured or on ambulance
stretchers. Liverpool supporters were shouting and swearing as
they made their way out through this tunnel.     I went back
upstairs to the seated area.


There       were   about seven or eight youths, about 18 -   20     years
old,     pilfering the snack bar.     The girls in the snack bar were
involved in taking water onto the pitch. I told those youths
to clear off. However, they carried on and in the end I had
to fetch a police officer. They then disappeared. When the
officer went, they came back and told me they were going to
"get me". I ran down the stairs and told the                police    officer
what had happened.


The stewards then came down from the seated area as they were
very   frightened.  Some of the supporters had taken the
stewards' jackets from my cupboard in the snack bar which I
discovered later. I went back up the stairs, but noticed that
the gang of youths had gone. It was hard to see from the back
of the stand              what was happening below.  There were still
supporters in             the seated area. Many were drunk.  This was
easy to see as some were walking on seats and falling off.                     I
have never seen such drunkenness or bad behaviour before.

I have attended 13 semi-finals and this is the worst                   I    have
seen for people being drunk.


I    took my radio back to the club control room as I was advised
to do so by a police officer. The radio meant that I could be
easily identified as being an official of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club.


When I was at the bottom of the right hand steps and                        just
before I  took the radio back, Doug Lock  had spokento                      me by
radio       to     check that the stewards and gatemen      were     allright.
On     returning          from the club control   room,I went back     to    the
seated area which was more or less empty by then.     However,
pilfering was still taking place although by a different group
of people.

I    went        back downstairs.      I told my younger son to go home       so
that     he       could    tell my wife that we were allright.        By    this
stage       someone        had   heard on the radio that   there   were     five
reported          dead.      I   sent my other son home shortly    later.      I
also arranged for the temporary stewards to go home.     About
4.50 pm I went down to the pitch to see if I could do anything
to help.
It was still chaotic. By this stage about one-third of                      my
stewards had gone home. I felt helpless and was stunned                     by
what was happening around me.

The police shortly later started to leave the ground through B
Gate.   I asked a police officer if it was allright for me to
go home. He told me that there was nothing that could be done
and the West Stand was empty. I told all the remaining
stewards they could go home.

I   must    mention that at about 3.05 pm I realised          that    people
were starting to climb over the fences, but I did not realise
how serious the situation was. It has never happened before
that such numbers have entered through C Gate.


At last years semi final, I saw Police on the terraces. I
cannot remember how many.   They were underneath the West
stand. I noticed these Police Officers as I leant over the
front      of    the   seated   area.   These Police   Officers      were   in
position        well   before   kick off and indeed    were   in     position
shortly after the turnstiles opened at mid day. I also saw
three or four Police Officers at the entrance to the tunnel.
There were also Police Officers checking fans as they came
through the turnstiles. All the pens were open for the 1988
semi final.


I   witnessed the Police Officers at the entrance to the               tunnel
stopping fans from gaining access to the centre pens.    This
occurred at about 2.50 pm. The Police shut the doors to the
tunnel, the Police were then directing the fans to the wing
pens or the South West and North West pens. The doors were
kept   closed for about 10 minutes. I saw the doors closed and
opened by Police.


The     Police were not letting any fans down the tunnel even when
the     doors were opened again.        The Police at the doors went        to
the end of the tunnel to join the rest of the officers who were
deployed on the terrace side of the tunnel. I could see this
as I was chatting to the gatemen on C gate. I also saw Police
turning back fans who tried to go down the tunnel. The Police
only allowed fans back in who had been to the toilets.

I then went on my rounds to check that all the other stewards
were alright.    I did not go back again to see if the Police
Officers I have described were still in position. There were a
number of Police Officers by the snack bar to the South West
corner.   There was no barrier to prevent access to the South
West corner.    Nor were there Police on the gate to the
partition wall which was open, but I did deploy a steward on
that    gate. At last years semi final there were the same number
of stewards as this years semi final.


It is important to note that the Police accept responsibility
for the terraces. I have never deployed Sheffield Wednesday
stewards on the terraces as I could not expect any     of my
stewards to run the risk of injury or the threat of    injury
and    the    Police have made it clear that they     are   responsible
for the terraces. The Police system I have described for last
years semi final is also similar to that used for league
matches.   However, I have never seen Police Officers shut the
doors to the tunnel. I know that I have seen Police Officers
at league matches in positions at the entrance and to the rear
of the tunnel, as I have often chatted to them on occasion by
walking through the tunnel.


The    system is different in the sense that the Police         normally
seal off the South West pen by putting metal barriers in place
near the snack bar. A number of Police Officers, about 4 in
number, are put in position around the barriers. The gate to
the partition wall is kept shut, and Police Officers are put
behind it.         The fans are then channeled into the centre pens.


The    ground Police Inspector then tells me when he is about          to
remove       the    barrier   to the South West pen so as to   warn   the
                                     - 11 -


stewards    in case of any rush by fans for the steps leading                 up
to the seated area. The Police on the entrance to the tunnel
and the gate to the partition wall then direct fans to the
South West pen. Occasionally at big league games the South
West pen fills up. On those occasions, the ground Inspector
would then tell me that he was about to open the North West
pen.


Very often fans would come up to me to say they could not see
from the South West pen. I would then speak to the ground
Inspector to request that he open the North West pen. He would
listen but he did not always open the gate immediately.   Very
often he decided to wait to see if more fans were coming into
that area of the ground.


This ground Inspector            is the same Police Officer I have
described with a beard.          Normally he was positioned in the area
behind the turnstiles. He has been the ground Inspector                       for
the Leppings Lane area for the last 3 seasons.


Because of this practice I have always accepted the Police had
responsibility  for ensuring the pens were not over crowded. I
should     mention   that   when the fans were      channeled        into    the
centre pens     and then perhaps to the South West pen, and                 then
onto the North West pen if large numbers attended, it was
normal for only the staircase nearest to B gate to be left
open.  The away fans who had seat tickets could then gain
access  through turnstiles 11-16 and those standing could gain
access  through turnstiles A-G. However, the other staircase
was   never    locked.      It    was kept shut   and   6     stewards      were
allocated to the bottom of the staircase. It was necessary to
man the staircase in the event of any emergency.


I did ask the ground Inspector to open the South West and North
West pens depending upon the situation at a number of league
games.   He would often reply to the effect that it was his
responsibility       to     make    such   decisions,   and     it   was      my
                                               - 12 -


           responsibility to look after the seated area.


           This is the third season the West stand including the terrace
           has been allocated for away fans only. Before that, it was of
           course allocated between home and away fans. Again, the Police
           adopted a similar system of channeling fans into the centre
           pens,     and     when   full to    direct fans into the South West     pens.
           Prior to the West stand being allocated for away fans, the away
           fans gained access to the centre pens and South West pen
           together with about one third of the seated area through
           turnstiles A-G. Turnstiles 11-16 were for home fans taking up
           the remainder of the West stand. That system was in operation
           for something like 3 or 4 seasons and the only material change
           was     the     erection of the partition wall.   This   prevented    any
           mixing of home and away fans behind the West stand.


           Prior to these developments and the introduction of the pens,
           the West stand was an area for home and away fans where there
           no attempts made to segregate fans. However, since 1966 there
           has never been     to my     knowledge stewards deployedon the
           terraces.         The Police   have always deployed Officers    on   the
           terraces        and on the front and rear of the tunnel.   The numbers
           have of course varied.


(   '"'i   I must emphasise that whatever the police request me to do, I
           do.   I remember on 15th April that there were a lot of new
           officers as normally the same faces can be recognised. On this
           occasion I did not recognise many of the officers.


           This statement is to th^ best of my knowledge and belief.

                        Q. So your count of the number that you had between 2.40 and
                           3.10, the vast majority are in the 20 minute period from
                           2.40 and I think you calculated that at 600? - A. 600.

                                   MR. GLASGOW:    Thank you.

                        Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  YOu do that simply by putting
                    B        the tickets over that period in a pile and then counting
                             them or are you doing a running count in your head, or vliat?
                             - A. No by taking the tickets.

                                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        No other questions.   Thank you
                             very much.

                                   MR. GOLDSACK:    Sir, we now move on to Stewards.
                             Mr. Thorpe, please.


                                             STUART ROLAHD THORPE Called

                                              Examined by MR. GOLDSACK:

                        Q.   Mr. Stuart Roland Thorpe, is that right? - A. That        is correct.
                    D
                        Q.   Mr. Thorpe, I think for some 15 years now you have been Chief
                             Steward for the West Stand area? - A. That is quite correct.

                        Q.   And     altogether you have been a Steward at Sheffield Wednesday
                             for over 20 years? - A. Yes, that is correct.

                        Q. In recent years how many Stewards have you had under your
                           control on normal league matches? - A. 26.

                        Q. And how many do you have under your control for a semi-final?
                           - A. 33.  I have ten extra Stewards.

                        Q. Who arranges for those extra Stewards? - A. The Club. I
                           notify the Club.  I get the extra Stewards and then I let
                           the Club know I have got the extra Stewards.

                        Q. So you personally recruit them? - A. That is right.

                        Q. Will they all be people who have stewarded before? - A. This
                           year I had just one new one.  The rest of them have stewarded
                           before.

                        q . Was -the new one Mr. Cardwell? - A. That is correct.

                        Q. He had never stewarded before that particular match? - A. IIo.

                        Q. How again in recent years I think there has been an annual
                           meeting sometime during the closcd season for Stewards? -
                           A. That is quite correct.

                    H   Q. Have you attended all of those? - A .         x have.



J. L. Harpham Ltd
                                   S- TKORPE


Are they voluntary? - A- They are voluntary, yes.

Are you paid for attending? - A. That is right, yes.

Have you been paid for attending since they came in or were
they originally unpaid? - A. They were paid after the first
league match they paid us for attending the meetings.

What proportion of the Stewards do in fact go to that
meeting? - A. The turnstiles and the ground go to one day
and the set meeting is all the seating, North Stand, South
Stand, West Stand go to it.

So there are two separate meetings? - A. Yes.

Do you attend both? - A. No, I only attend the one meeting.

Nov; who is invited? Is it just the 26 regulars or are
there temporary Stewards also invited? - A. They are all
invited to the meeting.

So of the 33 or so that you may have under your control how
many of those usually come to the Annual Meeting? - A. They
all*come to the Annual Meeting.  They have got to do because
they get their passes and you have got to take two photos,
for the identity card you wear.

I think it is at that meeting that you are also issued with
the Ground Instructions.  Is that right? - A. That is r.'-ght.

V7e will perhaps come on to those in a little while. Do
you also receive at that meeting a talk from a member of
the Club? - A. Yes.

Uho normally gives that? - A. Doug Lock.

From a Police Officer? - A. And a Police Officer gives us
a lecture; also the Fire Brigade and the St. John's Ambulanc
Brigade.  The Fire Brigade demonstrate the fire extinguisher
all the types of fire extinguishers and they always ask the
Stewards where the fire points are in ray Stand and I always
tell them where they are and show them v/here they are and
the Fireman generally as}« what type the fire extinguishers
are and he always demonstrates them to us.

Does the Fire Brigade representative also deal with the
emergency evacuation procedure? - A. Yes.

Now as the Chief Steward for the West Stand is the Leppings
Lane terrace under your control? - A. No.

 Under which Steward is   that? - A. There are no Stewards in
 charge of the standing   area, the Leppings Lane.  I am just
 in charge of eight men   on C gate and B gate. There is
 three men on each gate   and I am in charge of the West Stand
 only.

                         Q. In the event of a fire or some other emergency in the V7est
                            Stand, do you have a procedure whereby your Stewards
                            know what position to take up to get people out quickly?
                            - A. Yes.

                                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You have left rae behind slightly.
                              You dealt with the Annual Meeting at which various things
                     B        happened.  You said there were two meetings.   Is that right?

                                    !1R . GOLDSACK: What the witness said was that one
                              of the meetings was for the Stewards and there was a separate
                              meeting for the turnstile attendants, as I understood it.

                                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         I see.

                         C.         MR. GOLDSACK:   So do we understand this to be the
                              position, Hr. Thorpe, that there is no one from the Club
                              who assists with the evacuation from the standing area in
                              the event of an emergency? - A. Mo, the Police always do it.
                              The'call a name over the Tannoy, we all know what it is.
                              It"is in the South Yorkshire, all Clubs in South Yorkshire
                              come under it. I just forget
                                                       —     — the    name.
                                                                ----- ------- - ~ My   Stewards they*
                                                                                   -mi --
                              clear the gangways; go   to  the    fire    extinguishers      and the
                     D        Police go to the  gates.    We  open    all     the   gates  and the Police
                              opens everything,  we stand    on   one   side.       That  is what 'we
                              co. That is what the procedure is.

                         Q. Even though you say it is not part of your responsibility,
                            can I just see what your understanding is as the means
                            of evacuating the West end terrace if there is an emergency?
                            - A. Yes.

                         Q. Where did you expect people to go? How were they going to
                            leave? - A. Go through C Gate and B Gate.

                         Q.   That is on the roadway? - A. Yes.

                         q   . Sorry, how are they going to get off the terraces in the
                               first place? - A. Well they get off the terraces, there is
                               the gate on the perimeter fence. There is a Policeman
                               stood at the side of those gates and those gates are opened
                               onto the pitch.  There is always a Policeman stood at every
                               gate all the way round the pitch.

                         Q. Some of course would be able to cone back down the tunnel,
                            wouldn't they? - A. Yes.

                         Q. But your understanding as Chief Steward of the West Er.d
                            was that the main point of evacuation was the perimeter
                            gates onto the pitch? - A. That is right.

                          Q. Which are manned by Police Officers not Stewards? - A.
                             Right throughout the game there is a Police Officer sat
                             in front of one of those.

                        Q. Now you knov/ of course that there are gates at the Stand
                           end of the radial fences? - A. Yes.

                        Q. Have you ever considered they are any part of the emergency
                           evacuation procedure? - A. No, because they are nothing to
                           do with me whatsoever.  I   have never been   told bydown-
                           stairs. All my interest is the West Stand.    I    amin charge
                           of the West Stand and is my responsibility for anyone in
                    B      that West Stand to be cleared out.

                        Q. I follow you say it is not part of your responsibility.
                           What I am wondering is whether as someone with 20 years *
                           experience as a Steward, you had ever appreciated that the
                           gates at the rear of the radial fences night be part of the
                           emergency evacuation procedure? - A. Well it could be sir
                           but the Police see to all that.

                        Q. You certainly thought the        main exits were the perimeter
                           gates? - A. Yes.

                        Q. 'Was that just something you had picked up over the years
                            or had someone told you that? - A. Since the last three
                            years since the Bradford Disaster that is when it more
                    D      or less started procedure on the ground, fire and so forth.

                        Q. I am not quite sure what you mean by that, Mr. Thorpe.
                            At your Annual Meetings has it actually been said in the
                            event of an emergency people on the terraces ’./ill leave
                            via the perimeter gates on to the pitch? - A. Yes, well
                            it is automatic, you see them opening the gates the Police
                          ' from out of my Stand.

                        Q.    Who has said that at the Annual Meeting?    - A. Mr.Lock.

                        Q.    That the way out from the terraces in     an emergency are
                             the perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

                        Q. Has it been the same Police Officer who has attended the
                            Annual Meeting over the last two or three years? - A. Yes,
                            the last tv/o years it has been.

                        Q.    Who is that, do you know? - A. I have     no idea.

                        Q. Mr. Sewell? - A. That is right.

                        Q.    And before him   was it Mr. Calvert? - A. Yes.

                        Q.    I think he was there for several years? - A.     Yes.

                        q   . now what sort of things do the Police tell you at the
                              Annual Meeting? - A. Well it is more or less instructions
                              in the back of our passbook, “don't get involved1'.

                        Q.     I wonder if we could just look at that then.  It is the

                                                                        S. THORPE


                                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Whilst that is being found,
                              Ihave got  a figure of 376 Stewards from somewhere.   Is
                              that a complete nonsense?

                                    MR.- MAXWELL: I gave you that figure, sir.  It cam a
                              from past Police documentation.  I think it is their
                              background material.
                     B                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          I seem to remember reading
                              there    were 376 Stewards on        duty on the day.

                                      M R . MAXWELL:   Yes.

                                     MR. GOLDSACK:  Sir, I will be corrected if I am
                              wrong.   I think that includes turnstile attendants and I
                              think when Hr. Thorpe refers to 26 and 33, he is not
                              including turnstile attendants at the West End.
    r
                                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  There will only be about 73
                              turnstile operators, will there, all round the around?

                                    MR. GOLDSACK:  I think we will hear, if it is
                              necessary, that there are many more Stewards at the Kop
                     D        endwhere of course Stewards are on the Kop itself.

                                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  This is what I was wondering,
                              whether this witness is only talking about one part of the
                              ground.

                                      HR. GOLDSACK:  Yes, he is only talking about the
                              ’VJest Stand and the immediate concourse.

                         Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Forgive me, are you the           Chief
                               Steward or a Chief Steward? - A. A Chief Steward.

                         Q.          MR. GOLDSACK:  That point having been raised,
                               Mr. Thorpe, can I just clarify for whom you are responsible,
                               You have responsibility for Stewards in the West Stand
                               itself? - A. That is quite correct.

                         Q. For Stewards on B Gate and C Gate? - A. That is quite
                            correct.

                         Q. And for Stewards who man the stairways to the Uest Stand?
                            - A. That is quite correct. _

                         Q. Is there anyone else for whom you have responsibility?
                            - A. Ko.

                         Q. V.’e shall hear in due course that the Stewards in charge
                            of A Gate in fact come under a different Chief Steward?
                            - A. That is quite correct.

                         Q. Do you now have in front of you, Mr. Thorpe, page 46 of

                                                            S. THORPE


                        Q. That is, I think, a three page document headed:   "Instructions
                           for Match Day Staff"? - A. Yes.

                        Q. Ana you are all issued with that, are you, at the Annual
                           Meeting? - A. We are told about this at the Annual Meeting
                           and they give me copies to give to my Stewards at the start
                           of the season.  I give my Stewards one and I make them sign
                           for it to say that he has had the instructions, match day
                    B      instructions.

                        Q. Is it the matters set out in that that the Police Officer goes
                           through? - A. Yes, more or less he goes through.

                        Q. Can I take you back a few years,Hr. Thorpe, to about 1931.
                           There was a crushing incident in 1981? - A. Well it was not
                           really a crushing incident.   They were getting a lot outside.
                           The queues were getting long outside the ground. VJhat th«y
                           did they opened C Gates about a yard.   I got my three
     (                     Stewards; they came from the office if we could let a few-
                           through to take the congestion of the queues. There was
                           about 50 came through the gates. We checked the tickets
                           and they came through orderly, there was no trouble. ‘ What
                           they did, they put thera up at the side of the vail, the
                           Police on horseback and they just came in about 50 to take
                    D      the congestion from the crowd outside and they started
                           coming in very steady.   We shut the gates after that. There
                           was only ±>out 50 what was allowed in and I remember it •
                           because it was the last semi-final for a while because
                           Hillsborough District, round Hillsborough Football Ground,
                           a lot of people were complaining about semi-finals, crowds,
                          -drunk people and things like that.   They got a petition up
                           and they did not get a semi-final until 1987 and I was
                           amazed we got a semi-final because the people around in the
                           houses round the Club were complaining:   "You will never
                           get a semi-final".   There was petitions and everything to
                           the M .P .s .

   1981 semi-final, shortly before the kick-off, stewards on
   gate C opened that, in effect, as an additional turnstile?
   A. Yes.
Q. And people came in in an orderly fashion?              A. T h a t ’s right.
Q. But was there not then an incidnet on the South end of the
   Terrace whe n people were injured?  A. No, not to my
   knowledge. I can't remember it.
Q. 38 people injured?     A. No, I can't remember.             I can't
   remember that.
Q. No recollection of that at all?           A. No recollection, I'm
   sorry, sir.
Q. Does it follow, then, that that incident, if there was ati
   incident, was never m e n t i o n e d at any meeting that you
   attended?   A. No. I can't remember, if it was.
Q. All right.   Do you remember that in about 1981 there was
   either some confusion or disagreement between the stewards
   and the police as to what their specific responsibilities
   were?   A. Well, there was, yes.
Q. You remember that?        A.        I remember that.
Q. And do you recalll a particular meeting where a police officer
   came along to try and explain, "This is our job, this is
  'your job"?   A. I can slightly remember it. I think it
   was in the Gymnasium.
Q. Would it have been Hr. Calvert?            A. I just forget now.
Q. But you have some r e co llection - - -       A. I have some recollection
   of that.
Q. --   of such a meeting?        A. Yes.
Q. Can you help as to what that policeman told you he thought
   the stewards' job was?    A. He said on the terracing, when
   I was with a few of my stewards, he said "It's nothing to
   do with us, because it's the West Stand, my Stand", and he
   was saying that the terracing was the Club's --
Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I am sorry, I am not following
      this.   I thought it was the policeman who was speaking?
     A. The policeman spoke to a crowd of us in the Gym.
Q. What did he say?   A. He says that the Club's job is to
   see to the terracing, the stewards to see to the terracing,
   the spectators on the terraces, and I thought to myself,
   "It's nothing to do with me, this, because I'm in charge
   of the seating accommodation", and I said "Well, it's
                                 36


                                                S. THORPE

     ridiculous." W h e n I w a l k e d away from it, some stewards
     objected to it, but I don't k n o w w ho did, and when I walked
     away I said "It's silly to put a person, put a steward
     amongst away supporters for abuse and swearing that they
     get.    I said, 'We -get it in our Stand. They've only
     got to sit in the wrong seat and you go to them and you
     say 'You are in the wrong seat' and then you get abuse
     and swearing and you've got to fetch a policeman." I
     said, "God he lp anyone what goes on the terracing with
     away supporters. I think it s disgusting."
Q.        Hr. GOLDSACK: Hr. Thorpe, at this meeting, you were
     present and a number of the stewards under you were
     present?   A. Y e s .
Q. Do you recall any senior Club officials being present?
   A. No, I can't remember.
Q. This, of course, was before Hr. Lock's appointment, was it
   not?   A. Yes.
Q. I think probably Hr. England was the Secretary in those
   days? A. Yes.
Q. Do you remember whether he was at the meeting?             A. No, I
   don't think he was.
Q. Can I be totally clear about this? The policeman was
   saying that the police considered it to be the stewards'
   job to make sure that things were all right on the
   ■terrace?  A. That's right.
Q. That is to      say, the standing area? A. That's        right.
Q. You did not think that was any business of yours because
   you had re sponsibility for the West Stand?  A. That's
   quite correct.
Q. Were there any stewards who had responsibility at that
   stage for the terraces?   A. No.
Q. Did anyone tell the polic eman that?           A. No.
Q. So might it be the position, Hr. Thorpe, that that policeman
   had given instructions and the stewards were then to
   steward the terrace, but in fact there were no stewards
   w ho could do that?   A. No.
Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Is that the position?      A. That's
     the position.
Q.        Hr. GOLDSACK: After that meeting, did stewards go
     on to the terrace?    A. No, we didn't get stewards on the
     Kop until two or three years after. About three years
     ago they-had stewards on the Kop.

                        Q. Well, that is the other end, is it not?        A. Yes.
                        Q. Have there ever been Sheffield Wednesday stewards on the
                           Leppings Lane Terraces?   A. No, not to my knowledge.
                      Q. Apart from the meeting that w e have just been talking about,
                         do you recall any other m e e t i n g where a police officer has
                         asked for there to be stewards on the West End Terraces?
                    B    A. No.
                        Q. So throughout your period, Mr. Thorpe, your understanding
                           is that there has never been any steward with any
                           responsibility for the Leppings Lane Terrace? A. No.
                        Q. When you had these annual meetings, after the various
                           officials had given their little talk, are people invited
                           to raise points or ask questions if they wish?   A. Yes.
  r
                        Q. We may well hear evidence in due course, Mr. Thorpe, that
                           one of the things that has been raised at that stage of
                           meetings is the lack of signposting for people coming in
                           at the Leppings Lane end to tell them where to go to get
                           on to the Terraces. Do you recall that being raised at
                           meetings?   A. Yes.
                    D
                        Q. The suggestion may be that that has fallen on deaf ears.
                            What do you say to that?  A. Well, no, not really, sir,
                            because as you approach Leppings Lane end, you've got big
                            notices, "Standing", and the turnstiles are below the
                            "Standing". To your left, as your are walking up, is for
                           ,seating, and anyone coming on the road, as they get out
                           'of the coaches, they know w h i c h w a y to go and it is clearly
                            marked for anyone, the supporters. It's clearly marked
                            outside.
                        Q. You mean this is on the turnstiles?       A. Yes,above the
                           tu r n s t i l e s .
                        Q. Can we come in to the turnstiles? If people come in through
                           turnstiles A to G with tickets for the Leppings Lane t e r x a c e ,
                           how do they kn ow how to get on to the terrace?  A. Well,
                           at the top it says "Standing".
                        Q. That is the tunnel?    A. The tunnel. To the right, there's
                           a letter to the right, and you more or   less - - -
                        Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I am sorry, what do you mean by
                             saying to the right there is a letter? A. To the South
                             Stand, the South Terracing.
                        Q. What letter?     A. I think it's No. 1.     There's 1 and 2.
                        q,        Mr. GOLDSACK:   Would you pick up the Bundle 'West
                             Midlands 2' and go perhaps to photograph 17? That is
                             roughly the view that you w o u l d have when you came through
                    H        turnstiles A to G, is it not? A. Yes, that's quite correct.

                    Q. And to someone who does not k n o w the ground, if they look
                       straight ahead, they do see "Standing over the tunnel?
                       A. That's quite correct.
                    Q. Can you explain from that photograph what you mean by the
                       lettering?   A. There's a letter 2 above 'Standing".

               B Q. Yes.       A. It's not on the photo, but just past my steps,
                         the West Stand steps, there is a letter 1.
                         Is that Y to Z?     A.   Just past Y to Z.     It's not on the
                         photo, sir.
                              LORD J U ST ICE TAYLOR:         Try 14.

                    Q-        Mr. GOLDSACK:  Just un der the bottom, half way up the
                         stairs. Is that it, Mr. Thorpe? A. You can't see it.
  r
                    Q- Are you saying that that can be seen as you come through
                         the turnstiles?     A.   Yes.

                    Q- What is the significance of the numbers 1 and 2?        A. It
                         used to be on the tickets w h e n you have all-ticket matches.
                D        There's numbers on them.
                    Q.        LORD J U S TICE TAYLOR:  I think when I look under there,
                         what it says is "Refreshments", is it not?     A. Yes. There
                         was a N o . 1 on i t , •■sir.
                    Q.        Mr. GOLDSACK: Can I be clear what you are saying about
                         tickets and semi-finals? Are you saying that your
                         understanding was that on semi-final tickets there was
                         a number which identified the part of the terrace to which
                         people should go?    A. T h e r e used to be, yes, sir.
                    Q. There used to be?   A.       But I don't know about this year,
                       the '89 semi-final.
                    Q. Part of the responsibi lities of the stewards on Gates C and
                       B would be generally to a ssist people to find their way
                       to the right part of the ground, would it not?    A. That's
                       quite correct, yes.
                    Q. And to do that, of course, they would obviously need to
                       know what the tickets said, would they not?         A. Well,
                       I have stewards at the b o t t o m of the steps and they have
                       people coming to the b o t t o m of the steps and my stewards
                       always tell them, "Round that corner for standing."
                    Q. Regardless of what number is on the tickets? A. That's
                       quite correct. They always come to my stewards at the
                       bottom of the steps and they always say, "This is seating.
                       Standing is round there." There are six stewards at the
                       bottom of those steps.

So your stewards do not need to see a ticket to find out
w here the person should be sent to stand?  A. Well, he
shows the ticket. Sometimes they come to him and say
"It's full under there, u nder the tunnel. Can we come
upstairs?" and they say "Standing is round the corner,
round the refreshment bar."
The complaint at the annual m e etings has been that there
has been inadequate signposting inside the ground, has
it not?   Do you agree that that complaint has been made?
A. Yes, I agree wi t h you.
Were you the person who was responsible for looking into
it and m a k i n g improvements if necessary? A. No, not me.
W hose respons i b i l i t y was that?   A.   It was the Club's
  respoonsibi1ity.
In practice, who does that m e a n - Mr. Lock or Mr. Mackrell?
A. I should say Mr. Lock, for security reasons, and
safety.
Mr.Lock.     So is this something that --
      LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:   Is this minuted?
      Mr. GOLDSACK:      Not that I am aware of, sir.
Is it a ma tter that you h a v e ever given any thought to,
Mr. Thorpe?    A. No,not really, no, because they filter
'through themselves.
They filter t h r o u g h ? _ A. They stand in that courtyard
waiting for their friends to come in. There's a snack
bar and the toilets and they stand outside talking in
groups, a lot of the supporters, when they come in. I have
stood by 'C ' Gate with my stewards to see if they were
all right, and when people have come in, I've always told
them, 'Go that way to 'Standing' please. Can we clear
this area?"     I've just h a d a lot of abuse, and even the
police have had abuse. It's just that they don't want to
go on to the terraces till the kick-off, some of them;
they just stand about cha t t i n g - long-lost friends or
something.
Where you send them is towards the South Stand entrance
to the terracing?   A. Yes.
It is right, is it not, that one of the largest areas of
standing is next to the N o r t h Stand? A. That's quite
correct.
Anyone coming in through turnstiles A to G needs to go
through the gate in the wa l l to get there? A. That's
quite correct.

                     Q. Is there any p r o vision m a d e by stewards under your control
                        to make sure that people k n o w they can go through there?
                        A. No, because it's locked. I have a steward standing
                        on there and the bolt is across. No-one can go through
                        there till they make sure that under the tunnel Pens 1 and
                        2 are lull, and then they filter them through there to the
                        North Stand area - you know, the terracing on the north
                        side.
                B Q. Can we just deal specifically wi t h that point so far as fhe
                          semi-final this year was concerned?         That gate in the wall
                          was open, was it not?   A. Yes.
                     Q. All day, fastened back?       A. Yes.
                     Q. Because at an all-ticket m a t c h the fans coming in at the
                        Leppings Lane entrance could have the whole of the terrace
                        area?   A. That's correct.
      r
                     Q. Did you have any stewards at all on duty near to that gateway
                        so that a propor t i o n of the fans were stewarded towards the
                        North Stand end?       A. Yes, I had a steward standing there!
                        I had a steward there from B Gate.

                D Q. So one of the stewards from B Gate was on the semi-final
                          positioned in that gateway in the wall?     A. Yes, he was.
                          Well, i t 's only about six or seven.yards away from B Gate,
                     Q. That is right. Did he have specific instructions to try
                        and --   A. No, he just kept telling them "That way",
                        like, you know, just pointing w h i c h way to go.
                     Q. Do you kn o w who that was?        A.   No.
                     Q.        LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:   The question was not what he
                          did but w h e t h e r he had any instructions to do anything?
                          A. No, he didn't have any instructions whatsoever.
                     Q. Pardon? A. He didn't have any instructions. More or less,
                        he stood there and used his common sense to tell them
                        himself.
                     Q         Mr. GOLDSACK:    Does it come to this, Mr. Thorpe:
                          That at the semi-final the only way people were likely
                          to get on to the North standing area was if they happened
                          to see the steward you have just described pointing --
                          A. Yes.
                     q    -- or by going through the tunnel, on to the centre pens
                          and then filtering along?  A. That's right.
                      Q. Can I now ask you a few specific questions about the
                         1988 semi-final? Were there any Liverpool stewards on
                         duty at that match?   A. Yes, they came and helped me
                         out.

'A. It        came from Liverpool.
 But do you kn o w who at Liverpool?             A.    I have no idea,
 sir.
 Did it       come addressed p e r s o n a l l y to you? A. No,to the Club.
 Did you see the letter y o u r self?          A. Yes, I      was given the
 letter. I was shown the letter.

                 Q. Long before any
                 Q.    Where were you between about 2 o'clock om-7ards? - A.       I
                      was on my rounds seeing to my stewards, seeing if my
                      stewards*were all right, up in the stands.
                 Q. Some of your stewards of course were on B and C Gate?
                    - A.That is quite correct.
             B
                 Q. So wh e n you do your rounds do you visit them to make
                    sure they are all right? - A. Yes.
                 Q. And do you continue to do your rounds up until 3 o'clock?
                    - A. That is quite correct.
                 Q. So at what stage did you b e c o m e aware of the problems
                    building up outside? - A. It was about just after half-
                    past-2, noticed it was bui l d i n g up a lot outside,
                    about quart - 20-to~3, I should imagine, round 2 0 - t o - 3 .
                    Started to climb over the turnstiles.
                 Q. And did you at that stage go to the area inside Gates I
                    and C? -A. I went downstairs to my stewards at the bottom
                    of the steps at the South West Side and I says watch it,
             D      lads, theres a lot climbing over, to make way for these
                    gates and I went down towards this C Gate and asked the
                    stewards if they were all right.
                 O.Were you conscious that over the next 10/15 minutes the
                    pressure outside was gett i n g worse and worse? - A. Yes.
                 Q.    Did you at any stage give any consideration to how that
                      pressure night be relieved? - A. No.
                 Q. You have told us that in 1981 Gate C was opened to
                    relieve pressure? - A. That is right.
                 Q. Did you give any thought to the possibility of opening
                    gates? - A. Well, they could not really because iust
                    outside the C Gates they got a line of Police and a
                    barrier across. Th e y could not do it this year because
                    they had got this barr i e r across.
                 0.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry.      What did they
                      do last year? - A. No, 1981. 1981.
                 Q. Yes. - A. They opened C Ga t e a little bit to ease the
                    congestion.
                 Q. Yes. I appreciate that. But this time? - A. They could
                    not do. They could not do it this year because they had
                    got, the side of my C G a t e to the railings, to the
                    Riverside, they had a b a r r i e r across with Police standing
                    there stopping people going round to the South Stand, you
                    know, supporters going r ound to the South Stand.

Wh y did that stop them opening the gate? - A. Because -
I have no idea but they got a barrier across, the Police.
You could not do it w i t h that barrier being there.
     MR. GOLDSACK:   Did not that actually mean there
were a lot of Police Officers there who could be used
to shepherd people into Gate C if it was partly open?
- A. You could do, yes. The reason they did it in
1981, there were less turnstiles. Three years - I
think it ws 1984 they had some more turnstiles built
and, you know, I thought there were enough turnstiles.
As you looked at the situation at about quarter-to-3
did you think everyone was going to get in by 3 o'clock?
- A . Oh, y e s .
Through the turnstiles? - A. Yes.
Could you see from your p o s i t io n how far down Leppings
Lane .... - A. N o .
.... the crowd went?     So y ou did not have a complete
view .... - A. N o .
.... of the situation outside? - A. No.
Between about 20-to~3 and 3 o'clock were you approached
at all by any Police Officer about the problems that
were .... - A. No.
.... building up?     You had a radio, I think? - A. Yes.
Did you have any com m u n i c a t i o n at all with Mr. Lock
between about half-past-2 and 3 o'clock? - A. He just
asked me if I was all right.
What time was that? - A. A b o u t 10-to-3.
Did you know where he was calling from? - A. I have no
idea w here he was calling from, to tell you the truth.
If you had needed to contact Mr. Lock yourself that day
did you kn o w where p h y s i c a l l y he would be? - A. No,
because ....
Sorry. Did you want to add something? - A. I cannot tell
you because sometimes he used to go on his rounds.
So your understanding was that between half-past-2 and
3 o'clock he could well be on a general tour round
the __ - A. Yes.
So far as you are c o n c e r n e d do you take up a specific
point at some stage so that your stewards know where

                            you are? - A. Yes, bottom of the - but I kept going round
                            to see to them because they were getting a lot of abuse
                            from ....
                        Q. At wh a t stage do you take u p a specific point? - A. After
                           the kick-off.
                        Q. After the kick-off. - A. Yes.
                   B
                        Q. So they know where to find you after ki c k - o f f ? - A. Yes.
                        Q. Before kick-off you are on your rounds? - A. I go round
                           to see my stewards are all right because this year they
                           had more"abuse than any. I have never known abuse ny
                           stewards had this semi-final, abuse, swearing.
                                                       He, turned round, "he saj
                           I d o n ’t know h ow you ve coped w i t h this lot." He says,
     r                     "Its murder." He says, " I ’ve had nothing but abuse.
                           He was walking on the seat. Said look at him, walking
                           on the seat. An Officer says - all right, he fell and
                                     went down to him. V/hen he got up he just swore
                           at             The Officer c ould not do nothing because

                        Q. Well now, Mr. Thorpe, we k n o w that Gate C was opened
                           twice .... - A. That is right. .
                        q        in the few minutes b e f o r e 3 o'clock. Did you see
                            either of those openings? - A. I saw it open first time.
                        0. From where? Where were y o u w h e n it opened? - A. I was
                           stood up in the stand.
                        Q. You were looking down?      -A. Yes, from the   snack bar, bade
                           of the snack bar.
                        Q. Did you at that stage think you should go down to Gate C
                           and speak to a senior P o lice Officer? - A. No. I was
                           interested in my stewards, h o w they were coming in. All
                           m y concern was for my stewards at the bottom of the
                           steps because they were r u s h i n g towards the bottom
                           of the steps. When you g et a hundred or more rushing
                           to those steps, there are six lads there, their lives
                           are at stake, so I we n t d o w n to them. I said, "Watch
                           it, lads." We had some L i v e r p o ol people help us to hold
                           the gates and we let them go so many at a time up the
                           stairs showing their tickets because some of them came
                           through w i t h no tickets, sta n d i n g tickets. They were
                           bo ttom of the steps trying to get in.

                       and m y other stewards he ld on to them while they filtered
                       upstairs and while they w e r e going upstairs, getting

                       frustration outside. T h e y were swearing at my stewards
                       as they w e r e going upstairs. We made sure they got
                       tickets for seating. A n y o n e without a ticket we told
               B       them to get away and abuse they got ....
                    Q. After you tried to sort that problem out where did you
                       go? - A. When it finished then I went all the way round
                       to ny stewards to see that they were all right with all
                       this crush coming up.
                    Q. Did you go to Gate B or C at all at that stage? - A. I
                       went*r o u n d to Gate B. A s k e d the lads if they were
                       all right. They said they were all right but they says
                       its terrible outside here, its terrible.
                    Q. Did you at that stage give any thought to how the
                       pressure outside could be relieved? -A. No, could not
                       reallv. No way could do anything.
               D    0. Did it occur to you at all at that stage that gates
                       might be opened? - A. No.
                    0. If you had been told that gates were going to be opened
                       vjhat, if anything, could y ou have done to help? - A. I
                       was not told the gates we r e going to be opened.

                    Q- No, but if you had be e n told is there anything that you
                          could have organised your stewards to do to make the
                          people coming in come in in an orderly fashion?-A. No,
                          you could not, because there were that many at the back
                          of the gates - they were not queuing at all. There was
                          iust one mass of people. It was just like a floodgate.
                          No-one, if they had opened the gates, no-one could have
                          stood there and told them w h i c h w a y to go, no-one, even,

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   In y o u r general tour round in the
     previous half-an-hour had yo u been conscious that the
     pens behind the goals we r e getting fairly full? - A.
     No. I cannot see the pens from in the stands.
Q.   So had you at no stage seen pens 3 and 4 at all? - A. Mo.
Q. But you w o u l d have e xpected that by about 10-to-3 they
   wo u l d be fairly full, w o u l d not you? - A. Well, I would
   do really but ....
Q. Well, with that e x p ectation when you saw all these people
   rushing into the tunnel did it occur to you then that
   there night be an ove r c r o w d i n g situation on the terraces?
   - A. No, not really, no. Trouble was, I was dumbfounded
   to see them running, that many. My interest was for ny
   stewards in that stand. That is all I was i n t e r e s t e d -*and
   people round about.
Q. This was a n e w situation, w a s not it? - A. Yes.
Q. A gate being opened and a lot of people rushing in? - A.
   Yes.
Q.    Did you consider it was a n ything that you as Chief ■'Steward
     for that end of the g r o u n d should get involved in? - A. No.
Q.    Are you saying from that y o u regarded it as entirely a
     Police responsibility? - A. Yes, I do.
Q. If you had thought there is going to be overcrowding on
   the terraces what w o u l d you have done? - A. Well, I would
   have no t i f i e d the Police. We have not got to get involved,
   like it says in our thing.
Q.    You are not supposed to deal with the problem. - A. No.
0.. But if you see one you s h ou l d alert the Police to it?
    - A. Yes.
0. So if it had crossed your m i n d at that stage the pens cannot
   cope,- there is going to be o v e r c r o w d i n g , how would you have
   contacted the Police? - A. I w o u l d have to go up to an Officer
Q. W hi c h one?   Do you have a particular point of contact? - A.
   No.
 Q. You would not have done it by Mr. Lock and the radio? - A.
    0'n, no.
 Q. Where V7 ere you in the few min u t e s after 3 o'clock?    Were
    you up in the stand by then? - A. Yes.
 Q. And presunably you became aware of people going over tlie
    perimeter fences? - A. That is right.

Q. Well now, I am not going to take      you through the part you
   played after 3 o'clock. T here has     been some evidence, Mr.
   Thorpe, of occasions v/hen people     are prevented from going
   down the central tunnel if it is      already full. Are you
   aware of that? - A. Yes.
Q. Ho w often to your k n o wledge is that done? - A. About     tuo
   or three times.
Q. Has that b e e n at League m a t c h e s or semi-finals? - A. At
   a semi-final, you close the gates for, I estimate, about
   five minutes so that it c o u l d filter round to the West
   Side terracing.
Q. You say they close the gates? - A. Yes.
Q. Which gates do you mean? - A. Some gates under the tunnel
Q. Look again at photograph 18. Do you mean those gates w«
   can see at the Leppings Lane end of the tunnel? - A. Yes.
Q. And when you say they c l osed them w ho do you mean by they
   - A. Police. Police have stood and closed them.
Q. Do you kn o w whether, anything like that happened at the
   1988 semi-final? - A. No, I cannot remember if there was.
Q. You do not kn o w one w ay or the other? - A. No.
Q. Are stewards ever involved in making sure that no more
   people go down that tunnel? - A. No.

                                                          S. THORPE


                     Q. Have you ever had a situation where you have thought it
                        necessary to bring to anyone's attention that parts of
                        the terraces appeared to you to be too full and something
                        should be done to ease it? - A. No, because I have always
                        said the Police have been more responsible for filtering
                        the crowd.  They have filtered themselves as well as they
                        come in.

                B             MR. GOLDSACK:   Yes, thank you, Mr. Thorpe.


                                       Cross-Examined by MR. IIYTNER:

                     Q. Mr. Thorpe, can I just take you up on the closing of the
                        tunnel? - A. Yes.

                     Q. Could that have been something done at the '81 semi-final?
                        - A. No sir.

                     Q. It is simply you remember it being done but you don't remember
                        when? - A. I can't remember the date.

                     Q. Whether it is a good thing or a bad thing I am not going
                T)      to ask you, but was the position this:  the Police simply
                        closed those two gates at the entrance to the tunnel
                        temporarily? - A. Yes.

                     Q. Allowing people out if they wanted to go to the toilet? -
                        A. That is quite correct.

                     Q.1-’But other than that not? - A. No.

                     Q. And   they would be allowed in? - A. That is right.

                     Q. Can I go back now to the '81 semi-final.  On that occasion
                        let it be said there was no northern team involved, was
                        there? - A. No.

                     Q. Midlands and London? - A. A London Club.

                     Q. There were then complaints of drunken fans and hooliganism
                        from the local residents? - A. That is quite correct.

                     Q. Mr.   Thorpe, I dare say you can remember the days when you
                        could go to a football match and mingle with theopposing
                        sides' supporters and have a lot of fun, a lot of banter
                        and enjoy the game as well? - A. Yes sir.

                     Q. Things have deteriorated? - A. That is quite correct.

                     Q. They deteriorated by 1931? - A. That is right.

                     Q. So that by 1981 it was no mystery to a Football Club or thos<
                        working for a Football Club that if there was a semi-final
                u       or everv a bi a league game,- there was likely to be hostility,

                      abrasiveness between the fans and a certain degree of drunken­
                      ness and hooliganism? - A. That is quite correct.
                  /



                  Q. Apart from the obvious step and fundamental step of segre­
                     gating fans, what different instructions were given or what
                     different procedures were carried out at Hillsborough to
                     deal with this new phenomenon of drunkenness, hooliganism
              B      and bad manners among fans? - A. They were ejected out of
                     the ground for swearing and drunkenness, the Police ejected
                     them out of the ground.  If any one came in drunk, the smell
                     of beer, ejected out of the ground.

                  Q. Well what different instructions were given for example
                     to Stewards to deal with what was obviously a new serious
                     problem? - A. Nothing really only "Don't get involved with
                     anyone".

                  Q. "Don't get involved"? - A. That was it:     "Don't get involved.
                     Notify a Policeman".

                  Q. The next thing is this:  from time to time there have been
                     disasters or incidents, not amounting to disasters, when
                     people have been crushed and hurt or killed through over­
              D      crowding? - A. Yes.

                  Q. You know that; don't you? - A. Yes.

                  Q. You have been asked already by Hr. Golasack about an incident
                     which you knov; nothing about at Hillsborough where 31 people
                     were crushed? - A. I can't remember.

                  Q. But you have known of other incidents? - A. Oh yes, the
                     Bradford one.

                  Q. Well that was a fire? - A. Yes.
 "\
                  Q. I am talking about crushing through overcrov/ding? - A. Ilo.

                  Q. You have known about that at other football grounds, ox
                     course? - A. Yes.

                  Q. It has been in the papers? - A. Yes, that is correct.

                  Q. What instructions were ever given to you or to any other
                     Stewards to your knowledge by the Sheffield Wednesday Club
                     which dealt with the problem of overcrowding and the
                     dangers that might arise from overcrowding? - A. nothing
                     really.

                  Q. Was anything ever said to you to indicate that it was
                     your responsibility, or one of your responsibilities:

                               "To prevent overcrowding in sections of the

                             - A. No sir.

                    q   .         2>iR. HYTNER:   You now realise what I have been reading
                             from? - A. No.

                                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       I am sorry, have I let the cst
                             out of the bag?

                                   MR. HYTNER:   No, not at all, sir. I was not trying
                             to catch him out, nor was I trying to appear clever to those
                             who did not knov; what I was doing.

                D   Q.        Did you even knov; of the existence of    the booklet Lord
                             Justice Taylor has just held up? - A. No, it has amazed me
                             when he has just shown it to me. .

                    Q.        That is the first time you have ever seen that? - A.      That is
                             the first time I have ever seen that sir.

                    q   / Or    heard of it? - A. That is       right.

                    0.       Can we just get this right.  You were the Chief Steward       of
                             the West Stand? - A. That is quite correct.

                    Q.       There was attached to the West Stand a terrace, the Leppings
                             Lane terrace. Did you regard yourself as the Chief Steward
                             for that area as well? - A. No.

                    q    .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You regarded the terrace as a
                             no-go area really for Stewards, didn't you? - A. Yes six.

                    q    .         m r . HYTNER: So did the Club, didn't it? The Club
                             did not appoint anybody, so far as you knew, to steward the
                             terraces? - A. On away matches, where the ground is
                             segregated like mine they have no Stewards for the standing
                             area but the Spion Xop they have got Stewards there.

                    Q. Oh yes, but what Lord Justice Taylor is asking about and
                       what I am asking about is not the Spion Kop where the
                       Sheffield Wednesday supporters go, it is the terraces at
                       the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes, they have no Stewards
                       there at all.

                         that was a "no-go" area as far as the Sheffield Wednesdays
                         Stewards were concerned? - A. That is quite correct.

                    Q. And on the day of this semi-final there were something
                       like 10,000 people expected on those terraces? - A. Yes.        .

                    Q. And so far as you as the Chief Steward at the West Stand
                       were concerned, the safe dispersal of those 10,000 spectators
                B      was in the hands of six chaps who turned up from Liverpool
                       without tickets calling themselves Stewards and who might
                       or might not have obeyed your suggestion of going on to
                       the terraces? - A. That is quite correct.

                                        Cross-Examined by *IR. JACKSON:

                    Q. 2-ir. Thorpe, Hillsborough is a venue for semi-finals? - A.
                       That is quite correct.

                    Q.   '81 Gate C had to be opened, did it not, because the turn­
                         stiles could not cope? - A. That is quite correct.
                D   Q.   At that time residents got petitions  together to urge that
                         no semi-finals be held at Sheffield  Wednesday? - A. That
                         is quite correct.

                    Q. By '37 Sheffield Wednesday again hosted a semi-final? -
                       A. Yes.

                    Q. The kick-off was delayed because          the Coventry fans had not
                       arrived on time? - A. Yes.

                    Q.   '85 consideration might well have been given to the kick-ofi
                         being delayed because of the Liverpool fans.

                               Looked at with those matters in mind, it is perhaps
                         a little hopeful to say:  "Well it all went well in '88”
                         because in '88 you had in fact to close the tunnel, didn't
                         you, to prevent overcrowding? - K . I can't remember.

                    Q. Well can you remember, Mr. Thorpe, because did you not
                       make a statement saying that you ... A. Yes, I did make
                       a statement, a Police statement.

                               MU. JACKSOH.:    It is at page 9, sir, of the Club's.

                    Q.   I remind you what was said:

                                "I witnessed the Police Officers at the entrance
                                to the tunnel stopping fans from gaining access
                                to the centre pens.”

                         A. That-is quite correct,        for about five minutes.

                          did you tell them about evacuation procedures? - A. I did
  r                       not tell them anything.

                       O. 'Were they really Stewards? -A. Yes.

                       Q. To do what? - A. Stewarding,     they steward atAnfielc     because
                          they showed me their passes.
               D
                       Q. They may well steward at Anfield.  I am concerned with
                          ctewarding at Sheffield.- They-have no idea of the
                          evacuation procedures? - A.Mo.

                       Q. They weren't wearing bibs? - A. No, they weren't wearing
                          bibs when they left me.

                       Q. They weren't being paid? - A. No.

                       Q. No one would recognise them?      - A. They had cot   theidentity
                          card on them.

                       Q. Mr. Thorpe, when you told us earlier that two people arrived
                          and said:  "Can we help out?" can you tell us when that
                          occurred? - A. After 1 o'clock.

                       Q. Who were they? - A. The Lloyd brothers.

                       Q. Were you really expecting them to work as Official Stewards?
                          - A. ho.

                       Q. And when they said:  "Can we help out?" who had sent them
                          to you? - A. Ken Castley from the cantilever stand.

                                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I rather think that phrase
                          v/as used in his evidence in relation tc 1SGS?

                                MR. JACK SOW: Sir, if I remember correctly his
                          evidence.  He first said in 1988 they had arrived in that
                          wav and then he retracted, that and said be had a letter
               H          from the Club.

Q.   B u t nev e r t h e l e s s y o u w o u l d b e ta k i n g your initial instructions
     f r o m the Police? - A. T h a t is right, yes.

Q. A n d in p a r t i c u l a r w e r e t hose L e p pings Lane terraces to
   be evacuated, d i d you u n d e r s t a n d it to be the case that it
   w o u l d be the Police w h o w o u l d be directing people off the
   terraces? - A. T h a t is right.

Q. W o u l d it be fair to sa y for tha t reason you did not ever
   p a y any p a r t i c u l a r a t t e n t i o n to the direction in which
   pe o p l e sh o u l d leave the terraces, tha t was a matter for
   the*Police, v/as it? - A. T h a t is a m a t t e r for the Police.

Q. Yo u m e n t i o n e d in y ou r e v i d e n c e earl i e r in answering
   Mr. Goldsack, that you w o u l d exp e c t your Stewards to take
   up p o sitions at Gates B a n d C? - A. T h a t is right.

Q.   If that be the case, Hr. Thorpe, the easiest v/av to get
     to Gates 3 and C from the terra c e s w ould be through the
     tunnel, w o u l d it not? - A. T h a t is right.

Q.   Bac k through the tunnel o r a l t e r n a t i v e l y round the         sides
     of the Stand? - A. T h a t is right, yes.

Q. W h e n you w e r e a s k e d q u e s t i o n s a b o u t the gates in the radial
   ba r riers at the bac); of th e terrace, do you remember being .
   asked that? - A. Yes, I r e m e m b e r that.

Q. Y o u said s o mething a b o u t t h e Police, whe n you were b e i n g
   asked w h e t h e r they c o u l d b e u s e d as a means of getting
   round the Stand, b oth s ides of the Stand.              What was it
   you w a n t e d to say a b o u t the Po l i c e and the radial ....
   A. A P o l i c e m a n stands at e a c h side of those radial gates
   and opens them w h e n t hey a n n o u n c e the evacuation.

Q. You know w h a t I m e a n b y the "radial g a t e s ” don't you?
   D o n ' t confuse their, w i t h p e r i m e t e r fence cates, I m e a n
   right at the back? - A. R i g h t at the v ery back just
   u n d e r n e a t h m y Stand.

O. w h a t should the Po lice d o if the e m ergency evacuation
   pr o c e d u r e is i n i t i a t e d as regards those gates at the
   b a c k of the radial fences? - A. O pen them.

 Q. A n d if they are a l r e a d y o p e n w h a t should the Police do?
      - A. F i l t e r peo p l e through.

 Q. H o w it m a y be, Mr. Thorpe, tha t it is because you wer e
    c o n c e n t r a t i n g on h o w to g e t people off the Stand rather
    than off the terraces t h a t you m a y have m i s u n d e r s t o o d
    something. - A. Yes.

 Q. But it n ever was the case, v/as it Mr. Thorpe, that
    people m u s t be e v a c u a t e d o f f the Leppings Lane terraces
    if there v/as to be m a s s e v a c u a t i o n on to the pitch.

                      entrances, i.e. the tunnel a n d the wings round the sides
                      of the Stand? - A. Yes, if t h e y c ould get through b u t they
                    ' c o u l d not ge t t h r o u g h b e c a u s e it was compact.

                    Q.    If the tunnel was full then the alternative w ould be to
                          go round the sides of the Stand, w o u l d n ' t it? - A. Yes.

                    Q. You see y o u s a i d you t h o u g h t Mr. L o c k h a d said something
                B      to you a b o u t m a s s e v a c u a t i o n o n to the pitch. Can you
                       clea r l y recall that c o n v e r s a t i o n and in particular when
                       v/as it? - A. I c a n ' t r e m e m b e r no w bu t they open the
                       fencing g ates for them to g e t o n to the pitch.              If they
                       c a n ' t get t h r o u g h the tunnel the o t h e r w a y is to come on
                       to the pitch.

                    Q. W h e n did he say that? - A.            I c a n ' t remember now.

  f                 Q.    Is it since this i n c ident that he has said that? - A. Mo,
                          before.

                    Q. Was it at a special m e e t i n g ? - A. A big meeting,              I think
                       it was.

                D               LOR D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:      I think he said before it
                          was at the A n n u a l Meeting.

                                 THE V7ITN2SS:      Yes.

                    q.            MR. ROBZRTSOiT:       O b v i o u s l y if people were going
                        on to the p i t c h they w o u l d be g o i n g towards Gates B and C
                     •' w h i c h is w h e r e you t h o u g h t p e o p l e w o u l d be evacuated from,
                        i s n ’t it? - A. T h e y w o u l d f i l t e r round to there.          There
                        is also a gate at the r i g h t - h a n d side of the South Stand,
                        a big e m e r g e n c y gate w h e r e t h e y c a n go.        Also they can
                        use it from the terracing.

                    Q. A r e you sure M r . L o c k v/as n o t talking about evacuating

                    Q. Fina l l y a p o i n t Mr. J a c k s o n has already taken up. Is it
                       fair to sa y that w h e n you s e n t the si:c Liverpool Stewards
                       as you t h o u g h t towards the terraces, you gave the m no
                       instructions w h a t s o e v e r as to w h a t they should do? - A.
                       Ho, that is right.         It is q u i t e correct.

                   Cross-examined by Mr. M A X W E L L :
Q. Mr. Thorpe, I w o u l d like to ask you something about signs
   at the back of the Stand, and I invite you first of all
   to look at ph o t o g r a p h 14 in bundle 'West Midlands 2'.
   It is the view of the back of the Stand. You have told
   Lord Justice T a y l o r about a recollection you have of
   there being some numbers posted. I think you have
   m e n t i o n e d 1 and 2, and I think you may have referred
   to 3?           A. 3 is the North Stand.
Q. Bear wi t h me. I am going to try and help you. If you
   look at the very right-hand concrete pillar, that is a
   pillar on w h i c h there is a small sign which says
    Standing"?       A.   That's right.
Q. Immediately above "Standing" there are two wooden batons
   that are a t tached to the pillar immediately above
   "Standing"?     A. Yes.
Q. To the left-hand side of the West Stand - and it is not
   shown on any p h o t og r a p h - there are two similar wooden
   batons fixed in the same sort of position at the extreme
   edge of the Stand?          A. That's right.
Q.        Neither of these pairs of batons has got anything attached
         to them, but they look as though they may have been the
         m ou n t i n g points for signs at some stage? A. Yes.
Q. Does that help y ou to r emember whether or not at that edge,
  i on photograph 14, of the W e s t Stand there used to be a No.l
    on a sign?   A. Yes, sir.
Q. Above the wo r d "Standing"?            A.   That's right.
Q. And was there a No. 3 at the left-hand edge of the West
   Stand?   A. Yes, sir.
Q. And there was a time, was there, when one could look at
   a ticket for an all-ticket m a t c h and work ou whether
   y o u were to go to 1, 2 or 3?     A. Yes, sir.
Q. Do you kn o w w h e n those signs came down?            A. I've no idea,
   sir.
Q. Do you kn o w h o w long, roughly, a matter of months or years?
   Were they up for the 1988 semi-final?       A. Yes.
Q.             LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR: They were? A.          I think they
         were up for the 1988 semi-final, yes, sir.
q    .         Mr. MAXWELL: Do yo u k n o w what reason there could^
         be for not h a v i n g them put back?  A. I have no idea, sir,
         to tell you the truth.
 Q. You told Lord Justice T a ylor about the gate in the wall,
    as it has been called, the opening that was left open at
    this semi-final?   A. That's right.

                        Q. Y ou said, "The gate in the wall is locked. No-one can
                           go through there until y ou m a k e sure the Pens through
                           the tunnel are full"?     A. That's right. That's for
                           ordinary League matches.
                        Q. Yes, that is ordinary League matches. Now, who makes
                           sure that the Pens through the tunnel are full so as then
                           to be able to unlo c k this opening? A. The Inspector,
                    B      the duty officer w ho is on at Leppings Lane.

                        Q. W h a t happens? W h a t does he do? A. He tells me that he
                           is going to open the gates, he is going to filter the
                           crowd to the n orth side of the terraces. He always
                           notifies me, so as to w atch m y stewards at the bottom
                           of the steps in case they run up the steps as they are
                           filtering across.

                        Q-   And do you kn o w what he has done immediately before telling
      (
                             you this?      A. He has checked w i t h his officers, you
                             know, the Pens, because a lot of the supporters can't see
                             and I've m e n t i o n e d it to h i m sometimes in League matches,
                             the spectators can't see , going over the north s i d e --

                        Q.         LORD JUS T I C E TAYLOR: The spectators cannot see
                D            what?   A. In or d i na r y League matches, sir, they come
                             through there, the seats, for standing only, and when it
                             gets full, the officer in. charge, the Inspector, always
                             lets me kn o w that he is g o i n g to open the north side
                             terracing by the North Stand, the two-tier.
                                    Mr. MAXWELL:    He is an Inspector who lets you know?
                             A.   Yes.
                        Q. He lets you k n o w after he has checked with the officers?
                           A. That's right.
                        Q. Where are the officers w i t h w h o m he checks?      A. I've nc
                           idea, to tell you the truth, sir.
                        Q. W h e n you were asked by the six Liverpool stewards whether
                           they could help you, yo u sent them to the Terraces?
                           A. That's right, sir.
                        Q. You thought there was something that they could do there,
                           did you not?   A. That's right.
                        Q. What use did y ou think they w o u l d be there? What purpose
                           did you think they would serve down there? A. To tell
                           the crowd to move down, m o v e down to the front instead
                           of   standing at the back. A lot of supporters w h e n they -
                           go to a m a t c h just stand in one spot, and they were
                           telling them to move down, down towards the railings.
                        Q. What, to move from any area where there may be crushing?
                           A. Yes:/

Q.     Is that the sort of purpose that you had in mind? A. Well,
      not really. I just told them, "Do what you do at Anfield".
Q.         LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR: M ov i n g down to the front sounds
      more like trying to pack do w n so that you can get more and
      more in?   A. Yes.
Q. Well, is there            any limit to that?      A.      No, not   really,
   sir.
Q. Not really?    A. Well, I told them to move them down so
   that there's spaces at the bottom, to move them down into
   those spaces until it is p r a ctically full.
Q.          Mr. MAXWELL:         This is   wh a t y ou told them to do,     is
      it?   A. Yes.
Q. To move them down?            A. Mo v e them down.
Q. Until what point? W h e n should they stop moving them down?
   A. Well, I just tell them to move them down and I left
   it at that, because if they are stewards at Anfield, they
   must know what they are doing on the terracing, if they
   do stewarding on the terracing at Anfield.
Q. Do you kn o w of any m a x i m u m capacity for the Pens?             A. No.
Q. I suppose that is because y ou say it is not part of your
   area?   A. That's right.
Q.' Do you have a safety officer?                 A. Yes.
Q. Who is that?         A.     Doug Lock..
Q. Mr. Lock is your safety officer, -is he?                    A. Yes.
Q. H o w do you kn o w that he is the safety officer? A. Because
   he was told that at the Annual General Meeting. At the
   Annual General M e e t i n g he is told that he is the safety
   officer.
 Q. W h e n was that? W h e n we r e y o u told that?          A. When he got
    the job about three years ago.
 Q.    That is before October, 1987?           A.     Yes.
 Q.     And that has not been changed, as far as you               are aware?
       A. N o .
 Q. He is the safety officer?      A. The safety officer. If vie
    want anything done, we always n otify him - such as gates,
    bolts. If the gates w o n ’t w o r k properly, we always notify
    M r . Lock.
 Q. What about Mr. M ac k rell? Is he the safety officer?                   A. Well,
    he must report to Mr. Mackrell.

Q. Yes, but what is Mr. M a c k r e ll ' s job in terms of safety?
   A. I don't kn o w really. He is Secretary of the Club;
   that's all I know. I always thought the safety officer
   was Mr. Lock. A nything that I wa nt doing in my Stand,
   1 always let Mr. Lock know.
Q. I see. That is the practical w a y in which you did it?
   A. Yes, that is the practical way, sir.
                 Mr. MAXWELL:      Thank y o u ve r y much.

                   C r o s s-examined by Mr. K A L L I P E T I S :
Q. Mr. Thorpe, will you turn to page 9 of the statement that
   you made to the Club?   Do you have it, Mr. Thorpe?
   A. No, sir. (Handed to the w i t n e s s ).
Q. W o u l d you turn down four paragraphs to the paragraph
   starting "At last year's semi-final ..."? A. Yes, that's
   right.
Q. You say there that you saw the police on the terraces;
   you cannot remember h ow many; they were underneath the
   West Stand?   A. That's right.
Q. And you n o t i c e d these police officers as you leant over
   the front of the seated area?         A. That's right, by the
   fire escape.
Q,       You say, "These police officers were in position well
        before kick-off ..."? A. That's right.
Q. As far as you were aware, did they stay?                          A. I've no idea,
   sir, to tell you the truth.
Q.      Whereabouts were they?                A. Just underneath the Stand.
Q.      Along the back of the terrace?                A. That's right.
Q. Stretching up towards the gate leading to the two                         side
   pens?   A. That's right, yes, sir.
Q. Turning to page 3 of your statement - - - I am sorry,                       page
         2 ---

q   .         LORD J U S T I CE TAYLOR: Just before you move on
        from that, you said that they were in position well
        before kick-off - indeed shortly after the turnstiles
        opened?   A. Yes.
Q. What were they doing on the terrace at that time, those
   police officers?  A. I've no idea, to tell you the
   truth, sir.

Q. Pardon?            A. I've no idea.'          They just stood there.

      LORD JUST IC E TAYLOR: I see, thank you. I am sorry,
Mr. Kallipetis. Where are we going now?
      Mr. KALLIPETIS:        Page 2, sir.
       LORD JUS TI CE TAYLOR:       Thank you.
       Mr. KALLIPETIS: Do y o u have that, Mr. Thorpe?
A.   Yes, I've got it now, sir.
Again the fourth paragraph down. You say: "The evacuation
procedures are important part ic ul ar ly with regard to any
fire, and we are informed as to the code which        will be
br oadcasted over the public address system"?     A. That's
right.
Mr. Thorpe, I do not want to k n o w what the code is, but
what I want to kn ow is this: Have there been any
dress rehearsals during League matches when this code
has been tested?    A. Yes, sir.
Can you remember on ho w m a n y occasions? A. There was
one two matc he s before this semi-final that we were
drilled on. We have had about four this year.
Is that during a      match?       A. Yes..
With a lot of shouting and chanting?                 A. That's quite
correct.
Any difficulty w it h the tannoy?             A. No.
So everybody could hear the m e ss ag e and go to their
designated position?   A. Yes, that's right, sir.
       Mr. KALLIPETIS:       T h a n k you very much.

           Cr os s-examined b y M r . W O O D W A R D :
Mr. Thorpe, you have been asked about the green guide
and the first time you have seen it is today? A. T h a t ’s
right.
M a y I ask you about so me th in g else? Did you k n o w that
the Club had a Safety C e r t i f i c a t e ? A. Yes.
Had anybody told you about it and about the responsibility
and importance of stewards in the Safety Certificate?
A. The Safety Certificate? I think it was in the press
that we had got a Safety Certificate, Sheffield Wednesday
Football Ground, because in my Stand there is a sheet
up of the Safety Certificate, like a copy, with all th«
ground procedures and e ve ry t h i n g like that.
It is in the Club's bundle, the first document in the
bundle. May I draw your attention, please, to page 5 in
the bundle? Section 9 deals w i t h stewards. It is page
                                                    70


                                                                        S. THORPE

                         5 in the bundle. Do you see w ha t it says there?
                         It says, "The holder shall arrange for the attendance
                         at every specified ac ti vit y a number of safety stewards".
                         Now, that is you and your men, is it not?      A. Yes.
                    Q. You knew that you were a safety steward?           A. Yes.
                    Q. And it there sets out the sort of task that you are
               B       expected to perform: the m a n n i n g of the exits, the
                       control and direction of spectators entering, using
                       or leaving the stadium. So there are three tasks,
                       entering, using and leaving the stadium?        A. Yes.
                    Q. You knew that that was a s t e w a r d ’s job?    A.   T h a t ’s right.
                    Q. The next requirement is that the safety stewards shall
                       patrol the stadium. Did you k n o w that that was expected
 f                     of the stewards? Did you k n o w that, Mr. Thorpe? Not
                       you necessarily, but that there wo ul d be stewards
                       patrolling the stadium?   A. No, not to my knowledge.
                       We just had to stand at us posts.
                    Q. Your role as a steward was in respect of a specific area
               D       and particular men?   A. Yes, that's right.
                    Q. And you did not have any conc er n about other parts?
                       A. No.
                    Q.   But from time to time durin g aday whilst your stewards
                        were at their posts, w e r e you visited and patrolled by
                     ,/ any of Mr. Lock's men?       A. No.
                    Q. Did Mr. Lock come round?          A.   Yes.
                    Q.    You were a chief steward?       A. Yes.
                    Q.    Were there stewards above you, before      you get to Mr. Lock?
                         A. Yes.
                         What is the order of rank?       Wh at sort of steward is above
                         you? A.

                    Q.   And above him?    A.   Mackrell.

                    Q-   Mr. Mackrell?    A. Yes.

                    Q.   Whatever job they had, there w as Mr. Jones above you and
                         then Mr. Mackrell. Wh er e did Mr. Lock fit into all this?
                         A. Well, he was overall. He's below Graham. I understood
                         he was my safety officer   for all the ground.

                    Q.   You took your directions        and orders from Mr. Lock, did
                         you    A. Yes.

                    Q.   But you-do not recall, other than Mr. Lock coming round
                H        any stewards havin g the task of patrolling? A. No.

You have told us about certain briefings that took place
and certain m ee tings? A. Yes.
Those were b ri efings or meet in gs at which the police
attended?    A. That's right.
Would you have a look, please, at this document? (Handed
to the w i t n e s s ) . It is a Club document and it is not in
the bundle. Could you please tell us whether you have
seen it before? It is h e a d e d "Management Information"
and it has got some w r i ti ng on the top. Would you ignore
the writing on the top for a moment?            It then says,
"Safety of Sportsground" and then it says "Use and
Training of Stewards", and it is Sheffield Wednesday's
material. Have you seen this before?             A. No.
Or anything like it?       A. No.
You have not seen that?       A. No.
You have not?       A. I have not seen this whatsoever.
The first par ag ra ph of it sets out that the prime
responsibility for the a rr an ge me nt of affairs at the
Club lies w i t h the Club. Do you see that?      A. Yes.
At paragraph 8 it talks about training and the training
of stewards. Do you see? A. Yes.
And in the third     section of that itsays, "Stewards   should
be supplied wi th    a hand-out detailing their responsibilities
in general terms     as set out above"?    A. Yes.
The general terms we can see at paragraph 3 on the left-
hand side.    That sets out "Controlling, directing and
patrolling" and other matters. Y ou have never seen this
before?    A. No, sir.
At the briefing or m e e t i n g or lectures that you had from
the police, do you recall being present at the meeting
w h e n Mr. Sewell ad dr essed y o u in 1988?  A. Yes.
That w ould be in the August, w o u l d it, the summer of 1988?
A. Yes.
Mr. Sewell talked to you. Was that the first time you h ad
had any address or lecture from him - do you remember?
A. I think it was.

                     STUART T H O R P E Recalled
                Cross-examined by MR. W O O D W A R D :
0. Mr. Thorpe, I was asking y o u about the obligation of a
   steward to remain in his p o s i ti on throughout. - A. Yes.
Q. Have you got page 58, please, in the club's bundle or
   do you have your little b o o kl et there which sets out
   your obligations? - A. That is right.
0. Does that - sir, if we look at page 58 in the bundle -
   does that show you at p a r a gra ph 4 there about the
   obligation to remain in the position until the final
   whistle is gone and the area is clear? - A. Yes.
Q. Do you see that? - A. Yes.
Q. Does it then say, "The pract ic e of stewards leaving
   their position before the final whistle will not be
   tolerated"? - A. That is right.
0.   You knew of that rule? - A. Yes.
Q.    Does it then say "e::cept in an emergencv"and then.
     "Stewards should not leave their place of duty without
     the consent of the Chief Steward or Senior Police
     Officer"? - A. That is right, yes.
0. What was the point of stewards having their tabards on?
   - A. Well, I have got to lock them away and where I pay
   ny stewards it is just a counter.
Q. What is the point of them V7earing tabards? - A. Well, so
   people can recognise them as stewards.

Q. So how w ou ld that occur i n t h e event of an emergency
   happening after you had p a i d your stewards? - A. I
   would not have paid m y s tewards in an emergency. I
   only pay m y stewards ....
Q. Forgive me. It is m y fault. If you had paid your
   stewards and they had h a n d e d their tabards in. - A.
   It would have been end of the match.
0. Are you saying that you did not pay your stewards until
   after the final whistle? - A. About three minutes before
   the fin^l whist le I pay m y stewards because where I pay

                                                        S. THORPE

  m y stewards there is no office whatsoever.     It is the
  counter of the snack bar. A n d when I an paying 26
  stewards I have got m oney to pay stewards. I do not
  want to get m u gg ed by supporters coming down the steps
  from out of the seating.
Q. So are you saying that it is just a moment or        two before
   the final whistle goes? ~ A. Yes.
Q. And they then go back to their positions, do they? - A.
   That is right.
Q. The gates are opened about 10 minutes before the final
   whistle? - A. On a League match, yes, about 5 or 10
   minutes before the end of the m a t c h because a lot of
   people leaving the ground to get to the coaches and
   the cars, but when we get a biggish match, Manchester
   United coming to Hillsborough, Everton, Liverpool, the
   Police seem to hold them b a c k so they can get the coaches
   round to ferry them away f r o m the ground.
Q. Your area of re sp onsibility was where? Where did it begin
   in relation to the turnstiles? Where did your area of
   responsibility begin? - A. B o tt om of the steps of the
   stands.
Q. At the b ot to m of the steps   ot   the stands, - A. Yes.   That
   is where m y area starts.
Q. And how far then did it go? Did it go to the balcony
  • front at the front of the stand? - A. Yes, all the way
    round the ground - all the w a y round the seating area
    of the West Stand.
Q. And is that an area w h i c h you patrol, from the bottom of
   the steps to the balcony front of the stand? - A. I do
   not go to the botto m of the steps of the balcony,you know.
   I do not go to the bottom.
0. But you w o u l d be going up and down the gangways and around?
   - A. Yes, seeing my stewards are all right in their
   positions.
Q. Did you have any stewards a t the bottom of those gangways?
   - A. I have two - there a r e two fire escapes, at the
   right-hand side of the stand and the left-hand side of
   the stand because, the b r i e f i n g of the match, Inspector
   asked me the names of those two stewards.
Q. You have two stewards in the West Stand at the front?
   - A. Yes.
Q.And they are positioned one at each end? - A. That is
   quite correct.

Q. There are no stewards across the centre? -A. Just at the
   turnstiles - at the gangways. As you come up the steps
   there are gangways.
Q. You me an at the back of the stand? - A.       Well, it is middle,
   more or less. Middle of the stand.
Q. Where are your stewards, Mr. Thorpe, in the West Stand?
    Whereabouts w o u l d you e xp ec t to find them, please? - A.
   As you come up the steps there is a landing and there are
   six steps leads up to the seating area, gangways. There
   are two stewards stand at top of that gangway. It is just
   a small one, about ha lf - a - d o z e n steps, and they just look
   at the tickets, as the s upporters come in, which wa y to go.
   The seating is numbered f r o m 1 to 30.
Q. So you have two at those steps? - A. Yes.
Q. Where else do you have them in the stand? -A. Bottom
   corner. Two in every stand. Go from U to Z.
Q. Four stewards in the West Stand? - A. No. There is two
   in every gangway. There are six gangways, six gangways,
   where they go up to the ticket, from U to Z.
0. So at each gangway in the W e s t Stand at the back there
   are two stewards to be found? - A. Yes.
0.    Do those stewards have any v i e w across the people in
      the West Stand? - A. Oh, yes.
Q ’ Do they have any r e s p on si bil it y for controlling those
    people? -A. No.  Just show them - only way they have
    got is to tell them where their seat is and if someone
    is sat in their seat they come back, they tell them
    that someone is in my seat and that steward goes to
    have a look if he has got the right ticket.
0. Do we un de rs ta nd that on this day, the occasion of
   the semi-final in April, there were a number of people
   who were in the wrong seats in the West Stand? - A. Yes.
Q. People w h o should    not h av e b e e n there? - A. That is
   quite correct.
Q. And who w h e n approached a n d asked to move were most
   unco-operative? - A. That is right. The language was
   terrible.
Q. I an sorry? - A. The language was terrible.
0.    And there were quite a n u m b e r of those, we re there?- A. Yes.
 Q.   llore than you would have expected? - A.    That is right.

Q. >    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Is that people w h o v/ere in
   the v/rong seats or who h a d n o stand tickets at all? - A.
   Some of them had no stand tickets whatsoever, sir, and ....
0.. H o w had they got past down the bottom of the steps? - A.
    Some of them had climbed up from the front, been pulled
    up from the front.
           LORD JUSTI CE TAYLOR:        Oh, I see.
0.        MR. WOODWARD:     Some of them had         come up from the
      front? - A. Y e s .
0.. Did you see that happening in any numbers? -A. I only
    saw it on the television.
Q. On the day? - A. Well, I did not see it but some of m y
   stewards saw it. They told m e that they wer e climbing
   up from the front.
Q. Did any of your stewards report that to you? - A. They
   tell me.
Q. On the day? -A. They tell the Police wh en anything happens
   like that.
Q.    Did any of your stev/ards report it         to you? -A.    Yes.
Q.      Did you report that to Mr. Lock? - A. No. It is the
       Police. Report it to the Police because Mr. Lock
     ■ cannot do anything. He has got to refer it back to
       the Police.
Q.     But if there were numbers of people in the West Stand
      who should not have bee n there that would be a matter
      for the stewards tohave to deal with, would not it? - A.
      No, it is the Police, to eject them out of the ground.
      They have not got to be involved with anything like that,
      in the wr on g seats. If they won't move out of the seats
      the Police eject them out of the ground.
Q. There seem to be two stages to it. If someone is observed
   to be in a place that he s hould not be in the steward cones
   along and says, "Excuse me. M ay I see your ticket? You
   are in the v/rong seat," a n d the steward deals wi th it if
   he can? -A. If he can.
Q.And if there are numbers of people like that is that not
   something that you w ou ld report  back to your    control room?
   - A. Report it to the Police.
0. You have a radio, do not you? - A. Yes.
Q.What is it for?       - A. R e p o r ti ng   matters. That matter is for

  the Police, not the club. Wh at can the club do if they
  are sat in the wrong seat and they have not got tickets?
' The club cannot do nothing. It is the Police to eject
  then from that area, not the club. That is m y under­
  standing.
Q. Are you saying that so far as you           are concerned no
   instruction had been §iven to you           by the club to
   report people being in the w r o n g        place, being in
   the stand w h e n they should not be        there? -A. No.
0. Did you k n o w that the club w a s monitoring, so far as it
   could, the admission to the various parts of the ground?
   -A. Oh, yes.
Q. What do you report on your           radio to the club? -A. Any
   accidents, if stewards are           short, stewards are late,
   anything like that and for           m e dic al - it is more or less
   for anyone getting hurt in           m y stand.
O.Does it follow from that .... -A. Calling Mr. Lock if
   there is anyone injured so they can get the St. Johns
   into m y stand.
Q. So it is in the event of an emergency you would use
   your radio? -A. Yes.
0.   Where there has been an injury? - A. That is quite            correct.
0.    Does it foilow from that that on the day of this match you
     had no radio contact w i t h Mr. Lock? -A. No.
Q.   It does f o i l o w ? - A. Yes.
Q.   You did not speak to him once on your radio? - A.Spoke to
     him once asking for more m e d i c a l people after he had been
     over the P A system.
Q. But that was after the incident had happened? - A. Yes.
Q. But before the incident, w h i l s t the crowd are coming in,
   people being found in the v/rong seats, is this the
   position, there was no r ad io communication between you
   and Mr. Lock? - A. Ho.
Q. Nor radio communication b e t w e e n you and anyone else? - A.
   No.
0. The club radio is in fact on talk through? - A. Yes.
0. It is on talk through, is not it? - A. That is quite
   correct.
Q.So you are able to hear any m es sa ge s? - A. That is right-

                                                       S. THORPE

Q. That are being passed.      For example, to Mr. Lock? - A.
   That is right.
Q. If there we re more people in your stand than should have
   been there than you had exp ec te d was there any reason for
   not telling Mr. Lock about it? - A. No, only -my - I have
   always done this - is fetch a Policeman, if we have got
   too ma ny people in witho ut tickets and in the wrong seat
   giving abuse, go to the Polic e and ask him to eject him
   out of the ground. If he does not eject him out of the
   ground or anything like that we have got to take his
   number and report him. That is. That is on rules for
   my stewards in that stand.
0. Yes. You have that i dentified in your rulebook, I think?
   - A.That is quite correct.
        LORD J U ST IC E TAYLOR:         Page 58.
        MR. WOODWARD:      Yes.         No. 5 there:
Q. "Stewards are responsible for ensuring spectators are in
   the correct seats and w h e n this is not the case they have
   a responsibility in the first instance to request them to
   do so." And then you get in touch with the Police? - A .
   That is right.
Q.Well, were there any people w h o actually moved when you
   asked them to? -A. Some of them moved but - - -
Q.There were some that did? - A. Yes.
Q. Did you see where they w e n t ? - A. They were brought down­
   stairs, ejected from the g r o u n d and some of them went into
   the proper seats.
0. If your responsibility b e g a n at the bottom of the stairs
   what steward - do you k n o w his name - had the responsibility
   for the forecourt? -A. The re was no-one on the forecourt
   whatsoever.
Q. There was no steward w ho h a d any responsibility for the
   area between yo ur stairs a n d the back of the turnstiles?
   - A. No.
Q. You have spoken of seeing p eople hanging around in the
   area?- A. Yes.
Q. Milling about betweenthe stairs _ _ _ - A.That is right.
q        and the turnstiles. Is this the position, that there
    was no-one from the club w h o was doing anything to deal
    with those people? -A. No, because a lot of people wait
    for their mates coming in and they stand talking. There
                                                                           S. THORPE

                        are the toilets there and there is a refreshment bar.
                        They go to the refreshment bar and they stand there
                        eating and I do not think if anyone went up to them
                        and told them to go to the terracing you will get a
                        lot of abuse, "Who do you t h i n k you are talking to?"
                        and the language is ve ry nice to you.
                     Q. Are you saying that there w e r e no club officials dealing
               B        w i t h people in the forecourt? - A. No.
                     Q. You agree? - A. I agree, yes.
                     Q. If you had sent someone dow n the stairs because he had
                        not got a ticket from the W e s t S t a n d - A. The Police
                        do that, not me, not the stewards, the Police.
                     Q.The Police do that? - A. Yes. They bring them right down
C                       and eject them out of the ground.

                        Q.     Is that the same one.            F o r g i v e me, will you hold it up
                               again b e c a u s e the p r i n t seems to be somewhat different.
                               195-3/89 is in m u c h b o l d e r figures than the one that we
                               have got copied.        It m a y b e unimportant.         Tha t is page 49.

                        0.     So really it is no t u ntil a supporter gets to the bottom

                                  "During the 1938 s e m i final, the Lloyd
               D                  b r o t h e r s had s t e w a r d e d the terrace wit h
                                  about 6 other Liverpool stewards.”

                          A. Yes.

                    Q.     So that is right, there w e r e six plus the Lloyds and they

                    Q. But you w e r e d i r e c t i n g them, w e r e n ' t you? - A. I told
                       them to go there.

                          had cone I w o u l d have d o n e b u t like I have b een saying,
                          it is not m y r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for stewarding of the

                         Q. This is 1933 we are talking about? - A. Yes, they were
                            there all the match because I know a lot of then and they
                            used to stand and talk well before the natch.

                         Q. Where were they? - A. The bottom of the tunnel.
                     B
                         Q. Is that the entrance to the tunnel? - A. Just to the
                            entrance to the tunnel by the toilet doors.

                         Q. well you would not be able to see them from up on the

                            I brought them downstairs.

  r                      Q.   In 19SS the two Lloyd brothers came and spoke to you
                              again? — A. Yes.

                         Q. And according to your statement that you made, they gave
                            you information that there would be a lot of fans coaing
                            from Liverpool without tickets? - A. Yes. They were at
                     D      the bottom of the steps and we were all talking.

                         Q. It was a point of conversation, wasn't it? - A. Yes,
                            a point of conversation, that is quite corriect.

                         Q. They ’./ere making a point of telling you? - A. Yes.

                         Q.; As if it was news? - A. Well it is nev/s. We get it a lot
                     E       at big semi-finals people coming without tickets and we
                             just take it that the Police v/ill cope with it. Every
                             semi-final there is always a lot who travel without
                             tickets trying to get in.

                         Q. But if it was nothing more than you would ordinarily have
                            expected, if it was not a matter of news why did you set
                            it out in your statement? - A. Well I just put it in
                     F      my statement, that is all.

                         Q. weren't they telling you that more than usual were going
                            to be coming? - A. Yes.

                         Q. How if more than usual turned up without tickets that
                            would cause problems, wouldn't it? - A. Well it would
                            not for the Police.
                     G
                         Q. It would not for the Police but it would have beer, more
                            than they might have expected? - A. I can’t say that sir.

                         Q. Did you think of passing that piece of information on
                            to anybody? - A. No.

                         Q. So that the Police if they had not got it fromsomewhere

                   A                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Mr. Woodward, he has been
                                asked that before already and he said no, it never crossed
                                his mind.
                                      THE WITNESS: The Police get to know a lot when fans
                                are travelling d o w n , at other matches fans are travelling
                                down without tickets. The Police seem to get to know as
                                well over their PA system because I have known a lot of
                   B            the Police for years and they have all left that area new
                                and they all seem to be new ones.

                        q   .         mr.   WOODWARD:   In the statement you made you said:

                                      "They also said ...." that is the Lloyd brothers,
                                      “.... that they thought there was going to be
                                      a lot of trouble."
                   C
    /                           A. Yes, they did say a lot of trouble but we get that
          \                     coning from other supporters other semi-finals. "You are
                                going to get some trouble, you have no tickets". The
                                reason was Liverpool wanted the Kop and they got the
                                Leppings Lane end and that is where we got a lot of abuse
                                to ny Stewards in the Stand. "We should have had that
                   D            f-ing end". That was the language.     Ican't pronounce
                                some of the language what was said to my Stewards because
                                there is that many ladies present in this room. They
                                were just shouting at us as we were going up the step:
                                "This Stand ought to fall down" and things like that tc
                                my Stewards. Abuse, it was disgusting.

                        qI      More Liverpool Stewards arrived while you were talking
                    E           to the Lloyds? - A. Yes.

                        Q. Do you remember how many? - A. About five or si::.

                        Q. In your statement you said "7 or 8"? - A. Well it might
                           have been 7 or 3.

                        Q. At that time there was a discussion as to where they would
                    F      go, how they would be used? - A. I told then: "2here is
                           no room up here for you. You can go on the terrace amongst
                           your own supporters" because I said I would not put my
                           Stewards in that area. No way will a home Steward go
                           amongst away supporters in .a ground.

                        Q. Did you know that that was just the plan in respect of
                           the Kop? - A. Well the Kop was all Nottingham Forest
                    G      supporters. They were well behaved.

                                               S. THORPE

In your statement, you said "I explained that my stewards
had already been allocated to the stewarding of the stand
and that they (the Liverpool stewards) were needed to look
after the terraces as b efore"?  A. Yes.
You n e e de d stewards to look after the terraces? A. W e l l ,
I told them to go and look after the terraces. I may
have said it wrong in m y statement, but my idea were just
to put them on there and that's it. I wasn't interested
in the terracing whatsoever.
       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Yo u know, Mr. Woodward, if
yo u will forgive me - and I a m not saying this in any
way against you - I do feel that we are getting the
Liverpool stewards a bit out of proportion, are we not?
I me an we are taking an enormous amount of time over
them and we are only t a l k i n g about six chaps.
        Mr. WOODWARD: Sir, if the time is disproportionate —
        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I am beginning to feel that
it i s .
      Mr. WOODWARD: T h e n I apologise. Thank you, sir.
Sir, I am reminded by m y learned junior of something that
I must put.
        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes, of course.
          Mr. WOODWARD:    In your statement, Mr. Thorpe, on
page 2, the statement that you made to the police, at
the top of the page, y o u say "All the stewards posted
by me w or ke d in the v i c i n i t y of the West Stand"? A. Yes,
t h a t ’s quite correct.
"I have no responsibility for the men working on pens
1 to 7"?   A. T h a t ’s right, if there is any put on
there.
Sorry?   A. If there's any stewards put on there, I'm
not responsible for them.
So that is what you     meant , is it?       A. Yes.
        Mr. WOODWARD:     T h a n k you, Mr. Thorpe. T ha nk you,
 sir.
             Cr os s-examined by Mr. G L A S G O W :
Mr. Thorpe, you have bee n asked some questions about your
statements, your two statements, and I want to ask you
about them. I think you answered a questionnaire for the
police?   A. T h a t ’s quite correct, sir.
 An d gave them as much in formation as you could recall?
 A. Yes, sir.

                                                  S. THORPE

Q. I think y ou were then seen by a solicitor?            A. Yes.
Q. Who took a long time w i t h yo u and asked you a great many
   more questions?   A. That's quite correct.
Q. And you have been perfectly properly asked about seme of
   the additional material w h i c h y ou put in your second
   statement?   A. That's right.
Q. Perhaps you w o u l d make this plain, Hr. Thorpe. Was it
   made plain to you wh en y o u were asked to come and assist
   this Inquiry that you should tell that solicitor everything
   which you could recall that might be of assistance to
   this Inquiry, whether or not it was thought to be helpful
   to the Club? A. That's quite correct.
Q. And have you attempted to do that, both in your statement
   and your evidence?   A. Yes.
Q. Thank you, Mr. Thorpe. I w o u l d like you to go on doing
   so and bear wi th me for a few minutes if you would.
   A.   All right.
Q. First, I w a n t to take you back to 1981 and I want to ask
     you about the incident w h i c h occurred outside the ground
     and then about anything y o u can help the Inquiry on that,
     happ en ed inside the ground. Outside the ground first.
     Is it right that in that year, 1981, that was the year
     that saw some of the first football unpleasantness outside
     this ground that your Club h ad ever unfortunately witnessed?
  / A . That is correct.
Q. It was the first year, to your knowledge, in which there
   had been, in a word, v i o l en ce on the streets? A. That's
   right.
Q. There had been fighting b e t we en rival fans - and let it
   be said that none of them was from Liverpool? A. That's
   quite correct.
Q. Local residents had been disgusted and offended and had
   made complaints both to the police and to the club?
   A. Yes.
Q. As the people who had invited those fans to the area?
   A. Yes, that's right, and also to the MP's.
Q. Yes, Members of Parliament?              A.   Members of Parliament.
Q. You have rightly been a sk ed about this. There were
   accounts of violence, of drunkenness and of thoroughly
    anti-social behaviour? A. That's quite correct.
Q. For the first time?     A.        Yes.
Q. Can I bring you to the area outside the turnstiles where
   your colleagues were w o r k in g? A. Yes.
                                90


                                               S. THORPE

Q. Is it right that despite w h a t was happening in the streets
   in that area, the turnstiles had orderly queues of well-
   behaved people in that year?      A. They had, yes.
Q. And, despite all that was going on wit h the hooligan
   element, w h i c h was then ev en smaller in proportion than
   it is today, it was c ompletely unaffecting the queueing
   at the turnstiles?       A. T h a t ’s right.
Q. And the turnstiles coped and the m e n had no difficulty
   wh atsoever?  A. That's correct.
Q. Was there a problem w i t h segregation of fans as a result
   of the fighting that there had been in the streets?
   A. No, there was no segregation.
Q. There was no segregation until that game?          A. Until that
   game.
Q. I simply want to ask you this: Did you know that the
   police were concerned as a result of the queueing of that
   match, that there should be segregation if possible in
   the future?   A. Yes, they were.
Q. And was one of the incidents w hi ch resulted from the
   warfare and the fighting in the streets that individual
   groups of fans had had to be brought to the ground almost
   under police protection?    A. That's correct.
Q. At that time, had it been important to which end of the
  .ground they were delivered, do you recall? A. The
   Tottenham supporters w e r e brought to the Leppings Lane
   end and the Wolves supporters were took to the Penistone
   Road end.
Q. And there came a stage when, despite the orderly queueing,
   a very small group of approximately, I think you said
   50 --    A. 50, that's quite correct.
Q. -- was brought to 'C' G at e?        A. That's right.
Q. Was that as a result of a general crush that was happening
   outside the gates?   A. I couldn't really tell you, sir.
   They brought them and w e open ed them gates, and what we
   did was we put them up at the side of the wall and they
   were coming steady.
Q. When you say "They brought them", is it right that they
   were lined up on the outside?   A. Yes.
Q.     And that a number of stewards, w i t h police, had been asked
      to stand inside the gate in advance?       A. That's quite
      correct.
 Q.    And the 50 or so people w e r e brought in and their tickets
      were properly checked?     A. That s right.
                                               S. THORPE

And they were sent to the area of the ground where they
should go?   A. Yes, that's right.
I simply have to ask y ou this Mr. Thorpe. If you cannot
help, then of course y ou m u s t say so. Did you believe
that that was part of the attempt to segregate fans or
as a result of a crushing incident that had occurred
outside the turnstiles?     A. The crushing outside the
turnstiles.
So be it. But yo ur recollection is that there was
orderly queueing      A. Orderly queueing.
Throughout that period?        A. Yes.
That is right?   A. Yes. Th ey w e r e fetched and they were
going right across the bridge, and that's where a lot was
brought from, because they were going up Leppings Lane
end. They brought them from the top and then they started
coming in orderly and there was no trouble as they were
coming in.
No trouble of any kind?        A. No, orderly, joyful and
everything; no trouble.
No trouble in the queueing?          A. No, not as they was coming
in.                        .     .
Thank you. I w oul d now like to mo ve to inside the ground
in that year, Mr. Thorpe.       Did you know that there had
been any trouble of any k i n d on the terraces?   A. No, 3
did not.
Whether or not yo u kn ew of injury?         A. I didn't k n o w of any
injuries whatsoever.
But even if you were u n aw ar e of that, you knew that theie
had been a police briefing shortly after that m atch when
views had been exchanged betw ee n the Club and the Police?
A. No, I don't remember if a nything like that happened.
Well, yo u remember Mr. Calvert?          A. Yes.
Chief Inspector Calvert.       Y o u remember him coming to talk
to you?   A. Yes.
And you have told us that Chief Inspector Calvert said
something about the divisions of responsibility between,
his men and your men, putt in g it bluntly? A. That's
right, yes.
In the course of that, d id Chief Inspector Calvert suggest
that he thought that stewards ought to be on the terraces?
A. He thought that, yes.
And y ou left the meeting, I think at the end, without
m a k in g any protest? A. That's right, yes.

                                             S. THORPE

Q. But a n umber of stewards did protest?         A. That's right.
Q. And said that they t h o u g h t --   A. It was too dangerous.
Q. And, w h e t h e r it was right of them or not, they were critical
   of the p oli ceman for suggesting that they ought to be on
   the terraces?         A. Yes.
Q. Did y ou know that as a result of that exchange of views,
   there was a complete separation of the way in w hich the
   terraces were organised? A. Yes, after that.
Q. As a result of this exchange of views between the Police
   and the Club following that difference of opinion, the
   terraces were divided into pens?   A. That s right, yes.
Q. A nd from that moment onwards did y o u hear anybody ever
   suggest that the stewards w e r e responsible for policing
   the pens?    A. No.
Q. But it is right to say that until they were divided, and
   as a result of the 1981 trouble, you had heard the
   suggestion made w hi ch had provoked annoyance -- A. Annoyance
   wi t h the stewards.
Q. Yes. Once the terrace h a d been divided up into pens, who
   controlled the people w h o went in and out of those pens?
   A. The police.
Q. Did the Club attempt to organise, for some years, a ticket
   .numbering system so as to divide fans between those p e n s ’?
     'A.   Yes, they did.

Q. And did you recall that there had been a time when there
   had been numbers hanging outside the concourse area?
     A.    Yes, there was numbers hanging.

Q.    And I am sure that you seek to. be helpful, Mr. Thorpe.
     Those numbers have now gone?     A. Yes.
Q.    And the signs w h i c h are left are not as helpful as they
     ought to be, are they?        A. No, they are not, not really.
Q. No. But did the system of n u m b e r e d pens and numbered
   tickets have to be given up? A. No.
Q. Do you remember that up to today there is not a numbering
   system for the tickets b e t w e e n the different pens? A. I
   have not seen any.
Q. You have had no involvement in the ticketing of the terraces
   at all?   A.   No.
           LO RD JUSTI CE TAYLOR: I am sorry, I did not get the
     answer to your question w h e t h e r the numbering had to be
     given up.

                           forward to 1988, and may I simply in the interests of
                            shortness - and if you w a n t to say more, please
                           interrupt - put to you the results. Since 1981, the
                           only changes that there h av e been in organisation have
                           been the division of the terraces into pens?         A. Yes.
                      Q. A vast increase in the n u m b e r of police both outside and
     f                   inside the ground?   A. " Ve ry big increase in police.
                      Q. A very big increase, and a very big increase in the
                         number of stewards?   A. That's right.
                      Q. Inside and outside the ground?             A.   That's right.
                 D Q. And a small increase in the number of turnstiles,
                           specifically two to deal w i t h the terraces?          A. That's
                           right, yes.
                    Q. And some changes in the lay-out to assist your organisation
                         outside the ground?     A. Yes.

                          n d after those changes had come about, principally in
                               and 1985, h ad you se en or heard any trouble of any
                         kind in policing any of the matches that have happened
                         since then?    A. No.
                      Q. I w ould now like to ask you, Mr. Thorpe, about your
                         conversation w i t h the Lloyd brothers, which you very
                         properly volu nt eer ed and w h i c h has been put before the
                         Inquiry. I simply want to k n o w whether you can now
                         remember at what stage that conversation took place,
                         in terms of time, first of all?          A. It was after 2 o'clock
                      Q. After 2 o'clock?          A. Yes.
                      Q. I do not kno w whether y o u w e r e in the room yesterday,
                         were you?    A. Yes, I w a s in the room, sir.
                      Q. It may be that there is a perfectly genuine difference of
                         recollection between you a nd the Lloyd brothers. Do you
                         remember that they do not believe that that conversation
                         did take place?   A. Yes. It was at the bottom of the
                         steps, on the right-hand side at the bottom of the s t e p s s
                         and we also saw some more Liverpool people, because when
                         he was sat up near his brother, I was stood with Jimmy,
                         and there were about five or six Liverpool supporters and

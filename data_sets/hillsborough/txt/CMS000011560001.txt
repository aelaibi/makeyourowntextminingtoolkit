TICKET TOUTING IN RESPECT OF FOOTBALL MATCHES

You copied to me your letter of 2 6 June 19 92 to Tony Newton.


I have no objections to your proposals for introducing a Bill in
respect of ticket touting in Great Britain.


The problem is virtually unknown in Northern Ireland where football
matches rarely draw crowds of sufficient size to generate such '
unwelcome interest.

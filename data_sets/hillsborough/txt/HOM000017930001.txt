      Dear Mr Poyner

      Thank you for your letter of 24 May enclosing a
      brief proposal for new research into safe crowd
      behaviour, which Lord Justice Taylor has read
      with interest.  Should the Inquiry feel it
      helpful to commission further work, I shall
      write to you again.

                                      Yours sincerely




                           CD      R M WHALLEY

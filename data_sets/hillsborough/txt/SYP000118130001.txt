Collected             meal       from       mobile             canteen.              Sat       down.       Heard          reports          of    what

sounded       to       be       fighting.                 Left       meal       went       towards             Leppings             Lane       end.

Saw    that       match          was       not       taking          place       and       several             fans      apparently

invading          the       pitch          from       the       Liverpool             (Leppings                Lane       end).           Went

towards       that          end.           Saw       PS    Morton,          SCS       HQ       CID,       in    uniform             running       from

that    end       and       he    shouted             to       me    that       people          were       dying          by    the       fences.

He    said    he       was       going          for       bolt       croppers.                 I went          to    the       fencing          and

saw    several             officers             trying          to    tear       the       fence®          away          with       their

hands.        The          fences          appeared             to    be    welded             on    the       inside          making          their

task    difficulty.                    They          were       unable          to    push          them       inwards          due       to    the

crowd    throngs.                 I then             saw       several          people          pressed             against          the       fencing

obviously             being       crushed             and       to    one       side       of       the    centre             was    a    pile     of

bodies       all       blue       faced          white          skinned          clothing                disarrayed             apparently

dead.        It       looked          as    if       they       had       been       stacked             neatly          at    first       glance

resemblant             of       scenes          from       the       concentration                   camps          of    WWE.           I saw     that

some    officers                had    managed             to       open    a    gate          in    the       fencing          and       were

assisting             people          from       the       terrace.              For       a    short          time       I assisted             in

this    and       then          realised             that       no    one       appeared             to    be       in    command          and     that

everybody             was       acting          on    instinct.                 I began             to    return          to    the       gymnasium

and    spoke          en    route          to    DC       Hall       and    DC       Blake.              Further          informed             Det.

Supt.    McKay             of    my    suspicions                   that    at       least          twenty          people          were       dead.

En    route       I    passed          several             persons          lying          around          the       ground          pitch       some

receiving             attention             from          officers          and       fans          alike.           Some       again

apparently             dead.           It       was       my    intention             to       inform          someone          that       mortuary

facilities             would          be    required                and    again       en       route          I spoke          to       Supt.

Chapman.              I saw       a    body          of    officers             form       a    line       across             the    length        of

the    pitch          from       the       Kop       to    Leppings             Lane       due       to    some          aggravation

coming       from          the    stands.                 On    arrival          at    the          gym    I spoke             to    DI    Towell

of    what    I had             seen       and       very       shortly          after          Cl       Beal       came       into       the    gym

and    ordered             it    cleared.                 Bodies          started          to       arrive          together             with
                                                                                                                                              PAGE

injured.                All    being         carried             on    stretchers,                bill    boards          or       similar             by

both         Police          officers            and    fans.           Assisted             in    gym    with          the    direction                of

bodies            and    injured,

1.      to t h e        area       closest         the          entrance          and

S.      to t h e        adjacent            area       where          they       were       tended       by St.           Joh ns staff

         initially.

Assistance               with         the    laying             out    of    bodies          together         with        DS       Smith,

DC    Lindsay            and       others         I know          but       c a n ’t    remember.

Some         of    the       bodies         were       accompanied                by    friends          or    relatives                and

understandably                     were      both       distraught                and       aggressive             to    Police          officers

present            and       assisting.

At    some         time       I was         handed          a    list       of    potential          witnesses                by    PC       300

Hays.         I told          Mr.      Addis       of       this       and       he    instructed             me    to    take           a    team

to      HRPS        and       give      these          to   C/Insp.              Agar       who    was    s e t t i n g up         an    incident

room     .
I took            DCs    Hall         and    Stoker             with    me       and    then       began       to       take       reports             of

missing            persons            with       those          officers.              We    were    then          redirected                to

Hillsborough                  where         we    continued             to       assist       in    the       identification                      of

the     deceased              by      relatives/friends                      and       obtain       statements                from       the       same

until         approximately                  5am.       <0500).              S t 111        some    bodies          unidentified                   but

assisted            in       the      preparation                of    these          for    despatch          to       the    public

Mr. David Waddington, Q.C., M.P.,
Home Secretary,
Queen Anne’s Gate,
LONDON. SW1H 9AT.


Dear Mr. Waddington,

This Authority, disturbed and perplexed by the Director of Public
Prosecutions recent decision to not prosecute individuals or
organisations for their roles in the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, has
written to the D.P.P. requesting his reasoning for rejecting
prosecutions.

We believe that solely applying the ’burden of proof’ test as the
criteria to establish a decision in a matter of such public concern is
inconsistent, damaging to public confidence and creates misgivings about
the D.P.P.’s objectivity.

The sheer weight,         emphasis, clarity and detail of evidence made
available to Lord         Justice Taylor led him to publish a damning critique
of Sheffield City         Council, South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club and         its engineers. That the D.P.P. refused to sanction a
prosecution under         the ’burden of proof’ test alone causes much concern.

Recently the D.P.P. has initiated a number of prosecutions arising from
the performance of individuals and organisations in contemporary public
disasters.  In such cases, with the apparent exception of Hillsborough,
the ’burden of proof’ test has been rightly allied to considerations of
’public concern’.

The scale, impact, status and implications of Britain’s worst sporting
tragedy involving multiple deaths - not least on matters of public
safety - warranted a thorough testing of the available evidence in an
open court specifically in the wake of the criteria used by the D.P.P.
in proceeding with a convicti&n in the Purley train-crash tragedy.




TSTCDZ
A reading of Mr. Justice Kennedy’s closing remarks in the aforementioned
case highlights the degree to which the need to satisfy and re-assure
’public concern’ achieved prominence, given the requirement for
individuals and organisations to be conscious of the implications of
serious shortcomings in the performance of duties in the service of the
public.

If justice is even handed the principles and criteria applied to the
prosecution and sentencing in the Purley case should have been equally
applicable in deliberations on the Hillsborough file.

In challenging both the criteria used in the D.P.P.’s deliberations, on
receipt of the West Midlands file, and in identifying a flaw if not a
contradiction in the application of the principles of justice given the
significance of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster to the public domain,
this Authority requests you investigate this matter further.

Our views on this subject are' shared by the Hillsborough Families
Support Group and local M.P.’s, amongst others. And in light of the
non-exhaustive points raised in this letter this Authority will continue
to articulate its serious misgivings regarding the process of justice in
this case.

Yours sincerely,




Councillor Harry Chase,
Chair,
Hillsborough Working Party.

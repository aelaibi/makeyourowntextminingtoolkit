I am Police Constable 138 .Saunders,presently stationed at Main Street.police station
at Rotherham.
At the time of football match which was played in 1988.between the above two teams.I was
on duty at the leppins Lane turnstiles,the end into which the Liverpool fans were
converging.The crowd entered in an orderly fashion until 2.30pm.when large numbers converged
on the crowd and the ques coverged into one mass of people trying to enter the ground.
All eventually entered the ground without the amount of pressure that was witnessed at
this years final.
During the match I was stationed inside the tunnel entrance which was packed solid but
this was no different to other semi finals that I attended in the past.

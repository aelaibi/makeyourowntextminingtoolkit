                      During        the      course         of    events         near    to    the    fencing         behind     the    g oa l s ,    I

                      saw a man            l y ing     on    the    grass,         near       to    the   goal    post.        He    was    near

                     became        apparent             that       this     was    not     the      case,     and       I could find                   no     pulse

                      I later        obtained a stretcher                         from a fireman,              and       the m a n w a s               placed           on

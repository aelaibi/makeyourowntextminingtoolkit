Dear Mr. Blackwell,

Re:   Anthony David Bland, deceased

Thank you for your letter of yesterday’s date and for the information you gave me. There
is no purpose as far as I can see in involving the insurance company concerned with a simple
endowment policy.

I had hoped that I might be able to resume the inquest towards the end of April, but
difficulties are developing in locating some of the statements which might be relevant. In
any case I will certainly avoid the dates 21st to 31st May when your clients will be on
holiday.

I will of course keep you informed.

Yours sincerely,




J. A. Turnbull

Dear Mr. Blackwell,

Re:    Tony Bland, deceased

As I indicated in our discussions, I am seeking a means of concluding the inquest into the
death of Tony Bland with the least possible distress and without any unnecessary procedures.
I propose, therefore, to indicate to all the "properly interested persons" under Rule 20 of
The Coroners’ Rules 1984 the written evidence which I deem to be necessary for admission
in order to deal with the matters which have to be recorded at the inquest. I am now trying
to identify the persons or authorities which fall within Rule 20.

May I assume that you are now acting not only for Tony’s parents, but also for his personal
representatives, whether or not they are the same persons? May I also enquire whether any
beneficiary under a policy of insurance issued on the life of Tony exists and, if so, the
identity of the insurers?

I will of course write to you further when I have been able to identify the relevant evidence.

Yours sincerely,




J. A. Turnbull

Dear Mr. Blackwell,

Re: Anthony David Bland, deceased

I am writing to confirm the conclusions we jointly reached in our telephone conversation this
morning. Since certain issues are apparently going to be ventilated in the Court of Appeal
following leave being granted to six families, it seems wise and sensible for a number of
reasons to wait until the outcome of those proceedings are known before I resume the
inquest into the death of your clients’ son. I understand that you will speaking to your
clients and confirm that this is your view also.

Yours sincerely,

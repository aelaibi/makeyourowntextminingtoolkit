to    return          to    the       ground.            I then made               my way          back     to the         ground

POLICE CONSTABLE 525 PAUL ALAN BEVINGTON~ FI Uruform (C Group)


I began duty on the above date with ray duty group at 6.00 am. At 8.00am the same
date I began ray official football duty attached to 'F' division CID. My duties
were that of an observer with relation to thefts of and fran motor vehicles around
the ground and I was riding a Police motorcycle in order to carry out these duties.

I was under the overall supervision of Det. Supt. McKay and after the briefing at
the ground , I was deployed in ray observer capacity to the F1 sub division in the
vicinity of the ground.
During the course of the morning I concentrated ray efforts to theNeepsend and
Shirecliffe areas. Football fans began attending in these areas at around 11.00
a.m. to 11.30 a.m. At this time I became aware of large concentrations of fans
in the public houses in thes e areas paricularly the 'Owl' and 'Victoria' public
houses which are both situated in Neepsend Lane. Fans were massed outside these
public houses both on the pavement and spilling into the road and appeared to be
boisterous and very high spirited. This trend continued until I took ray meal at the
ground at approximately 1.00 p.m. to 2.oo p.m. Whilst on meal I heard on ray
personal radio that assistance was required outside the 'victoria' public house
by two special constables on duty there in order to control the assembled fans. I
did not attend this incident.

On resuming duty I again concentrated on the Neepsend and Shirecliffe areas and saw
that there were still large amounts of fans congregated outside the two aforementioned
public houses. I then began a concentratedpatrol of the Neepsend Industrial Estate.
Whilst there I was approached by two other CID officers who informed me that an
incident was ongoing at the ground and at this time I switched ray personal radio
from the CID channel in use up to that time to the Channel 25 Ground control channel.
I heard that there was an incident in the Leppings Lane End of the Ground and that
bolt croppers were being asked for. All CID personnel were then requested to return
to the ground. I then made ray way back to the ground entering from Penistone Road
into the Police Rocm/Gymnasium area, behind the North Stand. On entering the gymnasium
I saw other CID officers assembled and at that time the first of the deceased was
brought into the gym. There then followed a steady strem of other deceased persons
and I was engaged with the other CID personnel in the laying out and numbering of
the dead. I continued this duty until approximately 6.00 p.m. when I returned to
Hammerton Road Police Station along with other Cid officers and relatives and
friends of the deceased. At this time I felt in somewhat shocked and 'quiet' state
and was allowed to take a short break in the sub divisional canteen.

At 8.00 p.m. that evening I again returned to the ground with other members of ray
duty group but on my arrival at the ground I again rejoined the CID personnel
present in the gymnasium area and together with DC 2405 Dynes was responsible with
the identification of the decaesed by friends and relatives using both photographic
means and the postive I.D. of the body. I continued this duty until 4.30 a.m.
on Sunday 16 April 1989. At this time a majority of the deceased had been identified
and there were no other relatives or friends present at the ground. I then went off
duty from Hammerton Road Police Station.

I have spent all ray 8\ years service at Hammerton Road Police Station and as such
have Policed a vast majority of the football matches which have taken place at the
Hillsborough Ground. During this time I. have been engaged on duties in all areas of
the ground but this present season I have been engaged mostly on turnstile duties
in Leppings Lane. On most match days there is no problems relating to the control
and admittance of fans at the Leppings Lane End of the ground but on numerouse
occasions I have seen problems arise at that end of the ground due to fans leaving
the surrounding public houses too late and then attending en masse at the Leppings Lane
turnstiles expecting almost intantaneous admittance. This of course is impossible and
pushing and shoving has taken place from the fans in order to 'speed up' their
entrance into the ground. My ovm feelings on this days events are that the problems
outlined above have taken place on a much enlarged scale by drink affected fans
who have attended at the ground as the kick off whistle has just blown or very shortly
after and have expected instataneous entry and a certain element within the crowd
pepared to deliberatley cause a crushsituation in order that a gate be opened in order
to gain entry for themselves both ticket holders and non ticket holders, present at the
ground.

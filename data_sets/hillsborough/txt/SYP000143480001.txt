TO THI S J U D I CI A L     INQUIRY?



Be f o r e    the m at ch was     played,    comments were made at Liverpool

about        ticket allocation.          If we had    returned any of our

allocation        I w ou ld have said they were              right    but we did not.

It    is obvious      that all      their   s upporters       could not att en d and        if

they were        concerned why did Liverpool                not    relay the m at ch    live to

Anfieldonabig               screen.



The Liverpool         suppor ters        I am sure must       be held responsible.              It

is obvious        that    they a tt en d ed with ou t       tickets and were

r es po nsible      for getting       in and    crushing      their own fans who         had

arrived        c or rectly and wit h tickets.



Also a public addr es s message                to the fans         explaining what was

hap pe ni ng w ou ld have         helped unless,       of    course,    they thought       it

w o ul d     panic the    crowd.



One    other     point about       one Liverpool       s upporter      is that he       ran the

length of the         pitch to the Forrest            end and his actions          could well

have       produced more      trouble.       He was    stop pe d by the       police and

taken away.



One other        incident     h ap pe ne d while   I was w it h our Chairman.             Two

L iverpool       supp or te rs    came    into the    foyer       of the She ff ie ld

W e d n e s d a y offices    looking      for a telephone.           We a sk ed them

how they had got            in.    One    showejjKa full          ticket and one said he

had not got a ticket.               fn    conv er sa ti on they said eight         ofthem

had    come,     four w ith tickets/ and four without.

    THE HYMN:
              Guide me, O thou great Redeemer,
                 Pilgrim through this barren land;
              I am weak, but thou art mighty,
                 Hold me with thy powerful hand:
                   Bread of heaven,
              Feed me till I want no more.

              Open now the crystal fountain,
                Whence the healing stream doth flow;
              Let the fire and cloudy pillar
                Lead me all my journey through:
                   Strong Deliverer,
              Be thou still my strength and shield.

              When I tread the verge of Jordan,
                Bid my anxious fears subside;
              Death of death, and hell’s Destruction,
                Land me safe on Canaan’s side:
                  Songs of praises
              I will ever give to thee.

CHOIR:
      Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts;
      shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer: but
      spare us, Lord most Holy, O God most mighty,
      O holy and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy
      Judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last
      hour, for any pains of death, to fall from thee.
                                   Purcell (1658-1695)

THE HYMN:
1 Abide with m e; fast falls the eventide;         3 I need thy presence every passing hour;
  The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!         What but thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?
  When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,        Who like thyself my guide and stay can be?
  Help of the helpless, O abide with me.             Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.

2 Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;   4 I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless;
  E arth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;     Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
  Change and decay in all around I see;              Where is death’s sting? where, grave, thy victory?
  O thou who changest not, abide with me.            I triumph still, if thou abide with me.

                     5 Hold thou they Cross before my closing eyes;
                       Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies:
                       Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
                       In life, in death, O Lord, abide with m e!

1 The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want;         3 Y ea, though I walk through death’s dark vale,
     he makes me down to lie                         yet will I fear none ill;
  In pastures green; he leadeth me                 For thou art with me, and thy rod

THE HYMN:

           God is Love : let earth rejoice;
         Let creation sing before him,
           and exalt him with one voice.
         He who laid the earth’s foundation,
           he who spread the heav’n above.
         He who breathes through all creation,
           he is Love, eternal Love.

        God is Love : and he enfoldeth
          all the world in one embrace;
        With unfailing grasp he holdeth
          every child of every race.
        And when human hearts are breaking
          under sorrow’s iron rod,
        Then they find that selfsame aching
          deep within the heart of God.

        God is Love : and though with blindness
          sin afflicts the souls of men,
        God’s eternal loving-kindness
          holds and guides them even then.
        Sin and death and hell shall never
          o ’er us final triumph gain;
        God is Love, so Love for ever
          o ’er the universe must reign.

          MINUTES OF THE JOINT EMERGENCY SERVICES LIMSON COMMITTEE HELD AT 2 PM

                           BEAVER HILL ROAD   WOODHOUSE    SHEFFIELD

      Persons present

      Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON (Chairman)                SYP (Operations Room)

      Police Sergeant________ (Secretary)                 SYP (Operations Room)


     Before the meeting commenced those present were invited to view the new
     SYFS Fire Control Vehicle which had recently been acquired. Facilities
     and ancillary equipment upon the vehicle were explained in detail and all
     agreed that it would be extremely useful at the site of any serious
     -incident.

     Whilst at the Training School the committee were then given a demonstration
     of the 'Major Fire' computer which actually simulated a major fire situation
     and it was agreed that there was potential to Lise the computer on a joint
     emergency services exercise.

      1       MINUTES OF PREVIOUS MEETING

              The minutes of the meeting held on 12 January 1989, having previously
              been circulated, were unanimously accepted as being correct.

     2        MATTERS ARISING

              There were no matters arising from those minutes.

     '3       SYFS FIRE CONTROL VEHICLE

              The Chairman thanked Mr Hornsby for allowing the committee to view this
              vehicle and also thanked him for Lise of the facilities at the Training
              School that afternoon.

     4        COMMUNICATIONS MOBILE TELEPHONE LINK

              Mr Hornsby explained that part of the equipment on the new control
              vehicle was a telephone network which would allow the Police, Fire and
              Ambulance Services to have direct line coirmunication with each other.
              It was agreed that this would be a great asset. The Chairman suggested
              that Inspector Woodhead should liaise with the SYFS Coirmunications
              Officer to work out a set procedure for the Lise of the telephone link.

     5        VODAFONE - ACCESS OVERLOAD CONTROL

              Mr Trueman referred to correspondence he had received from Racal
              Vodafone which dealt with the possible overloading of the airspace that
              could be created by excessive Lise of such telephones during a



          I
    major incident. The company were notifying that it was possible to
    give priority to certain users provided that the priority 'phones had
    been pre-programmed and two schemes were available. There was an
    'Exclusive' and a 'Managed' scheme which could be invoked and it was
    suggested that the 'Managed' scheme of £500 per event would be
    sufficient to emergency service needs.

    Inspector Woodhead stated that he had also had similar correspondence
    and that the 'phones used by SYP had already been pre-programmed but
    SYP had not registered with Racal Vodafone which was necessary to be
    able to use the service. The question of 'who pays' was not clear and
    it should be possible for one fee to be paid which would give priority
    to all 'phones used by the three services.

    The document was not clear on this point and it would be expensive if
    each service had to pay £500 each for their 'phones to be on priority.

    Mr Mellor stated that SYFS were on Cellnet and not Racal but they were
    aware that there was the possibility that some conversion was on the
    cards.

    The Chairman said that we obviously needed to make further enquiries
    about the schemes available by speaking to the company and it was
    acknowledged that such a 'priority' Lise of the 'phone would be required
    in a major incident. Mr Trueman and Inspector Woodhead to liaise on
    the matter and report their findings in due course.

6   DISASTER SHELTER

    The Chairman reported that SYMAS had purchased an inflatable shelter
    and that he had been fortunate enough to have seen a demonstration of
    its erection that morning. Mr Wade stated that the shelter would be
    used as 'on-site' accommodation for the treatment of casualties in large
    scale incidents. There was a floor space of 28 square metres, had
    integral lighting and had its own generator. The cost of the whole
    package was approximately £4,000 and could be erected in six minutes.
    Mr Wade said that it could be viewed and demonstrated to any interested
    parties if they so wished.

    The   Chairman stated that the shelter could serve many Lises and was ideal
    for   on-site accommodation at short notice. There was potential for
    the   Lise of such equipment by all three services and Mr Wade was thanked
    for   his open invitation.

7   JOINT TRAINING SESSION

    Mr Wade explained that SYMAS conducted one day symposiums on the subject
    of major incidents for their staff and asked if the other services could
    provide an input.

    Superintendent   Anderson said that SYP would provide an officer from
    Operations and   Traffic Division who would be able to discuss major
    incidents from   a police point of view. Mr Hornsby stated that the SYFS
    had previously   attended such synposiums and they would continue to do
    so.
FUTURE MAJOR INCIDENT EXERCISE

The Chairman stated that future joint exercises were a must and he knew
that everyone concerned was enthusiastic that exercises should continue
to take place, especially in view of recent problems and developments
highlighted in past incidents.

Mr Hornsby suggested that we could perhaps make use of the SYFS 'Major
Fire1 computer for a simulated exercise and it would be a good idea
for the Police and Ambulance Services to liaise with the Training School
personnel in formulating such an exercise.

Superintendent Anderson agreed that the Police were interested in taking
part in such exercises and in the first instance a computer based
exercise would be advantageous and could form the basis of an on the
ground mock exercise. Mr Reilley said that SFFS ran 9 pre-planned
exercises per year that the other two services would be welcome to
inject any input they may wish.

Mr Hornsby suggested that a mock major incident involving an aircraft
could possibly be arranged with the assistance of RAF Finningley with
whom they had excellent liaison. It was agreed that this would be the
type of incident we should aim at, an air incident being one of the
likely major incidents to affect South Yorkshire, especially in view
of the planned airport in Sheffield.

The Chairman summed up by agreeing to liaise with the SYFS Training
School Conmandant, Mr Curtis, together with Mr Wade, in order that a
computer based exercise could be drawn up. Plans for a future exercise
could be started as well as participation in the scheduled exercises
being arranged by the SYFS.

HOAX '999' CALLS

The Chairman stated that recently there had been problems by an apparent
increase in hoax calls especially to the Fire Service. The areas,
namely Goldthorpe and Ecclesfield, had had particular problems and the
Police and Fire Services had formulated plans to trace the persons
concerned. The Chairman said that for some reason the operator at Fire
Control was not asking enough information from the caller of a suspected
false call and that operator was then not giving full information or
voicing their suspicions to the Police Operations Room.

Sergeant_______ [suggested that the SYFS should ask their operators
to take more detail as a matter of course and not only take extra detail
when there was a 1campaign1. Mr Reilley agreed stating that he also
believed insufficient detail was taken at Fire Control. Mr Mellor


reported that the Fire Service received 3,000 malicious calls in 1988
and they were keen to reduce the number. Mr Trueman said that when
BT were fully computerised the BT operator would have a digital readout
of the telephone number from which the call was being made and tracing
a call would become much easier.
     Mr Hornsby accepted that there was a problem in this field and one of
     the reasons for brief details being taken was to expedite the call and
     despatch an appliance to the incident. Mr Hornsby stated that he would
     explain the problem to their          and ask him to liaise with Mr
     Edmundson.

10   TEMPORARY DANGER AREAS AND RESTRICTION OF FLYING

     The Chairman referred to correspondence from the Home Office concerning
     the flying of aircraft over the site of a major incident. The document
     explained that if a major incident occurs it may be dangerous for air
     traffic to use the airspace near the scene. If the police officer in
     charge considers this to be the case he may invoke the Temporary Danger
     Area and restrict flying for the duration of the incident. This was
     mentioned for the information of the other two services.

     SYFS Major Disaster Plan

     Mr Hornsby stated that SYFS had revised their plan and the draft was
     ready. He provided copies for the Police and Ambulance Services asking
     for comments and suggested that if any alterations or additions were
     thought necessary then they liaise with Mr Mellor.

My Lord Jus’tice Taylor,

I am writing to inform you that the NATIONAL UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES
would wish to give evidence to the Inquiry into the Sheffield Football
Disaster.

The NATIONAL UNION OF PUBLIC EMPLOYEES is the major union for ambulance
staff in this country and members of ours employed in the ambulance
service attended the t r a g e d y . They would like to give evidence to the
Inquiry about their experiences that Saturday afternoon and express
our criticisms at the manner in which ambulance cover is given at large
sporting e v e n t s .

It is our view that extended trained ambulance crews with vehicles and
equipment including defibrillators should be on hand at such events and
that lives would probably have been saved had they been on duty that
afternoon.  Additionally, all large sports stadia should consult with their
local ambulance services about accident and emergency a r r a n g e m e n t s .

We would appreciate hearing from you about the arrangements to be made.

Dear Sir,

As a result of several incidents during the recent past, involving casualties
within Sports areas, I have decided to delegate one of my Officers the
specific task of liaison with the Football Clubs within the South Yorkshire
boundaries.

This Officer will have the task to ensure that advice and, if necessary,
training can be provided by this Service to members of your staff.  It is also
to be his responsibility to ensure that the South Yorkshire Metropolitan
Ambulance Service are totally aware of the geography of your ground and of any
Incident Plans which you may have drawn up in order to ensure the safety o     e
general public.

Obviously, in order for this task to be successful it is necessary for you to
accept,in principle, our involvement and I should be grateful if you would
consider this proposal and communicate with me when you have made a decision.

I will ensure that if you require a visit or any form of advice associated to
this suggestion an Officer will be made available to meet with you or your
colleagues to explain our intentions.

I look forward to hearing from you with any comments you may wish to make.


Y«jurs -faithfully,

            EVACUATION OF SPORTS STADIA

            I have pleasure in enclosing a copy of Appendix 'L ' of our Force Standing Order
            on the policing of football matches.   You will see that it incorporates most of
            the points made by Mr. Justice Popplewell following the Bradford Fire.
                     \

            I hope'that you can find the time to read through the Appendix prior to our
            meeting at Bramall Lane at 10.30 a.m. on Thursday 10 July 1986, as obviously it
            will assist our deliberations and hopefully, agreement, in respect of crowd safety
            during the forthcoming football season.
            I look forward to meeting you on Thursday but if there is any point on which you
            require further clarification, please do not hesitate to contact myself or

Dear Mr Chester

Following your recent telephone conversation with Mr         ~| on 28th July 1986
in regard to your Club supplying passes for Officers from the South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service> I am submitting the following information for
you to discuss with your fellow directors.

On the 16th July 1986 Mr 1         visited your Club along with two other Officers
from the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and Sergeant |   |
of South Yorkshire Police. The meeting was held with Mr ]    , Senior Groundsman.
After touring your complex and discussing evacuation plans with South Yorkshire
Police, it was felt that the Ambulance Service would normally only become involved
in any events after they had already occurred and therefore, slight delays could
be experienced on occasions in responding to the incident. To avoid this I would
ask if two passes could be supplied to the Ambulance Service which would enable
us to ensure that an Ambulance Officer was in your ground at all home fixtures.

There would be no cost to the Club for this facility, and it would improve ground
safety. In the event of any untoward occurrence my Officers would be in a position
to identify problems prior to them happening and would therefore be in a much
better position to respond to any emergency.

If you require any further information then please do not hesitate to contact
Mr f         on Rotherham 361581 extension 259, who will ask one of our
Offciers responsible for the safety of your ground to contact you.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir,

Do you provide the best standards of Ambulance Care for the large number of
Employees and Members of the Public whilst they are on your premises?

Major Sporting Events have always relied heavily on the resources which are
provided by the Voluntary First Aid Organisations.

We acknowledge the very valuable contribution which the St John Ambulance
and British Red Cross Society make. There are, however, areas where the
level of care which we can provide, of necessity, exceed those which can be
provided by the Voluntary Societies. These include Advanced Ambulance Aid,
Treatment   of   Fractures  with  the most     modern  equipment   available
(particularly Spinal Injuries),     Stabilisation of patients with Head
Injuries,    Intubation,   Intravenous    Infusion,   Cardiac    Monitoring,
Defibrillation and the Administration of Drugs.

Can we be of assistance to you ? If so, get in touch with Don Trueman on
Rotherham (0709) 828820 to discuss your requirements.

If we can't help with your immediate requirements, please place this letter
on file for any future occasion when we may be able to assist.

I am sure that you will be more than happy with any the facilities which we
are able to offer.

Yours faithfully,




A. Page.

National Secretary

Dear Sir,


Hillsborough Disaster
Our clients : South Yorkshire Metropolitan
Ambulance Service (SYMAS)



We have been consulted by SYMAS in connection with a News
Release dated 20th April, 1989, issued, with your approval, by
the Association of Chief Ambulance Officers, Scottish Region
to the Secretary of the Scottish Football League and the
Scottish Football Association.    The News Release was also
copied to or came into the possession of the media.

The News Release contained the following statement :

"To ensure that there is a professional emergency medical
response it is surely time that at all International First or
Premier Division Matches (and other similar large public
events) a professional Ambulance Officer should be on duty at
the site, possibly in the Police Command Post to initially
interpret the disorder in terms of potential for patient
injury and secondly to co-ordinate all patient care resources
effectively.

If this had taken place at Hillsborough and Ambulance Staff
directed to resuscitation, we are left wondering if the death
toll would have been as tragically high.H
26 April, 1989


This News Release was issued by your Scottish Region and
approved by you without reference to our client in particular
Mr Page, the Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer of SYMAS.
Had you checked the facts with our clients you would have
been informed that Station Officers Higgins and Eason were
present with an ambulance inside the ground from before kick-
off.    They were able to react immediately as the incident
developed, to "interpret the disorder in terms of potential
for patient injury" and to assist in co-ordination of
"patient care resources."

The facts relating to those Station Officers' and the many
SYMAS staff’s involvement will become clear from the Public
Inquiry.     However the News Release is inaccurate and
potentially severely damaging to SYMAS, its Officers and
staff and is highly defamatory of them.        The conclusion
reached by the statement carries the wholly erroneous
implication that our clients' staff were not "directed to
resuscitation" and that as a result of inactivity or
unpreparedness on our clients' part the death toll was higher
than it should otherwise have been.        Nothing could be
further from the truth, and nothing more defamatory and
damaging (both in terms of morale and damage to reputation
and standing) than that conclusion.

With a view to mitigating the damage caused by the News
Release we require you and the Secretary of your Scottish
Region to publish forthwith a correction in a form equally
prominent to that of the original News Release.    The terms
of that correction must be approved by us and issued to each
of the recipients of the original.

Please contact Mr Chappell at this office immediately upon
r e c e i p t of this letter to agree the wording of the
correction.      In the meantime our clients' rights (including
those as to damages) are reserved.

Yours faithfully,
                                                                DIBB L U P T O N

   9. Chapter 3 deals with the working of the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975, and the need for further
regulation to protect the public who attend sporting events, from fire and the hazards of faulty construction.
Unfortunately, these are not the only hazards to spectators at sporting events nowadays, and in Chapter 4
I turn to the serious problem of violence.

   10. In my Interim Report I said that your Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (the "Green Guide")
contained so much good advice that it should be compulsory reading for all sports ground management.
That opinion holds good, but as the last edition of the Guide was published in 1976, and as it is so
important a source of advice, I decided to follow your suggestion and look afresh at the whole document
to see if it should be revised, or if it could be improved. The Inquiry commissioned research from three
consultants—Professor Canter, Professor of Applied Psychology at the University of Surrey (on human
behaviour in emergency situtations and its implications for the design and dissemination of information);
Professor Happold, Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Bath (on technical building aspects);
and D r Woolley of the Fire Research Station, Borehamwood. (on fire precautions matters). The material
they produced was extremely useful and practical, and I am indebted to them. This information greatly
assisted a special working group which I set up under Mr Killoran’s chairmanship to consider the Green
Guide. A record of the Group’s deliberations and membership is given elsewhere in this Report (Appendix
E>-      ,
   11. Chapter 4 deals with crowd control. In this chapter I look at the problem as it exists now, and make
a number of recommendations for new offences and for some increased powers for the police in relation
to sports grounds and hooliganism. In the light of my many visits to football grounds, and evidence from
a variety of football authorities and other bodies, I give my further thoughts on control of alcohol and on
membership cards. I also deal with the role which football clubs themselves should play in improving crowd
behaviour.

  12. In Chapter 5 I look at the extent of football hooliganism and several theories about its causes. I have
been much assisted in this task not only by academic research and evidence, but also by observing for
myself the behaviour of fans on the terraces and by listening to them when they came to give evidence
before me. But I have to confess to a certain lack of success in this part of my Inquiry.

  13. Finally, I believe that the paramount need is to protect the public by improving safety standards,
and thereby restoring confidence among those who attend sporting events. This means that effective steps
should be taken quickly. In this belief I commend my findings and Recommendations for your consideration.

                 FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD
                        SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS

                                                 Introduction

Sirs,
  1. On 13 May 1985 I was appointed to undertake an Inquiry with the following terms of reference:
        “To inquire, with particular reference to the events at Bradford City and Birmingham football grounds
        on 11 May, into the operation of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975; and to recommend what if
        any further steps should be taken, including any that may be necessary under additional powers, to
        improve both crowd safety and crowd control at sports grounds.”

  2. The. Assessors appointed to assist me were Mr Alan Goodson OBE, QPM, Chief Constable of
Leicestershire and Mr Martin Killoran QFSM, formerly Chief Fire Officer of Greater Manchester. They
have been of the greatest assistance. Their professional expertise and advice has been invaluable to my
Inquiry. Without their help my task could scarcely have been completed with such expedition.

  3. Neil Morgan was Secretary to the Committee. He has contributed enormously to the smooth running
of the Inquiry by his constant good humour and efficiency. Mark de Pulford and Jill Hales have both
shown the twin virtues of the Civil Service, intelligence and hard work, and they have been ably assisted
by Jane Osborn. Nathalie Austrie has been our efficient personal secretary.

   4. At an early stage of my Inquiry I decided to prepare an interim report giving the results of my
investigations into the events at Bradford and Birmingham, together with some preliminary recommenda­
tions on safety matters and crowd control. This was done so that safety levels could be improved quickly,
before the start of the new football season in the middle of August 1985. In a list of provisional
recommendations I also gave a tentative view on a number of longer-term issues which I proposed to
follow up in this my Final Report. My Interim Report was submitted to the two Secretaries of State and
subsequently presented to Parliament on 24 July 1985 (Cmnd 9585). I am grateful for the Government’s
quick and positive response to my Recommendations and to local authorities and sports management for
their subsequent action to improve safety.

  5. Since my Interim Report was published I have considered the written evidence submitted by a wide
range of organisations and individuals on the remaining aspects of my Inquiry. I have also heard oral
evidence from many of them. A full list of those who submitted evidence to the Inquiry is given in Appendix
A to this Report. I am grateful to all o f them.

  6 . During the course of the Inquiry the two Assessors and I have, between us, visited 31 soccer grounds
in England, Wales and Scotland. They are listed in Appendix B. We have also visited sports grounds
devoted to Rugby Union, Rugby League, cricket, horse racing, greyhound racing, athletics, tennis, motor
racing, stock car racing and speedway. In addition, we have visited indoor stadia.

  7. In this, my final report, I deal with five main subjects. The first, in Chapter I, is the disaster at the
Heysel Stadium in Brussels on 29 May 1985. It was agreed that I should take account of any lessons arising
from this tragic event, although the official investigation was, of course, a matter for the Belgian authorities.
I visited Brussels, together with my Assessors, and met the chairman of the Belgian Parliamentary
Commission which investigated the disaster and Madame Coppieters’t Wallant, the investigating judge,
together with representatives of the police, gendarmerie and fire service. All were extremely helpful, and I
am grateful to them, and also to the British Ambassador and his staff in Brussels for their assistance and
advice.

     8.      In Chapter 2 I review previous inquiries over the last sixty years into crowd safety and hooliganism
at sports grounds and conclude that there is still need for action:
                                               CHAPTER 1

                                            Tragedy at Brussels

   1.1 At about 7.30 pm on 29 May 1985, English fans charged into Block Z of the terrace at the Heysel
Stadium, Brussels, shortly before the European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus was due to
take place. There was a panic among the spectators in Block Z; as a result 38 people died and some 400
people were injured.

   1.2 It was agreed that I should take into account any lessons arising from the events at Brussels. In
doing this I do not intend to apportion blame. Neither do I propose to make any comments which might
prejudice any possible criminal proceedings.

   1.3 The official investigation into these events has already been carried out by a Commission of Enquiry
set up by the Belgian Parliament, which reported on 9 July 1985. At the present time Madame Coppieters’t
Wallant is carrying out an inquiry into the circumstances. She will be producing a confidential report,
which will be used purely to consider the prosecution of those alleged to have committed criminal offences.

   1.4 The death and injury of so many people must be the main subject of my investigation. However, it
is clear from all the evidence available to me that the behaviour of the crowds, both inside and outside the
ground, and before the match, as well as during it, needs also to be considered. So do the precautions
which the various authorities sought to take to prevent outbreaks of violence.

   1.5 I have had the opportunity, together with my Assessors, of visiting the Heysel Stadium and discussing
the matter with the Belgian and British authorities and with Liverpool Football Club. I have been provided
with a very large number of statements by those who were present, together with reports from Belgium
and a variety of official documents. I have also talked to Madame Coppieters’t Wallant. It will be obvious
that in the absence of a thorough and prolonged public enquiry the evidence available to me is somewhat
limited. It is bound to be fragmentary, and while it gives generally the broad picture it will not necessarily
coincide with the individual observations of everyone who was present. Indeed there are acutely differing
views about some matters. The lessons to be drawn are, however, reasonably clear.

The Heysel Stadium
  1.6 It was opened in 1930. It has been regularly used for football matches, including an international
football match a few weeks before the 29 May, between Belgium and France, at which the attendance was
about the same as at the Liverpool/Juventus game.

  1.7 The Stadium is owned by the City of Brussels and leased to the Belgian Football Association. There
had been no criticism by the Belgian Football Association nor by UEFA, who are the body controlling
European football, of the facilities at the ground or of the structure.

  “1.8 A plan of the Stadium is at Appendix C. There are two open terraces at each end of the ground
marked “X”, “Y” and “Z" and “O” , “N ” and “M” respectively. Between the two sets of terraces are two
stands. The stand marked Tribune 2 was built in about 1980. Apart from that, the Stadium is as it was
constructed in 1930. It is the largest of its kind in Belgium and provides facilities not only for football
matches but for athletics. -

  1.9 The terraces at “X” , “Y” and “Z” were formed of a slope of approximately 1 in 10 at the shallowest
and about 1 in 6 at the steepest. The surface o f the terraces was earth with only the nosing of the steps
being formed in concrete. Over the years the concrete nosing has deteriorated, and rusted re-inforcing bars
have been exposed. The edges were uneven and jagged where pieces of concrete had broken off. The general
condition of the terracing may be described as poor. The crush barriers showed signs of deterioration to
both the concrete uprights and the re-inforcement. On the day of the match the perimeter fence consisted
basically of two barriers. One was a brick structure; the other, on the terrace side, was wire fencing about
two metres high.

   1.10 There was a barrier dividing Block “Y” from Block “Z” . It consisted of two lines of tubular steel
hand rail fixed by metal straps to the top of the existing concrete crush barrier uprights. It thus formed a
passageway from top to bottom of the terrace. To one of the ^continuous hand rails were fixed fairly
lightweight steel posts approximately 2.5-3 metres high. Tied to the steel posts was plastic coated wire

                                                      3
mesh fencing. This composite construction, whilst forming a physical barrier, was not of sufficient strength
to resist the determined efforts to breach it. It was removed by physical force during the charge by English
fans from Block “Y” into Block “ Z” .

   1.11 The flank wall where the disaster occurred was about three metres high at its maximum, reducing
to just under two metres adjacent to the terrace. The brickwork wall did not appear to have been bedded
in mortar nor fixed in any other way to the concrete wall. The buttresses of the wall were such that they
would not assist in restraining the wall from movement when subjected to crowd pressure. It was not
constructed as a crush barrier. Not surprisingly, it was not adequate to act as such. The wall and perimeter
fence in front of the terrace were of fairly light construction which readily collapsed under the forward
pressure of the crowd.

   1.12 There were three places of entry and exit at the back of Blocks “X” , l'Y '’ and “ Z” and three single .
access doors from the terraces onto the pitch. There were no turnstile controlled access points, but some
control was exercised by gatemen. It was thus impossible to know the numbers going into each block or
to prevent overcrowding in one block. In addition there were gaps in the boundary walls through which
entry was effected by a number of spectators into Blocks “X” and “Y” .
           t
   1.13 Having regard to the state of the crush barriers and fences, and the general condition of the terraces
it seems unlikely, had it been located in this country, that a certificate would have been issued under the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 for this part of the ground. However, the poor state of the terraces
played no part in the tragedy.

The Arrangements for the Game
   1.14 By 24 April 1985 the finalists were known. A meeting was held by the Belgian Football Association
at its own Headquarters. There were present M. Roosens, the Secretary of the Belgian Football Association,
a number of police officers, a member of the gendarmerie and representatives of Liverpool Football Club.

   1.15 In Belgium the policing is carried out by both the local police force and by the gendarmerie, who
are a national body organised on military lines. The Brussels police were to be responsible for the area
including Blocks “O” , “N ” and “ M” , and the gendarmerie for Blocks “X” , “Y” and “Z” .

   1.16 It was agreed that the distribution and the positioning of spectators should be organised so that
English fans would be positioned in Blocks “X” and “ Y” of the terraces, in “ U”, “V” and “W” (in Tribune
2) and in “ A” , “F”, “ B” and “D ” (in Tribune 1). Juventus were to be accommodated in Blocks “O” and
“N ” of the terraces, in “Q”, “ P” and “W” (in Tribune 2) and in “ G” , “ L” , “ I” and “ K” (in Tribune 1).
It was agreed that each side would be issued with some 14,500 tickets of which 11,000 were for the terraces.

   1.17 It was arranged by the Belgian Football Association that Block “Z '' and Block “M” would be
allocated to neutral spectators, and Liverpool Football Club officials were told that a maximum of five
tickets per person would be sold to spectators. There was agreement that there should be a barrier put up
between Block “Y” and Block “Z’\ and another barrier between Block “N ” and Block “ M” . The Belgian
Football Association had agreed with the authorities that there should be at least one gendarme on each
of the steps of the segregation gangway between Block “Z” and the English fans in Block “Y” . These and
other matters were discussed, including the times of opening the ground and how English fans should
arrive. There were further meetings during May in Belgium and England. One matter which was agreed
was that there should be a ban on the sale of alcohol around the ground.

   1.18 Thus it was hoped that the English fans and Juventus supporters would be properly segregated and
that they would be physically prevented from being able to get at or to throw missiles at each other. They
would be contained within their own areas. However, the officer-in-charge of the gendarmerie at the ground
did not fully understand what his instructions were, nor unfortunately had he attended any of the meetings
preceding the game. In the result, for a number of different reasons, the gendarmerie presence between
Blocks “Y” and “Z” was insufficient.       *

   1.19 The advance intelligence was, broadly, that the English fans would present little or no trouble. This
had a marked effect on the precautions which were taken. Liverpool have a good record, so far as European
competitions, in which they have played for some 22 years, are concerned. Their management has long
experience and they sought to take the normal precautions to prevent the unauthorised acquisition of
tickets, to co-ordinate travel arrangements and to liaise with the Belgian authorities.
   1.20 So far as the sponsored travel arrangements were concerned, supporters were accompanied by
officers o f the British Transport Police. That generally seems to have gone off without difficulty. However,
one group of unsponsored supporters were refused passage by a Belgian vessel and there was a further
group of 400 unsponsored coach travellers who had apparently had a great deal too much to drink.

The Sale of Tickets for Block “Z”
   1.21 There were various alarms about the sale of black market tickets and forged tickets. One of the
matters of concern for the Liverpool Club was the sale of tickets for Block “Z” . By the UEFA instructions,
no blocks of tickets were to be sold at the venue of the match except in small quotas. What happened to
the sale of some of the tickets for Block “ Z” was described by M. Roosens. He said that there were some
3,000 tickets available for sale on the first day and they were put in the hands of a M. Desment who had
been selling tickets for the last twenty years. The sale took place at the Heysel Stadium, and a notice was
put up saying that they were available for 300 Belgian francs each and that the maximum which could be
purchased was five per person. When the staff arrived there was already a massive queue before sales had
started. M. Desment later walked through the crowds and noticed that there were more tickets being sold
to foreigners than to Belgians. He enquired from M. Roosens whether the sale should be stopped. The sale
was in fact stopped. By then they had sold 2,000 to 3,000 tickets.

   1.22 Because tickets were being sold from five different windows it was impossible to control who bought
them. It was quite clear from all the evidence that some organisations had been buying large quantities of
tickets. They did this by using a large number of their employees to take it in turns to go to the ticket
windows. M. Roosens agreed in evidence that people had left the Stadium with whole rolls of tickets.
Additionally, M. Roosens allowed 1,000 tickets to be sold to a director of a sports club committee who
apparently sold them to an insurance company which sponsored the club. One witness spoke of a travel
agent from Sicily with 60 tickets for Block “Z” which he was selling outside the ground at 100 times the
official price.

  1.23 It is quite clear that whether the tickets found their way onto the black market or not, a large
number of tickets for Block “Z” came into the hands of Juventus supporters. The effect was, therefore,
that all the careful preparations for the segregation of the English and Italian fans were rendered useless.

The events of 29 May
   1.24 It is not surprising that there is a great deal of conflicting evidence about the events of this day even
from experienced witnesses such as police officers. Contradictions about the behaviour of the English fans
before the game abound. I set out here as best I can some of the evidence presented to me.

   1.25 Elaborate arrangements were made within the Belgian authorities for meeting and escorting the
English supporters after their arrival in Belgium and on the train. Unfortunately, because of the timetable
which the shipping companies operated, large numbers of English fans arrived in Brussels well before kick-
ofT.

    1.26 The behaviour of the English fans in the centre of Brussels gave a foretaste of what was to happen
later in the day. It is only necessary to refer to one or two incidents so as to give an idea of how some,
albeit a small minority of the English supporters, were behaving. It is said that about 2,000 supporters had
taken over the Grand’ Place and the surrounding area. They were throwing beer bottles at the Belgian
Police, they were spitting, they were hurling beer at cars. One witness described the Grand Place as looking
 like a broken glass factory. One supporter, who had drunk too much and was v/earing a toy British police
helmet, stood at a nearby cross-roads directing traffic, thereby causing severe dislocation of traffic. A
jeweller's shop was robbed by English fans. Other fans were bathing in the fountains. A witness described
a grocer’s shop being pillaged. The steps of the Stock Exchange were invaded. A number of English fans
arrived at Jette from the train. They already had drink with them, although a good deal of it was
confiscated. They tried to get into the buses provided for them without paying. In this they were unsuccessful
 because the bus driver simply refused to drive them. A very experienced senior British police officer
 described the conduct of the English fans as the worst he had ever seen.

   1.27 Other witnesses, however, gave a totally different picture. Some supporters have written to say that
while there was some noise, the general behaviour was good, the atmosphere friendly and relaxed, and that
far from the police standing by while something akin to a riot was taking place, the police were heavy
handed, interfering with people who were merely singing and enjoying themselves and treating both sets
of supporters to an excessive display of authority.

                                                        5
    1.28 Yet other witnesses talk of a carnival atmosphere with British and Italian fans fraternising freely
 with each other, taking photographs and exchanging mementoes and favours. This view was supported by
 a senior police officer to whom I spoke when I was in Belgium.

 Events at the Stadium
    1.29 The first incident recorded in the Brussels Police Report took place at 3.55 pm when some of the
 temporary fencing, which had been erected all round the Stadium, was knocked down by Juventus
 supporters. It was erected to enable the Police more easily to search fans. It was about a kilometre long,
 comprising fifty sections. By about 4 pm about thirty or more sections had already been knocked down.
 This was not, apparently, considered serious by the police, because it was only intended to provide a buffer
 between the supporters and the ticket barrier. The police and gendarmes intended to search fans near the
 outside fence with a view to confiscating sticks or other weaponry. It is perfectly clear from all the evidence
 that there were insufficient police or gendarmes to search all spectators. Additionally it was wholly
 impossible to search people and at the same time to make sure that they did not retrieve weapons that had
 been confiscated.

    1.30 There is a great body of evidence that the searching was perfunctory; that because of the absence
 of turnstiles and the presence of holes in the perimeter wall, a large number of people got into the Stadium
 without tickets; that those who had tickets inside were able to pass them back to those outside who did
 not. Weapons which were confiscated earlier were retrieved. The weapons varied. There were sticks used
 to carry flags, pieces of tree trunks, bottles and stones. Additionally, it is dear that a number of spectators
 had had too much to drink and a ban on the sale of alcohol outside the ground was not enforced. Bottles
 of drink were on sale at a number of stalls, thus providing more ammunition for the fans.

    1.31 At 5.15 pm there was a police report that some of the perimeter fence in Block “N ”, occupied by
 Juventus supporters, had been cut. At 5.46 pm there was a report that Italian supporters were beginning
 to vent their anger on the police. At 5.55 pm there was a report that there was general disorder in Block
 “O", that supporters were becoming agitated and that 200 of them were beginning to get worked up,
 hurling insults at the police in the segregation gangway. A few minutes later there was a mass invasion of
 Block “ M” by supporters because Blocks “O” and “N ” were full.

     1.32 Commissioner Meura of the Brussels City Police said that some of his officers inside the stadium
,_were. pelted with missiles by the Italians, who were attempting to use riot tactics, surging forward en masse
  and retreating. He decided that what he must do was to protect the pitch and, although some of the
  perimeter fencing intended to protect the pitch was knocked over, he succeeded in preventing a pitch
  invasion. However, some 27 police were injured as a result of concrete and metal objects being thrown at
  the Juventus end of the ground.

   1.33 The Police report records a request at 7.06 pm for re-inforcements in the gangway of Blocks “N ”
 and “ M” , where the situation suddenly took a turn for the worse. And the report continues:
       “ It should be noted that the relative calm in the upper parts of sections “N”, “ M” and “O” only served
       to camouflage the jeers and provocation which a few hundred Juventus fanatics were directing at the
       police lower down. They began to cause trouble between 5.55 pm and 7.25 pm; initially in a fairly
       moderate way, there was a ^ hour during which insults were being hurled at the police and the supporters
       were trying to break through the fencing (Heras fencing shaken several times). The police in the gangway
       could not prevent 5 to 6 metres of fencing from being torn down at about 7 pm. Then 30 metres were
       forced and trampled down so as to give direct access to the track. All this despite the use of shields and
       truncheons by the police, several of whom were injured. It should also be noted that stones and/or tumps
       of concrete and some beer bottles, 20 in all, were raining down onto the track. Some hooligans from
       amongst the supporters were even running up to the police with sticks and iron bars.”

    1.34 The report describes one hooligan at the Juventus end getting through the fencing and onto the
 pitch itself and sprinkling salt between the goal-posts; and there is a report of another incident when a pair
 of hand-cuffs were taken from a police officer by a hooligan who got onto the pitch; subsequently they
 were returned. Although it had been arranged that Juventus supporters should have Blocks “O” and “N”
 and that “ M” should be allocated to neutral supporters, it is clear that Block “M” was occupied by
 Juventus supporters. Both the police and the gendarmerie described to me the behaviour of the Italian fans
 up. to this stage as worse than that of the English fans.

    1.35 What meanwhile was happening at the other end of the ground, in Blocks “ X” , “ Y” and “Z”? The
 first signs of unrest among the English fans appeared during the youth match which had been organised
to keep the spectators occupied; this occurred somewhere between 6.15 pm and 6,30 pm. The English fans
fired flares and rockets and threw stones into Block “Z”, which was beginning to be occupied by what
were clearly Italian supporters. There was also a number of English fans in Block “Z” who sought to
escape into Block “Y” . According to Captain Mahieu, who was in charge of the gendarmerie responsible
for patrolling the area between Block “Y” and Block “Z”, everything was calm between 6.15 pm and 7
pm. Accordingly he had gone out of the Stadium; so too had Lieutenant Bonnet who was his second-in-
command, to investigate a criminal complaint and to see about closing Block “X” . It appears there were
about 15,000 spectators in Blocks “X” and “Y” and about 5,000 in Block “Z” .

  1.36 There is no doubt but that somewhere between 7.15 pm and 7.30 pm English fans charged Block
“Z” . Preceding this there had been an exchange of missiles between Blocks “Z” and “Y” . There were three
charges by English fans. The first two seemed to have been repulsed; the third resulted in the Italian
supporters in Block “Z”, who were seeking to escape towards the perimeter, being squashed and suffocated
by the press of large numbers.

Extreme Political Parties
  1.37 There was evidence about the presence of supporters from the extreme right. The Mayor gave
evidence at the Inquiry that he had seen British and Italian spectators wearing the political insignia of
parties of the extreme right and carrying flags. One British supporter, himself a referee, said that the ground
outside the Stadium was littered with British National Front leaflets, some overprinted by the British
National Party with their address. Qne witness spoke of passengers on the boat crossing the Channel with
National Front insignia singing songs of hatred and exhibiting violence. *

   1.38 Mr John Smith, Chairman of Liverpool Football Club, spoke of how six members of Chelsea
National Front had boasted to him of their part in provoking the violence and said that they seemed proud
of their handiwork. Mr Bob Paisley, a former manager of Liverpool Football Club, said that he was forced
to leave the Directors’ Box at the start of the game as dozens of fans poured over the dividing wall and
that the person next to him claimed that he was a Chelsea supporter and was wearing a National Front
badge. A number o f banners decorated with swastikas were recovered after the match, including one
marked “Liverpool Edgehill” . There was also evidence that the flag of a right wing organisation, “New
Order” , was being flown by a small group of Juventus fans. A banner with “England for the English” and
“Europe for the English” was observed and a contingent of the National Front were clearly seen in Blocks
“X” and “Y” . One party leaving Brussels main station was observed to be Londoners wearing Liverpool
colours, carrying Union Flags and having National Front and swastika tattoos.

  1.39 Apart from their presence, there is very little hard evidence that they caused any of the violence.
Commissioner Meura said that he had not seen anyone from any extreme right wing organisation wearing
any insigna. On 5 July a press statement was issued by the Merseyside Police which said:
      “There is ho evidence to suggest that any National Front members were involved in the riot at the Heysel
      Stadium in Brussels.*’

What lessons are to be learned?                   —
1.40 A Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry was set up in Belgium on 12 June 1985. It reported on 9
July 1985. ‘

   1.41 The Commission concluded in this way:
      “It should be emphasised from the outset that it was the British supporters who mounted the disastrous
      charge into Section “Z”. They bear the main responsibility for the terrible events that followed and this
      must remain the case for whatever blame might be attributed to others as having aggravated the matter.

   An extract from their conclusions appears in Appendix D.
  1.42 When I spoke with M. Collignon, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry m
Brussels in November, he told me that the only matter in his report that on reflection he might like to a ter
was to make rather more criticism of the Belgian and European football authorities and less of the individual
members of the gendarmerie.
   1.43 In his principal statement to Parliament about the Heysel disaster, the Belgian Minister of the
 Interior said:
     “Everyone knows that those guilty of the violence, those responsible for the deaths of the victims, are
     the violent groups among the English supporters.”

  He also referred to the
     “collective responsibility of English society which tolerates this violence and tries to channel it without
     wanting to eliminate it.”

  He said that the organisers of the match were the second group of people responsible. With regard to
the role of the police and gendarmerie, he said that the overall plan had been adequate. He acknowledged
that there had been errors in execution and announced measures to improve training and equipment to
remedy these deficiencies. He added that if in future a larger police deployment was necessary, he would
prefer to ban matches. He did not want to turn Brussels, even for a day, into a police state, for the sake
of those who liked to manifest their violence.

  1.44 The lessons to be learned from the disaster can be summarised in this way:
 (aj It is essential that opposing fans at matches such as this should be properly segregated so that there
     is no possibility of their being within attacking distance of each other. Missiles from rival supporters
     caused enormous problems and contributed in no small way to the disorder which occurred. So f a g ^
     as domestic football is concerned, that means ensuring either that there is an unoccupied sp a c ^ ^
     between opposing factions or that the physical method of securing segregation is such that they are
     unable to attack or bombard each other with missiles.
 (b) Sales of tickets need to be properly controlled so that segregation can be effectively enforced. One of
     the problems of all-ticket matches is that ticket touts may be able to purchase numbers of tickets and
     sell them indiscriminately; the effect of this is to put the whole segregation policy at risk. Police need
     to be aware if this occurs. In Scotland any person who in a public place touts for the purpose of
     selling so as to give another person cause for annoyance commits a criminal offence under the Civic
     Government (Scotland) Act 1982.
 (c) It is clear that a large number of spectators, particularly the English, had consumed substantially too
     much drink, and that they were able to take drink into the ground. This is now covered by the
     provisions of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 in England and Wales and by
     the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980.
 (d) In addition to the fact that a number of fans were able to get into the ground without paying, most
     of them were also able to get in without being effectively searched; if they were searched, they were
     able to recover weapons which they subsequently used. This is particularly relevant to the power of
     the police to search at sports grounds in the United Kingdom.
 (e) While the structure of the police in Belgium is different from that in Britain there was obviously
     breakdown in communications and instructions both prior to and during the course of the match.
     was accepted by the Commandant of the gendarmerie that mistakes had been made. The important
     lesson for us to learn is that there needs to be strict co-operation between the football club and the
     police; that the police need to lay down and observe fixed procedures and that the communications
     need to be efficient. There was also criticism at the lack of liaison between the Headquarters outside
     the ground and those inside the ground. There needs to be good early planning with close co-operation
     between all the relevant authorities and clear decisions made. Those who are to be in charge on the
     day n~ed to have taken part in the planning and to clearly understand their role.
 (0 Another lesson which can be learnt is that in order to enforce segregation, apart from physical
    barriers, it is necessary to have present a sufficient number of properly instructed police to take
    effective action at the first sign of trouble. If there are perimeter fences, they should contain an
    adequate number of doors in them; they need to be manned and to be opened immediately in the
    event of an emergency.
 (g) It is clear that, notwithstanding the previous good record of any particular club, those who go to see
     that club play can readily behave like hooligans, particularly when affected by drink. Unfortunately
     a previous good record is no guarantee of good behaviour in the future.
 (h) The final and most important lesson, which I cannot too strongly or too frequently emphasise is that
     if hooligans did not behave like hooligans at football matches there would be no such risk of death
     or injury.

                                       EUROPEAN CONVENTION

  1.45 In August 1985 “The European Convention on Spectator Violence and Misbehaviour at Sports
Events and in Particular at Football Matches” was agreed. It has at the moment been signed by ten of the
parties. It has been ratified by four.
  1.46 The key points are that the Contracting Parties shall:
     1. co-ordinate the policies and actions of Government Departments and other public agencies against
     spectator violence and misbehaviour (Article 2);
     2 . secure that adequate public order resources are employed to counter outbreaks of violence and
     misbehaviour near and inside grounds and along transit routes used by spectators; and facilitate co­
     operation and exchange of information between police forces of different localities (Article 3.1);
     3 . seek to ensure that offenders (especially visidng supporters) are identified, prosecuted and that they
     receive appropriate penalties (Articles 5 and 3.1(c));
     4 . encourage the co-ordination of travel arrangements to inhibit potential troublemakers from leaving to
     attend matches (Article 3.3);
     5 . introduce procedures to identify problem matches in advance and for effective co-operation between
     authorities and clubs on precautions and measures to be taken (Article 4);
     6 . encourage the use of stewards in supporters’ clubs for crowd control and information (Article 3.2);
     7 . press football and local authorities and stadium owners and clubs to* take the necessary practical
     measures for problem matches, eg in the design, improvement and selection of stadia, segregation, alcohol
     control, ticket sales, the exclusion of drunks and troublemakers etc (Article 3.4);
     8 . encourage football authorities to review their regulations continuously (Article 6.3);
     9 . looking further ahead, take social and educational measures to promote the more positive side of
     sport, eg fair play and active participation (Article 3.5); and
     10. establish a standing committee to police the operation of the Convention and to propose improvements
   — (Article 8 ).         ~

   1.47 This is a blueprint for European football, which has lessons for our domestic game.

                                         History o f previous Inquiries

  2.1 When my Interim Report was published, it might have been thought by some that the suggestions
which I set out had only recently been considered. It was said to be unfair to expect the football clubs to
have taken earlier steps to arrange their affairs. It was urged that they should now be entitled to more time
and more money in order to deal with the problems of crowd control and safety at their grounds. The
problem of crowd control and safety had, so it was said, suddenly arisen. I have to say that almost all the
matters into which I have been asked to inquire and almost all the solutions T have proposed, have been
previously considered in detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period of sixty years.

The Shortt Report
  2.2 On 11 June 1923, the then Secretary of State for the Home Department asked the Rt Hon Edward
Shortt KC to form a Committee to inquire, amongst other things, into arrangements made to deal with
the abnormally large attendances on special occasions, especially attendances at athletic grounds. This
arose from disorder which occurred at Wembley Stadium on the occasion of the first Cup Final bn 28
April 1923. The Committee reported on 13 March 1924. The Report was presented to Parliament and
published as Command Paper 2038 at the princely sum of 6d.

  2.3 About responsibility for control inside grounds the Report had this to say:
     “As regards the general question of the apportionment of responsibility inside the ground as between the
     police and the ground authority, the principle to be followed should, in our judgment, be that the police
     should be responsible for all matters appertaining to the preservation of law and order and that for
     arrangements for the convenience of the public the ground authority should be responsible. It is, however,
     most important not only that the police arrangements should be under the control of a single officer, bat
     also that the duties for which the ground authority is responsible should be assigned to a definite
     individual, who should be competent to give instructions and to deal with any incident which arises. If
     responsibility is definitely allocated in this manner it appears to us that, in ordinary circumstances, there
     need be no difficult)' in this division of duties and that no disadvantage need result from the existence of
     dual control so long as the closest co-operation is maintained between the two authorities at all times.
     We are of the opinion, however, that if any emergency arises or there appears to be the slightest
     probability of a disturbance, it is essential that control should pass into the hands of one individual, and
     we recommend that, in the case of grounds providing accommodation for more than 10,000 persons, on
     all occasions when specially large attendances are anticipated or for other reasons unusual excitement
     is to be expected, arrangements should be concerted beforehand by which one individual can at any
     moment take control of the situation.”

  2.4 That paragraph of the report continued:                                                                ^
     “The question in such circumstances would have become one of the preservation of law and orderJma
     we therefore have no doubt that the control should then pass into the hands of the senior police officer
     present, and we consider that such officer would be justified in any circumstances, whether in accordance
     with a pre-arranged scheme or not, in assuming control if he considered it necessary for the purpose of
     the restoration of order. As part of the arrangements for this purpose we think that, in the very large
     grounds, there should be a central control box in telephonic communication with all parts of the ground
     and that the principal police and ground officials should be stationed there so that they may be in constant
     touch with the situation.”. . . (Paragraph 22).

  2.5 About stewards the Report said:
     “We understand that there is no uniform practice with regard to the employment of stewards at sports
     grounds, that in some cases they are only used to show spectators into the seating accommodation, and
     that, in cases where stewards are employed for packing of the standing room, they are only employed
     when there are specially large crowds. We consider it desirable in the interests of safety that, for the
     purpose of handling a crowd, stewards should be employed in any case where the crowd is likely to
     approach the capacity of the ground. For seating accommodation stewards should always be employed.
     It is in the highest degree important that any such stewards should be properly trained in their work and
     intimately acquainted with the part of the ground placed under their charge. We doubt whether it is
     practicable to secure suitable men for this purpose unless they are given continual experience in the

                                                       10
        work, and we therefore recommend that every ground with a capacity exceeding 10,000 which provides
        terraced accommodation for its spectators should maintain, or have a call upon, an adequate staff of
        efficient stewards, and should ensure that they keep proficient by requiring them to perform duty at
        frequent intervals. Stewards should be organised as a disciplined body and should act under the contro
        and supervision of their own officers. They should wear a distinctive badge of authority, which they
        should not be able easily to discard.” (Paragraph 27).

     2.6 The Report had this to say about precautions against fire:
         “We have been somewhat surprised to find that in many cases little or no precaution is taken against
         the risk of fire in stands* We do not suppose that either the risk or the consequences of fire wou d be so
         serious in an open stand as in a closed building, but we consider it most important that adequate
         arrangements should be made to deal with any outbreak which might occur.” (Paragraph 40),

         but concluded generally:
         “We are assured that these governing bodies are only too anxious to secure that their sport is carried
         on under conditions which will promote the public safety, and we feel that at this stage it is safe to eave
         the matter to them.” (Paragraph 47).

    The Moelwyii Hughes Report
      2.7 The next report (published as Cmnd 6846) arose out of the disaster at Bolton Wanderers Football
    Ground on 9 March 1946. Mr R Moelwyn Hughes KC was appointed by the then Home Secretary to
    conduct an enquiry into the circumstances of the disaster which arose by the presence of some o3,UUU
    spectators. 50,000 had been expected. Because of the press of people in an enclosure two barriers collapsed
    and 33 people were killed.

      2.8 It is interesting to observe that the previous best attendance at Bolton in the 1945-46 season had
    been 43,000 and it was amply policed by a force of 60. On this occasion there were 103 police to control
    85.000 spectators, which is about l / 10th of the present ratio of police to spectators at football grounds,
    both, inside and.outside the ground.

      2.9 Mr Hughes made a number of recommendations. He said:
         “Burnden Park is tvpical of most home grounds of the leading football teams in the country. They have
         grown stage by stage from humble beginnings on sites acquired when the large gates of these days were
         not anticipated, or when the clubs had not achieved eminence. It would be idle to suggest that the grounds,
         or large sections of them, should be rebuilt, but if they are to be made reasonably safe and if th en sk o f
         repeating the tragedy of Burnden Park is to be avoided, then, I have formed tne clear view that the
         following steps must be taken . . . ” (Page 10).

®     2.10 The recommendations included inspections of the enclosures, scientific calculation of the maximum
    number to be allowed entry, counting those entering the ground by mechanical means an cen r
    ordination of the system, all to ensure the admission of a safe number of spectators.

       2.11 So far as future regulation was concerned the Report said:
          “The preceding safety measures cannot be secured without legislation. A Departmental Conunittee
          reporting on CrowdsYo a previous Home Secretary in 1924 (Cd 2088) anaemically^ommend^i d u
          adequate provision for safety be left to the pressure of t h e g o v e r n i n g bodies in sport. The most
          important of these was, of course, the Football Association, which had not deigned to appear before the
          Committee. . .
          The legislation should empower the Home Secretary to issue general regulations for different kinds of
          grounds and the broad conditions necessary for safety.
          No ground of any considerable size should be opened to the public until it has been licenced by, I suggest
          as an appropriate licensing authority, the local authority . The issue of the licence wou       epen p
          satisfying the authority as to the construction and equipment of the ground, its compliance with reBulat o
          and the proposed maximum figures of admission to the different parts.

       2.12 Mr Hughes went on to say:

                                                            11
      “Compliance with the recommendations of this Report will cost money. They will involve grounds in a
      loss of gate money on popular days . . . The insurance for greater safety for the public demands a
      premium.”

Mr Hughes ended his report by saying:
      “I earnestly hope that, if the proposals I have made in this Report, or similar suggestions, commend
      themselves to you, Parliament will not be slow in granting you the necessary powers.” (Pages 11-12).
The Chester Report
2.13 Mr Hughes’ words fell on deaf ears. It was another 22 years before there was a further report
commissioned by the Government on the problems of football. In June 1966, the then Secretary of State
for Education and Science appointed Mr Norman Chester CBE, as he then was (Warden of Nuffield
College, Oxford), to chair an Enquiry. His terms of reference were:
     “To enquire into the state of Association Football at ail levels, including the organisation, management,
     finance and administration, and the means by which the game may be developed for the public good; and „
     to make recommendations.”
   %                                \
2.14 Mr Chester made this observation about crowd behaviour:
      “In recent years there has been an increase in disorderly behaviour by spectators. During the p e ri^ ^
      1946-1960 there were 195 cases brought to the attention of the FA, an average of 13 per season. In the
      following six seasons 148 cases were reported, an average of 25 per season. The matter was discussed
      some time ago at a meeting between representatives of a number of police forces (including the British
      Transport Police), the Football Association and the Football League. Both these governing bodies have
      been very concerned at this development.”
2.15 The Report continued:                                                                                      -
      “We have not been able to devote the time and resources to the study of this problem which its complexity
      deserves. We very much welcome the initiative of the Birmingham Research Group, of which Dr J A
      Harrington is Research Director and have been fortunate enough to see the Group’s preliminary report.
      We are sure that its findings will be of value to all concerned.” (Page 97).
The Harrington Report                                                                   -
2.16 This was made to the then Minister of Sport. 1 It observed:
      “Some spectators carry knives, hammers, sticks and spikes, choppers, and other offensive weapons like
      powdered pepper which are not necessarily used for violent purposes but may be used in threatening
      displays. There is also the problem of singing or chanting bawdy or obscene songs and phrases some of
      which are also threatening and provocative.” (Page 8 ).

2.17 About riots the Report said:
      “While such riots must be regarded as almost unknown accompaniments of football in this country, their
      potential seriousness and danger were exemplified recently by football riots in Turkey, where many
      people were reported killed. While comparable riots seem unlikely here, it would be foolish to rule out
      the possibility' of much more serious crowd disturbances at football matches than we have yet experienced.”
      (Page 9).

2.18 The Report regretted inactivity thus far:
      “The question of public safety and crowd control at football matches was dealt with by a departmental
      committee report published in 1924 (Cmd. 2088) and the inquiry into the disaster at the Bolton Wanderers
      Football Ground in 1946 (Cmd. 6946) . . . Unfortunately the most helpful suggestions in these reports
      have often been ignored, though the committee’s recommendations do carry some weight with boards of
      football clubs.”
  2.19 The Report went on:
      “The absence of national legislation outlining minimum standards of safety and amenity at football
      grounds means that some club managements do not feel obliged to put their grounds into a state
      considered by the police to be necessary for crowd control.” (Page 33). ________________

 2.20 And continued:
    “We feel that improved ground facilities would not only help to deal with the hooligan problem but do
    something towards its prevention. Clubs often seem keener to spend money on the purchase of p ayers
    than to undertake any major spending on ground improvement which would increase safety an ^ma *e.
    hooligan control easier. The loss of revenue which a club may suffer from alterations may be the
    determining factor. There is of course no obligation on a club to convert a ground which can accommodate
    50,000 to one which takes a smaller number in conditions of greater safety and comfort. Letters from
    members of the public suggest that already some are staying away because of their dislike of poor
    facilities, overcrowding, and disturbances, so that the neglect of ground improvement may ultimately be
    self defeating.” (Page 34).

 2.21 So far as responsibility is concerned, the Report said:
    “We think that those responsible for club management and the governing bodies of football should accept
     far more responsibility for keeping their crowds in order. This applies not only within the stadium itse
     but to club supporters travelling in groups to and from matches. One gets the impression that some clubs
     disclaim inv responsibility for the behaviour of their supporters and if the atmosphere of a Roman
     holiday is not deliberately fostered it is looked on with considerable tolerance. Football matches are
     commercial enterprises conducted for profit on private premises and clubs have therefore a heavy
     responsibility for keeping order and safety for the public on their premises.” (Pages 3 5 - j o ) .

  2.22 In its summary the Report concluded:
     “The solution of the problem of hooliganism in the football stadium is ultimately the responsibility of
     individual clubs who must each deal with it in the light of local circumstances. While a few clubs are
     exemplary in their attitude to the problem others are laissez-faire and need persuasion to take a more
     active role in trying to control hooliganism in their own grounds. This laissez-faire attitude does not he p
     the police in their attempts to deal with the matter.” (Page 56).

The Lang Report
  2.23 Shortly thereafter, a Working Party under the chairmanship of Sir John Lang
a number of distinguished members, was appointed by the then Minister with special                    ■
Sport to examine the problems involved in football crowd behaviour to which attentionhad beencalleda
few months previously by the Harringtori Report. Sir John’s Report was presented on 21 November 1969.

  2.24 By way of introduction it said:
     “The Working Party was dealing with a subject which has been discussed almost ad nauseam during
     recent years. Not unexpectedly the Working Party has not found a single simple solution for a problem
     which is often due to a combination of factors . . . ” (Page 3).
  2.25 The members of the Inquiry witnessed the demonstration of CCTV equipment and reported.
      “. . . the view was formed that closed circuit television could be of value in the             c™*dt
      control and . . . would be an important factor in preventing misbehaviour by P ^a to rs at f “      “
      was a refinement which most of the top class clubs could be expected eventually to have as a matter
      course.” (Page 9).

   2.26 About alcohol the Report said:
      “There can be no doubt that consumption of alcohol is an important factor in crQwd m.bbchaviour^both
      because i. sHmula.es ,u a„elSomea«ss and because empty bo..les are d a n g e r s          iere »ou d
      be no advantage in refusing licence facilities to football club grounds-this would merely snmu.a
      spectators to bring their supplies from outside. (Page 14).

 The Wheatley Report
    i ? 7 o n 4 February 1971 the Rt Hon Lord Wheatley was asked by the then Secretary of States for the
 Home Department and the then Secretary of State for Scotland to mak%a".*nd^                      °f the
 effectiveness of existing arrangements for crowd safety at sports Srour\  , , ,     and t0’C0nsider the
 improvements which could be brought about within the present framew               >            at Ibrox
 nature of any alterations in the law which appeared to be needed. This arose from the disaster
 Park where 66 spectators died.
     2.28 On 16 March 1972 Lord Wheatley completed his Report and it was presented to Parliament and
   published by HMSO as Cmnd. 4952.

      2.29 The Report contained a technical Appendix. Following the Report, the Safety of Sports Grounds
   Act 1975 was passed. A licensing system involving the issue of a safety certificate for designated grounds
  - was introduced and supporting guidance (the Green Guide) was published. In his Report Lord Wheatley
   said:
         “I recognise that a decision to introduce a licensing system for grounds along the lines I have recommended
         may cause anxiety to some football clubs and footbuii administrators. As I see it, their misgivings are
         associated with a fear that such stringent conditions might be attached to the granting of a licence that
         many clubs may not be able to afford the cost and some may have to go out of business.” (Paraeraph
         66).

      2.30 “ My answer to that is this. My task was to consider the problem of crowd safety at the grounds. Clubs
         which charge the public for admission have a duty to see that their grounds are reasonably safe for
         spectators. That is a primary consideration. It is accordingly necessary that some standards should be
         imposed and observed. This has been recognised by the football authorities themselves . . . I have
     , canvassed all the alternatives that have been proposed or which I personalty thought were reasonable to
         consider, and the one which I decided was best to meet the situation in the interest of the public is tte
         licensing system by a local authority. There is nothing new in this proposal. It has been mooted j P
         almost fifty years. It can come as no surprise to the football world, and in the light of happenings over
         the years the demand for an independent appraisal and determination of the safety of grounds becomes
         almost Irresistible. I certainly cannot resist it.” (Paragraph 67).

      2.31 Lord Wheatley ended his Report by saying:
         “ I trust that this Report may be of assistance to you in deciding what should be done to solve this
         important question of crowd safety in football grounds. One thing is certain. The public demand for
         something to be done has been growing over the years. I am sure I am reflecting public opinion when I
         say that something must be done now. The evidence certainly supports that view.”

   The McElhone Report
     2.-32 In October 1976 the then Secretary of State for Scotland asked Mr Frank McElhone MP to chair
   a Working Group on Football Crowd Behaviour
         “to consider the problems caused by some Scottish football supporters and to make recommendations
         to the Scottish Football Association and other organisations concerned.”

   Among the membership of the Working Group were representatives from the Football authorities, from
   the football clubs and the Strathclyde Police.

      2.33 In the introduction to the Report1, Mr McElhone said:
          “There is no simple solution to the problem; it is but one of the manifestations of anti-social behaviour
          besetting society in general today. We have however in our findings arrived at a number of conclusions
          and recommendations which we hope, given a commitment to implement them on the part of all those
        • most closely concerned, will go some way towards reducing the problem of hooliganism at football
          matches and by so doing turn football grounds once again into places of entertainment where parents
          can take their children to enjoy, in relative comfort and safety, the pleasures of our national game.”

      2.34 The Report observed that:
         “ A hooligan is a hooligan no matter where he operates and the fact that his behaviour is conspicuous at
         a football match has very often nothing to do with the game itself.” (Paragraph 4).
   Mr McElhone saw the problem as one of trying to reduce, or at least contain, the incidence of hooliganism
   at football matches without restricting the pleasure of the majority of supporters.

       2.35 So far as drink was concerned, the Report recommended that it should be an offence for a spectator
. - to carry or attempt to carry alcohol into a football ground; that it should be an offence to be in possession
    of alcohol within the ground or to attempt to gain admission while drunk. The Report recommended that
          '■1 11 •"   ■'   ■   **:        ..— —     —   —   ■ — i,- .       -   m   ---- -,..   .   -   -—

more people who were physically capable of carrying out the duties of enforcement would have to be
recruited and suggested that, in their recruitment of stewards, clubs should look to their supporters’ clubs
to assist in providing the kind of men required for the job. So far as transport was concerned, the Report
recommended that it should be an offence for anyone to be in possession of alcoholic liquor on a vehicle
hired specifically for the purpose of carrying passengers bound for a football match; or to allow any
alcoholic liquor to be carried on a public service vehicle being used for the purpose of carrying passengers
to football matches; or to allow the carriage of any drunken person on such a vehicle bound for a football
match.

  2.36 So far as the separation of supporters was concerned the Report recommended:
     “That In the interests of crowd control and safety, separation of rival supporters at turnstiles should be
     carried out if the police, in consultation with the club, consider such a step to be necessary; that for
     matches where larger than average attendances are expected, sufficient turnstiles should be opened
     timeously in order to achieve speedy admission:” (Recommendation 13).                                   *
     In order to protect the players, match officials and the pitch, access to the playing area should be made
     as difficuitTas possible. To prevent an invasion of the playing area by spectators . . . the erection of a
     physical barrier in the form of a fence not less than 1.8 metres in height with access points to aUow the
     pitch to be used if necessary for the evacuation of spectators in an emergency.” (Paragraph 53).

  2.37 A further recommendation was that:
     “the Courts should make full use of the higher fining powers under the Criminal Law Act 1977 in respect
     of common law offences which include malicious mischief, breach of the peace and assault, these being
     the most common offences associated with football hooliganism, and in respect of persistent offenders,
     should normally impose imprisonment without option.” (Recommendation 19).

  2.38 The Report recommended that:
     “The police should have statutory powers to search for any containers . . . in the possession of any
     person entering or attempting to enter football grounds.” (Recommendation 24).
but went on to point out that the clubs must bear their share of the responsibility for the behaviour and
conduct of their staff at all levels:                                                  ...

  2.39 Among other observations the Report says this:
     “ We recognise that many football grounds in Scotland are very old; some could even be described as
     primitive in that not only do they lack any kind of comfort for spectators but they, also lack basic
     amenities including adequate toilet accommodation. This primitive environment encourages some people
     to react in a primitive manner. Moreover there is a strong case for more seating accommodation. In our
     view it would go a considerable way towards reducing hooliganism; potential trouble spots could be more
     quickly recognised and identification of troublemakers by police would be made that much easier.”
The-Report therefore recommended:
     “that clubs should consider the provision of additional seating accomodation. In addition clubs must
     provide adequate toilet facilities for men and women and generally improve amenities for spectators.”
     (Paragraph 88).                 -

  2.40 This Report also recommended that:
     “players should be encouraged by the clubs to extend their voluntary public relations work in the
     community including personal appearances at youth clubs etc and coaching sessions in schools with the
     objects of promoting the game and the concept of good sportsmanship.” (Recommendation 37).
CCTV was recommended and supporters’ clubs encouraged. The Scottish Football Association was
recommended to take appropriately firm action against clubs.

Department of the Environment VVorking Group
  2.41 The most recent Government publication on the subject of football is the Report of an Official
Working Group on Football Spectator Violence set up by the Department of the Environment, which was
published by HMSO in 1984. The Working Group was set up following serious incidents of violence

                                                     15
 involving British supporters at England’s soccer matches in Luxembourg and France in November 1983
 and February 1984 respectively. It dealt partly with problems arising out of international football.

    2.42 However, as regards domestic football the Report said:
       “the Group reaffirmed the importance of consistent planning, preparation and co-ordination; of building
       on experience; and of the need to consider afresh all possible measures, including those previously thought
       to be impractical or unnecessary.” (Paragraph 5.1).
       “We recommend therefore that the FA reviews and better defines its powers and procedures and the
       responsibilities of the clubs. If their powers prove to be inadequate, the Association should consider
       enhancing them.”
 The Report went on:                                                                                    - -
       “This would better equip the FA to implement some of the recommendations.” (Paragraph 5.5).

    2.43 The Football Association had issued a “blueprint” detailing the precautions which league clubs
  should take against violence, which was circulated to clubs at the beginning of the 1983-84 season. The
  Working Party Report said that it:                                                                   ^
         . . has not been rigorously adopted by all clubs. Since it represents the collective wisdom of footbMr
       dubs, many of whom have successfully countered serious threats of violence, its implementation should
       have prevented some of the violence in grounds last season.” (Paragraph 5.7).                           '

     2.44 The Report observed that the enforcement by the Football Association of its “blueprint” occurs
  after the event when the deficiencies in a club’s planning has become apparent. The Report recommended
  that:
       “improved means should be found for ensuring that clubs adopt the provisions of the “blueprint” in a
       way appropriate to their own grounds and matches.” (Paragraph 5.7).

     The Report went on to recommend that each club should produce a detailed set of plans to be
   submitted to the football authorities for endorsement. This would prevent some clubs from avoiding their
-.responsibilities and might ensure also a more co-operative and committed response.

     2.45 The Report recommended that matches between high risk clubs should be programmed so that the
  risk or threat of violence could be reduced. The Report said:
       “It is more likely to take place at the beginning and end of the season and at holiday periods, particularly
       at seaside fixtures when other groups of young people sometimes also clash with football supporters.”
       (Paragraph 5.13).

    2.46 The Report went on to recommend the introduction of club membership, the introduction of CCTV
  and closer links with the community. It did not recommend that alcohol should be banned in grounds and
  concluded that in the absence of clear evidence that the introduction of legislation along the lines of the
  Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 would reduce violence at English soccer matches, it could not
  recommend such action. Furthermore, said the Report:
       “legislation of this kind would be unwelcome to many; the majority of football clubs are untroubled by
       violence and would unnecessarily be penalised financially and the vast majority of non-violeni spectators
       would suffer for the actions of the few.”(Paragraph 5.34):

   The Working Group did not recommend additional measures for banning alcohol on trains or on football
 coaches.

  Conclusion
   2.47 A study of all these reports (and there are numerous reports and discussion papers by other bodies)
 shows that the following are measures which have been frequently recommended:
       1. Closed Circuit Television
       2. Membership Cards
       3. Segregation

                                                        16
     4. More seating at football grounds
     5. Encouragement of supporters’ plubs
     6 . A ban on alcohol
     7. Involvement of the clubs with the community
     8 . Heavier penalties.

I too shall argue for these and related measures. It is to be hoped they will be more vigorously pursued by
the appropriate bodies than in the past.

                                       Future safety at sports grounds

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
  3.1 The terms of reference of my Inquiry require me to comment upon the working of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975. The Act was introduced in 1975 to give effect to the recommendations of an
Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds. This Inquiry, under the chairmanship of Lord Wheatley,
was set up in February 1971 following the tragedy at Ibrox Park in January 1971 when 66 people died as
a result of pressure from massive crowd surges on a gangway towards the end of the match.

  3.2 The main concern of the Wheatley Report was, understandably, with crowd safety in the context of
the hazards of uncontrolled crowd movement, with the measures appropriate for mitigating such risks and
with the provisions of a regulatory system to ensure that necessary safety measures were taken.

  3.3 The statutory framework of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, providing for local authority
certification of designated stadia, follows broadly the pattern outlined in the Wheatley Report.   ^

... 3.4 My enquiries into the working of the Act have shown that in the designated stadia it has proved
  effective in securing improvements in safety. Until August 1985,-however, the only stadia designated were
  those with accommodation for over 10,000 in Divisions One and Two of the Football League, the Premier
  League in Scotland and certain international football and Rugby League stadia. In August of this year,
  following the tragedies at Bradford, Birmingham and Brussels, designation was extended to Divisions Three
  and Four of the Football League and to Divisions One and Two of the Rugby League.

   3.5 The provisions of the Act have not been applied to the remainder o f stadia and grounds in England
and Wales and Scotland. I find that neither it, nor the Home Office/Scottish Home and Health Department
Guide associated with it (the Green Guide) have been successful in raising the levels o f safety at the non­
designated grounds. I have the clear impression from my various enquiries that until the tragic events at
Bradford, Birmingham and Brussels, the Green Guide was disregarded by the non-designated clubs. There
has, however, been an upsurge of interest since these events took place and there have, of course, been the
further designations referred to above. These developments do not themselves, in my view, yet assure a
proper standard of safety for the public at sports stadia and grounds. They do, however, provide a climate
in which, if prompt action is taken, a proper standard can be set and maintained. It is to be hoped that
this opportunity will not be missed.

   3.6 In his Report Lord Wheatley identified the various problems in the grounds relating to crowA
pressures and gradients in covered stands as well as the more acute risks that such factors presented o™
the standing terraces. He also drew attention to the dangers peculiar to stands, such as the risk of fire,
which normally do not arise on open terraces. Lord Wheatley went on to say: “Many of the stands used at
present were built years ago. The materials of which they are built, their design and the use to which the
accommodation underneath is put, may constitute fire risks. Thus while events in recent times have highlighted
the dangers in the terracing and its exits, the potential dangers in stands are self-evident.”

   3.7 The level of spectator accommodation currently required before a stadium can be designated is not
an indicator of all the risks identified by Lord Wheatley as being present in sports grounds and stadia.
Whilst it is acknowledged that a designated ground will have all safety matters attended to, there are
present, on many non-designated grounds, stands capable of accommodating large numbers of spectators.
If these grounds do not qualify for designation, the risks, in particular those associatd with fire, will not
receive the systematic attention that they should.

  3.8 There is, therefore, a need to reconsider the application of the safety controls at sports grounds. To
ensure the safety of persons attending it will be necessary to provide a wider measure of control in future
over sports grounds, sports stadia and indoor sports arena than currently.

  3.9 There is no wish on my part to add unnecessarily to the burdens which those who organise and
manage the various sporting activities carry. There is, however, a real responsibility to ensure that those
people who attend sporting events can feel confident that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure
their safety in case of emergency.

                                                     18
Future designation and certification policy of grounds with accommodation of over 10,000
(i) "Stadia"!"Grounds"distinction
  3.10 The power under Section 1 of the 1975 Act to designate stadia as requiring safety certificates has
been applied only to the grounds of the four Divisions of the Football League in England and Wales, to
the two Divisions of Rugby League, to the Premier League in Scotland, and to a small number of major
international grounds where football is played. Three of the major grounds where Rugby Union is played
are also covered, Twickenham, Murrayfield and the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park.

  3.11 In my Interim Report, I provisionally recommended that there should be designation of those
grounds capable of holding over 5,000 spectators 1 and that indoor sports premises should also be
designated2. I have now had an opportunity of reconsidering the position on further designation after
hearing extensive evidence on the matter. I have had to take into account, for example, the financial
position of the smaller clubs and balance that against the general safety of the public.

  3.12 By Section 1(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, the Secretary of State may by order
designate as a'stadium requiring a safety certificate any sports stadium which, in his opinion, has
accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators. By Section 17, sports stadium is given a particular
meaning, namely “a sports ground where the accommodation provided for spectators wholly or substantially
surrounds the area used for activities taking place on the ground.”

   3.13 According to Section 17 of the Act, sports ground means “ any place where sports or other competitive
activities take place in the open air and where accommodation has been provided for specators consisting of
artificial structures or of natural structures artificially modified for the purpose.”

   3.14 There is, in my view, no logic in making a distinction for safety purposes between a sports ground
and a sports stadium, simply according to whether the accommodation surrounds, say, three or two sides
of the ground. For instance, a Bradford-type stand is just as dangerous to the occupants in a stadium as
in a ground. In my view, the limitation on the interpretation of sports stadium, namely that the structure
has wholly or substantially to surround the area used for activities, is a limitation which should now be
removed and the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 should apply to any sports ground as defined in
Section 17 of the Act. I recommend that the distinction between sports grounds and sports stadia be abolished.

(ii) Extension o f designation under Section 1 o f the 1975 Act
  3.15 Given the present structure of the Act, I first have to consider those grounds and stadia with a
capacity for accommodation in excess of 10,000 spectators but which are presently undesignated. Should
they all be designated? Or should the full procedure under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 be
limited to those sports where in addition to a fire hazard there is a general problem of crowd control?

   3.16 It has to be recognised that at any sports grounds or stadia there may be three potential hazards the
fire risk, structural failure and problems of crowd control. But it does not follow that all grounds with
accommodation for over 10,000 spectators have all three problems. There are sports stadia and grounds
where by reason of the activity and the atmosphere there is no crowd control problem. For them I see no
purpose in imposing the full certification process under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

  3.17 Lord Wheatley, in his Report, recommended (paragraph 56) that the licensing system should be
phased as follows:         :
Category 1 (a) All International Grounds, ie Hampden Park, Ninian Park, Wembley Stadium, Cardiff
            Arms Park, Murrayfield and Twickenham.
            (b) All English 1st and 2nd Division Football League grounds and all Scottish 1st Division
            Football League grounds.
 Category 2 (a) All English 3rd and 4th Division Football League grounds and all Scottish 2nd Division
            Football League grounds (unless in Category 1).
            (b) Rugby League grounds.
 Category 3 Grounds of other Soccer Clubs and Rugby Clubs of either code with a capacity of more than
            10,000 spectators.         ____________ ____________________             __________ ——
 1Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 6 .
 : Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 5.
Category 4 Grounds with a capacity of not more than 10,000 spectators, having structural accommodation
           such as stands for spectators.

   3.18 Apart from some clubs who were then in the Scottish 1st and 2nd Division (as they then were called)
all grounds in Categories 1 and 2 have now been designated. Rugby League grounds which have already
been designated present a similar picture to Rugby Union grounds both in size and shape and in the
number and behaviour of their spectators. Currently, they have little or no hooligan problem. But safety
in the stands and on the terraces needs to be considered, having regard to the movement of large crowds
which some Rugby Union games attract. Accordingly, it seems to me right that Rugby Union grounds
with accommodation for over 10,000 spectators should now be considered for designation.

  3.19 The other sport which attracts large numbers and has problems of crowd safety similar to Rugby
Union or Rugby League is cricket. Also at some grounds an element of “ football” hooliganism has started
to appear on some occasions particularly at the one-day games. Lord Wheatley concentrated on the
problems of crowd safety at soccer grounds and also considered Rugby League and Union. Understandably,
he did not consider other sports such as cricket.

   3.20 Having regard to the large number who attend some cricket matches and to the risk in terms of
(Jrowd safety that their attendance presents, it seems to me to be right that those cricket grounds which
have accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators should also be considered for designation.

  3.211 have considered other sports where accommodation for spectators exceeds 10,000. At present there
appears to be no real problem arising from crowd pressure or hooliganism at these sports. I conclude
therefore that it is unnecessary to impose full designation under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
on any other grounds with accommodation for over 10,000 spectators.

  3.22 It has been suggested that the general system o f control of sports grounds might best be governed
by the Fire Precautions Act 1971. The fire service representatives who gave evidence argued that it would
be very much better if all matters relating to fire precautions were dealt with by them under one single Act.
At first sight that has much to commend it. But there is also an argument that all matters of safety in
sports grounds should come under the umbrella of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

   3.23 The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 has now been operating satisfactorily for a number of years
at designated grounds. It seems to me sensible that large sports grounds requiring a safety certificate should
continue to be dealt with under the Act. I am concerned, where possible,"" that all sports grounds requiring
a safety certificate should come under the umbrella of a single Act. It is now not feasible for the designated
grounds under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act to be dealt with by any other legislation. Accordingly, /
recommend the further designation o f sports grounds or stadia with accommodation fo r over 10,000 spectators
where Association Football, Rugby League, Rugby Union and cricket is played in England and Wales and
Scotland, under the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975.
(iii) Regulation o f sports grounds!stadia not designated under Section 1 o f the 1975 Act

   3.241 turn next to consider the question of those numerous grounds where the accommodation provided
for spectators is,below the 10,000 figure, and those with accommodation over 10,000 which are not
recommended for designation. Nevertheless, there exists in many of these grounds stands which may
accommodate several thousand people. An outbreak of fire could expose large numbers of people to serious
risk of injury unless statutory provision is made for their safety in such an event. What then is to be done
about the risk of fire at sports grounds and stadia which fall outside the system of designation, either
because their capacity is below 10,000 or where tl.eir capacity is over 10,000 and Association Football,
Rugby League, Rugby Union or cricket is not played?

  3.25 The question then is firstly, what system shall govern those grounds with accommodation below
10,000 , and those not recommended for designation with accommodation over 10,000 and secondly, at
what level of capacity the line should be drawn. One possibility is that grounds and stadia not designated
under the 1975 Act, but having seating capacity in a stand for over 500 spectators, should be designated
under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Another possibility is by the application of the “self compliance”
procedure. (See paragraphs 3.29 and 3.30).

  3.26 In July 1985, you published a consultative document—“A Review of the Fire Precautions Act
1971.” It was arranged that my attention should be drawn to it so that I might consider its relevance to
my Inquiry into the operation of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

                                                      20
      3.27 In paragraphs 3.57 to 3.63 of my Interim Report, I dealt with the position of the fire authority at
   law under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Two matters in the Consultative Document, which are of
   particular relevance to my considerations, are these. Because of the administrative workload of fire
   certification under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, and the failure of the Act to discriminate between the
   degrees of risk, it is suggested in the Consultative Document that what is needed is a more flexible and
   discriminating system of fire precautions control under which premises which pose the greatest risk to the
   safety of occupants in the event of fire can be identified. Secondly, the system should enable resources to
   be devoted to improving fire safety in premises which pose unsatisfactory fire risks, without having to
   devote equivalent attention to premises where standards are acceptable.

     3.28 At present, hotels, boarding houses, factories, offices, shops and railway premises are designated
   under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Fire authorities inspect these premises and issue a fire certificate with
   which the owner or occupier must comply. Sports grounds and sports stadia as such are not currently
   designated under the Act.

      3.29 Put shortly, the proposal in the Consultative Document is that the Secretary of State should have
   power to designate premises by class of use similar to that contained in the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
   Those which are designated would first have to be registered; then an obligation would be imposed upon
   the person responsible for the premises to achieve and maintain reasonable standards of fire safety. For
   this purpose he would be provided with advice in the form of an approved code of guidance. Thus the
   present fire certification process would be replaced by a system requiring the occupier to comply with the
   requirements of the Act by a specified date. The fire authority would have a duty to inspect and re-inspect
   after the said date to ensure that the occupier had in fact complied with the requirements of the Act.

      3.30 This type of approach to compliance with the requirements of safety legislation (which for ease of
   reference I call self compliance) has not received universal approval among those to whom I have talked.
   However, for the purpose of application of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 this approach may have
   some significance.

     3.31 The Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales and the Firemasters in Scotland have already carried
   out a detailed survey of a large number of sports grounds and stadia which were not designated under the
   Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

     3.32 The returns from the Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales about the extent of restrictions or
   prohibitions they had imposed on the use of outdoor sporting venues of all kinds, show that by 17 August
   1985 there were restrictions or prohibitions applying in some 106 grounds. In some cases Section 10 of the
   Fire Precautions Act 1971 had been used. In others, Section 77 of the Building Act 1984 (which gives
   district councils certain powers in respect of dangerous buildings) had evidently been used and no doubt
   Section 10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 had also been invoked.

       3.33 A total of 228 non-designated sports grounds were inspected by Firemasters in Scotland. In August
^ p 9 8 5 it was found that in about'half of the grounds the fire precautions arrangements were unsatisfactory.
    At none of the clubs in the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the Scottish Football League were the fire precautions
    found to be satisfactory. Six out of twenty needed significant work done to improve fire safety levels.

      3.34 Having regard to the lack of safety precautions at sports grounds disclosed in evidence to me, it
   would in my view be a mistake to leave to sports grounds’ management the discretion of “self compliance.”
   1 therefore recommend that a ll sports grounds and sports stadia not designated under the Safety o f Sports
   Grounds Act 1975 and having a capacity in a stand o f over 500 should be designated under the Fire Precautions
   Act 1971 as premises requiring afire certificate.

     3.35 The thresholds of 10,000 or of 500 are bound to be arbitrary and this is no more than an empirical
   approach. I have to exercise my judgmental best I can. It is an attempt to balance the expense of inspection
   against a reasonable degree of safety. It has to be remembered that the fire authority already have some
   control over non-designated sports grounds by virtue of Section 10(l)a of the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
   Similarly, local authorities have some control under Section 10(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
   1975.     -

     3.36 Some anxiety has been expressed about the additional expense which would be incurred by further
   designation and questions were raised about resource implications. However, the authorities have already
   done the inspections necessary to ascertain the problems in many oF the grounds and substantially to

                                                        21
remedy them. Although further expense and time will be required if there is to be certification of all sports
grounds with accommodation for over 500 spectators in a stand, nevertheless some of the ground work
has already been done. The speed and efficiency with which the Fire Authorities have acted in carrying out
the inspections is much to be commended and should allow for the early implementation of further
designation.

   3.37 I have given consideration to the possibility of using the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975 in relation to non-designated sports grounds and sports stadia. As I have said, it may be argued
that it is more appropriate to use, if possible, the 1975 Act and have all sports ground and sports stadia
under one Act rather than to apply the provisions of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 or in relation to
structural safety, the Building Act 1984 or the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.

   3.38 An additional difficulty may arise if the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is amended in the near future
as a result of the proposals contained in the Consultative Document. Then the issue of a fire certificate
under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 could create an anomalous situation in respect of other sports grounds
or stadia which might be inspected after, any changes in the legislation. It would, of course, be for
consideration, as and when the suggestions in the Consultative Document are implemented, whether the
Sfclf compliance scheme (as I have called it) would be sufficient to deal with the risk of fire at a sports
ground or stadium. I do not comment on that. It is not, of course, possible for me to anticipate wflfe
legislation would be introduced or how the Act might emerge after debate. If, however, after debate it
appeared that the fire certification process could properly be replaced by the self compliance scheme in
relation to sports grounds or stadia, then no doubt you would-be aidvised that that was the proper course
to take.

  3.39 However, I have to deal with the position in relation to the non-designated grounds and stadia
now. I have to take account that at grounds or stadia not designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975 there may still be stands of the Bradford type; unless they are subject to adequate statutory
control in the immediate future unacceptable risks may remain. Thus it seems to me that, until the legislation
governing fire precautions has been amended or consolidated, my recommendation about designation under
the Fire Precautions Act 1971 of sports grounds and stadia should be implemented.

   3.40 However, if it were possible under the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to
introduce some form of certification for those grounds and stadia not designated, it would be logical that
all sports grounds and stadia should be under the umbrella of that Act.

  3.41 By Section 15 of the 1975 Act, you “may by order direct that any of the provisions of this Act which
are not expressed to apply to sports grounds other than sports stadia, shall, subject to such exceptions,
adaptations and modifications as may be specified in the Order,, extend to classes of such sports grounds”.
The effect of that is that you may apply to sports grounds, the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975. In particular, you may apply those provisions relating to a safety certificate subject to
exceptions, adaptations and modifications as you may specify in the Order. Thus, so far as non-designatea
sports grounds are concerned, it would be possible for you, by Order, to introduce a modified' safety
procedure for those grounds relating to structural safety, crowd control and fire risk. This would have the
advantage of covering the risks inherent at a sports ground.
  3.42 However, there is a difficulty in that Section 15 may not govern non-designated sports stadia. So
that, if you were to proceed by an Order under Section 15, it might still leave the problem of sports stadia
which are not designated, because Section 15 only applies to sports grounds which are not sports stadia.

  3.43 It may, of course, be possible for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to be so amended so as
to have all sports grounds and stadia under the umbrella of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. That
would make some sense.

   3.44 Additionally, it may be argued that by amending Section 1 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975, all stadia which are presently not designated (by reason of having accommodation for fewer than
10,000 spectators) could be subject to a certification process under the Act. However, this certification
process would have to be the full safety certification under the Act. There is no provision for a modified
certification procedure for stadia under the Act as appears possible for sports grounds under Section 15.1
have to consider the immediate problem, until the Act is amended, if it is. If it is thought that in the long
term an amendment is the most sensible method of approach, I have to say however that a designation
order under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 seems the only immediate step which can be taken to deal with
the fire risk now.

                                                     22
  3.45 Thus, while there are alternatives to the recommendations which I made in paragraph 3.34, they
require amendment to Acts of Parliament, and until those amendments have been made, I am firm y o
the view that my recommendation should obtain.

  3.46 Much the same point may be made about indoor sports facilities, as I shall explain below (see
paragraphs 3.53—3.59).

Structural safety of undesignated sports grounds and stadia
   3.47 I return to the question how best to ensure the structural safety of those grounds and stadia not
designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. It might be done by amending Section 15 ot the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 as I have already indicated. Unless and until that is done what are the
alternatives? It appears that there are three authorities who have the power to deal with breaches of
structural safety at undesignated sports grounds: the Health and Safety Executive (under Section o
Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974); a county council (under section 10 of the Safety ot bports
Grounds Act 1975); and a district council (under Section 77 of the Building Act 1984).

   3.48 It is alsd clear that while these authorities have the power to enforce provisions of their respective
Acts, they have no duty to inspect the premises to ascertain whether there haw been any breaches, i his
difficulty was highlighted by the events at Bradford referred to in my Interim Report.

  3.49 It is in my view essential that one authority, and only one authority, should have the responsibility
for the structural safety of undesignated sports grounds and stadia. If not, there will not on y e a
duplication of effort and waste of resources, but also a risk that no-one will in fact inspect these grounds
and stadia.
  3.50 The necessary inspection must depend on the perception of risk, particularly having regard to other
buildings within the jurisdiction of the particular authority. But a duty to inspect and ensure compliance
with reasonable standards of safety is necessary.

   3.51 The next question is on whom this duty is to be imposed. The Health                       E ^ u U w axe. ■
 reluctant to intervene where there is already specific legislation (in this case the Safety of Sport _      _
 Act’ 1975). They do not have the resources. Nor may they have quite the same expertise such a                y
 available to a county council.
   3.52 Alternatively, the duty could be imposed on a county council or district council Thisj s a matter
 upon which I do not have the evidence to judge, except to observe only that the c?un;y C0“ f                 yf
 have a team who are expert in structural safety at sports grounds. On the other hand I;nc£ t ^
 the powers of the Metropolitan Counties will shortly be transferred to ^ ctr? P ^ n
 Additionally, it is suggested in a Consultative Document pubhshed by the Health
 - “Draft proposals for revising the Health and Safety (Enforcing Authority) Regulations 19 ,
 of the powers of the Health and Safety Executive should be transferred to the district^council In 'h eresu .
 this must be a matter for Ministerial decision but I recommend that one authority >^                       ^
 responsibility fo r securing structural safety at undesignated sports grounds and stadia. The potential cons
 quences of long term neglect in this area do not need to be highlighted by me.

  (iv) Indoor facilities in England and Wales
     3.53 In my Interim Report I was minded to recommend that designation should be extended ^
  indoor facilities in England and Wales. 1 A survey has been undertaken by       i                .     M0St of
  premises (in Scotland 26 premises were surveyed) with' an overall ^spectator_capacity o v e r l ^ M o J o f
  the premises are used for more than one sporting activity, of which the               g            „ voue "ban
  boxing, wrestling, judo, karate, gymnastics, athletics, football, ter™ s’      .         a rrh e rv Yencinn and
' badminton, hockey, squash, weightlifting, billiards, snooker, darts, table tennis, golf,         ry,
   bowls as well as water, ice and equestrian sports.

    3.54 In England and Wales over 80% of the premises are licensed under ^ m o r T o f
  (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 or equivalent GLC legislation because on                       ,       e(j
  requires licensing. Numbers of s p o r t i n g activities within these premises will not, however, be cover a y
  their licence against fire risk.----------------                                                               ■
  ‘Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 5
   3.55 More than half o f the remainder are subject to liquor licensing and/or other legislation which
includes consideration of .the adequacy of fire safety measures, eg the Fire Precautions Act 1971, the
Theatres Act 1968, the Cinemas Act 1985 and local legislation in relevant parts of the premises. In only
five per cent of these premises does no fire safety legislation apply at any time.

  3.56 In 1983 there were around 200 fires in indoor sports premises in the United Kingdom. It appears
that at about half of these fires no-one was present at the time. In approximately 40 per cent of the total
cases the cause was suspected to have been malicious ignition or children playing with fire.

   3.57 These figures reveal that there is a fire risk at indoor stadia. There is no evidence to suggest that
there is a crowd problem, nor that there is a problem of structural safety. Accordingly, it seems to me that
what is necessary for all indoor sports facilities with accommodation for more than 500 spectators is a fire
certificate under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. It may be in many cases that nothing further needs to be
done. In others, it may be necessary for the protection of the public that further steps should be taken.
That seems to me to balance the risk to the public with the expense to those responsible for the indoor
sports facilities and also to bring the control of the fire risk at these premises within a single Act. Accordingly,
I recommend that all indoor sports facilities with accommodation fo r over 500 spectators should require afire
certificate under the Fire Precautions Act 1971.

   3.58 If, however, the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 or equivalent G L ^ I
legislation were amended to include all sporting and recreational activities, then I am satisfied that the
necessary control in relation to fire precautions could be assured. Unless and until the Act has been
amended in that way, I repeat that these premises should be designated under the Fire Precautions Act
1971 by Order and require a fire certificate.

(v) Indoor facilities in Scotland
   3.59 Fire precautions at indoor facilities in Scotland are governed by a number of different Acts. It is
by no means clear to me that all activities at indoor stadia in Scotland are presently covered by fire
regulations. Accordingly, I recommend an urgent review o f the existing legislation and i f there is such a gap,
indoor facilities in Scotland should be designated under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 and require a fire
certificate.

Section 10 and prohibition notices
   3.60 As I have indicated, I do not regard the proposals in the Consultative Document for what I call
self compliance as appropriate for premises covered by the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. There is,
however, an important proposal in the Consultative Document about prohibition notices which is highly
relevant to the application of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

  3.61 I had occasion, in my Interim Report (paragraph 3.60), to make some observations about the
of Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971. This section seemed to me to be available only when there
was an immediate risk of a fire taking place. The Consultative Document deals with this in this way:
     “32 In circumstances where an inspection revealed the existence of abnormally serious risk it is important
     that the fire authority should have power to prohibit or restrict the use of the premises until the necessary
     remedial action has been taken. So far as England and Wales are concerned the power currently available
     for this purpose under section 10 of the 1971 Act has not been wholly effective. Some of die defects of
     Section 10 are:
        (a) because of pressure on Magistrates Courts there are sometimes delays in obtaining the hearing of
        applications and some Courts insist on prima facie evidence before granting a summons;
        (b) considerable documentation is involved in cases where there are a number of occupants since they
        must each be summoned;
       (c) it must be demonstrated that the dangerous condition exists at the time of the court hearing.
       Consequently Section 10 procedures are not easily applied to situations which can be manipulated by
       the occupier to frustrate proceedings. Examples are the storage of inflammable material in exit ways
       and dangerous overcrowding at night;
       (d) in the event of failure to comply with the court order the only sanction is to proceed under the
       law of contempt which does nothing to remove the hazard which gave rise to the original complaint
       to the court.”


                                                       24
  3.62 I made a provisional recommendation at paragraph 3.61 of my Interim Report that Section 10 of
the Fire Precautions Act 1971 should be amended so that the fire authority could go to court, not when
the risk was so serious, but when the risk was an ordinary one. I hoped that the power would be exercised
in cases other than those which were regarded as exceptional. Additionally, I was minded to recommen
that there should be power under Section 10 to apply for an injunction to the High Court or for an interdict
to the Court of Session in Scotland.1

 3.63 The Consultative Document (Paragraph 33) recommends a simpler method of approach and one
which seems to me to be sensible. It says:
      “33 It is therefore proposed that provision should be made for authorised officers of the fire authorities
      to have a power similar to that accorded to Health and Safety inspectors under Section 22 of The Hea tn
      and Safety at Work Etc Act 1974 to issue a Prohibition Notice. The 1974 Act procedures have the
      advantage of being simple to operate and, because no court hearing is involved, of achieving the aim of
      restricting the use of premises with the least possible delay. Once issued, a prohibition notice has more
      impact than action under Section 10, and is evidence of the situation, which if continued or repeated,
      could Jead to immediate prosecution for failure to comply with the notice. As in the case of improvement
      notices, there would need to be suitable appeal provisions. Like Section 10 of the 1971 Act, the power
      to issue restriction or prohibition orders extend to any premises falling within the general class o use
      from which a particular use could be designated.”

   3.64 Accordingly, I recommend that provision be made in the Fire Precautions Act 1971 fo r authorised
officers o f a fire authority to have power to issue a prohibition notice. _

   3.65 A similar difficulty also arises in the application of Section 10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975. As I explained in my Interim Report, under the terms of this provision a court has to be satisfied
that the danger is so great that immediate action has to be taken. There are thus difficulties for the local
authorities who are responsible for enforcement in ensuring that some safety precaution is ta en y a c u
where there is no immediate risk of danger. It may be that the threat of Section lO has, an wi con inue
to persuade clubs to do what is needed. However, it is clear that recently some local authorities have been
requiring clubs to carry out certain expensive precautions which the club, °n professional advice, d° not
themselves regard as either being a problem, or as being an immediate problem. Thus ere - ^
conflict between local authorities and clubs, which may have an adverse effect on the sa y                  P.
grounds. In my Interim Report, at paragraph 3.76, I was minded to make a recommendation in relation
to Section 10 similar to my recommendation on Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 19 .
me, however, that the introduction of the power to issue a prohibition notice^ similar o * P f* ■ ■
the Consultative Document on the 1971 Act would be a sensible provision and / recommend that p
 be made in the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 for authorised officers o f the local authority to hase po*er
 to issue a prohibition notice in relation to sports grounds and stadia.

 Revocation of certificates; reinspections
   3.66 Once a safety certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 has been 'ssued thcre is no
 power for the local authority to revoke it. By Section 4(1) “the local authonty may, in :my              J h“ h *

    3.68 Nor is there any duty, under the Act, on the local authority to make a regular inspection. As a
  matter of practice it appears that some local authorities do make regular inspections. Representations have
  been made to me that in order to ensure that the provisions of the certificate are being carried out, there
  should be a statutory obligation to have an annual re-inspection. I therefore recommend (1) an annual
  renewal o f the certificate (2) a duty on the local authority annually to inspect the premises prior to re-issuing
  the certificate and (3) the power to revoke.
                                                                                                        i


  Composition of local authority team
    3.69 I have been generally impressed with how well the 1975 Act has operated in designated grounds.
  There have been some criticisms by the various members who make up the certificating team that their
  particular expertise has not been given the full recognition that it should. In any organisation, let alone
  several organisations, some difficulties are inevitable due to the personalities of those involved. But the
  teams for the most part have worked together well.

     3.70 The fire service have made representations to me about their position in the “ team”. They rightly
  say that it is the local authority who issue the certificate. When the local authority receives a copy of an
  application for a safety certificate, it is to the chief officer of police and the building authority for the area
  in which it is situated that a copy of the application is sent. The local authority are obliged to consult then^JP
  about the conditions to be included in the certificate. There is no express requirement that the fire service
  shall be similary consulted. They also point out that on the hearing of an appeal relative to the terms o f .
  the certificate, the local authority can be a party; so too can the-chief officer of police and the building
  authority and any other person who may be concerned in ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions
  of the safety certificate. But not the fire service as such. If there is an appeal against a court order made
  under Section 10, under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975, the local authority, the club, the chief
  officer of police and the building authority may be parties but again not the fire service as such.

    3.71 The powers of entry and inspection are given to persons authorised by the local authority, to the
  chief officer of police and to the building authority. Again the fire service do not have the same power
  unless it is delegated to them by the local authority.

     3.72 The fire service point out that though fire is one of the major risks at a sports ground, the fire
- -service is not identified as having any particular role in the issue of the safety certificate or its enforcement.
  (I am dealing now with the position before the abolition of the Metropolitan Authorities). They complain
  that even if changes are made to permit a local authority to issue a prohibition notice under the provisions
  of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, they will be unable to do it on the spot. They suggest that it
  will be necessary for the solicitor to the local authority to be contacted, and that there are times when he
  may not be readily available to give the necessary authorisation for the prohibition notice to be issued.

     3.73 I am unconvinced by this argument, particularly so since the fire officers produced no evidence to ”
  me as to any real problem during the years since the introduction of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
  1975. In the event that problems should arise in future because of the non-availability of the authorised
  local authority official, the matter can be speedily remedied by the local authority giving delegated powers
  to the chief fire officer.

    3.74 It was further pointed out when district councils are given the local authorities’ responsibilities in
  the Metropolitan County Council areas in 1986 there may be even more difficulties. I hope this is a needless
  anxiety. The elected local authority is, in the end, the body responsible not only under the Act but co local
  people. It would be possible for the local authority to delegate to each discipline the power to issue a
  prohibition notice - that must be a decision of each local authority. At the moment I do not accept that
  there is any problem in practice.

    3.75 The fact that the Chief Fire Officer is not named as a party to the Act is said, albeit by only a
  minority among fire officers who spoke to me, to give rise to difficulties. It is argued that because of their
  expertise the fire service should be in charge of issuing the certificate and in enforcing the provisions.

    3.76 It has to be pointed out that the fire service, important as it is, is but one arm of the local authority,
  which includes the surveyor’s, architect’s, engineering and building and legal departments of the local
  authority. The reason that the Chief Officer of Police gets a special mention, and the Chief Fire Officer
  does not, is due to the constitutional position of Chief Constables and for no other reason. I find it difficult
  to believe that simply because the fire service does not get specific mention in the Act it should not be able

                                                          26
to work harmoniously with other sections of the local authority; nor do I believe that if it were mentioned,
greater harmony would result. I do not believe that it should be given the leading role in the team. The
certification procedure is essentially a team exercise in which all the disciplines have to be consulted and
in which all have an equal part to play. I do not in any way underestimate the immense value of the fire
service but in my view the present system should continue. It would be a very unwise local authority which
did not obtain and take full account of the views of the fire service.

   3.77 The Society of Chief Building Regulation Officers also submitted evidence to me that its members
 should be responsible for the operation of the Act and that they are not, in fact, being consulted, on some
 occasions, as the Act requires.

    3.78 There is no doubt that the chief building regulation officers do have a very important role to play.
 Their duties include linked statutory controls over existing buildings in relation to the safety of users. They
 have responsibility for the enforcement of other legislation controlling safety in buildings which are licensed
 as places of public entertainment or for public exhibitions or certain sporting contests. It is obvious t at
 they, individually and collectively, have a large amount of expertise relevant to safety at sports grounds.
 They may well hive as much expertise, or Indeed more, than those who are part of the team at county
 level. They are physically closer to the actual grounds with which they are dealing.

    3.79 For reasons which no doubt appeared valid at the time they were not, however, given the task of
 leading the team, when the Act was passed. For my purpose it matters not what the reason was. The lact
 is that the present situation has now obtained for ten years and has been working satisfactorily. It is,
 therefore, quite impossible now to start again, nor right for me to suggest that the chief building regulation
 officer of a district council should take over this function of the county council. Of course the district
 council in the metropolitan areas will, from early 1986, be exercising the powers of the local authorities in
 respect of this Act previously exercised by county councils.

   3.80 The Society of Chief Building Regulation Officers has also suggested to me that the co nsultation,
 imposed upon the local authority under Section 3(3) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act              wi     e
 building authority, has not.in all circumstances been complied with. One of the difficulties that has oeen
 pointed out to me is that because of the geographical distance between the building authonty and the loca^
 authority, the level of consultation with the building authority may be less good than with the other
 interested parties. I should be unhappy to think that was so. I have no firm evidence that bui ing au on ies
 are not fully consulted; but if it is necessary to emphasise the necessity for consultation, I am happy so to
 do. :

  A model safety certificate
    3.81 I have seen a number of safety certificates. They vary enormously as to their detail. It would be
k useful if the local authorities could draw up a document which contains the conditions which most ceneraiiy
" need to be included. They will have to avoid the danger of their model being treated as containing on y
  minimal conditions or of a local authority treating the model as of universal application; each ground has
  different problems and a flexible approach is necessary. But guidance is               an“J
  Association of Metropolitan Authorities, Association of County Councils and the on
  Local Authorities will be able to draw Up a suitable model.

  The Green Guide
     3.82 I have been asked to review this document. I have had many representations as; to what should go
  into it. It has to be a document which is sufficiently detailed not to be merely
  precautions and at the same time it has to be flexible. Accordingly, I set up a            wh=a?additions
  distinguished members under the chairmanship of Mr Killoran, my Fire Assessor, to exa
  or alterations are needed to be made.

     3.83 Their recommendations, which I accept and commend to you, are contf ined^
   their names. I am grateful to them for giving up so much of their vatuabte t i mea nd fo r thespeed
   expertise which they brought to the task. I add below my own comments and emphasis on one or two
   important matters connected with the Green Guide.

                                                         27
(i) Status o f the Green Guide
   3.841 am satisfied that the Guide .should continue to be voluntary and not form a statutory code; but it
is important that all those concerned with sports grounds should read and understand the contents, and
apply the lessons relevant to their own sports grounds.

   3.85 A number of officials of sports grounds I have visited have pointed out that the Green Guide has
in some cases little relevance to their particular sport. For instance, questions of a perimeter fence at a dog
or horse race are largely irrelevant. The Guide needs to be applied in a common-sense way.

(ii) The Use o f Timber in Stands
   3.86 In my Interim Report, paragraph 3.132,1 said I would like totally to prohibit permanent wooden
stands, including those made from combustible material. I recommended that the building of new permanent
stands of combustible material should be prohibited as a general rule1 and I pointed out that treatment
with fire retardant materials may riot be effective. That recommendation was made on the advice of the
fire authorities to whom I had then spoken. I had not then consulted the timber trades. Not unnaturally,
such a recommendation caused a certain degree of consternation in the timber trades, and representations
have been made to me that this sweeping recommendation should be reconsidered. In particular my
recommendation was taken to mean that no wood should be used in new stands.

  3.87 I have now had the opportunity to have a full discussion with the trade. I had, and have, no •
intention of banning all combustible materials from a stand. I was, however, anxious to reduce the fire risk
as far as possible and it seemed evident that, the less combustible material in a stand, the less the fire
hazard.

   3.88 It was urged on me that if proper exits were provided then the danger from combusitible cladding
 could be ignored. I believe it is important to deal with the risk of an outbreak of fire occurring by the
 provision of proper structural fire precautions, as well as providing an adequate number of exits for use in
 an emergency.

---3.89On l 1 November 1985 new Building Regulations came into force which covered, inter alia, stands
 at sports grounds. It was suggested that if a new stand were to be built in accordance with the Regulations,
 there could be no criticism.

   3.90 Unhappily, I have been advised that under the guidance issued in support of the new Building
 Regulations it would be possible, in certain circumstances, legally to build a Bradford-type stand. The
 Department of the Environment recognise the problem and are to give urgent consideration to altering the
 guidance on how to comply with the requirements. I recommend that they do so without delay.

   3.91 What then is to be done in the meanwhile? It is obviously possible to build a stand in combustible
- material which, because of its construction, will have a fire retarding effect, thus providing sufficient length
 of time to allow spectators to escape. Having regard to the general level of safety at sports grounds which
 has been revealed since the Bradford fire I am not optimistic that anything more than minimum standards
 will be adopted by some clubs because of financial problems.

    3.92 I am anxious, therefore, about the possibility that some new single-storey stands lacking adequate
 structural fire precautions might be bn 'It prior to any necessary amendments to the Building Regulations
 Guidance Codes. When they have been so revised conforming with them should be sufficient. Until then. I
 have to say that construction of a new stand with inadequate structural fire precautions constitutes a fire
 risk to which members of the public should not be exposed.

 (iii) Artificial Pitches
     3.93 Some concern has been expressed to me, in the light of greater use of artificial pitches, that there
 may be, in the circumstances of a fire such as occurred at B r a d f o r d , danger to the public from toxic fumes
 if„the artificial pitch is exposed to too great a heat. I have not sufficient evidence upon which to pass
 judgement. It is, however, a matter, which those who are concerned, namely the fire and football autnori ..es.
  need to examine in close co-operation, to see whether there is, in fact, a problem, and if so to devise
 by which such problem can be avoided. The Sports Council, I understand, have set up a Working P^rt>
  'In te rim R eport: R ecom m endation 13.
with the assistance of the Fire Research Station to investigate the problem and hope to be able to report
in 1986.                                .

(iv) Temporary Stands and Marquees
  3.94 In England and Wales and in Scotland there appears to be no general legislation governing the use
of temporary stands and marquees if they are only in existence for less than 28 days. Fears have been                          ,
expressed to me that the increasing use of these stands at golf matches and elsewhere gives some cause for
concern, both from the safety of the structure in the case of stands and the fire hazard in the case of              - • .v--.:.
                                                                                                                     •         •                      ■

of their use needs, in my view, to be considerably stricter. Fire authorities to whom I have spoken are                    ‘                     V
concerned that, even when they are notified, it is sometimes not possible to be sure that a temporary stand              : -

undoubtedly constitute a risk to the public. I understand that there are plans for you to publish national

efficiency of enforcement. One anomaly appeared during the course of my Inquiry. If Wembley arena is
used for boxing it needs to be licensed because it is “entertainment” under the London Government Act
1963 but the same stadium used for the “Horse of the Year Show” does not. The result is that two quite
different standards of safety can be applied to the events in the same building.

  3.98 It is not possible always to eliminate anomalies in legislation which have grown up through a
piecemeal approach to a particular problem. The anomalies apply to both outdoor and indoor sports
grounds and stadia. In the long term they need consideration by the appropriate Government departments.

                                                      29
                                                CHAPTER 4

                                                Crowd control

Who is to deal with the problem?
  4.1 Everyone is agreed that there is no single answer to the problem of hooliganism at football grounds;
there are, however, a number of steps which can be taken by various bodies interested in football which
together may result in better control of the problem.

   4.2 Thus Parliament needs to ensure that the police have the necessary powers. The police need to ensure
that they identify and apprehend the law breaker and provide the proper evidence to secure a conviction.
Courts need to pass the appropriate sentences and without undue delay. Clubs need to ensure that their
grounds are physically safe, with reasonable facilities and staff properly trained to control those who are
invited into the grounds and to deal with any emergency. They should involve themselves in community
affairs. Managers need to ensure their players, by their behaviour on the field, do not incite the spectators.
Parents too a^je involved. They have a general responsibility for where their children go and what they do.

  4.3 The genuine law-abiding supporters, who are the vast majority, have an interest in ensuring the
peaceful result of a football game by helping to support those enforcing law and order. The football
authorities need to take a positive approach to football problems.

  4.4 Persons in authority cannot stop violence by condemning it: but one thing is certain, that failure to
condemn violence undoubtedly encourages it. Those who hold responsible positions, who encourage others
to commit violence by failing to condemn or worse by praising violence, have much to answer for.

  4.5 There is no typical football club. Among the league clubs in England, Wales and Scotland there are
wide differences in quality of management and in attitudes. They range from the very good to the indifferent.

  4.6 Every club has different problems. Each problem may need a different approach. Some clubs are
virtually trouble-free, both in relation to their own supporters and supporters from other clubs. Some clubs
may be trouble-free when they play at home but their supporters may cause trouble elsewhere. Some, a
very small minority, have troublesome supporters generally. No one method to combat hooliganism will
be successful on its own. What is needed is a recognition by all concerned, and particularly by football
clubs and the football authorities, that nothing less than a determined and imaginative attack on the
problem will save football.

   4.7 While football is the national game and enjoyed by millions, it has no natural entitlement to survival.
It is but one form of entertainment in a highly competitive world of entertainment. The public are voting
with their feet. Gates in the English League were down from 28 million ten years ago to 17 million last
year. This year, except in the Fourth Division, figures are again down. Those clubs who are currently at
the top of the League do not need reminding of other great names who once were regarded as the “greatest”
and who now languish in lower Divisions with large grounds, small crowds, large debts and faded memories.

   4.8 With 92 League clubs in England and Wales, it is not surprising that agreement on almost any
 proposal for action is difficult to reach, or that the football authorities are regarded by some clubs as quite
 ineffective. I do not see my role as laying down a blueprint for the survival of football. I am concerned
 with safety only. But if football falters then safety will suffer. Like others before me I can only poin: a
 way. I can guarantee no success. But one thing is clear—those clubs which are unimaginative, weakly ied
'or determined to live in the past will certainly go the way of the Dodo and the Brontosaurus.

4.9 Finally, it may be of interest to note the attitude of some football clubs in England and Wales. After-
the fire at Bradford and the riot at Birmingham a general invitation was issued by me to all those interested
in football to give me the benefit of their advice. This many did, and I was able to write my Interim Report
with the advantage of their views. I was also able to visit a number of clubs myself and I had useful
discussions with them.

   4.10    In the Interim Report I again invited those interested in the very difficult problems in football to
let me have their views. To make sure that I did, indeed, have the considered views of those most closely
affected by the problems and most experienced in the game, I wrote a personal letter in the following terms
to ail 92 football clubs in the English League:
      “I am anxious to have the views of the Clubs about what steps can be taken or recommended to prevent
      the repetition of the events at Birmingham. I shall, of course, be getting the collective views of the Clubs
      from the FA and Football League when I meet them again.
      I would also welcome any views of your Club about other aspects of my Inquiry. In addition, if you
      would like to come and have a discussion with me I shall be happy to see you or any of your Board at
      your convenience.”
      Oliver Popplewell (sgd)

   4.11 I am glad to say- that a number of clubs helped me by giving me the benefit of their experience,
either in writing or by taking the time and trouble to come and talk to me—in some cases clubs have done
both. I also managed myself, together with my Assessors, to visit a number of clubs. I am very grateful to
them. Their views have been of immense value. I have, however, rather sadly to record that over 50 out of
the 92 League Clubs did not even take the trouble to acknowledge receipt of my personal letter.

How can the problem be controlled?
               *
  4.12 I turn to deal with the elements which combined are necessary for coping with the problem of
hooliganism.

 A. The Police
   4.13 I made it clear in my Interim Report that the state of the premises and the conduct of the event
therein is not the responsibility of the police. A club is a commercial organisation, which is run for profit,
and its legal status is little different from that of the person who organises a pop concert a garden party,
or many other private events. Because, as a matter of practice, police officers have regularly attended in
large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for
control of what goes on inside the ground has passed from them to the police. A police presence is there
to assist in the enforcement of law and order. Those responsible for organising a private function, however,
have the primary and continuing obligation and responsibility to ensure reasonable safety for those who
are invited onto their premises.

   4.14 This responsibility,'which is a legal responsibility, continues throughout the time that those whom
 they have invited onto their ground remain there. It does not, for instance, cease when an emergency arises.

   4.15 The police’s responsibility is to preserve law and order. When an emergency arises they are likely
 to be the only body there capable of dealing with it. They have the facilities. They have the training. They
 have the authority. As I said in my Interim Report, the police have to take the de facto responsibility of
 organising the crowd with all that entails.-

    4.16 This has given rise to a certain apprehension amongst police officers. What are the resource
| implications? Does it require a police presence at a ground which hitherto has not had one? Does it require
  the presence at a ground, which presently has three or four constables, of a senior officer or more men in
  case an emergency arises?                               -

   4.17 It was never intended that my Recommendation that: “Evacuation procedure should be a matter of
 police training and form part of the briefing by police officers before a football match” 1 should result in an
 increase of resources or of a greater presence by police officers at a ground. Their purpose at a ground is
 to assist in the preservation of law and order.

    4.18 It is agreed generally that evacuation procedures, at major grounds at any rate, should be the subject
 of pre-planning, involving the club and its stewards, the local fire service (whose experience in evacuation
 is second to none) and the police. The nature and extent of police manning will vary from club to club.
 Thus at a ground where there are only two or three police officers there will undoubtedly be a different
 system from that which exists at a ground where there are present 300 officers in the charge of a very senior
 officer.

   4.19 Thus, whilst it is important that the police should treat evacuation procedure as a matter for training
 and briefing, they do that in order more readily to assist the owners of the private club to carry out their
 responsibilities, as they would any other private organisation in an emergency, and not as a result of any
 'Interim Report: Recom m endation 1.
legal responsibility resting upon the police. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club,
or the occupier of the ground who is putting on the function, that the primary and continuing obligation
rests.

(i) Stewards and Policing
  4.20 A number of clubs have been impressed by the presence of stewards from visiting clubs who look
after their own supporters. This is a practice which has much to commend it. One witness reported that at
Ostend a serious confrontation between the Belgian police and Liverpool supporters was defused by the
presence of Liverpool stewards.

  4.21 In some police forces it has been possible for one or two officers to travel with fans when they go
away and thus assist the “ home police” in identifying trouble-makers. In other cases home stewards have
been able, at away matches, to stand at the home turnstile and ensure that their own supporters do not
infiltrate the opposition terraces.

  4.22 A number of clubs have shown me the handbooks which have been issued to their stewards. I have
seen also cands issued to police officers with instructions as to their duties in the ground. The handbook
for Bristol Rovers, for instance, was written pursuant to the conditions of their Safety Certificate and was
approved by the police. It is a thoroughly comprehensive and sensible document dealing both with general
matters of stewarding and with the question of evacuation in the event of an emergency. It is to be hoped
that all other clubs will have done the same.

   4.23 In my Interim Report I recommended that the Green Guide should be amended to read: “All exit
gates should be manned a t all times while the ground is used by the public and be capable of being opened
immediately from inside by anyone in an emergency.” 1 Leicester City Football Club have a system of exit
doors worked on a magnet system which are automatically controlled from a central office. Ipswich have
a similar sort of system. Understandably there is concern that if my Recommendation were applied to
them they would be required to have a steward at each gate and that this would vitiate the whole scheme.
It was not my intention that this Recommendation should apply to exits which are automatically controlled,
if these types of mechanisms are acceptable to the responsible local authorities.

(ii) Powers o f Search
  4.24 In my Interim Report I said that I was minded to recommend that, in England and Wales, the
police be given the unfettered right of search before entry into football grounds, by statute.2 I there set
out the problems relating to police powers of search which are contained in the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984 which comes into effect on 1 January 1986.

   4.25 The disquiet arose because, by Section 1(3) of the Act, a constable only has power to search a
 person or a vehicle, or anything in or on a vehicle, i f he has reasonable grounds fo r suspecting that he will
find stolen or prohibited articles. A prohibited article includes an offensive weapon.

  .4.26 The passage of the Bill through Parliament gave rise to considerable controversy about the extent
and nature of police powers. On the one hand there were those who expressed disquiet about what were
called colloquially the “sus laws” and those who wanted to give the police a more effective weapon against
crime. It is not part of my function to comment on the arguments nor on the result. Nor do I wish to
make any observation about the Act, save in relation to sports grounds (and particularly football grounds)
with which I am concerned. The wider implications are not for me to consider.

   4.27 Football grounds are in their way unique in that they are a regular place for very large numbers of
people to meet. Some of those who attend football do so intending to cause trouble. Every Saturday, for
about three-quarters of the year, about half a million people go to football matches. Thus football is
different in kind, nature and purpose from any other activity of the community.

  4.28 The “ reasonable ground for suspicion” safeguard in the Act, which is there for the general protection
of citizens as they go about their ordinary business, needs to be reconsidered in the light of what actually
happens at football grounds.
  4.29 The effect of the “reasonable ground for suspicion” clause is that anyone can go into a football
ground carrying a weapon without fear of detection or search by simply carrying it in his pocket. There is
'In te rim R eport: R ecom m endation 11.
7Interim R eport: Provisional Recom m endation 1.
nothing thereby to give a constable reasonable ground for suspecting that he will find an offensive weapon.
No one wishes to see a situation in which it is possible for a large number of people to be at a football
ground in possession of offensive weapons. If there is, as I believe there is, a determination by all responsible
members of the public to seek ways to remove violence at football grounds, any measures which assist in
that task need to be considered.

  4.30 The difficulty which arises at present is this: 5,000 fans seek to enter a football ground. Experience
shows that some will be carrying an offensive weapon. A police officer has no special method of detecting
which of those 5,000 is carrying an offensive weapon. He may reasonably suspect that some, or many, will
be doing so. He cannot individually identify those persons. Thus he is not empowered by the Act to search
that person, either before or after entry.

   4.31 I have observed police searching visiting fans on a number of occasions. They were light-hearted
affairs to which no one appeared to take objection. They were speedily done. No one was asked for their
consent. It has been put to me that if there is a general search there is less likely to be trouble than if a
single person is picked out and wants to know why he has been individually selected.
           t
   4.32 What then is to be done? I believe a football ground should be treated as a special case. So far as
searching people entering the ground is concerned, it has been suggested that it can be made a condition
of entry that they agree to be searched. Thus, it is said that anyone who is inside the ground is deemed to
consent. Therefore the search by a police officer is not a search under the provisions of the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 but is contractually agreed to by reason of an arrangement made between the
football club and the spectator. This is an arrangement which can be properly made. It takes it outside the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Of course it only applies after the spectator enters the ground,
because the contract is made as he enters the ground. But at many grounds there are physical problems
about searching within the ground. Thus that solution is not really a practical one.

  4.33 What then about searching a spectator before he enters the ground? It is suggested that the limitations
of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 do not apply if a policeman says, in effect, to a spectator:
“I propose to search you” . If the spectator says nothing, or agrees, then because it is a voluntary search
the policeman need not have reasonable grounds for suspicion under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984. If the spectator does object, then the police officer says to him: “ I cannot therefore search you, but
you will not be allowed into the ground”. He then will go and report that fact to the operator of the
turnstile, who will decline to admit the spectator.                                                        '

  4.34 This allows a police officer to search by a method outside the provisions o f the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984.

  4.35 Unless a search is made lawfully by agreement or under the provisions of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984 it constitutes an assault. But if a spectator agrees to be searched, a police officer is not
guilty of an assault. There are, however, a number of problems. Firstly, the police, on the occasions I have
witnessed, invariably search without any sort of discussion. Is silence by the spectator consent? If the
consent is obtained by the threat of refusal of entry, is it consent? And finally, at what age can consent be
given by a spectator? If it is not until 16 or 18 years of age then the proposed system is of little value.

   4.36 It is not my task to give a definitive ruling on these matters; but the disquiet which has been
expressed by the police leads me to suggest that if the present practice of searching those who enter a
football ground is to be allowed to continue, it should be carried on in circumstances where the practice is
clearly legally based.

   4.37 It has, I think, to be recognised that a football match is an occasion outside the ordinary run of
normal activity of the community. Accordingly, there is no reason why there should not be specific
provisions relating to activities at football matches. This is the case with the Sporting Events (Control of
Alcohol etc) Act 1985. It has been recognised to be wrong to give the police a general power of search in
all circumstances. But I am absolutely satisfied that the control of hooliganism at a football ground could
be seriously hampered by the inability of the police lawfully to search at random those entering the ground.

  4.38 / recommend, therefore, that in England and Wales the unfettered right to search those who are either
entering or trying to enter a football ground should be conferred by statute. In Scotland there are divided
views. Consideration should be given as to whether this Recommendation should be extended to Scotland.
The Scottish police do not as a matter of practice search before entry as the police in England and Wales

                                                       33




                                                                                               ■» ..
  do. It may be that because of their “breach of the peace” offence (see Paragraphs 4.68-4.70 below) they
  have found that fans dump weapons and other undesirable items, including alcohol, outside the stadium
  before they enter without the necessity for searching. There is no doubt that the knowledge that there is
  to be a search has proved to be a deterrent to bringing into the ground these undesirable items.

   4.39 A similar problem arises out o f the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985. That Act
 was designed, among other things, to prevent those entering sports grounds from taking alcohol in with
 them. By Section 7(2) “ a constable may search a person he has reasonable grounds to suspect is committing
 or has committed an offence under this Act and may arrest such a person.” While the police officer obviously
 has reasonable suspicion for looking inside a bag which plainly contains bottles, or bears the name of some
 well known supermarket, those whose ingenuity is greater will not be subject to suspicion if they bring a
 bottle or cans in an inside pocket of a heavy overcoat. Thus the clear intention of Parliament is flouted.

   4.40 An additional problem has been drawn to my attention in relation to the searching of vehicles on
 suspicion of carrying alcohol. By Section 7(3) the police have power to search vehicles being used for the
 principal purpose of carrying passengers for the whole or part of a journey to or from a designated sporting
 event on reasonable suspicion. The Act, however, does not cover all vehicles but only public service vehicles
 or railway passenger vehicles.

    4.41 The problem of control, which has arisen, is that a large number of trouble-makers now no longer
 go by public transport. They do not wish to be organised or disciplined, and choose to go in their own or
 hired vehicles. Minibuses are favoured but they are by no means the only type of vehicle used. In some
 cases, the trouble-makers carry with them a large quantity of drink which they consume before they get to
 the ground. They may even intend to smuggle drink into the ground. There is presently no power to search
 such vehicles for alcohol, whether or not there is reasonable suspicion. The right to search these vehicles
 gives rise to a number of very difficult questions, but you should be aware of the problem.
 (iii) Offences
    4.42 There is general agreement among the police officers to whom I have spoken that their powers to
 deal with the more serious specific criminal offences are adequate. These include assault, wounding, actual
 bodily harm, assault on the police, obstructing the police, criminal damage and possessing offensive
-weapons. In addition, the Law Commission has recently made a number of recommendations about offences
 relating to public order (Law Commission 123) which appear in your Review of Public Order Law (Cmnd
 9510).

    4.43 The recommendations of the Law Commission do not, however, deal specifically with other
 unacceptable forms Of behaviour at sports grounds which have come to my notice, namely the throwing
 of missiles, running onto the pitch and obscene and racialist chanting. They are less serious in the sense
 that throwing a missile is not as important as an offence of riot. On the other hand, it is quite obvious that
 throwing a missile at a football match often triggers disorder. It is the inability to prevent or check that
 trigger which leads to greater disorder. Just as a bucket of water might extinguish a fire, if detected in time,
so the ability to deal with the first sign of trouble on the terraces is likely to have a beneficial effect. It is
no comfort to be able eventually to punish those- who engage in a full-scale riot, if the riot could be
prevented at a much earlier stage, by stopping those guilty of missile throwing or other disorderly conduct
just as soon as they begin. Should they be specific offences or can they be dealt with by an offence of breach
of the peace or disorderly conduct?

    4.44 It is acknowledged that the mood of a football crowd can be very volatile because of the nature of
 the game, the excitement the game engenders and the behaviour of the spectators. The margin between
 order and disorder at a football match is very narrow and it does not require very much to turn an exciting
 but peaceful afternoon into a scene of grave disorder. The balance is a fine one and can be upset by what
 would be regarded elsewhere as a trivial incident. Thus disorderly conduct which would pass as unremarkable
 in everyday life takes on a new significance in the context of a football match.

(a) Throw ing o f Missiles and Running on to the Pitch
   4.45 The first question to be asked is whether either should be an offence at all. Nearly everyone is agreed
that throwing a missile at a football ground should constitute an offence. So far as running onto the pitch
is concerned there are divided views. Those who are against it say, quite rightly, that a properly organised
stadium will have perimeter fences which will prevent people from running onto the pitch; therefore those
who run onto the pitch may only do so because they want to escape from danger on the terraces. They

                                                       34
may also run onto the pitch at the end of play in excitement, but do no harm to anybody. If there is a
specific offence and it is not enforced, this brings the law into disrepute. Indeed, it may be very difficult to
enforce if a substantial number of people run onto the pitch. There is also the difficulty of drafting an
offence so as to exclude the person who legitimately comes onto the pitch.

   4.46 The contrary argument is that if there is an offence of running onto the pitch people will not do it.
In Scotland, where the breach of the peace offence seems to me to be effective, large football grounds do
not have pitch perimeter fences as a general rule. The'fact that it may be difficult to arrest all those who
come onto the pitch does not mean that those who do and can be arrested should not be arrested. Those
who come onto the pitch for a proper reason are unlikely to be arrested. The offence canvassed would give
the police power immediately to deal with an offence and thus prevent more serious trouble. Sometimes
running on the pitch is done specifically to stop the game, sometimes to make a protest, sometimes to
exchange pleasantries with the referee or umpire or to congratulate a player on scoring a hundred runs. In
all cases it is likely to lead to further disorder.

  4.47 I am clearly of the view that running onto the pitch without good reason and missile throwing
should constitute offences. The police should have the power to arrest such offenders. It is often the start
of disorder. It should be stopped at the earliest possible moment. I shall need to consider whether these
should be specific offences or can be dealt with by an offence of disorderly conduct or breach of the peace.

(b) Chanting Obscene or Racialist Abuse at a Sports Ground
   4.48 One of the Provisional Recommendations in my Interim Report was that consideration should be
given to creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse at a sports ground.1 Nearly
everyone who has given oral evidence or submitted written evidence is equally of the view that this is a
very disagreeable feature of crowd behaviour at some football matches and indeed at other sports grounds.
I can support that view from my own observations on the terraces. The tcrraces are certainly no place for
the prudish or fainthearted. There are, however, divided views as to the practicability or otherwise of
enforcing this as an offence.

... 4.49 The contrary view is that if a very large crowd chooses to make disagreeable observations about a
 player such an offence would be difficult for the police to enforce. If it is not enforced the law is brought
 into disrepute. It upsets those against whom the chants are aimed if it is an offence which is not enforced.
 There is the further view that bad language has always been part of the football scene. It is a man’s game
 and thus language which would be objectionable in more polite society is the norm on the football terraces.
 Finally, it is said that it really is not possible to legislate for every disagreeable piece of behaviour.

   4.50 Those who favour some legislation, point out that a lot of people who attend sports grounds have
what would be a pleasant and agreeable afternoon totally ruined by constant foul language from those
around them. But while it may not always be possible to detect all those who behave in this way, if it is
occurring, a police officer should have the power to stop it. The very fact that there is legislation may of
itself persuade people to refrain from indulging in action which may not only upset other spectators but
may also encourage potential hooligans to act in a disorderly way.

   4.51 There are, of course, immense difficulties in drafting suitable legislation. Booing a player because
of the colour of his skin is disagreeable and distressing; however, it would be quite impossible to make it a
criminal offence to boo the referee, or a player on the opposing side simply because he was on the opposing
side. That is not to say that it is a habit which contributes anything to the well-being of the game, ar.y
more than the booing of the opposition’s national anthem at an international match or the kicker of a
penalty at a rugby union match. However, it is not possible always to legislate for bad manners. Additionally,
there is the very real difficulty of enforcement.

  4.52 The fact that there is some legislation governing foul language and racialist abuse at football matches
may have the effect of reducing the incidence and effect of it. On balance I believe that consideration should
be given to drafting some appropriate legislation in order to prevent it, either as a specific offence or
included in the offences of disorderly conduct or breach of the peace.

  4.53 I note that a number of clubs have as part of their ground regulations provision for precisely this
type of offence. For instance, Bristol Rovers’ Football Club Regulations read:                             .
 1Interim Report: Provisional Recom m endation 8



                                                       35
     “The Club reserves the right to prosecute or to eject or cause to be ejected any person who within the
     Club premises is considered by the Club, its employees or agents (hereinafter called ‘the Club’) to their
     absolute discretion to be or have been behaving in any of the following ways:
         (i)   entering upon the field of play during the course of a game
        (ii)   using obscene language or swearing
       (iii)   making vulgar gestures
       (iv)    using terms of racial abuse
        (v)    taunting opposing team supporters
       (vi)    entering areas of the terraces designed for use by opposing team supporters.
     The Club may, in its absolute discretion, bar from entry to the Ground, for any period up to FIVE
     YEARS, any person prosecuted or ejected in accordance with this Regulation and may take such steps,
     including informing the parents or guardians of the person concerned, necessary or desirable for the
     implementation of this bar.”

   4.54 The naxt question which arises is whether the present legislation or amendments to the legislation
proposed by the Law Commission or by the Review of Public Order Law are sufficient to cover either of
the three canvassed offences of missile throwing, running onto the pitch or chanting obscene or racialist
abuse. In 1936 the Public Order Act was enacted. It was introduced following the public disorders involving
the Black Shirts in the East End of London. Section 5 of the Act reads as follows: “Any person who in any
public place . . . uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of
the peace or whereby a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned; shall be guilty of an offence.” Thus it
js not enough to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour—an intent to cause a breach of
the peace or the likelihood of a breach of the peace occurring has to be proved.

  4.55 So far as missile throwing is concerned, if it can be proved that a missile hit somebody, then the
offence of assault is committed. But throwing a missile in a football ground is conduct which ought to be
stopped. It is the trigger for disorder. It is difficult to think of a legitimate reason for throwing a missile at
a sports ground. It is often impossible to show where the missile landed, particularly when some of the
missiles which are commonly used are coins of the realm. Section 5 is often inapplicable because it may
not be possible to show that the behaviour was intended to provoke a breach of the peace. It is even more
difficult to show that a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned when it may be impossible to
demonstrate where a missile fell. The offence of possessing an offensive weapon may not cover this problem.

   4.56 Likewise, running onto the pitch or chanting obscene or racialist abuse at a sports ground of itself
is unlikely to be covered by the provisions of Section 5. The Law Commission points out that Section 5
may not cover intimidatory conduct if the victim is, for example, a policeman or an old lady because they
are not likely to be provoked into violence by the defendant’s behaviour.

   4.57 The limit of Section 5 is further shown by the case of Cozens against Brutus 1973 AC 854: during
an international tennis match the appellant went onto the court and disrupted the game. He was charged
under Scction 5. It was held that his conduct did not come within the terms of the Section. Lord Reed
said: “Parliament had to solve the difficult question of how far freedom of speech or behaviour must be limited
in the general public interest. It would be going much too far to prohibit all speech or conduct likely to occasion
a breach of the peace because determined opponents may not shrink from at least threatening a breach of the
peace in order to silence a speaker whose views they detest. Therefore vigorous and it may be distasteful or
unmannerly speech or behaviour is permitted so long as it does uot go beyond any one of the three limits. It
must not be threatening, it must not be abusive, it must not be insulting. I see no reason why any of these
should be construed as having a specially wide or specially narrow meaning. They are all limits easily
recognisable by the ordinary man. Free speech is not impaired by ruling them out. Before a man can be
convicted it must be clearly shown that one or more of them have been disregarded.”

  4.58 It is also clear that on occasions magistrates have taken the view that, having regard to the
background of the Public Order Act, Section 5 is inappropriate for minor acts of hooliganism. In your
Review of Public Order Law, at paragraph 3.24, there appears: “The police have sometimes been reluctant
to use section 5 of the 1936 Act to deal with minor acts of hooliganism. They do not wish to over-react to
such incidents by charging too serious an offence with a disproportionately high maximum penalty and the
courts have on occasion deprecated the use of section 5 in cases where it was doubtful whether the conduct in
question amounted to “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour”.”
       4.59 Accordingly, your Review of Public Order Law proposes an amendment to Section 5 of the Public
     Order Act 1936 so that it reads: “Any person who whether in a public or private place, uses threatening,
     abusive or insulting words or behaviour which is intended or likely—(a) to cause another person to fear
     unlawful violence or (b) to provoke the use of unlawful violence by another shall be guilty of an offence.”
     (paragraph'3.7).

        4.60 This revised offence clearly will not cover running onto the pitch nor chanting obscene or racialist
     abuse. It was, however, hoped that it would cover missile throwing. Your Review says, at paragraph 3.12:
     “Missile throwing: Under the Law Commission's proposals, unlawful violence will include violent conduct
     towards property as well as towards persons, and will not be restricted to conduct causing or intending to
     cause injury or damage”— In one respect the Law Commission’s definition of unlawful violence may prove
     particularly useful: the police have suggested that at football matches and on similar occasions, it can
     sometimes be difficult to find appropriate offences with which to charge those picking up and throwing
     missiles in circumstances where the injury or damage caused by particular missiles cannot be identified.
     The Law Commission gives as an example of unlawful violence: “throwing at or towards a person a missile
     of a kind capable of causing injury which does not hit or fall short”.

       4.61 This, says the Review, should remove evidentialdifficulties related to intent or recklessness; and in
     cases of group violence the police should be able to charge missile throwers with violent disorder, thus
     exposing them to a maximum penalty on indictment of five years imprisonment.

       4.62 This proposed amendment in my view may still leave a gap in the legislation. Somebody who throws
     a missile may not intend to cause another person to fear unlawful violence* he may be seen simply to be
     throwing a missile and it may not be possible to say where it went or what it was aimed at. It will often
     not be possible to show that it is likely to cause another person to fear unlawful violence because it is not
     known where it lands. It may also require the evidence of another person to say that he feared unlawful
     violence. It seems to me that there is very real difficulty in applying Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936,
     even as amended, to a missile thrower at a football ground where the evidence is merely of a fan throwing
     something.

        4.63 If, as I believe, there is a gap in the legislation and missile throwing, running onto the pitch and
    .chanting.obscene or racialist abuse at sports grounds are not covered by the present or by the proposed
      legislation, what then is to be done?

        4.64 The Review of Public Order Law, paragraph 3.25, recognizes the problem of dealing with those
     who create a disturbance. It reads as follows: “ Even if it amounts to threatening, abusive or insulting
r    behaviour, disorderly conduct of this sort may not be caught by section 5 at present because it may not be
     intended, or likely to occasion a breach of the peace; or when the section is amended, because it may not be
     likely to cause fear of violence to people or property. This may be because the fear engendered is not directed
     to any specific result likely to follow from the conduct but instead consists of a more general state of anxiety
     or alarm. Alternatively the apprehension may be directed at a consequence of this behaviour, such as a
     stampede by a crowd or an accident being caused by the articles used to blockade an entrance, which is not in
     itself unlawful violence. But behaviour of this kind does constitute a real nuisance to the public which would
     seem to justify invoking the protection of the criminal law.” In order to deal with it the Review suggests a
     new offence. A t paragraph 3.26 it says: “The main elements of a new offence intended to cover disorderly
     conduct which falls outside the scope of section 5 as amended might be as follows: (a) threatening, abusive,
     insulting or disorderly words or behaviour in or within view of a public place; (b) which causes substantial
     alarm, harassment or distress.

       4.65 The addition of the clause “which causes substantial alarm, harassment or distress” has apparently
     been inserted in order to provide a safeguard so that merely to be annoyed or disturbed will not suffice,
     fhe legislation is designed^ according to the Review, to protect the weak and vulnerable, and therefore the
     proposed definition requires evidence that the victim suffered substantial alarm, harassment, or distress.

        4.66 No one would want to criticise that as a proposal covering the sort of behaviour which your Review
     jvid in mind; namely groups of youths persistently shouting abuse and obscenities, or pestering people
     " uiting to catch public transport, or to enter a hall or cinema, or rowdy behaviour in the streets late at
     night- which alarms local residents.

      4.67 Unfortunately it is insufficient for the unacceptable behaviour with which I am concerned at football
     matches. Somebody running onto the pitch does not substantially alarm, harass or distress anyone, but it

                                                           37
is often the trigger for disorder. Somebody throwing a missile or chanting obscenities does not necessarily
cause substantial alarm, harassment or distress. Spectators on occasions start shaking a perimeter fence in
concert as a preliminary to breaking it down. But under the proposals of the White Paper, because this
would not cause substantial alarm, harassment or distress it would not amount to an offence.

  4.68    The matter is dealt with efficiently in Scotland by the common law offence of “breach of the peace” .
This covers a very wide range of circumstances. Originally constituted to cover the situation when one or
more persons conducted themselves in riotous or disorderly manner to the alarm and annoyance or
disturbance of the lieges, it has now been extended to cover those who provoke a disturbance. The offence
may be committed in a public or private place and although evidence of alarm is normally produced such
evidence is not essential.

  4.69: There is a wide interpretation placed on the type and nature of disorder which may amount to a
breach of the peace. It has been common practice for the police in Scotland to use the offence for such
behaviour as chanting obscene or abusive slogans, running onto the pitch, throwing objects at spectators
or onto the pitch, climbing flood-light pylons and assaulting or attempting to assault spectators or players.
              *
  4.70 The list is not exhaustive and police bring a charge of breach of the peace in circumstances of
disorder at a football match. The use of this charge has been of great value in Scotland in dealing with a
wide range of unacceptable conduct at a football match. Actual violence or disorder does not need to have
occurred, nor is it necessary for a complaint to be received about the actions of the individuals before the
police can intervene. Power of arrest is without warrant and the offences -are normally dealt with within
the minor courts although in very serious cases they can become an indictable offence triable in the Sheriff
court o r the High Court.

   4.71 I have paid three visits to Scotland and have spoken to the football and police authorities. I have
also observed, for example, how well the crowd behaved at a Celtic/Rangers match where there was no
perimeter fencing. The offence of breach of the peace is widely regarded as a very successful preventive
measure. It is a common law power. It is not difficult to recognise at a football ground somebody who is
disturbing the peace at that football ground.

   4.72 At present there is statutory provision in England and Wales for binding over a person for breach
of the peace pursuant to the Justice of the Peace Act 1361. He is brought before the court and bound over
to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour, but the preventive nature of the bind over means that no
immediate penalty can be imposed. Thus in England and Wales binding over for breach of the peace which
is appropriate for “peeping tom” cases is wholly inappropriate for football-related offences.

   4.73 As an alternative to the introduction of an offence of breach of the peace in England and Wales,
similar to the Scottish offence, the offence of disorderly conduct which the Review of Public Order Law
proposes should be considered applicable in the context of a football ground, but without the clause “which
causes substantial alarm, harassment or distress.” It is argued that disorderly conduct ought to be defined.
But nobody finds it necessary to define it in the well-known offence of being drunk and disorderly. There
is no reason why somebody who is sober but disorderly should not be equally guilty of an offence. In
paragraph 3.24 of your Review of Public Order Law there appears “If a person who causes this type of
disturbance is drunk, he may be charged with the offence of being drunk and disorderly; but there is no
corresponding offence to cover similar conduct by a person who is not drunk even though the nuisance caused
is no less, and may be thought more culpable in someone who is sober,”

   4.74 Quite clearly a new offcnce in England and Wales of disorderly conduct or breach of the peace on
the lines of the Scottish common law offence, would be of substantial assistance in dealing with hooliganism.
It would avoid the problem of trying to define all the different types of behaviour which give rise to disorder
at football matches and would undoubtedly enable the police to take action much earlier than they can
under the present law. This offence should be confined to sports grounds where the disorderly conduct is
likely to have such a devastating effect on crowd safety. Disorderly conduct would clearly include throwing
a missile, running onto the pitch, seeking to climb over or to pull down a perimeter fence, shining a mirror
towards a batsman, throwing bottles or cans onto the field of play, or interfering with a greyhound or
horse racc. I suggest that it should be triable summarily and there should be a power of arrest. I recommend,
therefore, that consideration should be given to creating an offence o f disorderly conduct at a sports ground.

  4.75 I make these suggestions about legislation with some diffidence, because I am conscious that it is
for the Legislature to make the laws and for the Judiciary to interpret them. I am naturally anxious not to

                                                      38
trespass on Parliament’s function. But as these matters have been fully canvassed in evidence before me I
hope I may be forgiven for expressing my own views.

(iv) Powers o f Arrest
  4.76 I made a Provisional Recommendation in my Interim Report that the police should be given the
power to arrest a hooligan subsequent to the offence under Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936.1 At
present he can only arrest when the hooligan is actually committing the offence. If he is subsequently
identified on Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) there is no power under the Public Order Act 1936 to arrest
him. I do not believe that Section 24(5) and Section 25(1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
cover the matter. With the proposed future use of CCTV it is important that this gap in police power
should be closed and the.power to arrest be given even in amended legislation. I recommend that the power
to arrest under Section 5 o f the Public Order Act 1936 should be widened.

(v) Alcohol
   4.77 Alcohol plays a part in some of the outbreaks of violence which occur at sports grounds. Even if
it does not give Vise to violence, it gives rise to disorderly behaviour; if fans could be prevented from coming
into the ground without having drunk excessive quantities of alcohol, there can be no doubt but that the
standards of behaviour would improve. To ban a fan from physically bringing drink into the ground, and
from obtaining a drink when in the ground, does not unfortunately prevent him from coming into the
around with drink inside him.
                                                                                                                   ■v - r
                                                                                                           ■          '''-'I

  4.78 The introduction of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 has been generally
welcomed, subject to two reservations; firstly, whether drink should be available at all in the ground and ■
secondly, whether there should be an automatic exclusion of alcohol from boxes within view of the ground.

  4.79     In my Interim Report I observed (paragraph 6.17) that by reason of the introduction of the Sporting
Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985, the question of spectators being able to obtain drink in the
ground was no longer a problem for me to consider. Nevertheless there was, and still is, a considerable
divergence of opinion about the question of spectators being able to obtain drink in the ground and of the                :v
extent, if any, to which it should be available. Considerable feeling also has been expressed to me about            ••••••

preventing people in private boxes, who have paid substantial sums of money for the privilege (and who             - —
                                                                                                                      -
contribute nothing to hooliganism) from obtaining drink in those boxes, while drink may be available to
those who go onto the terraces, albeit not in the sight of the field of play.

  "4.80 The effect of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 is to allow the Magistrates, on
application by a club, and after hearing evidence from any objectors (usually the police) to decide whether
any part of the premises shall be licensed to sell drink. By Section 3(3) “an order under this section shall
not apply to any part of the premises from which designated sporting events, at the designated sports ground,
may be directly viewed.”

  4.81 Thus a bar beneath a terrace, at which a notional hooligan can obtain drink, may be licensed, but
the Directors’ Box which is so placed that the event may be directly viewed from it, may not.

  4.82 Each Licensing Bench is perfectly entitled to adopt whatever view it feels in its judicial wisdom is
proper in respect of a particular licence sought. The Act was intended to bestow upon the Licensing Justices
a complete discretion. Some criticism has been made that in some way the exercise of that discretion ma 'es
a loop-hole through the Act. It does not, because it was always intended that magistrates should have the
discretion.
  4.83 There is a division of views as to whether drink available in the ground contributes in any way to
hooliganism. Those who contend that it does point out that if it is not available, however much has een
drunk before the game starts, there will be at least a 1^- hour period of drying out; nor will there have en
an opportunity to top up; the peak moment of potential violence is often when the opposing fans meet
after the game, by which time it may well be two hours since the potential hooligan last had his dnnk.
Thus there is some measure of protection by forbidding it in the ground altogether.

   4.84 Those who favour allowing drink to be sold on the ground, certainly before the game starts, point
 to the fact that if there is no drink available in the ground, those who want to drink simply go into t e

had to be erected, between the seats which look out onto the pitch and the bar area, an opaque glass panel
so as to Prevent those having a drink from watching the game. As a deterrent to hooliganism it has no
purpose at all. Its effect may be to deter much needed finance from being injected into the game.

modest compared with that of Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United, is a serious one for this Club.

    lat the provisions o f Section 3(3) be reviewed in relation to executive boxes.

(vi) Closed Circuit Television
   4.92 The introduction of CCTV as a weapon against hooliganism seems to have met withumversal
approval. It is essential that the equipment which is installed is of a h.ghquahty.T lns^sa maUerforthe
individual choice of the police authority and the football management. Bu nothing could

so that they can be prosecuted and convicted. It is important too to recognise tha         p       .-

  4.93 Its use a t Huddersfield Town Football Club, for instance, has proved its value. During

attending the Huddersfield Town ground. There were 26 matches played in ^eseaso n               3 arrests were at
games against one particular team and 75 against another. It was decided thatthe next v sit^of one orthese
teams was a suitable occasion to assess the potential of video-recording incidents of disorder FoUo ng
the recording of incidents in the ground, two officers were selected to examine the recording, to ettect th
arrest of the parties involved in the violent incidents. Identification of offenders was achieved by the officers

   4 94 The results to date, which are by no means final, are that eight persons have appeared before the
 Courts,^here Ae main evidence has been the video-recording of themselves committing offences of assault

   4.95 It is dear that the most beneficial factors are firstly,the "fee. ™     ^

  4.101 The Football Trust has made a substantial contribution towards the purchase of this equipment
as they and the Football Grounds Improvement Trust have done in respect of other facilities at football
grounds. This is much to be commended and they play a very important part in ensuring the welfare of
the game. •

(vii) Radios
  4.102 I had occasion in my Interim Report, to make some observations about the way that the police
radios had operated at Bradford (paragraphs 3.27-3.33). I recommended that early attention should be
given by the Home Office Directorate of Telecommunications to consider the practicality of producing a
more suitable personal radio for the police.1

   4.103 Subsequently, at one ground I went to I was able to observe the relative efficiency of the police _
radio operated by a police officer and a commercial type of radio of similar construction and appearance,
operated by a steward employed by the club. Messages from both were received in the police control room
situated in the ground, by an experienced controller. The reception from the steward’s commercial radio
was markedly better than from the police radio.

  4.104 One police force expressed confidence in their equipment. They had been able to purchase their
equipment on the commercial market and had found no operational difficulty in its use. However, I
observed at one ground a Police Sergeant being asked by a Chief Superintendent to send a message on his
police radio. He was unable to do so, to general embarrassment, apparently due to the batteries having
worn out. The point has also been made by the Fire Brigades’ Union that their radios are not as good as
they would like because the batteries, if used for any length of time, tend to wear out. I see no reason,
therefore, to alter my view that the quality of both the police and the fire service radios (though each are
different) still needs to be reviewed and the importance of regular maintenance emphasised. I am pleased
to learn that a detailed study is being commissioned by the Home Office Directorate of Telecommunications
into the problem of personal radios.

(viii) Police Manpower
   4.105 In my Interim Report (paragraphs 6.9 and 6.10) I drew attention to the large number of police
officers it is necessary to deploy for the purpose of controlling crowds at a football match. It is a matter
of some concern that such a large proportion of police resources should be devoted to the task of controlling
a football crowd, when there are so many other aspects of law and order to which they ought to be devoting
their time. The police are the first to recognise this.
  4.106 At a recent Millwall/Portsmouth match over 500 police officers were required to be deployed in
and outside the ground (and properly so required) to control a crowd of under 7,000 spectators. Any steps
which can be taken to reduce the necessity for a police presence at a football ground are to be encouraged.
A successful membership scheme may well have this effect.

B. The Clubs

(i) Membership Cards and the Football League Scheme
   4.107 I recommended in my Interim Report that urgent consideration.be given by football clubs in
England and Wales to introducing a membership system.2 No other Recommendation has given rise to
such discussion or indeed criticism. There were three criticisms of the idea of a membership system. Firstly,
that I was advocating an identity card system. I was not, nor did I so suggest in my Report. Secondly, that
a membership pass was the equivalent of an identity card. It is not any more than a driving licence, work
pass, season ticket, credit card, bus pass, library ticket or the many thousands of membership cards of
different clubs, both football and others, which presently exist. Thirdly, there was the suggestion that to
require a card or pass at a football ground was interfering in some way with the liberty of the subject. This
I have to say is simply emotional nonsense.
   4.108 There are, however, two much more serious objections which have real validity. Firstly, that any
system of membership cards is likely to prove impractical at the turnstiles because there would not be
enough time to check the card presented, given the tendency of football spectators to arrive at the very
last moment.                                                                   ■       ______________
1Interim R eport: R ecom m endation 3.
1 Interim R eport: Recom m endation 20.
  4.109 The figures for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, for instance, support this objection. On 17
August 1985 when they played Watford, the final attendance figure was 29,884. At 2.45 pm there were
19,217 in the ground, at 3 pm there were 27,785. The figures for Liverpool this season for five games show
that On average only 65 per cent of total attendance were in the ground 15 minutes before kick-off and 92
per cent at kick-off. Thus, on average, some 9,000 spectators were still trying to get into the ground 15
minutes before kick-off and 2,500 were still outside when play began.

   4.110 The second objection is that it would prevent a casual spectator, who wanted to go and visit his
 own club on occasions, from so doing; and also that the spectator, who supported a number of clubs wou d
 be prevented from attending matches. It was also pointed out that if away supporters were banned some
 clubs would lose large revenues. In the lower Divisions, except for local derbies, away fans are only a sma
 proportion of the crowd, but in the First and Second Divisions they may be very substantial.

    4.111 These were, and still remain, very strong arguments, more particularly as they come from a large
  number of the more responsible and reputable clubs. They have been repeated many times to me, both
  orally and in writing, since my Interim Report. On the other hand, the Football Association, the Football
  League, the Professional Footballers’ Association and the Sports Council all favour some form ol
  membership scheme. So too do many supporters’ clubs, and a number of clubs w ho are introducing their
  own scheme. A partial membership scheme has much to commend it and, in fact, exists at many clubs

    4.112 A number of matches this season have shown that the casual supporter cannot, in fact, just go to
 any game as he pleases. One example is what happened in the Watford versus Chelsea game in Septem r»
 It was played at 12 noon. It was all-ticket. I wanted to go on to the terraces. As a Watford supporter 1
 needed to be in possession of a voucher from a previous programme. As a Chelsea supporter I needed to
 be a member of the Supporters’ Club and to go and get a ticket from Chelsea during the week. Wattord,
 in fact, held 1,000 tickets for Chelsea supporters available at the ground on the day, though this was not
 made public. Thus, if on the Saturday morning I had as a casual decided I would like to go to the game, 1
 would not have got in and thus I was no better off than I would have been under a membership scheme.

   4.113 All-ticket games in England and Wales involve a severe limitation of those who can attend. A
 number of big games are all-ticket. The usual method of distribution of the tickets to the away team is to
 channel them to members of their supporters’ club or to season ticket holders. In those cases it is clear
 that the casual supporter will not get a ticket. This year all Leeds United matches, w hen they play away
 from home, have been designated by the Football Association to be all-ticket games; thus the casual
 supporter of Leeds United is unlikely to be able to get a ticket to see his team when they are playing away.

    4.114 The system which Leeds United has adopted is to allocate           a w a y tickets first ta season ticket
                                                                         t h e i r


  holders and shareholders: the remainder are distributed to the Supporters’ Club. I was told that to t>e a
* member of Leeds United Supporters’ Club you need to be proposed, interviewed and approved by a
9 particular branch. Unless you are so approved you cannot join the Club; at some branches unless you are
  personally known you will not be approved; if you cannot join the Club you cannot get into an away
  match. It appears to be a membership scheme with very strict m e m b e r s h i p control. However, ~          g
  misbehaviour of Leeds United fans at a recent match has caused the FA temporarily to ban all Leeds
  United supporters at away games.
    4.115 The Football League have set up a working party to consider the whole question of membership
  cards. This reported on 9 September 1985. Because of its importance, it is worth setting out some
  details of that Report.
        “ 14. Many football clubs have in recent years carefully considered how to attract desirable groups of
        spectators, such as families and children, to attend their matches ....
        15. To this end accommodation has been set aside for these groups, and often admission to them is
        controlled by the use of membership cards . . .
        16. In addition numerous clubs have established supporters’ membership schemes, open to indi^ u“,s
        good character who are not eligible for membership of family or children s schemes and for seaso
        holders.
        17. Safety of Sports Grounds Act regulations lay down strict guidelines for segregation of rival SUPP®**” ’
        and these structures greatly facilitate the creation of reserved areas for members of particular schem s.

                                                         43
At many clubs, facilities have been specially improved to cater for these groups particularly refreshment
kiosks, lavatories, additional seating and so on.
18. A particular benefit of schemes of this sort is that the club and its supporters can be confident that
in those areas of the ground where admission is controlled by membership, the likelihood of disorder is
minimal. If offences do occur, membership is withdrawn and the individual banned from the ground.
23.-It is thus necessary to consider how a membership system could help solve the away travel problem.
The answer clearly lies, in building on the success of the individual club schemes and extending the
privileges, which membership confers at home matches to away games. To achieve this will require a
high degree of compatability between one club’s scheme and another’s.
24. The first step, therefore will be for all clubs to have a membership scheme the basic principles of
which will be common to all. In our view these should cover:
   (a) the categories of membership (eg the season ticket holders, families, young people and/or children,
   accredited supporters, etc).
   (b) TJie specification of the membership card.
   (c) A photograph on the card and a duplicate held by the club (except for season ticket holders for
   whom this may not be necessary).
   (d) The length of time for which a card is valid. We recommend that they should be renewed each
   season.                                                         -
   (e) The information about the applicant to be supplied on the form requesting membership (eg, full
   name, address, date of birth).
   (f) Agreement with the clubs on the proportion of ground capacity to be covered by membership
   arrangements. We recommend that this should normally be not less than 50 per cent.
   (g) In view of the fact that some clubs are contemplating the introduction of electronic readers at
   turnstiles, it will be important to see that the electronic data on cards (presumably in the form of a
   magnetic strip) also conforms to a common standard.

25. To ensure that these criteria are complied with, we recommend that the Football League issue
guidelines to all clubs to be included in the arrangements, thus establishing the concept of a “ Football
League approved membership scheme.” Clubs should be encouraged to provide reserved and safe
accommodaton at their ground for away supporters who are members of approved schemes.
26. Whilst we do not recommend that every match should be ‘members only* for reasons we explain
below, we believe it would be possible through the use of reciprocal membership arrangements to reduce
the likelihood of crowd disorder at difficult games by insisting that not only are these ‘all ticket but also
that tickets are to be sold to members only. We envisage that in due course, as membership schemes
gain increasing acceptance, more and more areas in football grounds become reserved enclosures, to
which only ‘home’ members or ‘away’ members are admitted.
28. ... . We hope, however, that it will never be necessary to refuse admission to persons of good
character, who for whatever reason, are not members of the home or aw ay team’s scheme (the so called
‘casual’ supporter, who perhaps only attends a handful of games in a season, or likes to visit a number
of clubs or who has a conscientious objection to being in a membership scheme).
 37. The Working Party concludes that it is possible to establish a national membership card scheme *or
 Football League clubs which does not require extremely expensive computer-based electronic equipment
 at each ground, or which totally excludes away supporters or decent football fans who are not members
 of schemes from the great majority of matches which are expected to be trouble free.
38. We recommend that the Football League urgently draws up guidelines for ‘inclusive’ membership
schemes (following the advice given in paragraph 24 of this report) with a view to ensuring their
compatability with one another and at the same time providing guidance with the help of the Central
Computer and Telecommunications Agency to clubs wishing to in stall electronic equipment to check
xrards.
39. We recommend that the Football League, in full, introduce regulations requiring clubs to establish
areas of their grounds for the use of members, with normally at least 50 per cent of the ground s capacity
reserved for this purpose.

                                                    44
         40. We recommend that the Government includes in its proposed Public Order Bill a provision or
         exclusion orders on football offenders, to back up membership schemes, and for clubs and po ice to
         double their efforts to prevent undesirable non-members from entering their grounds, including t e
         circulation by clubs of black lists of banned persons.
         41. The Working Party believe that if these recommendations are followed the system introduced will
         comply with the agreement reached between the Government, the Football Association and t e oot a
         League at the Downing Street meeting on 30 July, The national membership card scheme should impose
         little financial burden on clubs, and indeed provide s o m e c o m m e r c i a l opportunities for them as a resu
         of their obtaining more information about their customers. The successful operation of the scheme will,
         in addition, provide a measure of security and reassurance for the decent supporters who continue o e
         the backbone of English professional football, as well as a demonstration to UEFA and U t A tnat
         English football is determined to put its house in order.”
       4.116 Reading propose to introduce a computerised system, with cards, which would exclude non-
    members. It has not yet been implemented. It is, however, one type of scheme. So too have Brentford.
    Under their scheme they issue a form which asks for name and address and employer. A person is issue
    with a card witK the type of membership he requires. It costs £1. The cost of producing t e car was
    substantially covered by advertising. Armed with this card, which the member presents at the turnstile, he
    is admitted to that part of the ground where his ticket allows him to go. Those without tickets go thr°ug i
    the non-members’ turnstiles thus allowing the casual in, but he pays more for his ticket. Po ice nee o y
    patrol the non-members’ areas.
      4.117 So far this season Brentford have sold about 5,000 membership cards'. They find that the list of
    members has important commercial potential and are optimistic that there will be consi era e spin o s
    from the scheme.
      4.118 In the 1984-85 season Crystal Palace operated a limited membership card system m which 25 per
    cent of the ground had been for “members only” . In April 1985 they announced1that 50 per >:e n t^ t he
    ground would be so organised. There was an initial fee of £3, but members patd 50 pence ess or        ^
    accommodation and £1 less for a s e a t . There were some 3,800 members. The membership scheme led to a
    reduction of one third in the level of police manning at the ground.
      4.119 Leicester City have introduced a similar scheme. They have 3,000 members, nearly 5,000 season
    and family ticket holders and 1,000 members of the Supporters’ Club. Because of the success^ of the scheme^
    which has led to improved behaviour, they have been able to reduce the amount of Pen™^e r ^
    hope, as membership rises, to reduce the fencing further. Millwall have an away travel dub App cations
    require the name and address, date of birth and description of the applicant and require the applu:ant to
    say whether he has been convicted of any football-related offence. The card contains p         g p
    applicant. A number of other football clubs have supporters’ associations or clubs which require a
    membership card including a photograph.
(      4.120 An example of a match containing substantially only home spectat°rs        ^ /h e MiKvall v^sus
     Portsmouth game on 26 October 1985. Because of previous troubles, it was an aH-ticket game. Portsmouth
     Football Club did not accept any tickets and dissuaded their supporters from going to the ga
     result only about thirty Portsmouth supporters watched the match which was trouble- ree.

        4.121 Another proposal, which Has found favour w ith some witnesses, is ; h^ it^ ™ tS^ ° nc,f° r
     supporters should be limited to a person holding membership ot the visiting c u       pp'    wvjen thev
     it is hoped that a football club would be made responsible for the behaviour of its support
     are visiting another ground.
       4.122 It has to be remembered that all clubs at present have a structure for membership ^ ^ ^ a p e o f
     season ticket holders, family membership and so on. There is no re^ ° n w y _ vJP                   facilities for
     should not be encouraged at the expense of the potential hooligan. Thus, y . .P_ . 3 , bv involvin®
     members, by offering discounts on away travel, by offering t i c k e t s at preferential prices and by involving
     members in the general well-being of the club, there will be two particular benefits.

     4.123 Firstly, the club will gain from all the commercial benefits of a membership scheme and
     in the cost of maintaining law and order in the ground. Secondly, the members^ 1 1 benefit
     contact with the hooligan. Thus, gradually, a club with a membership scheme may start to win bac
     families and children as well as other supporters who now stay away.'

                                                               45
  _ 4.124 The Football Trust and the Department of the Environment recently commissioned the Sociology
  Department at the University of Leicester (who are very experienced in investigation of football problems}
  to examine and report on Leicester City’s membership scheme.

   4 125 The Leicester sociologists conclude that the most practical strategy would be to encourage the co­
  ordinated introduction of club-based schemes. “Such an approach”, they say, “would enable each club to
  become familiar with the operation of its own scheme and, following that, it might be possible to establish and
  to monitor a pilot project involving reciprocal arrangements.”

  , 4' l2^ n my Inte” m Report * set out the various problems of a membership scheme and said that despite
 the problems these could be overcome with goodwill and effort. I did not pretend that any membership
 scheme would necessarily be successful, or that I could guarantee that it would cure football hooliganism.
   suggested that clubs could keep away fans away if they were so minded. I did not then recommend this
 as the only scheme, nor do I do so now. It is to be hoped that a partial membership scheme which still
 allows casual^ to enter the ground will be the first step in trying to secure greater peace and harmony at a
 football match. In the end, it must be for the football clubs to take whatever steps they think necessary to
 ensure crowd control at football matches. Membership schemes are one, but certainly not the only step.
    e football League have taken an important step in this direction and their efforts are much to be
 commended.

   4.127 Clubs in the Football League have reacted to the Football League's proposal with varying degreed
 of enthusiasm ranging from downright opposition to warm acceptance. Given the history of the°Football
 League clubs no one should be surprised that there is no agreement on this suggestion anymore than on
 any other suggestion.

    4.128 The fact that this season, as I write, trouble on the terraces has been appreciably less than last
 season, is no ground for complacency. I recognise that the great majority of football matches are trouble-
 tree, but any practical step which can be taken to lessen the risk is to be applauded. The Working Party’s
   eport is but a first step. So too are the experiments which I have recorded. No doubt there are other
 promising schemes elsewhere. It will have to be seen how successful they are and adjusted in the light o f
 experience. For my part, I recommend that consideration should continue to be given to some form o f
 membership scheme fo r Football League clubs in England and Wales.
 (ii) Stewards
   4.129 I have already expressed my view about the responsibility of the clubs, as private organisations
inviting spectators into their grounds for profit, to bear the responsibility for ensuring the reasonable safety
o! those spectators. To that end, I have already recommended that stewards should be properly selected
and properly trained. The days when all they are required to do is to act like an usherette at a cinema to
snow people to their seats should have gone. They have a very important public responsibility to ensure
the safety of the spectators, as do the cabin staff of an aeroplane. I have been impressed at a number
grounds which I have visited, by the steps which have now been taken (albeit belatedly) to ensure th ! ^
there are competent stewards who are properly briefed. No doubt the presence of a large number of police,
which is now the accepted practice on a ground, had led some clubs to be less energetic than they otherwise
would be in looking after their own property and the safety of spectators.
(iii) Community Affairs-
    4.130 Clubs like Aberdeen and Watford (no doubt there are other shining examples) have involved
 themse.ves n community affairs. They have provided a place were families and children can attend. They
 have encouraged a relationship between the club and the local community which can only result in greater
harmony at the ground. The current financial problems affecting a number of clubs will no doubt result in
a rethink as to whether a football ground, often used only for football once a fortnight, is being put to its
best practical use. Some 40 hours use in a year scarcely seems an economic use of an expensive ground.
Un the Continent, the sharing of grounds and their facilities, not only for spectators and players, but for
members of the public, has much to commend it. This, of course, cannot happen overnight. A number of
  orward looking clubs already involve the community. Many do not and there can be no doubt that it is
to everyone’s advantage that they should.
(iv) Behaviour O f Players
, 4.131 The behaviour of some players on the field of play undoubtedly contributes on occasion to bad
behaviour on the terraces. This is not confined to football. Indeed some of the antics of cricketers and
tennis players are substantially worse than those of football players. The public conduct of professional
golfers and snooker players, who are subject to pressures and tension, certainly no less than other sports
players, has much to commend it. A number of football.clubs take a much firmer view about the behaviour
of their players than some of the other sporting authorities. It is a fact, however, that in some cases the
play-acting when a player goes down, the childish kicking away of the ball when a free-kick is awarded to
the opposition, and the throwing away of the ball when it is the opposition’s throw-in, all cause upset on
the terraces, and play a part in contributing to disorder. Worse still is the so-called professional foul which
in ordinary language is plain cheating. In some games it might call for a ban for life. It seriously increases
tension among the crowd.

(v) Supporters' Clubs
   4.132 It might be thought that with falling attendances supporters’ clubs would be positively encouraged
and welcomed by football clubs. Far from it. Some football clubs have no supporters’ clubs. Some who
do treat them as if they were a rival organisation. The result is that instead of harnessing the goodwill of
those who provide some of the livelihood to the club (and are often their keenest supporters) some clubs
take active steps to discourage them. In some football clubs “the customer knows best” has a hollow ring.
                    t ..
(yi) Facilities at Football Grounds
  4.133 I have little doubt but that the provision of good facilities at football grounds is likely to result in
better behaviour from the fans. A number of clubs do provide first-class facilities. At others the facilities
pan at best be described as woeful, at worst non-existent. There is a tradition of standing on the terraces

•
and even a modern ground like Ibrox Park has one side of the stadium which has all standing. But it is
possible to provide comfortable facilities. There is a strong view that while better facilities will not necessarily
prevent people from behaving like hooligans, they are likely to lessen the chance. There is no reason why
clubs should continue to provide facilities no better then were available a hundred years ago. Clubs must
be encouraged to improve their facilities.

  4.134 Professor Canter of Surrey University was invited to carry out some research for me into the
problems of crowd behaviour. He interviewed a selected number of people living near grounds as diverse
as Celtic and Millwall; Coventry and Preston North End. They were asked a general open question about
the reason why people do not go regularly to football matches and what would encourage people to go
more frequently. The largest percentage (29%) said that improved comfort would encourage people to go
more frequently. That figure varied from as little as 8% at Coventry to 44% at Southampton.

 4.135 This view is not wholly supported by the findings of the Dunfermline College of Physical Education,
who carried out a survey of crowd behaviour at football matches in Scotland. In particular they looked at
Rangers, Aberdeen and Hibernian Football Clubs. Their conclusion was:
      “ Fans rated the quality of the football and the trouble-free crowd as being more important than the
      quality of facilities. Further, entertaining football was valued more highly than a winning team. However
      the relative importance placed on the importance of facilities appeared to depend on the experience of
     the fans. For example at Easter Road (the Hibernian Football Club Ground) a predominantly terraced

•     ground, where there have been few ground improvements, concern was centred on improvements to the
      stadia such as covering the terracing and more seating. However, at Ibrox (Rangers Football Ground)
      and Pittodrie (Aberdeen Football Club Ground) where the fans feel there is little room for improvement
      of the facilities, the concern was focussed on the quality of the football and additional types of
      entertainment.”

  4.136 It would be splendid if perimeter-fencing and segregation barriers could be removed. They are in
England and Wales, of comparatively recent origin. In the past we looked with superior amusement at
countries elsewhere where it was thought necessary to introduce them. It is, however, quite clear that in
England and Wales, at any rate, a very g r e a t deal of trouble would exist without them, although they are
not universal. In Scotland they are almost non-existent. The grounds at Pittodrie and Ibrox are a model.
One advantage of introducing successful membership schemes could be to reduce the number of perimeter
fences.

   4.137 In my Interim Report I recommended1 that consideration be given to the design of a standard
efficient perimeter fence with proper exits. That was understood in some quarters to mean that I had
recommended that perimeter fences should be installed as a matter of routine at all grounds. That was not

my intention. What I was saying was that if perimeter fencing was to be installed at a particular ground,
it would be sensible that the design of it should be standardised. I have seen a number of perimeter fences
in various parts of the country. They varied in quality and design enormously and I suspect also in cost.
Some were efficient, some not particularly so. At one ground there was a perimeter fence which could not
possibly be criticised on grounds of efficiency. However, because of the nature of its construction, those
inside the stand had very great difficulty in watching the football. Thus while they were physically controlled,
their enjoyment was exceedingly limited. Nor are perimeter fences the only method of preventing spectators
from getting on to the pitch. There are very efficient methods adopted at some Continental grounds like
double fencing and dry moats.

   4.138     It would, in my view, be of immense help to those clubs who are intending to put perimeter fencing
in, or are minded to alter their existing fences, to have a standard specification, so that an efficient perimeter
fence, if one is required, can be installed. I would like to have persuaded the Football Association to set
up a small working party to help the clubs develop a standard design. They declined the invitation pointing
out that if their design was unsuccessful and the fence surmounted, this would undermine their disciplinary
power. I still think they are the proper organisation to look at this problem.

                                                      Hooliganism

      5.1 I do not believe that my Report would be complete without an examination of some of the current
    theories about hooliganism.

      5.2 There are three popular fallacies about hooliganism. Firstly, that it is something comparatively new.
    Secondly, that it is only found at soccer matches and thirdly, that it is an English disease.

    (i) Hooliganism is not a new phenomenon
       5.3 Seneca (who died in AD. 65) devoted the last three years of his life to philosophy and to writing
    letters to Lucilius a native o f Pompeii. In one of them he wrote (Penguin Classics translation): “You asked
    me to say what you should consider it particnlarly important to avoid. My answer is this: the mass crowd. It
    is something to which you cannot entrust yourself yet without r is k .. . Associating with people in large numbers
    is actually harmful. There is not one of them that will not make some vice or other attractive to us or leave
    us carrying the imprint of it or be daubed all unawares with it. And inevitably enough, the larger the size of
    the crowd we mingle with the greater the danger.”

       5.4 . . . “I happened to go to one of these shows at the time of the lunch hour interlude, expecting there to
■      some light and witty entertainment then, some respite for the purpose of affording people’s eyes a rest from
    human blood. Far from it. All the earlier contests were charity in comparison . . . What we have now is murder
    pure and simple. . . In the morning men are thrown to the lions and the bears but it is the spectators they are
    thrown to in the lunch hour. The spectators insist that each, on killing his man should be thrown against
    another, to be killed in his turn; and the eventual victor is reserved by them for some other form of butchery;
    the only exit for the contestants is death. Fire and steel keep the slaughter going. And all this happens whilst
    the Arena is virtually empty. . . . And when there is an interval in the show there is a cry ‘let’s have some
    throats cut in the mean-time so that there is something happening’.”

       5.5 Writing in 1788 from Downing Street, Edward Gibbon described in his History of the Decline and
    Fail o f the Roman Empire the factions of the circus in Rome in AD. 548 thus: ‘‘The race in its first
    institution was a simple contest of two chariots whose drivers were distinguished by white and red liveries; two
    additional colours, a light green and cerulean blue were afterwards introduced; and as the races were repeated
    25 times, 100 chariots contributed in the same day to the pomp of the circus . . . The bloody and tumultuous
    contest continued to disturb the public festivity till the last age of the spectacles of Rome” ... .

      5.6 “ Constantinople adopted the follies though not the virtues of ancient Rome; and the same factions which
    had agitated the circus, raged with redoubled fury in the hippodrome. Under the reign of Anastasius, this
    popular frenzy was inflamed by religious zeal; and the greens who had treacherously concealed stones and
    daggers under baskets of fruit massacred at a solemn festival 3,000 of their blue adversaries” .

^fc.7 “The blues affected to strike terror by a peculiar and barbaric dress, the long hair of the Huns, their
close sleeves and ample garments, a lofted step and a sonorous voice. In the day they concealed their two-
edged poinards but in the night they boldly assembled in arms and in numerous bands, prepared for every act
of violence and rapine. Their adversaries of the green faction or even inoffensive citizens were stripped and
often murdered by these nocturnal robbers, and it became dangerous to wear any gold buttons or girdles or to
 appear at a late hour in the street of the peaceful capital.”

       5.8 Gibbon then describes the sedition which occurred and continued: “It is computed that about 30,000
    persons were slain in the merciless and promiscuous carnage of the day . . . the Hippodrome itself was
    condemned during several years to a mournful silence; with the restoration of the games, the same disorders
    revived and the blue and green factions continued to afflict the reign of Justinian and to disturb the tranquility
    of the eastern empire.”

      5.9 Antonia Fraser reports in her book “Cromwell Our Chief of Men” that in 1655 in the Midlands, in
    order to preserve the Peace it was considered necessary to ban football matches and race meetings.

      5.10 The Leicester Daily Mercury records a disgraceful scene at the match between Burnley and Blackburn
    in 1S90 when: “the Referee was mobbed at the close, the official had to be protected by the Committee and
    so demonstrative were the spectators that the Police could not clear the field. He had to take refuge under the
grandstand and subsequently in a neighbouring house. The police force was increased and eventually the
Referee was hurried into a cab and driven away followed by a howling stone-throwing mob.”

  5.11 There are more recent examples of football hooliganism. In 1909 at Hampden Park some 6,000
spectators pulled up goalposts, fences and pay-boxes, set fire to them and danced rouhd them in the middle
of the pitch. Police, firemen and ambulancemen were stoned, fire engines damaged and hoses slashed.
Police, after throwing the stones back at the rioters, finally cleared the ground at seven o’clock at a cost
of fifty-four Constables injured and the destruction of virtually every street round Hampden. Sixty other
people were also injured.
     a

  5.12 Neither of the New Year’s Day matches at Parkhead in 1898 or Ibrox in 1905, between Rangers
and Celtic, were finished because of pitch invasions. There were serious outbreaks of disorder in Scottish
Football in 1941, 1949, 1953, 1955, 1957, 1958 and on into the 1960s. The disorder consisted of fighting,
bottle-throwing and pitch invasions in addition to ritual chanting, obscenities and jeering. The Glasgow
Herald wrote in 1952: “This hooliganism on the sports field cannot be allowed to go on. The sport of football
must be cleared up.”

(ii) Hooliganism is only a football problem
   5.13 This is not wholly true. 1954 saw the MCC in the. West Indies playing the third Test Match at
Georgetown, British Guyana. The West Indians were about to put on 100 when one of their batsmen was
run-out. ScufHing broke out in the stand behind square-leg. Dozens of bottles were hurled towards the
square-leg umpire who had given the batsman, out and mounted police had to be moved onto the scene of
disorder.

  5.14 Six years later in the second Test at Queens Park, Port of Spain, there was a similar occurrence.
Again a West Indian was run-out. Again bottles were thrown onto the field by the crowd. Beer cans, fruit
and anything else which came to hand was also thrown. Then the crowd came onto the field of play; finally
the game had to be abandoned for the day.

   5.15 In November 1963 there was a riot at a horse race track in the New York area. There were fifteen
arrests and. fifteen taken to hospital. Booths were set on fire and cars damaged.

  5.16 In 1955 at an ice hockey match between Montreal Canadians and Detroit Redskins there was a
major riot. A smoke bomb was thrown. Cars were overturned, stores were looted and there were one
hundred arrests.

(iii) Football hooliganism only occurs in this country
   5.17 This is not the case. In Brazil, in September 1950, one person was shot dead and several others
injured, four seriously, when an angry crowd tried to drag a football referee from inside a police car at
Rio de Janeiro. In Italy, in March 1951, police used tear gas to disperse thousands of angry football
spectators who broke into a visiting football team's dressing room at Bari, Southern Italy, injured a player
and the trainer and chased the referee four miles to a farm house.

   5.IS    The official communist newspaper, Bauber, described a game near Belgrade in 1955 in this way:
“ Fans rushed on to the field carrying knives, knocked down the Referee and put him out of action for at least
six months.”

   5.19 The St Louis Post Despatch, in December 1976, described a football game in this way: “ At a
National Football League game at Foxborough, Massachusetts between the New York Jets and the New
England Patriots, rowdy fans continually ran out onto the field, stopping play a dozen times. By the time the
game ended two fans had died of heart attacks, 30 were taken to hospital with cuts and bruises, 49 were
arrested, a policeman’s jaw was broken and a spectator had been stabbed. In the parking lot a policeman was
giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a heart-attack victim when a drunken fan urinated on the officer’s
back.”

The extent of hooliganism
  5.20 There is then considerable evidence about the age and generality of the problem. It is less easy
however to measure its extent and development. One of the problems confronting anyone enquiring into
the problems of hooliganism is the total lack of any reliable statistics. It is possible to ascertain from the

                                                         50
  police the number of arrests during a season at a particular ground. By comparing these figures with the
  previous year or years, some sort of conclusion can be drawn, particularly if the number of spectators is
  also known. Thus arrests as a percentage of spectators can be calculated.

    5.21 Unfortunately this is an unreliable approach. Firstly, the data often do not distinguish between
  those arrested inside and those arrested outside the ground. Secontily the offences are not denned; they
  may be, for example, pick-pocketing, drunkenness or violence. Thirdly, the number of arrests may not
  indicate the extent of violence because when a riot takes place police may have to spend more time detending
  themselves than arresting people; on other occasions which are less violent they may be more able to arrest
  the trouble-makers.

      5.22 It might have been thought that this violence has been a problem for football clubs for many years
  the first thing the football authorities would have done would have been to seek to establish the extent of
  it. Far from it.
     5.23 Presently at every Football League match in England and Wales there is an observer appointed by
  the Football League to assess and report on the performance of the referee. In European and Internationa
  matches there is an assessor who reports on the game, including crowd problems. When I suggested to the
  Football League that their observers at domestic matches might also observe and report on any crowd
  problems they were not enthusiastic. Nor it appears are there any official plans for the central collection
A p f statistics on this important subject. The result is that any student of the problem has to make do with
  inadequate statistics and a good deal of folklore because the authorities are unable to provide the assistance
  so that the necessary lessons may be learned.
     5.24 In July 1976, a panel established jointly by the Sports Council and the Social Science Research
  Council reported on the problems of anti-social behaviour at sporting events.1 In its recommendations for
  research the Report said this: “ During its discussion the Panel was constantly hindered by a lack oftjastc
  statistical information about hooligans and hooliganism. As a result it cannot be claimed that it has achieve
  a thorough understanding of the nature of the problem or of its extent. It appears that much of the data needed
  might already be available in police records, but not in a readily accessible or systematised form. While tms
  is not a recommendation for research as such, the Panel feels that a routine system of collecting information
  from police forces in England and Wales about football hooliganism should be establisne .

      5.25 Although that recommendation was made in 1977 no serious attention appears to have been paid
   to it. Recently, however, the Football Association wrote to all Football League C l u b s in England an
   Wales: “We at The Football Association are monitoring the problems o f various Clubs and trying to ensure
   that where potential problems exist a Club is forewarned. Some form o f inform ation service ls^there ore
   necessary to enable us to provide meaningful help to Clubs and, for this reason, >ve         a s " J0** °
   a report on your home matches equally with reference to the visiting supporters. A eit a t e t e
   is a helpful approach and to be encouraged. It is still vitally important that the police and the clubs shou
        together so that henceforth it is possible for the clubs to obtain statistics on the num er o rr
        nature of the offences which occur on their property.

     5.26 The figures of arrest at the twelve London dubs, over the last ten years are,
   there were just under three arrests per 10,000 spectators. They went up to four in 1976-77, down to three
   ana in in 1978-79, up to five in 1980-81, down to four in 1982-83 and is now on the way up a=ainProfessor
   Canter, a consultant to my Inquiry says: “The general trend is clearly upwards. Overall the ratio j,s
   hut what is also noticeable is that there appears to be a 4 to 5 year cycle, the troug s o w 1
   coincide with World Cup years.”

       5.27 Professor Canter has also looked at the casaulties at a ground to see whether the‘r n^ ber ‘^ "1
    proportion to the arrests and ejections; he concludes that there is a d.rect relationship between the number
    i’f incidents and the number of casualties.
       5.28 His conclusion is: “Taken altogether, the figures show an increasing trend towards ™len,ce
    arrest or ejection. They also show that the violence linked to these arrests appears to be 1‘n ^ d o casualt.es
    Those Clubs, especially in the major cities that attract larger followings, appear tohave more M olent ^incidents
    associated with their matches and these appear to be typically, although not solely, at ga
    larger crowds” .            '                   ________ ________________ —— -----                 —---------- .

                                                                  51
  5.29 “The thesis that some clubs and special matches are the prime focus of acts of violence is supported
by these figures. Discussions with police and other researchers argue this too. Our figures do corroborate these
generally held views to some extent.”                                                          ^

   5.30 “ But there is an important caveat. Few Clubs are without incident during a season, so to ‘blame’ a few
clubs is to ignore the widespread pattern. Further, whatever the threat of ‘away’ supporters, ‘home’ supporters
are not completely innocent.” Professor Canter says: “Two other comments follow from these findings. The
first is that it is possible to identity patterns to incidents from available data provided that enough data is
collated together^ Secondly, this being the case, the football authorities (as well as the Police) can tackle the
clubs directly wh jse supporters are frequently associated.”

   5.31 The poin: is made however that differences between clubs are enormous. Professor Canter says: “It
is clear that each club has its own ethos. The question is thus raised whether this might relate to aggressive
acts as indicated in arrests.” The arrest ievels at the Tottenham Hotspur and Millwall grounds have
remained fairly Constant over this time, at between three and four arrests per 10,000 spectators while at
Chelsea it has fluctuated from two or three per 10,000 from 1975-79 to between seven and eight per 10,000
today.      t

   5.32 A team of sociologists at the University of Leicester who have made a special study of hooliganism,
say: “It is not our contention that, because hooliganism at football matches can be shown to be deeply rooted
in the British past, it has therefore been entirely unchanging in its forms, contents and consequences. Among
the factors at work shaping the specific character of the ‘football hooligan-phenomenon’ since the late 1950s
have been:
  1. the structural changes that have occurred in the ‘rough’ and ‘respectable’ sections of the working class,
     and in relationships between them;
  2. the rise of a specifically teenage leisure market;
  3. the increased ability and desire of young fans to travel to away matches on a regular basis;
  4. changes in the structure of the game itself;
  5. specific attempts by the Football Authorities to curb hooliganism and, above all, the involvement of
     central.govemment in this process;
  6. changes in the mass media, above all the advent of television and emergence of the ‘tabloid’ press with
     its competition-generated and commercially-orientated concept of newsworthiness;
     and
  7. finally, the recent virtual collapse of the youth labour-market.”

   5.33 In our view, these features, which are all in some sense at least historically specific have made a
significant contribution to the form, content and extent of football hooliganism since the 1950s.

  5.34 Almost everyone to whom I have spoken both in the football world, in the press and the media
generally, in the police and in the academic world, agrees that the amount of violence which is related to
soccer, has increased; the statistics also tend to support this view. A distinction needs to be made, however,
between violence which occurs inside the ground and violence which occurs outside the ground. There is a
good deal of evidence that as the art of controlling a crowd within the ground increases and the physical
constraints are improved, so the problem is simply transported from inside to outside the ground.

   5.35 This may be a matter of congratulation and pleasure to the football clubs and.to those who have
inside the ground but it is not much consolation to spectators when going to or from the ground or to the
ordinary citizen going about his lawful business in the streets of the town where the football match is being
played.

Characteristics of the hooligan
   5.36 Who then are these hooligans and why do they behave as they do? A good deal of work has been
done by sociologists and others in an attempt to answer this question. The Sports Council Report1 says:
“There is a substantial body of literature describing and analysing the sub-culture of violence which is followed
by young men in the lower classes of many societies . . . It is a culture which values additional masculine
virtues of courage and skill in fighting, of heavy drinking and exploitative sex; of loyalty to other members of
Mbid


                                                       52
the group and control over local territory. It would appear that the core members of fan groups are drawn
from communities where those values still hold and these values are reaffirmed and given a new location in
football hooliganism. These values have not only been challenged by alternative values held by other classes
in Britain but by the emergence of new youth cultures with which they come into conflict.”

  5.37 “The sub-cultural violence has found a new location in football. Football has created new heroes who
exemplify its values and extend its territories well beyond the local street, cafes and public houses.”

  5.38 The Report goes on: “Whatever the experts are likely to say about the natural aggressivity of young
males and the way this is released in crowd situations, those who have to deal with the problem of football
hooliganism, whether the police or the management of the clubs, believe that in some way it reflects on the
breakdown of authority in modern Britain, and the ineffectiveness of home, school and churches in bringing
up children.”
  5.39 “They believe it is society’s problem and represents the consequences of a permissive society. There is
a sense in which it may be society’s problem but a different explanation might be offered. We have already
drawn attention to the nourishment which football hooliganism draws from certain elements in traditional
working class culture; the value it places on masculinity, violence and loyalty. These elements far from being
the result of social change are extremely resistant to it. There are however important changes taking^ place in
British society which may bear upon any long term solution to the problems of football hooliganism.’

   5.40 The Sports Council Report points out that there is nothing new about violence in the young: “ Gangs
of young adolescents who are alienated or in direct revolt against society are not a new phenomenon. Th§
post-war years have seen the rock and roll riots of the Teddy Boys, the Mods and Rockers, the Skinheads
and the Bower Boys. All seem to be seeking a distinct identity for themselves by special clothes, a feeling of
solidarity by concerted actions and a sense of being wanted through companionship. Football fans are in a
similar mould. They seek ‘male bonding’ because they are in a critical gap between the stage of detachment
from family dependence—if they ever enjoyed this fully—and the stage of marriage. This is a simpler
explanation than the claim that they retain vestigial traces of instinctive hunting behaviour from their
evolutionary forebears, although the latter is as difficult to falsify as it is to prove.”

   5.41 “They not only seek each other’s company, but are pressed into it by a society whose structure does
not offer them much in the way of alternative affiliations. So we see young males ‘moving around’ together m
varying degrees of mutual dependance from the occasional ‘meeting up’ to the closely knit gang. If masculinity
and aggression (let us not forget spontaneous wit and m utual loyalty) are values adopted by these groups, it
is the understandable consequence of a socialisation which shapes the need to acquire these qualities as a mark
of manhood.”
   5.42 “The football match turns out to be a natural arena for the rehearsal of these qualities and for the
strengthening of bonds with each other. It offers an acknowledged meeting place, a carnival atmosphere and
exciting contrast to the drabness of the workaday week. But principally it offers scope for belonging to a
loosely constructed group, a gang or a clique; for assuming a role and taking part in the action. For a fan
group has an explicit shared aim although may not be held with the same degree of conviction by a
members. It is that the team should win. The aim Is victory. This objective, to support a team and in so doing
help it to win, far from being reprehensible in our society is generally regarded as desirable.

  5.43 One of the Leeds United supporters to whom I spoke expressed it in this way He said he would
rather see his side win a boring game by 1-0 than see an exciting game which his team lost 5-4. Winning is
everything. Losing is nothing.

 Why football particularly? *
    5.44 The report continues:
 “We still have to ask, however, why football support to a much greater degree than other sports provides a
 situation that is so primed that it sometimes erupts into disorder.”

   .5.45 “Some of the differences between football and other sports can be spelt out in greater detail. It is
 important to emphasise that no single feature but only a combination will suffice to portray e oo a ma c
 as a situation with a potential for extreme behaviour.”
   5.46     “ 1. There is a very strong belief that the presence of large numbers of supporters spurs a team to
 greater effort. It is also widely felt that if this presence can be made explicit by shouting and chanting the
 effect will be that much greater. It is partly for this reason that organised supporters and fan clubs are strongly
 encouraged by management and why teams are expected to perform better on their home territory.. . . The
 belief in clamourous support does not obtain in all games and the differences are not merely accidental. Football
 is a continuous physical activity that proceeds so rapidly that each action seems almost a reflex. It does not
 require the concentration or ‘cerebration’ of a chess match or a golf tournament, where the players’ moves are
 invariably accompanied by a hush on the part of the spectators and not by shouting. It is in general accord
 with research on social facilitation and ‘audiences’ that support can induce ‘arousal’ and hence more physical
 effort but that for tasks requiring careful thought at the time when the action is carried out, audiences are
 distracting and counterproductive.”

         “2. There are only two parties to a football match, for the entire event. The competition is completely
 polarised; if one team wins, the other loses and there is no fine gradation of awards. The same applies to the
 supporters. They are in direct and simple opposition and this implies also that each side is united within itself
 into a huge collectivity for the purposes of direct competition with the other side. This competition does not
 end with the match - there are traditional enemies, old scores to settle and reputations to attack or defend and
 the frequency of the meetings reinforces the partisanship.”

         “3. The game itself includes a fast moving series of direct physical confrontations as well as cooperative
 movements between team members. The spectators can readily identify with these movements, both individually
 and collectively because all the action can be seen by the whole of the audience at the same time. They can
 follow and respond to the shifting fortunes and experience vicariously the often aggressive encounters. Quite
 often the outcome is unpredictable up till the closing minutes.”

           “4. A strong sense of ‘involvement’ or identification with what is happening on the field of play, whether
 it is a clash of individuals or a team movement, arises from the fact (relatively unique to football) that a high
 proportion of the spectators have played the game themselves through the early years of their lives or are still
 playing.” I have to say that I question this view. I am by no means sure that such a high proportion of
 football supporters have in fact played the game to the extent suggested and I am equally doubtful that in
 other games like rugby union and cricket the proportion of spectators who themselves have played or are
 playing is necessarily less than at football.

          “5. An additional factor to combine with the preceding ones to further delineate football is its strong
- basis in working class culture. Football is still an institution that is distinctly working class. The terraces at
 big matches have become obvious and prominent places for proudly displaying and emphasising class values
 and this process is of course mutually re-inforcing. It is readily observed not only at the cultural but also at
 the individual levels. Some social scientists say that aggression is more encouraged in the social upbringing of
 working class children but more heavily punished when it is employed and that punishment further reinforces
 its use because it is itself aggression and administered by a revered model ie the parent. In middle class
 upbringing, physical forms of aggression are less encouraged as acceptable social behaviour and they also
 receive less punishment when they are deployed.”

          “6. The alignment of football teams is territorial . . . the large majority of supporters are drawn from
 a fairly localised territory. Unlike middle class people, whose attachment is more likely to be temporary and
 whose lives are more mobile, working class youths and adults have a very strong attachment to place” . . .

    5.47 The report continues: “It may be noted that we have not so far referred to the possibility of frustration
 which in one of the main theories of aggression is regarded as a main instigator. In football hooliganism, it is
 doubtful if it adds much strength to the explanation. If some young people are frustrated by unemployment
 and the many social deprivations to which they are exposed, this is a chronic condition and not something that
 is acutely experienced at football matches. Indeed, the reverse is more likely. It may, however, be argued thut
 the fan groups’ major aim is frustrated if its*team is defeated or one of its members unfairly treated, and that
 this frustration intensifies if the fans are prevented by the police and by the layout of the Ends from correcting
 the injustice of humiliation.”

    5.48 Finally the Report says: “It must be re-emphasised that none of the conditions we have outlined are
 enough by themselves to distinguish football from similar spectator sports such as rugby union and league,
 American baseball and football and ice hockey and so on. However, when taken in combination they amount
 to a formidable set of predisposing characteristics. It must follow that if action is to be taken to minimise the
 undesirable consequences of football, it must be taken at many points. There cannot be a single panacea.”

   5.49 The reference to Rugby League points a contrast between the atmosphere at that sport and at
 association football. I was able to watch a Rugby League club game attended by 12,500 spectators. There


                                                        , 54
       were no perimeter fences. There was no form of segregation. There were no incidents. Only some 20 police
       officers were on hand. There were large numbers of women and children present; the afternoon was an
       enjoyable day out for everyone. On the previous day when England played New Zealand, however,
       policemen had had to go onto the pitch to sort out players who were fighting among themselves.

          5.50 Professor Canter in his Report to me said: “The genera! concern with violence, at and around football
       matches, has been the reason for a great many official and technical reports and a number of studies. From
       these examinations some general explanations of violence at football matches have been put forward. These
       explanations do carry implications for crowd safety and control.”

         5.51 “The following hypotheses have been put forward to explain violence at and around football matches.
       As will be apparent the different hypotheses are not necessarily competitive or mutually exclusive, although
       they do carry differing implications for control.”

         5.52 The various explanations identified by Professor Canter are these:
        “ 1. Violence is a conscious deliberate activity sought after by particular organised groups.
         2. Particular fodtbail dubs have attracted a membership that contains small numbers of supporters groups
             that are especially prone to violent behaviour.
         3. Watching football can be an intensely rowdy activity. Under given physical or emotional circumstances
             notably on the terraces and at important major matches, this rowdyism will burst into violence.
         4. Violence is'a direct product of uncontrolled confrontation between rival groups of fans.
         5. Football hooliganism is a quasi-political reaction by unemployed disaffected youth against an uncaring
             society and against Clubs more interested in their players than in their supporters.
         6 . Most aggressive behaviour among football supporters is essentially ritual not intended to lead to actual
             acts of violence. It only evolves Into violence when the ritual breaks down say due to misunderstanding
             by the supporters or the police.”

       The “new” hooligan
         5.53 Many responsible organisations and individuals I have spoken to in the course of my Inquiry
       expressed serious concern about the rise of what they saw as a new breed of football hooligan. The Leicester
       sociologists say:1
        “In our research we have been particularly interested in what the football hooligans themselves and other
        young fans call ‘fighting crews’ specialty those of the ‘super hooligan groups’ which have evolved in recent
        years at some of the larger clubs. . . . One of their main distinguishing marks is the fact that they do not
        travel to matches on ‘football specials’ and official coaches but tend instead to use regular coach or rail services
        or cars and hired vans. They also eschew the forms of dress, the scarves and favours (also the club banners)
        that still tend to be widely associated with football hooligans in popular opinion. One of their main objectives
        in attending matches is to confront and fight opposing fans and to ‘take their end’. Fans of this kind travel
    ^ p ith o u t identifying colours in order to avoid advertising themselves too soon to rival fans and the police.”

         5.54 The way they operate was graphically described in a recent trial at the Old Bailey before Judge
       Hilliard.

         5.55 On the day of the offence Chelsea were due to play Cambridge Uniced Football Club at Cambridge.
       A large police operation had been mounted involving over 400 officers. Chelsea supporters had. apparently,
       on a previous visit to Cambridge caused damage to property and p ossib ly to other persons. A number of
       Cambridge supporters, about 60-80 young men, gathered at a public house. There was no trouble in the
       public house because police officers visited from time to time. It is clear, however, that look-outs had been
       posted so that they could give warning not only of the approach of Chelsea supporters but also of the
      .police.

         5.56 The leader of the group %vas known as the “General” . He had been subject to a life ban from
       Cambridge United Football Club from November 1983.

         5.57 Some time about midday, a group of about 50 youths were seen running from the direction of the
       public house. They were carrying weapons in the forms of bottles or s:ones. A local resident realised they
       ‘ Dunning. M urphy and Williams: ‘‘Spectator Violence at Football M atches: tow ards a sociological explanation . British Journal of

 were hunting or hounding Chelsea supporters. He could hear the sound of bottles being broken and glasses
 being trampled into the ground. The Cambridge supporters proceeded to ambush and then attack the
 Chelsea supporters.

    5.58 One of the accused was asked what he had against Chelsea supporters. He said: “They’re animals.”
 And when asked what he got out of it he said: “It’s a bit of excitement.‘What is there in Cambridge for
- young people., . . The bastards give you a good hiding up there anyway. What Cambridge needs is something
 like a Mecca.” One of the other youths said: “ I have been depressed for some time now and I formed the
 opinion that if I was going to take my aggression out on anybody I may as well have one with football
 supporters. I knew the people in there—[the public house/ —would be looking for trouble.”

   5.59 One of the accused said: “I knew there would be trouble because other years when that many people
 meet, it always leads to trouble, and it was obvious from the talk in the pub that some people were intent on
 getting Chelsea fans on their way to the ground.” And another said: “It was obvious what was going to
 happen . . . when those teams are in town a lot of kids go out looking for trouble.”

    5.60 The Jadge said this: “Now in this case a group of youths and young adults at different times and
  varying, according to estimates, between 30 and 150 took part in attacks on Chelsea supporters between noon
  and 2 pm . . . The final exit from [the public house], about 2 pm was a determined and cunning attack by
  about 80 people. At a nearby road junction the mob split into two parts and each part then approached the
  main Newmarket Road by separate side roads, thus trapping Chelsea supporters and ordinary members of the
  public going to the football ground. The site for this was carefully chosen to permit of no escape, the main
  road at that point having iron railings upon the entire length of the centre reservation. Sticks, pool cues, bottles
 'and glasses were carried as weapons by some of those in both groups, and were used on those caught in the
  pincer movement. Some Chelsea fans escaped by jumping over the railings. One who failed to make it was hit
  over the head with a bottle and jabbed in the neck with a broken end, severing an artery, and might well have
  died but for skillful first-aid by a police officer and good medical attention. Another young man had his jaw
  broken in three places, merely for being in the way, and was kicked and beaten to the ground in front of
  ordinary men and women who were helpless to intervene.”

   5.61 “This was organised, pre-planned violence which endangered life. An experienced policeman said it was
 the "worst series of indicents he had seen in ten years, and there were a number of other incidents involving
 groups of youths attacking single youths with feet and fists and weapons—too many to mention.”

    5.62 Of the leader, who was sentenced to five years imprisonment, the Judge said: “An intelligent and
 reasoned letter which I have read shows that you have some insight. . . It also shows that you are articulate,
 fluent and persuasive in a high degree.”

    5.63 Many of the accused did not fall into the so-called “rough” working class category. One, who was
 sentenced to ten months imprisonment, was described by the Judge as having a good work record and
 attractive references. Another who had no previous convictions was described by a probation officer as
 being a very decent young man. Of another it was said by his employers, that he had worked well for them
 and that his behaviour was out of character. Yet another, was a computer engineer; he was buying his own
 home and he was engaged to be married. Another had previous exemplary character and had glowing and
 unsolicited testimonials from neighbours. Another was a hard-working apprentice from a secure home
 background. Others were described as being well-employed with good references, coming from good homes;
 yet another was described as having an exemplary lifestyle, a committed Christian.

   5.64 An example of the ingenuity of the modern hooligan was given to me by one police force. One
 group of hooligans in order to avoid detection by the police on a visit to an away-match, hired morning
 suits and travelled by British Rail having persuaded the authorities that they were going to a wedding.

    5.65 The evidence given to me also shows that one characteristic of today’s hooligan is that often he
 quite deliberately does not take alcohol in order better to carry out his part in the planned operation and
 to keep his mind clear.

 The Scottish experience
   5.66 A study, sponsored by the Football Trust on crowd behaviour at football matches, was carried out
 by a research team from the Centre for Leisure Research, Dunfermline College of Physical Education (then
 part of Edinburgh University) between 1982 and 1984, and was published in January 1984.

                                                           56
   5.67 It is clear from that Report, from my discussions with Mr Coalter (who was a leader of the research
team) and from evidence which I received, both from the Scottish police and the football authorities, that
there are a number of significant differences between what happens in Scotland and in England.

   5.68 The Dunfermline study investigated three football clubs, namely, Glasgow Rangers, Glasgow Celtic
and Aberdeen Football Club. Overall they drew a number of conclusions. They found: “Scottish Clubs and
their supporters [were] distinct from those south of the border and as such [merited] study in their own right.”
They concluded that both Aberdeen and Rangers retained more traditional community links and further,
that: “The relatively low level of commercialism and the rather more traditional, even populist, links between
the Clubs and their supporters mean that the various theories developed largely on the basis of English evidence
to explain the meaning and significance of the game to supporters (and in particular the roots of football
hooliganism) appear less applicable in Scotland.” The study continues. “In addition, soccer related violence
in Scotland is also distinct from that in England in that it tends to be fuelled by sectarian antagonism. Some
of the forces which tend to promote and encourage violence therefore are well outside professional football
and have long historical roots”.

   5.69 One of thl significant developments in Scottish football has been the emergence of the so-called
“Casuals” . They were originally So named because of their clothing. They originated in Aberdeen probably
from copying the style of some English supporters and have now spread to a large number of clubs. They
attach themselves to a club and adopt its name. They are bent on fighting the opposition fans in order to
enhance their own prestige.

  5.70 When I talked to Mr Coalter he was somewhat sceptical about the significance of the “Casuals”.
Mr Coalter’s view was that they were comparatively unimportant, that the label was simply attached to
them by the media and that they represented no more than a very small minority of football supporters.
The Casuals are however, in the view of the police, a very real problem. They are well organised, appear
to have money and cause a great deal of trouble, particularly outside the football grounds.

  5.71 Other evidence I have received from responsible people tends to suggest that under whatever name
they use, the Casuals are a greater problem than hitherto. They travel more widely, are very much better
organised and tend to seek out their opponents in areas away from football grounds like city centres where
the police are less prepared for them.
   5.72'The Dunfermline report goes on: “Surveys at the three Clubs demonstrate that the popular stereotype
of football supporters as male working class adults is only partly true. Although still predominantly male the
survey has revealed that the supporters at three Stadiums were predominantly in the younger age group (under
30) in the skilled occupational groups, whether white-collar or blue-collar but with a significant proportion
from the professional and intermediate white-collar occupations.” The Report points out a difference between
Rangers, which attracts a high proportion of the traditional or working class supporters, while at Aberdeen
there is a significantly larger proportion of white-collar workers.
   5.73 The Report continues: “The analysis of the data on arrests for football related offences confirms the
conclusions of the McElhone Report that the number of arrested per thousand spectators is extremely low.
Moreover a small number of matches account for a large proportion of the total arrests and a large number
of the arrests occur at games in which tensions are heightened by sectarian rivalries. The majority of offenders
are arrested for forms of vocal aggression and the types of offences commonly associated in the public mind
with hooliganism - physical violence, damage to property, pitch invasions - form a relative small proportion
of .he total. As such it is argued that much of the disorder which does occur might more aptly be labelled
rowdyism than hooliganism.” The Report continues: “Seating and segregation have in combination contributed
to the reduction in level of crowd disorder within stadiums. The segregation of opposing fans within the ground
is regarded by the police as perhaps the biggest single contribution in the reduction in crowd disorder.”

■ 5.74 The Dunfermline Study goes on to say that while the problem of crowd disorder within stadia is
largely contained, “if crowd disorder occurs it is more likely to occur outside the stadium after the game.
 Furthermore the offences committed outside the stadiums are more likely to be violent in nature than those
inside. Ironically while solving crowd problems within stadiums, an unintended consequence of the segregation
of large crowds’mav be to provide the potential conditions for disorder outside the grounds. Segregated and
 coherent groups may provide the basis for the continuation of forms of behaviour which while tolerated inside
 the ground, quickly become defined as unacceptable outside. Many of the officers interviewed saw the major
 issue of football related crowd disorder as being the inconvenience to local residents and damage to property
 outside stadiums; however there was a recognition that given the random nature and geographical spread of
 many of these incidents they pose a difficult problem to combat”.

                                                        57
Experience elsewhere
   5.75 The experience in America and elsewhere is not substantially different. Dr Goldstein, of the
Department of Psychology of Temple University, Philadelphia, reviews (in “Sports Violence” 1), a series of
articles by distinguished international experts, indicating that aggressive sports tend to increase not only
the aggression of those who participate but of also some of those who watch. The argument is that fans
who get caught up in outright violence do not seem to be psychologically different from most other fans,
but the one difference is that they are almost universally young men, some of whom come to sports events
in the hope of a battle:

   5.76 On the question of the relationship between aggression on the field and aggression off the field, the
emerging view was that the particularly brutal and angry aggression that is virtually an integral part of
some forms of competitive sport increases the likelihood of imitative violence among crowds dominated
by young adult males. One of the articles suggests, for example, that anonymity and excitement allows fans
to put aside more readily the inhibitions that would keep them from being openly aggressive in other
situations. Violence on the playing field then holds out to them an example they are more likely to follow.
Drinking adds to that likelihood.

  5.77 In the articles there is also a good deal of support for the view that “perceived injustice” is an
important cause of much violence among spectators. Put another way a spectator who thinks his team has
been unjustly treated will react violently and aggressively. Certainly, anyone who has been present at a
football match is well aware that the referee’s decision can give rise to considerable controversy, not only
among players on the field, but among spectators in the stands and on the terraces. Bad refereeing has
always led to problems on the field because players are only too ready to take advantage of any weakness
they perceive, or alternatively to redress the balance of what they perceive was an injustice by taking the
law into their own hands.

   5.78 There are, of course, a great number of well-documented outbreaks of violence at sports grounds
which have resulted from a disputed decision by an official. For example on 24 May 1964 there was a
soccer match between Peru and Argentina. With two minutes left in the contest, Argentina was leading
1-0. Peru then scored. However, the goal was disallowed by the referee because of rough play. Fans broke
onto the'field,' the match was suspended, more fans crashed onto the field, the police fired revolvers and
tear gas and the crowd panicked. As a result of the riot, some 300 spectators were killed.

  5.79 The various types of disorders are classified in “Sports Violence” into five major categories. They
are: '
      1. Frustration disorders They occur when spectators’ expectations of access to the game and the way it
         will be played or adjudicated are thwarted. Included in this is “perceived injustice” when a source of
         frustration occurs as when fans believe that an incompetent or biased official has cost their team
         victory.
      2. Outlawry disorders They occur when groups of violence-prone spectators use sports events to act out
         their anti-social activities by attacking officials, fighting with rival fans and destroying property. Such
        ■ crowd violence is seen as the work of a delinquent or criminal element.
      3. Remonstrance disorders They occur when a section of a crowd uses a sports event as an arena for
         the expression of political grievances.
      4. Confrontation disorders They break out when spectators fro.m rival religious, geographic, ethnic or
         national groups come into conflict. Given the appropriate circumstances, smouldering resentment can
         easily spark into open hostility, so that local Derby games where regional supremacy is at stake are
         an ideal setting for confrontation riots.
      5. Finally, there is what is called an expressive riot, which is the intense emotional arousal which
         accompanies victory or defeat, particularly if it is exciting or unexpected and uninhibited behaviour
         is then triggered.

  What is apparent from the above categorisation, it is said, is that no single control measure could cope
with all the triggers of disorder and that action which might be suitable for one situation could be
inappropriate in another.                                         ._____________ __________________ _

  Extreme Political Activity
    5.80    There is a substantial body of evidence that political activists are present at football grounds in
  England although it seems not to be a problem in Scotland. Football grounds are used in order to recruit
  new members and leaflets are passed out. There is no doubt that at football grounds there are a number
  of people who belong to extreme political parties and they are there often in a group. Equally it is evident
  that some of them take part in the disorders which occur.

    5-81 There is also widespread evidence of the presence of small groups of National Front and similar
 supporters at football matches, of the giving of Nazi salutes, of the distribution of literature and of the
 chanting of racist slogans. They boast in their publications of these activities. Further, a number of their
 supporters have been convicted of criminal offences arising from the use of violence at football grounds.
 But that does not prove the assertion that it is they who are responsible for violence on the terraces. The
 evidence which is available to me, from football clubs generally and from the police in all parts of the
 country, is that while they constitute a presence at a number of football grounds where they recruit and
 cause trouble by racist chanting, there is little to connect them with organised violence. The considered
 view of the police w£o spoke to me seems to be that their importance at football grounds is a self importance
 and that they are not a significant factor in the problems with which I am dealing.

    5.82    That is not to say that anyone, particularly those with memories of events since 1936, should take
^■kcomplacent attitude towards their activities. Nor is it necessary to approve of the contents of their
^magazines. However in the search for answers to trouble at football grounds, it is right that too much
 importance should not be attached to their activities.                           -

    5.83    This view is confirmed by the statistics in the report to my Inquiry prepared by Professor Canter.
 He said: “Where terracing is seen as the physical basis of violence, political activities are seen as the social
 cause. As with terraces, removing political activity would not solve the problem of football hooliganism.
 However it is important to identify the extent of any conscious involvement by such groups as the National
 Front in crowd violence. We therefore asked a question carefully phrased to see if there were any direct
 evidence for the involvement of political groups as seen by our respondents arid if there was any difference
 between the clubs in this. After a general question on people’s thoughts we asked for any concrete evidence
 that they might have ‘in their own experience.' In effect we were asking almost one thousand witnesses
 throughout the country whether they could give any first hand evidence to support the view that political groups
 are involved in crowd trouble,” The question was: “ Do you think that organised political groups such as the
 National Front are involved in crowd trouble?” The answers were:
                                                          Yes         No
                         Celtic                           39          61
                         Manchester United                44          56
                         Tottenham Hotspur                43          57
                         Chelsea                          65          35
                         Sunderland                        11         89
                         Mill wall                        43          57
                         Fulham                           48'         52
                         Southampton                      55          45
                         Preston                          49          51
                         Coventry                         38          62

     5.84 Professor Canter continues: “ When it comes to actual evidence the picture becomes more hazy.
. Although 162 of our respondents said they had direct evidence of National Front involvement, closer examination
  reveals that a number of those based that on media reports. All in all, about 10% of our respondents appear
  to have first hand knowledge of National Front activities.”

    5.55 It is interesting to see what this “political” group was actually doing. Professor Canter's figures
  show that 194 respondents had witnessed involvement and that 34 incidents involved either starting a fight
  or fighting. However, Professor Canter reports that most of those who said they saw fights were in fact
  quoting media reports. The evidence o f these respondent makes it clear that the majority of those involved
  were distributing literature, chanting or making gestures or displaying or wearing signs or symbols.

    5.56 This sample accords with the other evidence which has been presented to me.

My own conclusions

to^nnw "!!!51 haI T reaf SOme thirt,y 0r f0rty reports’ studies or books, where an attempt has been made
I am^anrwiserPI°doubt m “ ** *              knowIedgeable on the          of football hooliganism. Whether

       to If^Ve had th® opportunity myself of attending a number of football matches incognito. I fc^e
talked to fans on the terraces and observed their behaviour. I have discussed the problem with Professor
and f o o t S ^ h ? Y ter’ WntK the Lei.cester sonologists, with groups of football supporters, with the police
and football authorities and many other experienced observers.                         •
  5.90 I am of the view:
           I    (a) That there has always been a group, albeit a small group who find violence attractive: who
                     currently find the football ground a convenient theatre for their violence and the football match
                     the occasion for display of their aggressive tendencies which on other days and at other times
                     they will be exhibiting in public houses, the city centre or elsewhere. Their main target at
                r            grounds is opposing fans. They choose to exercise that violence at a football match
                    for a number of simple reasons. The date and place of a match are fixed; the nature of the
                    opposition is known; its presence is certain, so is that of the police. Their own support is
                    known. Its presence too is certain. The battle lines can be drawn. Thus plans can be made well
                    m advance for the particular acts of violence that they intend to create.
               (b) And while there is a good deal of academic support for the view that violence was at one time
                    the prerogative of the so called “rough” working class that is no longer the complete picture
                    today. A majority of today’s hooligans no doubt do fit into that category, but some do not.
                    i hey come from a variety of backgrounds, many have reasonable jobs and earn a proper li^jp.
               (c) Whether they are motivated by the same reasons as their predecessors can only be a matter
                   of conjecture; there seems little reason however to believe otherwise.
      II       (a) A second group imitates the first element I have identified. Thus those not particularly given
                    to violence witness violence in others and see it being exercised, without let or hinderanee.
                   People expect the spectators on the terraces to behave in an aggressive way and to use foul *
                   language. It then becomes accepted and the norm and thus becomes a part of the pattern of
                     ife which would not be tolerated elsewhere. This knock-on effect can be seen in violence in
                   the streets of our cities, unconnected with football.
               (b) The feeling of anonymity in the crowd gives rise to a loss of inhibition and self-discipline. The
                   association with those of similar disposition, the enthusiasm and the partisan support for the
                   team, which itself causes an atmosphere, all create a situation which can readily give rise to
                   violence.
     Ill          Then there is a third group (not always separate from the other two groups) who cause violence
                  for a reason, either real or supposed. It may be an inability quickly to get into the ground; it
                  may be the presence of rival spectators in a part of the ground to which the fans think they
                  have a claim.
     IV           Finally there are those, the vast majority of spectators, who abhor violence and wish onlv for
                  an afternoon of pleasure at a football match.
   5.91 Whether it is ever possible, by altering in some way the structure of society, so that there are not
 people to whom violence is of itself attractive, has given rise to considerable debate. There are, of course,
 very many factors which cause a person to have an aggressive disposition. Heredity and environment are
 such uncertain barometers of interaction that it is too simple to say, improve the environment and violence
 will disappear. Neither of course should be ignored.

   5.92 I have therefore sadly to conclude that there has always been violence in the world and that there
 always will be violence; and that however close social scientists get to determining the true cause of violence
 on the football terraces, no complete cure can be prescribed, even for the very long term.

   5.93 It is clear however that there are a considerable number of preventive measures at sports grounds
 which can properly and reasonably be taken. These I have set out in Chapter 4 of this Report. By taking
 proper preventive measures it may be possible to stop violence inside a sports ground. So far as violence
 generally is concerned, I would like to be able to say there is a simple cure. There is not. It would be doing
 a grave disservice to suggest otherwise.

 Postscript         t
   5.94 I do not pretend that my Report can be all embracing or provide a simple solution to a complex
 problem. There is no panacea. There is no one solution to the problem of violence. More particularly it is
 to be hoped that if violence within the football ground is contained, it will not re-emerge elsewhere. I
^confess I do not feel sanguine about that.

   5.95 I trust that by publicly canvassing the problems which affect the game, -both in my Reports and
 during the course of the Inquiry and also by stimulating discussions, at all levels, both inside and outside
 the game, it may be possible for solutions to emerge so that the national game can regain some of its
 former glory. Nor should we ever forget the tragic events which gave rise to my Reports.

   5.96 Although this is my Final Report, the problems of football will continue long after I have returned
 to the more familiar and less turbulent routine of my judicial duties. I therefore leave my task adopting
 the words of Matthew Arnold:

               --    '           “Peace, Peace is what I seek and public calm;
                                    Endless extinction of unhappy hates.”                     ,

    16. Fire authorities should identify and visit all sports stadia in their areas and should prohibit or restrict
 the use of any stands which, in their view, constitute a risk to spectators because of the inadequacy of the
 fire precautions.

  grounds, whatever their size, to include indoor as well as outdoor activities. (Now amended. S ee paragrap s

  to cover all sports grounds, not merely football grounds. (Now amended. See paragraph 3.23 an ina epOrt
  Recommendation 2)
    7.    I am minded to recommend that consideration should be given to providing the policewith additional
  powers o f arrest under the Public Order Act 1936. (Now se e paragraph 4.76 and Final Report Recommendation

          The causes, circumstances and lessons to be drawn from the tragic events occurring during the

          AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE TWO FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS (UEFA-BELGIAN
          F O O f BALL UNION (RBFA))

  page 73* It should be emphasised from the outset that it was the British supporters who mounted the
           disastrous charge into Section Z. They bear the main responsibility for the terrible events that
I         followed and this must remain the case whatever blame might be attributed to others for having
I         aggravated the matter.

          There is absolutely no doubt but that the organisers, the RBFA and UEFA were familiar with
          the usual behaviour of the English supporters. This is all the more clear from the fact that people
          were sufficiently concerned for the Brussels Police to send a representative to Liverpool to assess
          the situation. The gendarmerie, who were also invited, did not consider it necessary to send a
          representative.

          The Board of Liverpool FC has made known that it took a number of precautions . . . The Club
          made reassuring statements confirming that its supporters were amongst the most placid in Great
          Britain and that, moreover, the Club could identify all the ticket holders.

          The British Transport Police representatives gave the same kind of reassurance . . . Moreover, .
          the RBFA the evening before the match made statements to the same effect and confirmed that
          the match had been perfectly well organised.

          It is nevertheless true that despite the reassuring statements made by UEFA, who should have
          been and perhaps were better informed of the realities of the matter and despite the precautions
          taken . . . some English supporters or so called supporters (a limited number, it is true) became
          a murderous rabble.


          THE ORGANISERS OF THE MATCH

          (a) Organisation of the match                                      •
          It is important to recaii that the duty placed on the RBFA and, beyond them UEFA, was to
          guarantee the safety of spectators and in this context it was their responsibility to take the
          necessary precautions and in particular apply the UEFA rules. However, both the RBFA
          and UEFA seemed more concerned with financial and commercial considerations than safety
          precautions.

page 74       The ticket sales . . . got completely out of hand. It has been established that a large number of          I^
             tickets for Section Z (a neutral zone where there should under no circumstances have been any
             Italian supporters) were sold to Italians . . . large quantities of tickets were sold to travel agents,
             football clubs and others without their having been asked to give any written guarantee whatever
             that they would not sell tickets to Italians. The sale of tickets at Heysei Stadium (theoretically
             restricted to five tickets per person) was organised in such a way that anyone, including Italians,
            could get tickets for Section Z without any problems at all. This is in contravention not only of
             UEFA directives but also contrary to the arrangements agreed before the match. Such a procedure
'R eferences to pages are to pages in the H ouse o f Representative docum ent 1232 (1984-5),'1-2



                                                        71
              was bound to create a black market.

              The next point is the requirement to separate opposing supporters within the stadium. There is
              a specific UEFA ruling on this.

              It is clear that natural animosity developed into altercations, fights and charges; the third of these
              had tragic consequences and could no doubt have been avoided had there not been so many
              Italian supporters in Section Z. It is clear that the ticket sales organised by the RBFA were a
              decisive element in this and they are to blame in that respect.

              This, together with the absence of an adequate buffer zone . . . as well as the weakness of the
              fencing separating Sections Z and X-Y, meant that the safety precautions were even less effective.

              It is amazing that knowing about the significance of the black market, the organisers did not
              warn the forces of law and order of the potential danger.

              . . *It was decided to create an enclosed area around the outside of the stadium using Heras
              fencing. The idea was in fact to operate a kind of filtering procedure which would allow spectators
              to be searched as soon as they went through into the enclosures. In fact the fencing proved totally
              inadequate and in so far as it could be considered as much a psychological as a physical barrier,
              the fact was that it could not fulfill this function. It would have been more helpful to have
              passageways or gangways which could have allowed spectators to be shepherded.

              The way in which the match was organised testifies to routine and a lack of seriousness. A number
              of ambiguous decisions were taken . . . the RFBA preparations for the match were too informal,
              no prior agenda for meetings; no regular membership; no minutes. Even if it was only some of
              the decisions which were ambiguous, it remains the case that, for example, failure to decide clearly
              how the gangways between the sections should have been set up and manned was one of the
              causes of the tragedy.

             (b) Lessors and owners o f the stadium
     page 75 . . . The condition of the stadium appeared dilapidated on the occasion of our visit. . . structures
             were deteriorating, columns, crash-barriers and steps. It is also clear that the terracing itself had
             been neglected and had not been the subject of the kind of normal maintenance work which is
             required in a stadium of this size. This made it easy for the supporters to obtain missiles.
             Moreover, the narrowness of the gangways and of the few entrances at the top of the stadium,
             as well as the fact that there were only three exits at the bottom, caused problems when it came
             to evacuation.

               These problems were exacerbated by the fact that the lower gates could only be opened from the
               pitch side. According to the organisers and the forces of law and order, the intention was to
               make it possible for evacuation to take place in the event of trouble while allowing the forces of
               law and order to intervene as necessary. . . .

               It seems surprising that the general regulations relating to safety at work should not be applicable
               in this instance. If this is the case, then they should be applied . . . certain basic facilities were
               lacking. There were only a few fixed telephones, which is inexcusable. It is essential that if
               gatherings on this scale are to be organised there should be an on-the-spot command post where
               the organisers and forces of law and order can meet. . . .

.I             It is reasonable to emphasise the responsibilities of UEFA in this respect. In February 1985, the
               organisation was content to devote less than an hour to the inspection of the stadium and did
               not comment on its condition.

               The Authorities
               A. The local police
               Precautions made
               It is part of the duty of the police to implement the provisions of the document Crowd Violence

                                                            72
                at Sports Grounds”. . . . This document, drawn up at the suggestion of the RBFA, in consultation
                with the police was issued by the Ministry of the Interior in the form of guidance on the 17th
                February 1974. It would not appear that the police took any measures to implement the provisions
                of this document.. . .

page 77 Specific preparations
                The police took part in preparatory meetings. . . . On the occasion of these meetings, those
                involved apparently discussed all the measures to be taken at the ground as well as transport,
                the arrival of the supporters, the sale of tickets, liaison and co-ordination of the activities of the
                police and the gendarmerie, all organisation of parking facilities, organisation of emergency
                services and sale of alcoholic drinks.
                . . . the emergency services were not specifically invited to these meetings, nothing was said about
                the condition of the stadium and again no minutes were taken setting out the decisions which
                had been reached during the meetings.
                .... . the reports on these meetings were drawn up in retrospect: there is no way to be sure of the
                number of participants, their rank, their precise identity or what they said . . .
                The day of the 29th Ma y 1985
page 78 ..". There was fighting in the streets from the morning onwards. This fighting was caused by
        persons under the influence of alcohol. The police decided to limit their interventions in order to
        avoid more serious trouble. . . . Nothing was done to curb the consumption of alcoholic drinks
        on the public highway or the sale of the same.

                One is entitled to question whether everything necessary was done to prevent the troubles which
                occurred later.

                Heras fencing had been erected around the stadium but this perimeter fence was not sufficiently
                well supervised . . .

                The police arrived at the stadium in good time, they were nonetheless unable to carry out a
                complete search of the spectators because of a shortage of men (only forty available). Confiscated
                items could not be kept away from the supporters because of a lack of containers. Efforts were
                made to compensate for this by collecting confiscated items by van.

                Fifty men were placed between Sections M, N -0 but they were forced to retreat at about 6.30
                pm because of the agression of the Italian supporters. The gangways were so structured that it
                was not possible to keep officers on the steps.
                The police could not prevent supporters from invading the pitch. Lumps of concrete torn from
                the structure of the stadium and missiles caused enormous problems. (27 police were injured).
    _   -   .    .   .   .                                                                                               i
                The police communications system worked well. The police did what was necessary to maintain              i.
                adequate liaison with the gendarmerie.

                B. The Burghermaster

                also chief of the local police . . . This applied as much in the city on the 28 and 29 May as in the
                stadium when the events took’place.'
                                                                                               .        . .              ‘
                As to the condition of the stadium, this being the property of Brussels City Council, it was for         !
                the City Council to deal with its maintenance and also to ensure that all the fencing provided
                was strong enough to serve the required purpose.

                C. The Gendarmerie
        ' \. The so-called advance measures
page 79 . . .So far as the document entitled “Crowd Violence at Sports Grounds' which the gendarmerie
        adapted as a General Order, it appears that three points were not dealt with:
        Examination of the ground,

                                                            73
         It should be pointed out that Captain Mahieu had not been invited to any of the meetings in
         question.

        4. Action within the stadium
page 81 . . . no member of the gendarmerie v/ho participated in the preparatory meeting was present at
        the Heysel Stadium on the day of the match . . . the Commission considered whether it would
        be appropriate to establish a command post at the stadium or even two, one inside one outside.
        Although the Commission did not feel qualified to form a judgment on this, it considers that the
        point should be made.

         5. Divisions o f tasks within the squadron
         The Commission regrets that within Alpha Squadron there was no precise division of tasks
         between the Commander and his deputy. It was obvious that at certain times both officers were
         together inside the stadium and at other times they were together outside the stadium.

         This was all the more unacceptable because of the inadequacy of the radio communications.

         The provisions of messengers seems to have made up in some degree for the radio communication
         problems referred to below but according to the witness, these messengers could not in any event
         fulfill their purpose because of the density of the crowd.



page 82 6. Communications arrangements and equipment
         . . . numerous means of communicating information were provided.

         There were communication links between the Special Branch and the command post, and between
         the police and the gendarmerie both inside and outside the stadium. In addition to these, radio
         contact between police and gendarmerie was assured by liaison officers at HQ, the command post
         and at the ground. In the end, this adds up to an unwieldy system. Perhaps this is the price to
         be paid for trying to ensure that two separate forces, the police and the gendarmerie, worked
         together without losing their separate identities.

         Communications between the Special Branch and the command post did not operate well , . .
         the poor condition of the equipment was mainly to blame. But it is also probable that the Special
         Branch was not properly briefed.

         At the gendarmerie headquarters, messages are recorded by a shorthand writer, who typed the
         messages as they were received. It would appear that the messages were recorded only selectively.

         Communications between the platoons and-their commanding officer did not take place under
         ideal conditions; the Captain commanding in the stadium went outside. No communication was
         possible with him thereafter and this at the very time when the tragedy occurred.

         Even when the radios were working, their effectiveness was reduced by the ambient noise level.
         The gendarmerie must have known this would happen. One must ask why messengers were not
         used for these communications.

         It is clear from witness statements that communications between the command post and the
         stadium ware not operating properly . . . this means that at a time when it would have been
         useful to call in reserves, the command post was not receiving sufficiently precise information
         from the stadium.
         There are several statements about the state of the equipment. General Bernaert said that the
         sets were good quality ones but that there was trouble with the cadmium nickel batteries. The
         batteries were old and, moreover, were not properly used.

         . . . insufficient attention was paid to checking whether those using the equipment were doing so
         in the correct manner.

Chairman

WORKING GROUP ON THE GREEN GUIDE
   E i. Shortly after publication of your Interim Report you asked me to establish a Working Group of
appropriately qualified scientifical and technical persons who had practical experience of safety at sports
grounds to assist the Inquiry in its task of reviewing the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(the “ Green Guide”). As you know, and with the kind cooperation of the Home Office, Scottish Office,
Department of Environment, local authority associations and technical consultants to the Inquiry, I was
able to form such a group and this met for a full week (23-28 September) under my Chairmanship.

  E2. Our terms of reference were: “To review the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
(Football) - “the Green Guide” - and to make recommendations to the Committee of Inquiry on Crowd
Safety and Control at Sports Grounds as to amendments or additions considered necessary to the Green
Guide published in 1976.” A record of the membership of the Group appears later in this appendix.

   E3.1 am pleased to be able to report that the Working Group completed its work satisfactorily and that
it was found possible on the final day of the Group’s week to reach general agreement on the various
recommendations for changes which we wished to see made to the Guide. I have since prepared a self-
contained note of these points and have put the Group’s deliberations into ihe form of recommendations
for you. This note is set out below for your consideration. I support these recommendations.

   E4. As you will see there are, in total, some 63 recommendations. This should not be taken in any way,
however, as an adverse judgment upon the current Guide. The substantive advice in the Guide stood up
remarkably well to a week of detailed scrutiny by experts and fully justifies the high esteem and confidence
in which it is generally - and internationally - held.

   E5. It remains only for me to record my gratitude to the members of the Group who gave up so much
of their valuable time to assist the Committee in its task; to my fellow Assessor, Mr Alan Goodson, for
his encouragement, support and practical advice throughout the week; and to Mr Mark de Pulford for his
excellent work as Secretary.

                                                                                   MARTIN KILLORAN
                                                                               Fire Assessor to the Inquiry


                                     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

         STRUCTURE OF THE GREEN GUIDE
                                                                            %
            E6. The Working Group was dissatisfied with the structure of the current Guide and recom­
Rec i-   mends that the Green Guide should be reorganised so as to reflect more closely the needs o f its
         target audience. (The Group agreed that the target audience of the Guide comprises: (a) sports
         ground management in designated and undesignated grounds; (b) engineers, designers and others
         engaged in the improvement, design appraisal or refurbishment of sports stadia to certificable
         standards; and (c) local authorities responsible for enforcing the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
          1975.) The Group considered that, following a general introduction which describes the scope of
         the Guide, sets the scene and briefly discusses the nature and extent of risks to the public at
         sports grounds, the guidance should be re-arranged so as to deal first with general management
         responsibilities and major planning and design matters. (Guidance on these matters should, where
         practicable, include methods for assessing the general safety condition of a ground and the need
         for detailed drawings and plans.) The succeeding categories of detailed guidance should each be
         preceded by a statement of the general functional requirement or aim and should include as much
         appraisal, flow and other diagrams as may conveniently be arranged. The Group considered that
         a possible scheme for the categories of advice in the Green Guide was: Fire (to include a checklist
         and appraisal flow diagram and reference to the need for professional advice). Structural Appraisal
         (to include a method for appraising existing structures and reference to the need for professional
         advice). Ground Control and Ground Management (to identify responsibilities and duties), and
         Inspections, Tests and Maintenance.

                                                    77
          INSPECTIONS AND TESTS
            E l4. The current Guide recommends:
           (i) A detailed annual inspection to ensure compliance with the Green Guide (GG: 4.1);
           (ii) A general visual inspection following each event for damage which might create a potential
                hazard (GG: 4.2); and,
          (iii) Testing of crush barriers in accordance with the Guide on installation and subsequently,
                normally, at intervals of several years (GG: 4.3).
Rec 10     The Group recommends that the routine general visual inspection by management advised in the
         Guide should also cover features which might reduce the degree o f fire protection offered and that
Rec 11   there should also be a warning in the Guide against storing hazardous materials under or near stands.
Rec 12   The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to the inclusion o f additional
         guidance to certifying authorities as to the frequency and content o f inspections.

Rec 13      El 5. The Group recommends that regular emergency evacuation drills for members o f staff
         should be recommended in the Guide.

            E16. On the testing of crush barriers (GG: 4.3 and Appendix C of the Guide) the Group had
         before it no evidence that the current guidance had permitted dangerous or defective crush
         barriers. However, it seemed to a minority of the Group that certain anomalies exist in the current
         recommendations in the Green Guide as to load factors and testing (for example the table of
         strengths for new crush barriers permitted a different design strength for the bars and posts than
         for the foundations); and there was some evidence that enforcing authorities were unclear as to
Rec 14   the correct procedures. The Group recommends that representatives o f the local authorities, the
         Home Office and appropriately qualified advisers should, together, review the Guide’s recommenda­
         tions on the design and testing o f crush barriers in more detail with a view to clarifying the guidance
         in future editions of the Guide (see also paragraph 28 below).

Rec 15      E l7. The Group further recommends that the Guide should advise that any automatic fire
         protection equipment or emergency lighting system shoidd be tested regularly in accordance with
         relevant British Standard codes o f practice.-

         INGRESS TO THE GROUND
           E18. The Guide currently recommends that the number and location of turnstiles should be
         planned to achieve the smallest crowd waiting for admission that is consistent with the rate at
         which spectators can be distributed inside the ground (GG: 5.1). The Group recommends that
Rec 16   more detailed guidance to management as to contingency planning in the event o f unusual pressures
         and frustrations (including a reference to the value o f centralised computer-based monitoring)
         should be given. The Group further recommends that the Guide emphasise that turnstiles are not
         acceptable as a means o f escape from a ground.
                                                                                                         9

            E19. The Group considered it desirable that the Guide should specify a notional maximum
Rec 18   free flow rate past a turnstile. The Group recommends that further consideration be given to
         defining a maximum notional flow rate past turnstiles for incorporation in a future edition o f the
         Green Guide.

           E20. The Guide currently recommends that fences forming the boundary to a ground should
         be of “appropriate height and strength” to avoid spectators gatecrashing (GG; 5.2). The Group
Rec 19   recommends that boundary walls and gates and any other structure forming part o f the boundary
         should also be o f appropriate height and strength to avoid gatecrashing.

         EGRESS FROM THE GROUND
          E21. Currently, Section 6 of the Guide makes a number of general recommendations as to
        egress from a sports grounds (GG: 6.1 to 6.13). The Group was generally content with these but
        recommends that the wording in paragraph 6.13 of the Guide should be revised to make it clear
Rec 20, that escape routes are not to be regarded as an alternative provision only for use in emergency. The
Rec 21 Group further recommends that guidance should be included to the effect that doors on exit


                                                       79
Rec 22    routes should always open outwards; and that, where practicable, exit gates should be sited adjacent
          to entrances.

Rec 23      E22. The Group recommends that a study should be undertaken of the current use and effectiveness
          of the exit route signposting and exit marking systems recommended in the Green Guide (GG: 6.6),
          and that consideration should be given to commissioning further research in this area.

          TERRACES AND STANDS

          Safe capacity of terraces
              E23. The Guide currently suggests that the exits from each areas of spectator accommodation
          should be so designed that the spectator can leave that area in eight minutes or less (GG: 6.5).
Rec 24    The Group concluded that this so-called "eight minute rule” was concerned solely with the effect
           o f crowd turbulence (arising from delays in evacuating specator accommodation) on the rate o f
          flow. It was not related to emergency evacuation time criteria (see paragraph 32 below) and the         |
           Group recommends that the Guide should make this clear.
                s

          Terrace packing densities
           - E24. The Guide recommends packing densities between the limits of 27 and 54 persons per
          10m2 depending on the condition of the terrace or slope and on the extent to which crush barriers
          conform to the Green Guide guidelines on spacing (GG: 15.4). Recommended flow rates from
          the terraces are given at paragraph 16 of the Guide.

            The Group concluded that the flow rates and permissible spectator densities in the Guide were
          satisfactory and reasonable when taken as a whole and that they accorded with experience.
Rec 25    However, the Group recommends that flow rate and packing criteria and their relationship (if            |
          any) with those criteria given in respect o f emergency evacuation and crowd turbulences should be      |
          set out and explained more clearly in the Guide and that further advice should be given as to how       1
          interpolation between the wide limits suggested in respect o f terrace packing densities may properly   §
Rec 26    be carried out. The Group further recommends that consideration be given to the possibility o f a       §
          separate detailed study o f the possible casualties which might be attributable to high packing
          densities.

          Terrace steps and viewing slopes
             £25. The Group was content with the Guide’s recommendations in respect of terrace steps and
Rec 27    viewing slopes (GG: 7.4). The Group recommends, however, that the surfaces o f terrace steps and
Rec 28    viewing slopes should be even as well as non-slip and that the way in which the maximum desirable
          gradient is specified in the Guide should be improved.

          Terrace gangways
            E26. The Guide states that the aim in respect of terrace gangways should be to ensure that
          every spectator on a terrace is within 12 metres of a gangway or of an exit. (GG: 7.5). The Guide
          further indicates that gangways should be sunk.
            The Group felt that although these recommendations were generally satisfactory’, reasons
          should be given for the basic aim stated in paragraph 7.5 of the Guide. Furthermore, it would
Rec 29    be preferable to state the safety objective behind the current recommendation to sink gangways so
          that it could be met in other ways. The Group recommends accordingly.

          Division of spectator accommodation
            E27. The Guide currently recommends the division of a ground into sections to prevent major
          migrations by spectators, and into sub-sections to minimise the sway and surge of spectators
          (GG: 7.6). The Group recommends that the Guide should limit the application o f its guidance on
          segregation to terraces at football grounds (See recommendation 57 below).

          Crush barriers and other physical restraints on movements
Rec 30,      E28. The Group recommends that the Guide should should explain that brick walls and similar

                                                      80
        structures lacking mass or tensile strength are poorly suited to withstand horizontal pressures and
Rec 31 that the Guide should strongly recommend regular structural appraisal by appropriately qualified
Rec 32 personnel. The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to mounting a more
        detailed review o f current literature on the strength o f crush barriers and the effects o f the various
        types o f loading that might be applied to them (see also paragraph 16 above).

Rec 33        The Group further recommends that the aim o f the guidance on migrations be restated as "to
            prevent potentially hazardous migrations” rather than mass migrations as currently indicated in
            the Guide. (See also paragraph 43 below).

            PITCH PERIMETER FENCES
              E29. The advice on pitch perimeter fences in the current Guide deals mainly with the crush
            barrier aspects (GG: 7.9). Access to playing pitches and the need for “anti-hooligan” or other
            protective devices is however, referred to in the section on crowd behaviour (GG: 18).

Rec 34        Th% Group recommends that the Guide should explain more clearly, preferably by reference to
            standardised specifications, the different functions perimeter fencing may serve and that appropriate
            cross referencing is incorporated in any future edition of the Guide. Th? Group further recom-
Rec 35      mends that the importance o f allowing full access to the pitch where this is likely to be used as a
            place o f safety in emergency should be made plain. (It was noted that Scottish Building Regulations
            required that protected zones such as stairways led to a place of safety, ie a unenclosed space in
            the open air at ground level or an enclosed space in the open air at ground level with access (of
            defined widths) to an unenclosed space. A pitch could be accepted as a place of safety only if it
            met that requirement. If, however, it was subsequently fenced off, circumstances could arise,
            under Scottish Building Regulations, where a change of use would be deemed to have taken
            place.)

            STAIRWAYS AND RAMPS
Rec 36        E30. The Group recommends that the current guidance on stairways and ramps (GG: 9) should
            contain appropriate cross references to advice on egress from the ground (GG: 6). The Group
R'ec 37     further recommends that the Guide should advise that, ideally, the rising and going o f steps should
            be uniform throughout an entire escape system. A minority of the Group felt that the method of
            calculation for access to stairways (GG: 9.4.5) of the Guide was anomalous and should be
            reviewed.

            FIRE PRECAUTIONS
              E31. Guidance on fire precautions is currently contained in section 10 of the Green Guide. It
            covers a variety of important matters including fire resistance, emergency lighting and fire-fighting
            equipment.

           The Group was not wholly satisfied with the general advice on fire precautions offered by the
Rec 38, Guide. So far as existing structures were concerned, the Group recommends that detailed advice
        should be given on means o f reducing the rate offire growth in existing stands. The Group believes
        that consideration should be given to incorporating appropriate references to recent work in this
        area commissioned by the-Inquiry from the Fire Research Station. In particular, the Group
Rec 39 recommends ;hat the Guide should emphasise the hazards o f developed fires breaking into spectator
        accommodation and the consequent need for fire separation under stands to be imperforate. In
Rec 40 addition, the dangers o f fire spread across adjoining stands should be emphasised and half-hour fire
        resistance might need to apply to vertical sections dividing spectator accommodation from other
        areas.

            Evacuation times
               E32. On notional emergency evacuation times, the Guide currently recommends interpolation
            between 2} and 8 minutes, with the higher figure applying where a stand is of non-combustible
          - fire resisting structure and presents generally a low fire risk (GG: 8.3).

             The Group was satisfied that there was no case for reducing the 2 \ minutes lower evacuation
           time as recommended in the Guide. The lesson of Bradford was the need for adequate measures
           to inhibit the rate of fire development and spread and to improve the efficiency of fire procedures

                                                       81
         rather than to stipulate more stringent criteria in respect of notional values. However, represen­
         tatives of the Fire Research Station felt that the 24 minutes should be regarded as a maximum;
         they believed that although individual circumstances might conceivably justify increasing the
         figure, it was not currently possible to assign quantitative values to active or passive fire protection
         measures with sufficient precision to enable specific relaxations to be advocated in the Guide with
         any degree of confidence. A majority of the Group believed that the notional 8 minutes upper
         limit indicated in the Guide, although lacking any very clear or relevant technical rationale, was
         reasonable and should be retained. Nevertheless, it was the firm view of a minority including Mr
         Platt that 8 minutes is too long a period to allow for the evacuation of any stand under emergency
         conditions and that, although relaxation of the 2 \ minutes figure might be reasonable in individual
         circumstances, it would be misleading to specify an upper limit in the Green Guide.

           The consensus was that the enforcing authority should decide on relaxations in the light of
         professional experience and individual safety circumstances of a particular ground, but that the
Rec 4f   Green Guide should offer more guidance as to what latitude was permissible on evacuation times
         and the circumstances to take into account. In particular, the Green Guide should emphasise that
         escape routes should be designed or chosen so that they provide progressive reduction in difficulty
         or danger to people using them and regard should be had to the likely accumulation o f smoke and
Rec 42   combustion products in those routes. The Group recommends that consideration should be given
         to devising a more scientific method for assessing the evacuation o f a stand under emergency
         conditions.                                                -

         Fire protection and fire-fighting equipment
Rec 43     E33. The Group considered that there was currently insufficient evidence as to the value fo r life
         safety o f automatic fire protection equipment fo r the Green Guide to encourage trade-offs between
         such equipment and structural fire protection measures. Any implications that such trade-offs
         were permissible should be removed from the current Guide (eg GG: 10.2). A majority of the
         Group rejected also the idea that the Green Guide should suggest similar relaxations where
         management expertise and vigilance were at a high level.

Rec 44    On fire detection and fire-fighting equipment, the Group recommends that reference should be
         made to relevant British Standards such as BS 5839: Part 1, BS 5306: Parts 1 and 3 and BS 5423.
         The Group considered that it was an inefficient and undesirable use of resources for manned fire
         appliances to attend all matches.

           E34. On roof venting, the Group felt that with some stand roof configurations, appropriate
         venting and curtaining arrangements might offer a means of reducing the spread of fire. It was
         agreed however that the science of fire and smoke venting was highly complex and that it im s
         not appropriate for the Guide.to offer more than a general reference to the issue. However,^R
Rec 45   Group felt that some advice on roof venting should be offered in the Green Guide along the lines
         of that proposed by the Fire Research Station in work commissioned by the Inquiry, It was
         agreed that the priority in the Guide was to recommend effective fire precautions relating to the
         early stages of a fire.

         Access for emergency vehicles
           E35. The Group agreed that the Guide’s recommendations as to access for emergency vehicles
         (GG: 11.30) Were soundly based. It was noted that the Interim Report recommendation that
         vehicular parking be banned within quarter of a mile of a sports ground (when it was in use) had
Rec 46   been made on a “where practicable” basis. The Group recommends that the qualification “where
         necessary" should be added to the current Guide s recommendations on access for emegency vehicles.

         Hazardous materials
            E36. The consensus was that it was not practicable for the Guide* to offer detailed a.dvice on
         fire spread hazards associated with particular materials. Nevertheless, the Group recommends
Rec 47   that consultation with expert fire advisers should be indicated in the Guide where substantial use
         of. for example, polymer seating is contemplated or o f artificial pitches where forward escape onto
         the pitch might be necessary. (See also recommendation 35 above).

                                                       82
         COMMUNICATIONS
            E37. The Green Guide currently recommends that precise requirements for communications
        within a particular ground be determined after consultation with the police (GG: 17). The Guide
        goes on to give examples of the arrangements likely to be needed at larger grounds. The Group
        considered that this advice and the way in which it was expressed was generally satisfactory.
Rec 48, However, the Group recommends that the advice as to central control points should not be confined
Rec 49 to the largest grounds and that the Guide should emphasise the need for ground management and
Rec 50 responsibility to be centralised accordingly. The Group also believed that it would be desirable in
        larger grounds if public address systems permitted messages to be directed towards specific zones
        o f the ground. The Group recommends accordingly.

            E38. On emergency audible alarms, the use of coded messages found little support in the
         Group. The need was rather to communicate essential information effectively to the crowd. For
Rec 51   that purpose, a clear system of communications covering all the various conceivable crises, including
         the facility to stop the event, should be devised in consultation with the emergency services. The
         Group recommends that guidance to this effect should be incorporated in the Green Guide.
         Further study was required before pre-set formulae messages could be recommended in the Guide.
         However, it was clear that such messages should be in the active mode, that they should be
         directed towards persons from whom a response is required, and that they should be delivered
Rec 52   authoritatively by trained controllers. The Group considered that there was a need for standard
         guidance covering the use o f public address systems for emergency purposes. The Group recommends
         that consideration be given to this.                                  .

            E39. The Group considered that the development and operational experience of closed circuit
         television (CCTV) facilities was too little advanced to enable the Guide to be prescriptive as to
         particular systems. However, it was noted that CCTV appeared to have significant value in crime
         prevention and detection and that it had a considerable role to play in aiding emergency
         evacuations, police management information and crowd control. The Group therefore recom-
Rec 53   mends that the provision o f CCTV systems should be encouraged in the Guide.

         CROWD BEHAVIOUR
            E40. Advice on crowd behaviour is currently set out in the Green Guide in the form of
       . recommendations of an earlier working party on crowd behaviour (GG: 18). The Group recom-
Rec 54 mends that the advice for management currently presented at paragraph 18 of the Guide should
         be re-organised and expanded so as to explain more fully the major problems and principles of
         crowd control and then go on to elaborate the various methods available which may be relevant
         in certain situations at sports grounds and of the circumstances under which these might be
         appropriate (see also recommendation (1) above).

Rec 55    E41. The Group also recommends that the Guide should emphasise the value o f effective planning
         before events, debriefing exercises and full liaison with the police, in order to predict and prevent
         trouble. In particular, the Guide should stress the desirability of identifying in advance, against
         the local historical background and known travel arrangements, the likely size and nature of the
         crowd.

Rec 56     E42. The Group further recommends that the Guide makes it clear that the responsibility for
         pre-planning and liaison lies with club management subject only to the point that the disposition
         of operational police resources is the sole responsibility of individual chief constables.

           . E43. There was considerable discussion in the Group of the segregation issue which, it was
         agreed, had major implications for planning. The consensus was that clear differentiation of
         opposing fans (with ancillary facilities) remained the only viable and prudent course so long as
         crowd violence remained at current levels; and that the best way to achieve such differentiation
         was by spatial separation and physical containment of opposing groups. The Group was anxious,
         however, that segregation should not be encouraged other than where local circumstances made
Rec 57 - it absolutely necessary. In particular, at the present time segregation should not be advocated for
         sports other than soccer. The Group recommends accordingly. (See also paragraph 27 above).

Rec 58     E44. The Group agreed that certain fire precautions measures, for example plasterboard fire
         separation and fire protection equipment, might be vulnerable to vandalism and that certificating
         authorities should be-advised to take this into account where appropriate. The Group recommends
         accordingly.

           E45. On ticketing, the Group agreed that this was not an effective means of crowd control
Rec 59   unless clubs ensured that their arrangements for the issue and allocation o f tickets were as efficient
         and effective as possible. The Group recommends that this latter point be strongly emphasised in
         the Green Guide.

Rec 60     E46. On alcohol, the Group recommends that the guidance on alcohol (GG: 18.4) should be
         reworded to make clear that an important objective was to reduce potential missiles and also that
         the police should be consulted over arrangements for the sale of alcohol at grounds. A reference
         to the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 was also needed.

          E47. The Group were content with the material on police facilities given in the Green Guide
Rec 61 s(GG: 17.8) but considered that the Guide should advise adequate vehicular accessfor the imobrusive
        removal o f detainees an d secure detention rooms at appropriate grounds. The Group recommends
        accordingly.

     '   OTHER MANAGEiMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Rec 62    E48. The Group was strongly in favour of the creation of a new section in the Green Guide on
         management responsibilities and recommends that consideration should be given to this. The
         Group considered that it would be helpful if such a section could incorporate a form of
         checklist of necessary tasks organised under broad headings such as: Pre-planning for Emergency
         Procedures, Training of Stewards and First-aid Facilities/Other Medical Provisions. A reference
         to the need for management structure to reflect such responsibilities, preferably including the
         designation of a named individual to take responsibility for the proper execution of such duties,
         was also highly desirable.

           E49. On the question of the relative responsibilities of the police and stewards, the Group felt
Rec 63   that the Guide ought to make it plain that it was the club's responsibility to control and manage
         spectators in normal circumstances and that the police presence (if there was one) was to deal with
         the law and order problems and provide support and leadership in emergencies. The Group
         recommends accordingly. It was noted that there now existed considerable material on the training
         and deployment of stewards and staff likely to be involved in emergency situations.

                      FINAL REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD
                             SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS

                                                       Introduction
     Sirs,

       1. Oil 13 May 1985 I was appointed to undertake an Inquiry with the following terms of reference:
             “To inquire, with particular reference to the events at Bradford City and Birmingham football grounds
             on 11 May, into the operation of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975; and to recommend what if
             any further steps should be taken, including any that may be necessary under additional powers, to
             improve both crowd safety and crowd control at sports grounds.”

£   .■ 2. The Assessors appointed to assist me were Mr Alan Goodson OBE, QPM, Chief Constable of
       eicestershtre and Mr Martin Killoran QFSM, formerly Chief Fire Officer of Greater Manchester. They
      have been of the greatest assistance. Their professional expertise and advice has been invaluable to my
      Inquiry. Without their help my task could scarcely have been completed with such expedition.

             Morgan was Secretary to the Committee. He has contributed enormously t° the smooth running
    of the Inquiry by his constant good humour and efficiency. Mark de Pulford and Jill Hales have both
    shown the twin virtues Of the Civil Service, intelligence and hard work, and they have been ably assisted
    by Jane Osborn. Nathalie Austrie has been our efficient personal secretary.

       4.    At an early stage of my Inquiry I decided to prepare an interim report giving the results of my
    investigations into the events at Bradford and Birmingham, together with some preliminary recommenda­
    tions on safety matters and crowd control. This was done so that safety levels could be improved quickly,
    before the start of the new football season in the middle o f August 1985. In a list of provisional
    recommendations I also gave a tentative view on a number of longer-term issues which I proposed to
    follow up in this my Final Report. My Interim Report was submitted to the two Secretaries of State and
    subsequently presented to Parliament on 24 July 1985 (Cmnd 9585). I am grateful for the Government’s
    quick and positive response to my Recommendations and to local authorities and sports management for
    their subsequent action to improve safety.

      5. Since my Interim Report was published I have considered the written evidence submitted by a wide

•   range of organisations and individuals on the remaining aspects of my Inquiry. I have also heard oral
    evidence from many of them. A full list of those who submitted evidence to the Inquiry is given in Appendix
    A to this Report. I am grateful to all of them.

      6. During the course of the Inquiry the two Assessors and I have, between us, visited 31 soccer grounds
    in England, Wales and Scotland. They are listed in Appendix B. We have also visited sports grounds
    devoted to Rugby Union, Rugby League, cricket, horse racing, greyhound racing, athletics, tennis, motor
    racing, stock car racing and speedway. In addition, we have visited indoor stadia.

       7. In this, my final report, I deal with five main subjects. The first, in Chapter 1, is the disaster at the
    Heysel Stadium in Brussels on 29 May 1985. It was agreed that I should take account of any lessons arising
    from this tragic event, although the official investigation was, of course, a matter for the Belgian authorities.
    I visited Brussels, together with my Assessors, and met the chairman of the Belgian Parliamentary
    Commission which investigated the disaster and Madame Coppieters’t Wallant, the investigating judge,
    together with representatives of the police, gendarmerie and fire service. All were extremely helpful, and I
    am grateful to them, and also to the British Ambassador and his staff in Brussels for their assistance and
    advice.

         8.      In Chapter 2 I review previous inquiries over the last sixty years into crowd safety and hooliganism
    at sports grounds and conclude that there is still need for action:

                                                           1
   9. Chapter 3 deals with the working of the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975, and the need for further
regulation to protect the public who attend sporting events, from fire and the hazards of faulty construction.
Unfortunately, these are not the only hazards to spectators at sporting events nowadays, and in Chapter 4
I turn to the serious problem of violence.

   10.' In my Interim Report I said that your Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (the “Green Guide”)
contained so much good advice that it should be compulsory reading for all sports ground management.
That opinion holds good, but as the last edition of the Guide was published in 1976, and as it is so
important a source of advice, I decided to follow your suggestion and look afresh at the whole document
to see if it should be revised, or if it could be improved. The Inquiry commissioned research from three
consultants—Professor Canter, Professor of Applied Psychology at the University of Surrey (on human
behaviour in emergency situtations and its implications for the design and dissemination of information);
Professor Happold, Professor of Civil Engineering at the University of Bath (on technical building aspects);
and Dr Woolley of the Fire Research Station, Borehamwood (on fire precautions matters). The material
they produced was extremely useful and practical, and I am indebted to them. This information greatly
assisted a special working group which I set up under Mr Killoran’s chairmanship to consider the Green
Guide. A record of the Group’s deliberations and membership is given elsewhere in this Report (Appendix
E).     ,
   11. Chapter 4 deals with crowd control. In this chapter I look at the problem as it exists now, and make
a number of recommendations for new offences and for some increased powers for the police in relation
to sports grounds and hooliganism. In the light of my many visits to football grounds, and evidence from
a variety of football authorities and other bodies, I give my further thoughts on control of alcohol and on
membership cards. I also deal with the role which football clubs themselves should play in improving crowd
behaviour.

  12. In Chapter 5 I look at the extent of football hooliganism and several theories about its causes. I have
been much assisted in this task not only by academic research and evidence, but also by observing for
myself the behaviour of fans on the terraces and by listening to them when they came to give evidence
before me. But I have to confess to a certain lack of succcss in this part of my Inquiry.

  13. Finally, I believe that the paramount need is to protect the public by improving safety standards,
and thereby restoring confidence among those who attend sporting events. This means that effective steps
should be taken quickly. In this belief I commend my findings and Recommendations for your consideration.

                                               CHAPTER 1

                                             Tragedy at Brussels

   1.1 At about 7.30 pm on 29 May 1985, English fans charged into Block Z of the terrace at the Heysel
Stadium, Brussels, shortly before the European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus was due to
take place. There was a panic among the spectators in Block Z; as a result 38 people died and some 400
people were injured.

  1.2 It was agreed that I should take into account any lessons arising from the events at Brussels. In
doing this I do not intend to apportion blame. Neither do I propose to make any comments which might
prejudice any possible criminal proceedings.

   1.3 The official investigation into these events has already been carried out by a Commission of Enquiry
set up by the Belgian Parliament, which reported on 9 July 1985. At the present time Madame Coppieters’t
Wallant is carrying out an inquiry into the circumstances. She will be producing a confidential report,
which will be used purely to consider the prosecution of those alleged to have committed criminal offences.

   1.4 The death and injury of so many people must be the main subject of my investigation. However, it
is clear from all the evidence available to me that the behaviour of the crowds, both inside and outside the
ground, and before the match, as well as during it, needs also to be considered. So do the precautions
which the various authorities sought to take to prevent outbreaks of violence.

   1.5 I have had the opportunity, together with my Assessors, of visiting the Heysel Stadium and discussing
the matter with the Belgian and British authorities and with Liverpool Football Club. I have been provided
with a very large number of statements by those who were present, together with reports from Belgium
and a variety of official documents. I have also talked to Madame Coppieters’t Wallant. It will be obvious
that in the absence of a thorough and prolonged public enquiry the evidence available to me is somewhat
limited. It is bound to be fragmentary, and while it gives generally the broad picture it will not necessarily
coincide with the individual observations of everyone who was present. Indeed there are acutely differing
views about some matters. The lessons to be drawn are, however, reasonably clear.

The Heysel Stadium
  1.6 It was opened in 1930. It has been regularly used for football matches, including an international
football match a few weeks before the 29 May, between Belgium and France, at which the attendance was
about the same as at the Liverpool/Juventus game.

  1.7 The Stadium is owned by the City of Brussels and leased to the Belgian Football Association. There
had been no criticism by the Belgian Football Association nor by UEFA, who are the body controlling
European football, of the facilities at the ground or of the structure.

   1.8 A plan of the Stadium is at Appendix C. There are two open terraces at each end of the ground
marked “X”, “Y” and “Z” and “O”, “N” and “M” respectively. Between the two sets of terraces are two
stands. The stand marked Tribune 2 was built in about 1980. Apart from that, the Stadium is as it was
constructed in 1930. It is the largest of its kind in Belgium and provides facilities not only for football
matches but for athletics. -

  1.9 The terraces at “X”, “Y” and “Z” were formed of a slope of approximately 1 in 10 at the shallowest
and about 1 in 6 at the steepest. The surface of the terraces was earth with only the nosing of the steps
being formed in concrete. Over the years the concrete nosing has deteriorated, and rusted re-inforcing bars
have been exposed. The edges were uneven and jagged where pieces of concrete had broken off. The general
condition of the terracing may be described as poor. The crush barriers showed signs of deterioration to
both the concrete uprights and the re-inforcement. On the day of the match the perimeter fence consisted
basically of two barriers. One was a brick structure; the other, on the terrace side, was wire fencing about
two metres high.

   1.10 There was a barrier dividing Block “Y” from Block “Z” . It consisted of two lines of tubular steel
hand rail fixed by metal straps to the top of the existing concrete crush barrier uprights. It thus formed a
passageway from top to bottom of the terrace. To one of the .continuous hand rails were fixed fairly
lightweight steel posts approximately 2.5-3 metres high. Tied to the steel posts was plastic coated wire
mesh fencing. This composite construction, whilst forming a physical barrier, was not of sufficient strength
to resist the determined efforts to breach it. It was removed by physical force during the charge by English
fans from Block “Y” into Block “ Z” .

   1.11 The flank wall where the disaster occurred was about three metres high at its maximum, reducing
to just under two metres adjacent to the terrace. The brickwork wall did not appear to have been bedded
in mortar nor fixed in any other way to the concrete wall. The buttresses of the wall were such that they
would not assist in restraining the wall from movement when subjected to crowd pressure. It was not
constructed as a crush barrier. Not surprisingly, it was not adequate to act as such. The wall and perimeter
fence in front of the terrace were of fairly light construction which readily collapsed under the forward
pressure of the crowd.

   1.12 There were three places of entry and exit at the back of Blocks “X” , “Y” and “Z” and three single
access doors from the terraces onto the pitch. There were no turnstile controlled access points, but some
control was exercised by gatemen. It was thus impossible to know the numbers going into each block or
to prevent overcrowding in one block. In addition there were gaps in the boundary walls through which
entry was effected by a number of spectators into Blocks “X ” and “Y”.

   1.13 Having regard to the state of the crush barriers and fences, and the general condition of the terraces
it seems unlikely, had it been located in this country, that a certificate would have been issued under the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 for this part of the ground. However, the poor state of the terraces
played no part in the tragedy.

The Arrangements for the Game
   1.14 By 24 April 1985 the finalists were known. A meeting was held by the Belgian Football Association
at its own Headquarters. There were present M. Roosens, the Secretary of the Belgian Football Association,
a number of police officers, a member of the gendarmerie and representatives of Liverpool Football Club.

   1.15 In Belgium the policing is carried out by both the local police force and by the gendarmerie, who
are a national body organised on military lines. The Brussels police were to be responsible for the area
including Blocks “O”, “N” and “ M”, and the gendarmerie for Blocks “X”, “Y” and “Z” .

   1.16 It was agreed that the distribution and the positioning of spectators should be organised so that
English fans would be positioned in Blocks “X” and “Y” of the terraces, in “ U’\ “V” and “W” (in Tribune
2) and in “A”, “F”, “ B” and “D ” (in Tribune 1). Juventus were to be accommodated in Blocks “O” and
“N” of the terraces, in “Q”, “ P” and “W” (in Tribune 2) and in “ G” , “ L” , “I” and “K” (in Tribune 1).
It was agreed that each side would be issued with some 14,500 tickets of which 11,000 were for the terraces.

   1.17 It was arranged by the Belgian Football Association that Block “ Z” and Block “M” would be
allocated to neutral spectators, and Liverpool Football Club officials were told that a maximum of five
tickets per person would be sold to spectators. There was agreement that there should be a barrier put up
between Block “Y” and Block “ Z”, and another barrier between Block “N ” and Block “M” . The Belgian
Football Association had agreed with the authorities that there should be at least one gendarme on each
of the steps of the segregation gangway between Block “Z” and the English fans in Block “Y”. These and
other matters were discussed, including the times of opening the ground and how English fans should
arrive. There were further meetings during May in Belgium and England. One matter which was agreed
was that there should be a ban on the sale of alcohol around the ground.

   1.18 Thus it was hoped that the English fans and Juventus supporters would be properly segregated and
that they would be physically prevented from being able to get at or to throw missiles at each other. They
would be contained within their own areas. However, the officer-in-charge of the gendarmerie at the ground
did not fully understand what his instructions were, nor unfortunately had he attended any of the meetings
preceding the game. In the result, for a number of different reasons, the gendarmerie presence between
Blocks “Y” and “Z” was insufficient.       *

   1.19 The advance intelligence was, broadly, that the English fans would present little or no trouble. This
had a- marked effect on the precautions which were taken. Liverpool have a good record, so far as European
competitions, in which they have played for some 22 years, are concerned. Their management has long
experience and they sought to take the normal precautions to prevent the unauthorised acquisition of
tickets, to co-ordinate travel arrangements and to liaise with the Belgian authorities.
   1.20 So far as the sponsored travel arrangements were concerned, supporters were accompanied by
officers o f the British Transport Police. That generally seems to have gone off without difficulty. However,
one group of unsponsored supporters were refused passage by a Belgian vessel and there was a further
group of 400 unsponsored coach travellers who had apparently had a great deal too much to drink.

The Sale of Tickets for Block “ Z”
   1.21 There were various alarms about the sale of black market tickets and forged tickets. One of the
matters of concern for the Liverpool Club was the sale of tickets for Block “Z” . By the UEFA instructions,
no blocks of tickets were to be sold at the venue of the match except in small quotas. What happened to
the sale of some of the tickets for Block “Z” was described by M. Roosens. He said that there were some
3,000 tickets available for sale on the first day and they were put in the hands of a M. Desment who had
been selling tickets for the last twenty years. The sale took place at the Heysel Stadium, and a notice was
put up saying that they were available for 300 Belgian francs each and that the maximum which could be
purchased was five per person. When the staff arrived there was already a massive queue before sales had
started. M. Desment later walked through the crowds and noticed that there were more tickets being sold
to foreigners fhan to Belgians. He enquired from M. Roosens whether the sale should be stopped. The sale
was in fact stopped. By then they had sold 2,000 to 3,000 tickets.

   1.22 Because tickets were being sold from five different windows it was impossible to control who bought
them. It was quite clear from all the evidence that some organisations had been buying large quantities of
tickets. They did this by using a large number of their employees to take it in turns to go to the ticket
windows. M. Roosens agreed in evidence that people had left the Stadium with whole rolls of tickets.
Additionally, M. Roosens allowed 1,000 tickets to be sold to a director of a sports club committee who
apparently sold them to an insurance company which sponsored the club. One witness spoke of a travel
agent from Sicily with 60 tickets for Block “Z” which he was selling outside the ground at 100 times the
official price.

  1.23 It Is quite clear that whether the tickets found their way onto the black market or not, a large
number of tickets for Block “ Z” came into the hands of Juventus supporters. The effect was, therefore,
that all the careful preparations for the segregation of the English and Italian fans were rendered useless.

The events of 29 May
   1.24 It is not surprising that there is a great deal of conflicting evidence about the events of this day even
from experienced witnesses such as police officers. Contradictions about the behaviour of the English fans
before the game abound. I set out here as best I can some of the evidence presented to me.

  1.25 Elaborate arrangements were made within the Belgian authorities for meeting and escorting the
English supporters after their arrival in Belgium and on the train. Unfortunately, because of the timetable
which the shipping companies operated, large numbers of English fans arrived in Brussels well before kick-
off
   1.26 The behaviour of the English fans in the centre of Brussels gave a foretaste of what was to happen
later in the day. It is only necessary to refer to one or two incidents so as to give an idea of how some,
albeit a small minority of the English supporters, were behaving. It is said that about 2,000 supporters had
taken over the Grand’ Place and the surrounding area. They were throwing beer bottles at the Belgian
Police, they were spitting, they were hurling beer at cars. One witness described the Grand Place as looking
like a broken glass factory. One supporter, who had drunk too much and was wearing a toy British police
helmet, stood at a nearby cross-roads directing traffic, thereby causing severe dislocation of traffic. A
jeweller's shop was robbed by English fans. Other fans were bathing in the fountains. A witness described
a grocer’s shop being pillaged. The steps of the Stock Exchange were invaded. A number of English fans
arrived at Jette from the train. They already had drink with them, although a good deal of it was
confiscated. They tried to get into the buses provided for them without paying. In this they were unsuccessful
 because the bus driver simply refused to drive them. A very experienced senior British police officer
described the conduct of the English fans as the worst he had ever seen.

   1.27 Other witnesses, however, gave a totally different picture. Some supporters have written to say that
while there was some noise, the general behaviour was good, the atmosphere friendly and relaxed, and that
far from the police standing by while something akin to a riot was taking place, the police were heavy
handed, interfering with people who were merely singing and enjoying themselves and treating both sets
of supporters to an excessive display of authority.

                                                        5
    1.28 Yet other witnesses talk of a carnival atmosphere with British and Italian fans fraternising freely
 with each other, taking photographs and exchanging mementoes and favours. This view was supported by
 a senior police officer to whom I spoke when I was in Belgium.

 Events at the Stadium
   1.29 The first incident recorded in the Brussels Police Report took place at 3.55 pm when some of the
 temporary fencing, which had been erected all round the Stadium, was knocked down by Juventus
 supporters. It was erected to enable the Police more easily to search fans. It was about a kilometre long,
 comprising fifty sections. By about 4 pm about thirty or more sections had already been knocked down-
 This was not, apparently, considered serious by the police, because it was only intended to provide a buffer
 between the. supporters and the ticket barrier. The police and gendarmes intended to search fans near the
 outside fence with a view to confiscating sticks or other weaponry. It is perfectly clear from all the evidence
 that there were insufficient police or gendarmes to search all spectators. Additionally it was wholly
 impossible to search people and at the same time to make sure that they did not retrieve weapons that had
 been confiscated.

    1.30 There is a great body o f evidence that the searching was perfunctory; that because of the absence
 of turnstiles and the presence of holes in the perimeter wall, a large number of people got into the Stadium
 without tickets; that those who had tickets inside were able to pass them back to those outside who did
 not. Weapons which were confiscated earlier were retrieved. The weapons varied. There were sticks used
 to carry flags, pieces of tree trunks, bottles and stones. Additionally, it is clear that a number of spectators
 had had too much to drink and a ban on the sale of alcohol outside the ground was not enforced. Bottles
 of drink were on sale at a number of stalls, thus providing more ammunition for the fans.

    1.31 At 5.15 pm there was a police report that some of the perimeter fence in Block “N ”, occupied by
 Juventus supporters, had been cut. At 5.46 pm there was a report that Italian supporters were beginning
 to vent their anger on the police. At 5.55 pm there was a report that there was general disorder in Block
 “O", that supporters were becoming agitated and that 200 of them were beginning to get worked up,
 hurling insults at the police in the segregation gangway. A few minutes later there was a mass invasion of
 Block “ M” by supporters because Blocks “O” and “N ” were full.

     1.32 Commissioner Meura of the Brussels City Police said that some of his officers inside the stadium
,_were pelted with missiles by the Italians, who were attempting to use riot tactics, surging forward en masse
  and retreating. He decided that what he must do was to protect the pitch and, although some of the
  perimeter fencing intended to protect the pitch was knocked over, he succeeded in preventing a pitch
  invasion. However, some 27 police were injured as a result of concrete and metal objects being thrown at
  the Juventus end of the ground.

   1.33 The Police report records a request at 7.06 pm for re-inforeements in the gangway of Blocks “N ”
 and “ M”, where the situation suddenly took a turn for the worse. And the report continues:
       “It should be noted that the relative calm in the upper parts of sections “N’\ “ M” and “ O” only served
       to camouflage the jeers and provocation which a few hundred Juventus fanatics were directing at the
       police lower down. They began to cause .(trouble between 5.55 pm and 7.25 pm; initially in a fairly
       moderate way, there was a | hour during which insults were being hurled at the police and the supporters
       were trying to break through the fencing (Heras fencing shaken several times). The police In the gangway
       could not prevent 5 to 6 metres of fencing from being tom down at about 7 pm. Then 30 metres were
       forced and trampled down so as to give direct access to the track. All this despite the use of shields and
       truncheons by the, police, several of whom were injured. It should also be noted that stones and/or lumps
       of concrete and some beer bottles, 20 in all, were raining down onto the track. Some hooligans from
       amongst the supporters were even running up to the police with sticks and iron bars.”

    1.34 The report describes one hooligan at the Juventus end getting through the fencing and onto the
 pitch itself and sprinkling salt between the goal-posts; and there is a report of another incident when a pair
 of hand-cufl's were taken from a police officer by a hooligan who got onto the pitch; subsequently they
 were returned. Although it had been arranged that Juventus supporters should have Blocks “O” and *‘N”
 and that “ M” should be allocated to neutral supporters, it is clear that Block “M” was occupied by
 Juventus supporters. Both the police and the gendarmerie described to me the behaviour of the Italian fans
 upito this stage as worse than that of the English fans.

    1.35 What meanwhile was happening at the other end of the ground, in Blocks “X”, “ Y” and V‘Z”? The
 first signs of unrest among the English fans appeared during the youth match which had been organised
to keep the spectators occupied; this occurred somewhere between 6.15 pm and 6,30 pm. The English fans
fired flares and rockets and threw stones into Block “ Z”, which was beginning to be occupied by what
were clearly Italian supporters. There was also a number of English fans in Block “ Z” who sought to
escape into Block “Y”. According to Captain Mahieu, who was in charge of the gendarmerie responsible
for patrolling the area between Block “Y” and Block “Z”, everything was calm between 6.15 pm and 7
pm. Accordingly he had gone out of the Stadium; so too had Lieutenant Bonnet who was his second-in-
command, to investigate a criminal complaint and to see about closing Block “X ” . It appears there were
about 15,000 spectators in Blocks “X” and “Y” and about 5,000 in Block “Z”.

  1.36 There is no doubt but that somewhere between 7.15 pm and 7.30 pm English fans charged Block
“Z” . Preceding this there had been an exchange of missiles between Blocks “Z” and “Y” . There were three
charges by English fans. The first two seemed to have been repulsed; the third resulted in the Italian
supporters in Block “Z”, who were seeking to escape towards the perimeter, being squashed and suffocated
by the press of large numbers.

Extreme Political Parties
             *
  1.37 There was evidence about the presence of supporters from the extreme right. The Mayor gave
evidence at the Inquiry that he had seen British and Italian spectators wearing the political insignia of
parties of the extreme right and carrying flags. One British supporter, himself a referee, said that the ground
outside the Stadium was littered with British National Front leaflets, some overprinted by the British
National Party with their address. One witness spoke of passengers on the boat crossing the Channel with
National Front insignia singing songs of hatred and exhibiting violence.

   1.38 Mr John Smith, Chairman of Liverpool Football Club, spoke of how six members of Chelsea
National Front had boasted to him of their part in provoking the violence and said that they seemed proud
of their handiwork. Mr Bob Paisley, a former manager o f Liverpool Football Club, said that he was forced
to leave the Directors’ Box at the start of the game as dozens of fans poured over the dividing wall and
that the person next to him claimed that he was a Chelsea supporter and was wearing a National Front
badge. A number o f banners decorated with swastikas were recovered after the match, including one
marked “Liverpool EdgehiU” . There was also evidence that the flag of a right wing organisation, ^New
Order” , was being flown by a small group of Juventus fans. A banner with “England for the English and
"Europe for the English” was observed and a contingent of the National Front were clearly seen in Blocks
“X” and “Y” . One party leaving Brussels main station was observed to be Londoners wearing Liverpool
colours, carrying Union Flags and having National Front and swastika tattoos.

  1.39 Apart from their presence, there is very little hard evidence that they caused any of the violence.
Commissioner Meura said that he had not seen anyone from any extreme right wing organisation weanng
any insigna. On 5 July a press statement was issued by the Merseyside Police which said:
      “There is no evidence to suggest that any National Front members were involved in the riot at the Heysel
      Stadium in Brussels.*’

What lessons are to be learned?                   "
1.40 A Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry was set up in Belgium on 12 June 1985. It reported on 9
July 1985. •

   1.41 The Commission concluded in this way:
      “It should be emphasised from the outset that it was the B r itis h supporters who mounted the disastrous
      charge into Section “ Z”. They bear the main responsibility for the terrible events that followed and this
      must remain the case for whatever blame might be attributed to others as having aggravated the matter.

   An extract from their conclusions appears in Appendix D.

   1.42 When I spoke with M. Collignon, the Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission of Enquiry m
 Brussels in November, he told me that the only matter in his report that on reflection he might like to a ter
 was to makerather more criticism of the Belgian and European football authorities and less of the individua
 members of the gendarmerie.
    1.43    In his principal statement to Parliament about the Heysel disaster, the Belgian Minister of the
 Interior said:
     “Everyone knows that those guilty of the violence, those responsible for the deaths of the victims, are
     the violent groups among the English supporters.”

  He also referred to the
     “collective responsibility of English society which tolerates this violence and tries to channel it without
     wanting to eliminate it.”

  He said that the organisers of the match were the second group of people responsible. With regard to
the role of the police and gendarmerie, he said that the overall plan had been adequate. He acknowledged
that there had been errors in execution and announced measures to improve training and equipment to
remedy these deficiencies. He added that if in future a larger police deployment was necessary, he would
prefer to ban matches. He did not want to turn Brussels, even for a day, into a pojice state, for the sake
of those who liked to manifest their violence.

  1.44 The lessons to be learned from the disaster can be summarised in this way:
 (a) It is essential that opposing fans at matches such as this should be properly segregated so that there
     is no possibility of their being within attacking distance of each other. Missiles from rival supporters
     caused enormous problems and contributed in no small way to the disorder which occurred. So fidk
     as domestic football is concerned, that means ensuring either that there is an unoccupied sp a ^ r
     between opposing factions or that the physical method of securing segregation is such that they are
     unable to attack or bombard each other with missiles.
 (b) Sales of tickets need to be properly controlled so that segregation can be effectively enforced. One of
     the problems of all-ticket matches is that ticket touts may be able to purchase numbers of tickets and
     sell them indiscriminately; the effect of this is to put the whole segregation policy at risk. Police need
     to be aware if this occurs. In Scotland any person who in a public place touts for the purpose of
     selling so as to give another person cause for annoyance commits a criminal offence under the Civic
     Government (Scotland) Act 1982.
 (c) It is clear that a large number of spectators, particularly the English, had consumed substantially too
     much drink, and that they were able to take drink into the ground. This is now covered by the
     provisions of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 in England and Wales and by
     the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980.
 (d) In addition to the fact that a number of fans were able to get into the ground without paying, most
     of them were also able to get in without being effectively searched; if they were searched, they were
     able to recover weapons which they subsequently used. This is particularly relevant to the power of
     the police to search at sports grounds in the United Kingdom.
 (e) While the structure of the police in Belgium is different from that in Britain there was obviously^fc
     breakdown in communications and instructions both prior to and during the course of the match,
     was accepted by the Commandant of the gendarmerie that mistakes had been made. The important
     lesson for us to learn is that there needs to be strict co-operation between the football club and the
     police; that the police need to lay down and observe fixed procedures and that the communications
     need to be efficient. There was also criticism at the lack of liaison between the Headquarters outside
     the ground and those inside the ground. There needs to be good early planning with close co-operation
     between all the relevant authorities and dear decisions made. Those who are to be in charge on the
     day n-ed to have taken part in the planning and to clearly understand their role.
 (f) Another lesson which can be learnt is that in order to enforce segregation, apart from physical
     barriers, it is necessary to have present a sufficient number of properly instructed police to take
     effective action at the first sign of trouble. If there are perimeter fences, they should contain an .
     adequate number of doors in them; they need to be manned and to be opened immediately in the
     event of an emergency.
 (g) It is clear that, notwithstanding the previous good record of any particular dub, those who go to see -
     that club play can readily behave like hooligans, particularly when affected by drink. Unfortunately
     a previous good record is no guarantee of good behaviour in the future.
 (h) The final and most important lesson, which I cannot too strongly or too frequently emphasise is that
     if hooligans did not behave like hooligans at football matches there would be no such risk of death
     or injury.

                                      EUROPEAN CONVENTION

  1.45 In August 1985 “The European Convention on Spectator Violence and Misbehaviour at Sports
Events and in Particular at Football Matches” was agreed. It has at the moment been signed by ten of the
parties. It has been ratified by four.
  1.46 The key points are that the Contracting Parties shall:
     1. co-ordinate the policies and actions of Government Departments and other public agencies against
     spectator violence and misbehaviour (Article 2);
     2. secure that adequate public order resources are employed to counter outbreaks of violence and
     misbehaviour near and inside grounds and along transit routes used by spectators; and facilitate co­
     operation and exchange of information between police forces of different localities (Article 3.1);
     3. seek to ensure that offenders (especially visidng supporters) are identified, prosecuted and that they
     receive appropriate penalties (Articles 5 and 3.1(c));
     4. encourage the co-ordination of travel arrangements to inhibit potential troublemakers from leaving to
     attend matches (Article 3.3);
     5. introduce procedures to identify problem matches in advance and for effective co-operation between
     authorities and clubs on precautions and measures to be taken (Article 4);
     6. encourage the use of stewards in supporters’ clubs for crowd control and information (Article 3.2);.
     7. press football and local authorities and stadium owners and clubs to" take the necessary practical
     measures for problem matches, eg in the design, improvement and selection of stadia, segregation, alcohol
     control, ticket sales, the exclusion of drunks and troublemakers etc (Article 3.4);
     8. encourage football authorities to review their regulations continuously (Article 6.3);
     9. looking further ahead, take social and educational measures to promote the more positive side of
     sport, eg fair play and active participation (Article 3.5); and
     10. establish a standing committee to police the operation of the Convention and to propose improvements
   — (Article 8).          ~

   1.47 This is a blueprint for European football, which has lessons for our domestic game.

                                         History ofprevious Inquiries

              ty, , 7 Repor was Published, it might have been thought by some that the suggestions
,          ou|. had on*y recently been considered. It was said to be unfair to expect the football clubs to
havetaken earlier steps to arrange their affairs. It was urged that they should now be entitled to more time
                      °, T t0| dear ^     the Proble™        crowd control and safety at their ground?. The
mattir^infnCr° v t,CT ? r° t       f 3' d’ so U was said>suddenly arisen. I have to say that almost all the
matters into which I have been asked to inquire and almost all the solutions I have proposed, have been
pr viously considered in detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period of sixty years.
The Shortt Report

<.,        1\ J“ ne 1923; the then Secretary of State for the Home Department asked the Rt Hon Edward
f. ° “      to fonn a Committee to inquire, amongst other things, into arrangements made to deal with
    abnormally large attendances on special occasions, especially attendances at athletic grounds. This
       j ®1? disorder, which-occurred at Wembley Stadium on the occasion of the first Cup Final bn 28
n .S J L ;         Com™“ ee reP °J?d on 13 March 1924. The Report was presented to Parliament and
published as Command Paper 2088 at the princely sum of 6d.         ‘

  2.3 About responsibility for control inside grounds the Report had this to say:
       As regards the general question of the apportionment of responsibility inside the ground as between the
     pohce and the ground authority, the principle to be followed should, in our judgment, be that the police
     should be responsible for all matters appertaining to the preservation of law and order and that for
     arrangements for the convenience of the public the ground authority should be responsible. It is, however
     most important not only that the police arrangements should be under the control of a single officer, but
     also that the duties for which the ground authority is responsible should be assigned to a definite
    individual, who          be competent to give instructions and to deal with any incident which arises. If
    responsibility w definitely allocated in this manner it appears to us that, in ordinary circumstances, there
    need be no difficulty in this division of duties and that no disadvantage need result from the existence of
    dual control so long as the closest co-operation is maintained between the two authorities at all times.
                     0Pini<>n> however, that if any emergency arises or there appears to be the slightest
    probability of a disturbance, it is essential that control should pass into the hands of one individual, and
    we recommend that, in the case of grounds providing accommodation for more than 10,000 persons, on
    all occasions when specially large attendances are anticipated or for other reasons unusual excitement
    is to be expected, arrangements should be concerted beforehand by which one individual can at anv
    moment take control of the situation.”

 2.4 That paragraph o f the report continued:
    “The question in such circumstances would have become one of the preservation of law and order         HI
     we therefore have no doubt that the control should then pass into the hands of the senior police officer
    present, and we consider that such officer would be justified in any circumstances, whether in accordance
    with a pre-arranged scheme or not, in assuming control if he considered it necessary for the purpose of
    the restoration of order. As part of the arrangements for this purpose we think that, in the very large -
    grounds, there should be a central control box in telephonic communication with all parts of the ground
    and that the principal police and ground officials should be stationed there so that they may be in constant
    touch with the situation.” . . (Paragraph 22).

2.5 About stewards the Report said:
    “We understand that there is no uniform practice with regard to the employment of stewards at sports
   grounds, that in some cases they are only used to show spectators into the seating accommodation, and
     .if*’ "! cases where stewards are employed for packing of the standing room, they are only employed
   when there are specially large crowds. We consider it desirable in the interests of safety that, for the
   purpose of handling a crowd, stewards should be employed in any case where the crowd is likely to
   approach the capacity of the ground. For seating accommodation stewards Should always be employed.
   It is m the highest degree important that any such stewards should be properly trained in their work and
   intimately acquainted with the part of the ground placed under their charge. We doubt whether it is
   practicable to secure suitable men for this purpose unless they are given continual experience in the

                                                    10
      work, and we therefore recommend that every ground with a capacity exceeding 10,000 which provides
      terraced accommodation for its spectators should maintain, or have a call upon, an adequate staff of
      efficient stewards, and should ensure that they keep proficient by requiring them to perforin duty at
      frequent intervals. Stewards should be organised as a disciplined body and should act under the control
      and supervision of their own officers. They should wear a distinctive badge of authority, which thej
      should not be able easily to discard.” (Paragraph 27).

   2.6 The Report had this to say about precautions against fire:
      “We have been somewhat surprised to find that in many cases little or no precaution is taken against
      the risk of fire in stands. We do not suppose that either the risk or the consequences of fire would be so
      serious in an open stand as in a closed building, but we consider it most important that adequate
      arrangements should be made to deal with any outbreak which might occur.” (Paragraph 40),

      but concluded generally:
      “We are assured that these governing bodies are only too anxious to secure that their sport is carried
      on under conditions which will promote the public safety, and we feel that at this stage it is safe to leave
      the matter to them.” (Paragraph 47).

 The Moelwyii Hughes Report
   2.7 The next report (published as Cmnd 6846) arose out of the disaster at Bolton Wanderers Football
 Ground on 9 March 1946. Mr R Moelwyn Hughes KC was appointed by the then Home Secretary to
 conduct an enquiry into the circumstances of the disaster which arose by the presence of some 83,000
 spectators. 50,000 had been expected. Because of the press of people in an enclosure two barriers collapsed
 and 33 people were killed.

     2.8 It is interesting to observe that the previous best attendance at Bolton in the 1945-46 season had
   been 43,000 and it was amply policed by a force of 60. On this occasion there were 103 police to control
   85.000 spectators, which is about 1/I0th of the present ratio of police to spectators at football grounds,
. .both, inside andoutside the ground.

    2.9 Mr Hughes made a number of recommendations. He said:
                           typical of most home grounds of the leading football teams in the country. They have
       “ B u m d e n P a r k is

       grown stage by stage from humble beginnings on sites acquired when the large gates of these dajs were
       not anticipated, or when the clubs had not achieved eminence. It would be idle to suggest that the grounds,
       or large sections of them, should be rebuilt, but if they are to be made reasonably safe and ifth en sk o f
       repeating the tragedy of Burnden Park is to be avoided, then, I have formed tne clearview that the
       following steps must be taken . . . ” (Page 10).

    2.10 The recommendations included inspections of the enclosures, scientific calculation of the maximum
  number to be allowed entry, counting those entering the ground by mechanical means and central co­
  ordination of the system, all to ensure the admission of a safe number of spectators.

    2.11 So far as future regulation \yas concerned the Report said:
        “The preceding safety measures cannot be secured without legislation. A D e p a r t m e n t a l Committee
        reporting on Crowds to a previous Home Secretary in 1924 (Cd 2038)anaem.cally
        adequate provision for safety be left to the pressure of the governing bo les in P •
        important of these was, of course, the Football Association, which had not deigned to appear before th
        Committee . . .
        The legislation should empower the Home Secretary to issue general regulations for different kinds of
        grounds and the broad conditions necessary for safety.
        No ground of any c o n s id e r a b le size should be opened to the public until it has been licenced JjM suggest
        as an appropriate licensing authority, the local authority. The issue of the licence would depend u p on
        satisfying the authority as to the construction and equipment of the ground, its compliance with re0uiati
        and the proposed maximum figures of admission to the different parts.

     2.12 Mr Hughes went on to say:

                                                            11

           Mr Hughes ended his report by saying:

    than to undertake any major spending on ground improvement which would increase safety and make
    hooligan control easier. The loss of revenue which a club may suffer from alterations may be the
    determining factor. There is of course no obligation on a club to convert a ground which can accommodate
    50,000 to one which takes a smaller number in conditions of greater safety and comfort. Letters from
    members of the public suggest that already some are staying away because of their dislike of poor
    facilities, overcrowding, and disturbances, so that the neglect of ground improvement may ultimately be
    self defeating.” (Page 34).

 2.21 So far as responsibility is concerned, the Report said:
     “We think that those responsible for club management and the governing bodies of football should accept
     far more responsibility for keeping tbeir crowds in order. This applies not only within the stadium itself
     but to club supporters travelling in groups to and from matches. One gets the impression that some clubs
     disclaim Iny responsibility for the behaviour of their supporters and if the atmosphere of a Roman
     holiday is not deliberately fostered it is looked on with considerable t o l e r a n c e . Football matches are
     commercial enterprises conducted for profit on private premises and clubs have therefore a heavy
     responsibility for keeping order and safety for the public on their premises. (Pages 35-j6).

  2.22 In its summary the Report concluded:
     “The solution of the problem of hooliganism in the football stadium is ultimately the responsibility of
     individual clubs who must each deal with it in the light of local circumstances. While a few clubs are
     exemplary in their attitude to the problem others are laissez-faire and need persuasion to take a more
     active role in trying to control hooliganism in their own grounds. This laissez-faire attitude does not help
      the police in their attempts to deal with the matter.” (Page 56).

The Lang Report
  2.23 Shortly thereafter, a Working Party under the chairmanship of Sir J o h n L a n g GCB and tnduding
a number of distinguished members, was appointed by the then Minister with- special                   ^
Sport to examine the problems involved in football crowd behaviour to which attention had been called a
few months previously by the Harrington Report. Sir John’s Report was presented on 21 November iyw .

  2.24 By way of introduction it said:
     “The Working Party was dealing with a subject which has been discussed almost a i nauseam during
     recent years. Not unexpectedly the Working Party has not found a single simple solution for a problem
     which is often due to a combination of factors . . • (Page 3).
  2.25 The members of the Inquiry witnessed the demonstration of CCTV equipment and reported:
  " “ . . . the view was formed that closed circuit television could be of value in the
    control and . . . would be an important factor in preventing misbehavior ^sp ectato rs at grou s.
    was a refinement which most of the top class clubs could be expected eventually to ha>e as a matter of
    course.” (Page 9).
   2.26 About alcohol the Report said:
      “There can be no doubt that consumption of alcohol is an important factor in cro wd
      Ixcause-lt sHm»]a«s q u a r r e ls o m e and tea u se em p., f o t t e are da,.gerousm                     »a,e
      be no advantage in refusing licence facilities to football club grounds                            -
      spectators to bring their supplies from outside.” (Page 14).

 The Wheatley Report
     ?7 On 4 February 1971 the Rt Hon Lord Wheatley was asked by the then Secretary of State Tor the
 Ho'me Department and the then Secretary of State for Scotland to m      a k      e      ^and of the
 effectiveness of existing arrangements for crowd safety at sports groun             to consider the

                                                          13
   2.28 On 16 March 1972 Lord Wheatley completed his Report and it was presented to Parliament and
 published by HMSO as Cmnd. 4952.

     2.29 The Report contained a technical Appendix. Following the Report, the Safety of Sports Grounds
  Act 1975 was passed. A licensing system involving the issue of a safety certificate for designated grounds
• was introduced and supporting guidance (the Green Guide) was published. In his Report Lord Wheatley
  said:
        “I recognise that a decision to introduce a licensing system for grounds along the lines I have recommended
        may cause anxiety to some football dubs and football administrators. As I see it, their misgivings are
        associated with a fear that such stringent conditions might be attached to the granting of a licence that
        many clubs may not be able to afford the cost and some may have to go out of business.” (Paragraph
        66).

     2.30 “My answer to that is this. My task was to consider the problem of crowd safety at the grounds. Clubs
        which charge the public for admission have a duty to see that their grounds are reasonably safe for
        spectators. That is a primary consideration. It is accordingly necessary that some standards should be
        imposed and observed. This has been recognised by the football authorities themselves . . . I have
    i canvassed all the alternatives that have been proposed or which I personally thought were reasonable to
        consider, and the one which I decided was best to meet the situation in the interest of the public is
        licensing system by a local authority. There is nothing new in this proposal. It has been m ooted^b
        almost fifty years. It can come as no surprise to the football world, and in the light of happenings over
        the years the demand for an independent appraisal and determination of the safety of grounds becomes'
        almost irresistible. I certainly cannot resist it.” (Paragraph 61).

    2.31 Lord Wheatley ended his Report by saying:
        “I trust that this-Report may be of assistance to you in deciding what should be done to solve this
        important question of crowd safety in football grounds. One thing is certain. The public demand for
        something to be done has been growing over the years. I am sure I am reflecting public opinion when I
        say that something must be done now. The evidence certainly supports that view.”

 The McElhone Report
— 2:32 In October 1976 the then Secretary of State for Scotland asked Mr Frank McElhone MP to chair
a Working Group on Football Crowd Behaviour
        “to consider the problems caused by some Scottish football supporters and to make recommendations
        to the Scottish Football Association and other organisations concerned.”

 Among the membership of the Working Group were representatives from the football authorities, from
 the football clubs and the Strathclyde Police.

    2.33 In the introduction to the Report1, Mr McElhone said:
       “There is no simple solution to the problem; it is but one of the manifestations of anti-social behaviour
       besetting society in general today. We have however in our findings arrived at a number of conclusions
        and recommendations which we hope, given a commitment to implement them on the part of all those
      • most closely concerned, will go some way towards reducing the problem of hooliganism at football
       matches and by so doing turn football grounds once again into places of entertainment where parents
       can take their children to enjoy, in relative comfort and safety, the pleasures of our national game.”

    2.34 The Report observed that:
        “ A hooligan is a hooligan no matter where he operates and the fact that his behaviour is conspicuous at
        a football match has very often nothing to do with the game itself.” (Paragraph 4).
Mr McElhone saw the problem as one of trying to reduce, or at least contain, the incidence of hooliganism
at football matches without restricting the pleasure of the majority of supporters.

   2.35 So far as drink was concerned, the Report recommended that it should be an offence for a spectator
to carry or attempt to carry alcohol into a football ground; that it should be an offence to be in possession
of alcohol within the ground or to attempt to gain admission while drunk. The Report recommended that
■                         —       _                 ..              .......... —       m .:   ..      ■             — ■■ ■ I N- ..............   - ........

more people who were physically capable of carrying out the duties of enforcement would have to be
recruited and suggested that, in their recruitment of stewards, clubs should look to their supporters' clubs
to assist in providing the kind of men required for the job. So far as transport was concerned, the Report
recommended that it should be an offence for anyone to be in possession of alcoholic liquor on a vehicle
hired specifically for the purpose of carrying passengers bound for a football match; or to allow any
alcoholic liquor to be carried on a public service vehicle being used for the purpose of carrying passengers
to football matches; or to allow the carriage of any drunken person on such a vehicle bound for a football
match.

  2.36 So far as the separation of supporters was concerned the Report recommended:
     “That in the Interests of crowd control and safety, separation of rival supporters at turnstiles should be
     carried out if the police, in consultation with the club, consider such a step to be necessary; that for
     matches where larger than average attendances are expected, sufficient turnstiles should be opened
     timeously in order to achieve speedy admission:” (Recommendation 13).
     In order to protect the players, match officials and the pitch, access to the playing area should be made
     as difficultras possible. To prevent an invasion of the playing area by spectators . . . the erection of a
     physical barrier in the form of a fence not less than 1.8 metres In height with access points to allow the
     pitch to be used if necessary for the evacuation of spectators in an emergency.” (Paragraph 53).

  2.37 A further recommendation was that:
     “the Courts should make full use of the higher fining powers under the Criminal Law Act 1977 in respect
     of common law offences which include malicious mischief, breach of the peace and assault, these being
     the most common offences associated with football hooliganism, and in respect of persistent Offenders,
     should normally impose imprisonment without option.” (Recommendation 19).

  2.38 The Report recommended that:
     “The police should have statutory powers to search for any containers . . . in the possession of any
     person entering or attempting to enter football grounds.” (Recommendation 24).
but went on to point out that the clubs must bear their share of the responsibility for the behaviour and
conduct of their staff at all levels:

  2.39 Among other observations the Report says this:
     “ We recognise that many football grounds in Scotland are very old; some could even be described as
     primitive in that not only do they lack any kind of comfort for spectators but they, also lack basic
     amenities including adequate toilet accommodation. This primitive environment encourages some people
     to react in a primitive manner. Moreover there is a strong case for more seating accommodation. In our
     view it would go a considerable way towards reducing hooliganism; potential trouble spots could be more
     quickly recognised and identification of troublemakers by police would be made that much easier.”
The-Report therefore recommended:
     “ that clubs should consider the provision of additional seating accomodation. In addition clubs must
     provide adequate toilet facilities for men and women and generally improve amenities for spectators.”
     (Paragraph 88).

  2.40 This Report also recommended that:
      “players should be encouraged by the clubs to extend their voluntary public relations work in the
      community including personal appearances at youth clubs etc and coaching sessions in schools with the
      objects of promoting the game and the concept of good sportsmanship.” (Recommendation 37).
CCTY was recommended and supporters’ clubs encouraged. The Scottish Football Association was
recommended to take appropriately firm action against clubs.

Department of the Environment Working Group
  2.41 The most recent Government publication on the subject of football is the Report of an Official
Working Group on Football Spectator Violence set up by the Department of the Environment, which was
published by HMSO in 1984. The Working Group was set up following serious incidents of violence
involving British supporters at England’s soccer matches in Luxembourg and France in November 1983
and February 1984 respectively. It dealt partly with problems arising out of international football.

   2.42 However, as regards domestic football the Report said:
      “the Group reaffirmed the importance of consistent planning, preparation and co-ordination; of building
      on experience; and of the need to consider afresh all possible measures, including those previously thought
      to be impractical or unnecessary.” (Paragraph 5.1).
      “We recommend therefore that the FA reviews and better defines its powers and procedures and the
      responsibilities of the clubs. If their powers prove to be inadequate, the Association should consider
      enhancing them.”
The Report went on:                                                                                    - .
      “This would better equip the FA to implement some of the recommendations.” (Paragraph 5.5).

  2.43 The Football Association had issued a “blueprint” detailing the precautions which league clubs
should take against violence, which was circulated to clubs at the beginning of the 1983-84 season. The
Working Party Report said that it:
      “. . . has not been rigorously adopted by all clubs. Since it represents the collective wisdom of footbim
      clubs, many of whom have successfully countered serious threats of violence, its implementation should
      have prevented some of the violence in grounds last season.”. (Paragraph 5.7).

  2.44 The Report observed that the enforcement by the Football Association of its “blueprint” occurs
after the event when the deficiencies in a club’s planning has become apparent. The Report recommended
that:
      ‘improved means should be found for ensuring that clubs adopt the provisions of the “blueprint” in a
      way appropriate to their own grounds and matches.” (Paragraph 5.7).

    The Report went on to recommend that each club should produce a detailed set o f plans to be
 submitted to the football authorities for endorsement. This would prevent some clubs from avoiding their
-responsibilities; and might ensure also a more co-operative and committed response.

   2.45 The Report recommended that matches between high risk clubs should be programmed so that the
risk or threat o f violence could be reduced. The Report said:
      “It is more likely to take place at the beginning and end of the season and at holiday periods, particularly
      at seaside fixtures when other groups of young people sometimes also clash with football supporters.”
      (Paragraph 5.13).

  2.46 The Report went on to recommend the introduction of club membership, the introduction of CCTV
and closer links with the community. It did not recommend that alcohol should be banned in grounds and
concluded that in the absence of clear evidence that the introduction of legislation along the lines of the
Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 would reduce violence at English soccer matches, it could not
recommend such action. Furthermore, said the Report:
      “legislation of this kind would be unwelcome to many; the majority of football clubs are untroubled by
      violence and would unnecessarily be penalised financially and the vast majority of non-violenf spectators
      would suffer for the actions of the few.”(Paragraph 5.34):

  The Working Group did not recommend additional measures for banning alcohol on trains or on football
coaches.

Conclusion
  2.47 A study of all these reports (and there are numerous reports and discussion papers by other bodies)
shows that the following are measures which have been frequently recommended;
      1. Closed Circuit Television
      2. Membership Cards
      3. Segregation

                                                       16
     4. More seating at football grounds
     5. Encouragement of supporters’ clubs
     6. A ban on alcohol
     7. Involvement of the clubs with the community
     8. Heavier penalties.
I too shall argue for these and related measures. It is to be hoped they will be more vigorously pursued by
the appropriate bodies than in the past.

                                      Future safety at sports grounds

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
   3.1 The terms of reference of my Inquiry require me to comment upon the working of the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975. The Act was introduced in 1975 to give effect to the recommendations of an
Inquiry into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds. This Inquiry, under the chairmanship of Lord Wheatley,
was set up in February 1971 following the tragedy at Ibrox Park in January 1971 when 66 people died as
a result of pressure from massive crowd surges on a gangway towards the end of the match.

  3.2 The main concern of the Wheatley Report was, understandably, with crowd safety in the context of
the hazards of uncontrolled crowd movement, with the measures appropriate for mitigating such risks and
with the provisions of a regulatory system to ensure that necessary safety measures were taken.

  1.3 The statutory framework of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, providing for local authority
certification of designated stadia, follows broadly the pattern outlined in the Wheatley Report.

. 3.4 My enquiries into the working of the Act have shown that in the designated stadia it has proved
 effective in securing improvements in safety. Until August 1985,-however, the only stadia designated were
 those with accommodation for over 10,000 in Divisions One and Two of the Football League, the Premier
 League in Scotland and certain international football and Rugby League stadia. In August of this year,
 following the tragedies at Bradford, Birmingham and Brussels, designation was extended to Divisions Three
 and Four of the Football League and to Divisions One and Two of the Rugby League.

   3.5 The provisions of the Act have not been applied to the remainder o f stadia and grounds in England
and Wales and Scotland. I find that neither it, nor the Home Office/Scottish Home and Health Department
Guide associated with it (the Green Guide) have been successful in raising the levels of safety at the non­
designated grounds. I have the clear impression from my various enquiries that until the tragic events at
Bradford, Birmingham and Brussels, the Green Guide was disregarded by the non-designated clubs. There
has, however, been an upsurge of interest since these events took place and there have, of course, been the
further designations referred to above. These developments do not themselves, in my view, yet assure a
proper standard of safety for the public at sports stadia and grounds. They do, however, provide a climate
in which, if prompt action is taken, a proper standard can be set and maintained. It is to be hoped that
this opportunity will not be missed.

  3.6 In his Report Lord Wheatley identified the various problems in the grounds relating to cro w j^
pressures and gradients in covered stands as well as the more acute risks that such factors presented o ^
the standing terraces. He also drew attention to the dangers peculiar to stands, such as the risk of fire,
which normally do not arise on open terraces. Lord Wheatley went on to say: “Many of the stands used at
present were built years ago. The materials of which they are built, their design and the use to which the
accommodation underneath is put, may constitute fire risks. Thus while events in recent times have highlighted
the dangers in the terracing and its exits, the potential dangers in stands are self-evident.”

   3.7 The level of spectator accommodation currently required before a stadium can be designated is not
an indicator of all the risks identified by Lord Wheatley as being present in sports grounds and stadia.
Whilst it is acknowledged that a designated ground will have all safety matters attended to, there are
present, on many non-designated grounds, stands capable of accommodating large numbers of spectators.
If these grounds do not qualify for designation, the risks, in particular those associatd with fire, will not .
receive the systematic attention that they should.

  3.8 There is, therefore, a need to reconsider the application of the safety controls at sports grounds. To
ensure the safety of persons attending it will be necessary to provide a wider measure of control in future
over sports grounds, sports stadia and indoor sports arena than currently.

  3.9 There is no wish on my part to add unnecessarily to the burdens which those who organise and
manage the various sporting activities carry. There is, however, a real responsibility to ensure that those
people who attend sporting events can feel confident that all reasonable steps have been taken to ensure
their safety in case of emergency.

                                                     18
Future designation and certification policy of grounds with accommodation of over 10,000
(i) "Stadia"/“Grounds” distinction
  3.10 The power under Section 1 of the 1975 Act to designate stadia as requiring safety certificates has
been applied only to the grounds of the four Divisions of the Football League in England and Wales, to
the two Divisions of Rugby League, to the Premier League in Scotland, and to a small number of major
international grounds where football is played. Three of the major grounds where Rugby Union is played
are also covered, Twickenham, Murrayfield and the National Stadium at Cardiff Arms Park.

  3.11 In my Interim Report, I provisionally recommended that there should be designation of those
grounds capable of holding over 5,000 spectators1 and that indoor sports premises should also be
designated2. I have now had an opportunity of reconsidering the position on further designation after
hearing extensive evidence on the matter. I have had to take into account, for example, the financial
position of the smaller clubs and balance that against the general safety of the public.

  3.12 By Section 1(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, the Secretary of State may by order
designate as a' stadium requiring a safety certificate any sports stadium which, in his opinion, has
accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators. By Section 17, sports stadium is given a particular
meaning, namely “ a sports ground where the accommodation provided for spectators wholly or substantially
surrounds the area used for activities taking place on the ground.”

   3.13 According to Section 17 of the Act, sports ground means “any place where sports or other competitive
activities take place in the open air and where accommodation has been provided for specators consisting of
artificial structures or of natural structures artificially modified for the purpose.”

   3.14 There is, in my view, no logic in making a distinction for safety purposes between a sports ground
and a sports stadium, simply according to whether the accommodation surrounds, say, three or two sides
of the ground. For instance, a Bradford-type stand is just as dangerous to the occupants in a stadium as
in a ground. In my view, the limitation on the interpretation of sports stadium, namely that the structure
has wholly or substantially to surround the area used for activities, is a limitation which should now be
removed and the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 should apply to any sports ground as defined in
Section 17 of the Act. I recommend that the distinction between sports grounds and sports stadia be abolished.

(ii) Extension o f designation under Section 1 o f the 1975 Act
   3.15 Given the present structure of the Act, I first have to consider those grounds and stadia with a
capacity for accommodation in excess of 10,000 spectators but which are presently undesignated. Should
they all be designated? Or should the full procedure under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 be
limited to those sports where in addition to a fire hazard there is a general problem of crowd control?

   3.16 It has to be recognised that at any sports grounds or stadia there may be three potential hazards the
fire risk, structural failure and problems of crowd control. But it does not follow that all grounds with
accommodation for over 10,000 spectators have all three problems. There are sports stadia and grounds
where by reason of the activity and the atmosphere there is no crowd control problem. For them I see no
purpose in imposing the full certification process under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

   3.17 Lord Wheatley, in his Report, recommended (paragraph 56) that the, licensing system should be
 phased as follows:         ;
 Category 1 (a) All International Grounds, ie Hampden Park, Ninian P a r k , Wembley Stadium, Cardiff
             Arms Park, Murrayfield and Twickenham.
            (b) All English 1st and 2nd Division Football League grounds and all Scottish 1st Division
            Football League grounds.
 Category 2 (a) All English 3rd and 4th Division Football League grounds and all Scottish 2nd Division
            Football League grounds (unless in Category 1).
            (b) Rugby League grounds.
 Category 3 Grounds of other Soccer Clubs and Rugby Clubs of either code with a capacity of more than
            10,000 spectators.                                                           _ _ _ ______ _
 ‘Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 6.
 -Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 5.
 Category 4 Grounds with a capacity of not more than 10,000 spectators, having structural accommodation
            such as stands for spectators.

    3.18 Apart from some clubs who were then in the Scottish 1st and 2nd Division (as they then were called)
 all grounds in Categories 1 and 2 have now been designated. Rugby League grounds which have already
 been designated present a similar picture to Rugby Union grounds both in size and shape and in the
 number and behaviour of their spectators. Currently, they have little or no hooligan problem. But safety
 in the stands and on the terraces needs to be considered, having regard to the movement of large crowds
 which some Rugby Union games attract. Accordingly, it seems to me right that Rugby Union grounds
 with accommodation for over 10,000 spectators should now be considered for designation.

   3.19 The other sport which attracts large numbers and has problems of crowd safety similar to Rugby
 Union or Rugby League is cricket. Also at some grounds an element of “football” hooliganism has started
 to appear on some occasions particularly at the one-day games. Lord Wheatley concentrated on the
 problems of crowd safety at soccer grounds and also considered Rugby League and Union. Understandably
 he did not consider other sports such as cricket.

   3.20 Having regard to the large number who attend some cricket matches and to the risk in terms of
 *owd safety that their attendance presents, it seems to me to be right that those cricket grounds which
 have accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators should also be considered for designation.

   3.21.1 have considered other sports where accommodation for spectators exceeds 10,000. At present there
 appears to be no real problem arising from crowd pressure or hooliganism at these sports. I conclude
 therefore that it is unnecessary to impose full designation under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
 on any other grounds with accommodation for over 10,000 spectators.

   3.22 It has been suggested that the general system of control of sports grounds might best be governed
 by the Fire Precautions Act 1971. The fire service representatives who gave evidence argued that it would
 be very much better if all matters relating to fire precautions were dealt with by them under one single Act.
 At first sight that has much to commend it. But there is also an argument that all matters of safety in
 sports grounds should come under the umbrella of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

    3.23 The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 has now been operating satisfactorily for a number of years
- at designated grounds. It seems to me sensible that large sports grounds requiring a safety certificate should
 continue to be dealt with under the Act. I am concerned, where possible,'that all sports grounds requiring
 a safety certificate should come under the umbrella of a single Act. It is now not feasible for the designated
 grounds under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act to be dealt with by any other legislation. Accordingly, I
 recommend the further designation o f sports grounds or stadia with accommodation fo r over 10,000 spectators
 where Association Football, Rugby League, Rugby Union and cricket is played in England and Wales and
 Scotland, under the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975.
 (iii) Regulation o f sports grounds/stadia not designated under Section 1 o f the 1975 Act

    3.241 turn next to consider the question of those numerous grounds where the accommodation provided
 for spectators is,below the 10,000 figure, and those with accommodation over 10,000 which are not
 recommended for designation. Nevertheless, there exists in many of these grounds stands which may
 accommodate several thousand people. An outbreak of fire could expose large numbers of people to serious
 risk of injury unless statutory provision is made for their safety in such an event. What then is to be done
 about the risk of fire at sports grounds and stadia which fall outside the system of designation, either
 because their capacity is below 10,000 or where ti.eir capacity is over 10,000 and Association Football,
 Rugby League, Rugby Union or cricket is not played?

   3.25 The question then is firstly, what system shall govern those grounds with accommodation below
 10,000, and those not recommended for designation with accommodation over 10,000 and secondly, at
 what level of capacity the line should be drawn. One possibility is that grounds and stadia not designated
 under the 1975 Act, but having seating capacity in a stand for over 500 spectators, should be designated
 under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Another possibility is by the application of the “self compliance”
 procedure. (See paragraphs 3.29 and 3.30).

   3.26 In July 1985, you published a consultative document—“A Review of the Fire Precautions Act
 1971.” It was arranged that my attention should be drawn to it so that I might consider its relevance to
 my Inquiry into the operation of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

                                                       20
   3.27 In paragraphs 3.57 to 3.63 of my Interim Report, I dealt with the position of the fire authority at
law under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Two matters in the Consultative Document, which are of
particular relevance to my considerations, are these. Because of the administrative workload of fire
certification under the Fire Precautions Act 1971, and the failure of the Act to discriminate between the
degrees of risk, it is suggested in the Consultative Document that what is needed is a more flexible and
discriminating system of fire precautions control under which premises which pose the greatest risk to the
safety of occupants in the event of fire can be identified. Secondly, the system should enable resources to
be devoted to improving fire safety in premises which pose unsatisfactory fire risks, without having to
devote equivalent attention to premises where standards are acceptable.

  3.28 At present, hotels, boarding houses, factories, offices, shops and railway premises are designated
under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. Fire authorities inspect these premises and issue a fire certificate with
which the owner or occupier must comply. Sports grounds and sports stadia as such are not currently
designated under the Act.

    3.29 Put shortly, the proposal in the Consultative Document is that the Secretary of State should have
 power to designate premises by class of use similar to that contained in the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
 Those which are designated would first have to be registered; then an obligation would be imposed upon
 the person responsible for the premises to achieve and maintain reasonable standards of fire safety. For
 this purpose he would be provided with advice in the form of an approved code of guidance. Thus the
|present fire certification process would be replaced by a system requiring the occupier to comply with the
^requirements of the Act by a specified date. The fire authority would have a duty to inspect and re-inspect
 after the said date to ensure tfiat the occupier had in fact complied with the requirements of the Act.

   3.30 This type of approach to compliance with the requirements of safety legislation (which for ease of
reference I call self compliance) has not received universal approval among those to whom I have talked.
However, for the purpose of application of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 this approach may have
some significance.

   3.31 The Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales and the Firemasters in Scotland have already carried
 out a detailed survey of a large number of sports grounds and stadia which were not designated under the
'Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

  3.32 The returns from the Chief Fire Officers in England and Wales about the extent of restrictions or
prohibitions they had imposed on the use of outdoor sporting venues of all kinds, show that by 17 August
1985 there were restrictions o r prohibitions applying in some 106 grounds. In some cases Section 10 of the
Fire Precautions Act 1971 had been used. In others. Section 77 of the Building Act 1984 (which gives
district councils certain powers in respect of dangerous buildings) had evidently been used and no doubt
Section 10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 had also been invoked.

   3.33 A total of 228 non-designated sports grounds were inspected by Firemasters in Scotland. In August
p985 it was found that in about'half of the grounds the fire precautions arrangements were unsatisfactory.
 At none of the clubs in the 1st and 2nd Divisions of the Scottish Football League were the fire precautions
 found to be satisfactory. Six out of twenty needed significant work done to improve fire safety levels.

    3.34 Having regard to the lack of safety precautions at sports grounds disclosed in evidence to me, it
 would in my view be a mistake to leave to sports grounds’ management the discretion o f ‘’self compliance.”
 I therefore recommend that all sports grounds and sports stadia no: designated under the Safety o f Sports
 Grounds Act 1975 and having a capacity in a stand o f over 500 should be designated under the Fire Precautions
 Act 1971 as premises requiring a fire certificate.

   3.35 The thresholds of 10,000 or of 500 are bound to be arbitrary and this is no more than an empirical
 approach. I have to exercise my judgment as best I can. It is an attempt to balance the expense of inspection
 against a reasonable degree of safety. It has to be remembered that the fire authority already have some
 control over non-designated sports grounds by virtue of Section 10(t)a of the Fire Precautions Act 1971.
 Similarly, local authorities have some control under Section 10(1) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
 1975.      •

   3.36 Some anxiety has been expressed about the additional expense which would be incurred by further
 designation and questions were raised about resource implications. However, the authorities have already
 done the inspections necessary to ascertain the problems in many of the grou n ds and substantially to
remedy them. Although further expense and time will be required if there is to be certification of all sports
grounds with accommodation for over 500 spectators in a stand, nevertheless some of the ground work
has already been done. The speed and efficiency with which the Fire Authorities have acted in carrying out
the inspections is much to be commended and should allow for the early implementation of further
designation.

   3.37 I have given consideration to the possibility of using the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975 in relation to non-designated sports grounds and sports stadia. As I have said, it may be argued
that it is more appropriate to use, if possible, the 1975 Act and have all sports ground and sports stadia
under one Act rather than to apply the provisions of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 or in relation to
structural safety, the Building Act 19S4 or the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974.

   3.38 An additional difficulty may arise if the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is amended in the near future
as a result of the proposals contained in the Consultative Document. Then the issue of a fire certificate
under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 could create an anomalous situation in respect of other sports grounds
or stadia which might be inspected after, any changes in the legislation. It would, of course, be for
consideration; as and when the suggestions in the Consultative Document are implemented, whether the
Stelf compliance scheme (as I have called it) would be sufficient to deal with the risk of fire at a sports
ground or stadium. I do not comment on that. It is not, of course, possible for me to anticipate w jA
legislation would be introduced or how the Act might emerge after debate. If, however, after debatCTt
appeared that the fire certification process could properly be replaced by the self compliance scheme in
relation to sports grounds or stadia, then no doubt you would-be advised that that was the proper course
to take.

  3.39 However, I have to deal with the position in relation to the non-designated grounds and stadia
now. I have to take account that at grounds or stadia not designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975 there may still be stands of the Bradford type; unless they are subject to adequate statutory
control in the immediate future unacceptable risks may remain. Thus it seems to me that, until the legislation
governing fire precautions has been amended or consolidated, my recommendation about designation under
the Fire Precautions Act 1971 o f sports grounds and stadia should be implemented.

   3.40 However, if it were possible under the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to
introduce some form of certification for those grounds and stadia not designated, it would be logical that
all sports grounds and stadia should be under the umbrella of that Act.

  3.41 By Section 15 of the 1975 Act, you “may by order direct that any of the provisions of this Act which
are not expressed to apply to sports grounds other than sports stadia, shall, subject to such exceptions,
adaptations and modifications as may be specified in the Order,, extend to classes of such sports grounds”.
The effect of that is that you may apply to sports grounds, the provisions of the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act 1975. In particular, you may apply those provisions relating to a safety certificate subject to s w |
exceptions, adaptations and modifications as you may specify in the Order. Thus, so far as non-designatea
sports grounds are concerned, it would be possible for you, by Order, to introduce a modified safety
procedure for those grounds relating to structural safety, crowd control and fire risk. This would have the
advantage of covering the risks inherent at a sports ground.

  3.42 However, there is a difficulty in that Section 15 may not govern non-designated sports stadia. So
that, if you were to proceed by an Order under Section 15, it might still leave the problem of sports stadia
which are not designated, because Section 15 only applies to sports grounds which are not sports stadia.

   3.43 It may, of course, be possible for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 to be so amended so as
to have all sports grounds and stadia under the umbrella of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. That
would make some sense.

   3.44 Additionally, it may be argued that by amending Section 1 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975, all stadia which are presently not designated (by reason of having accommodation for fewer than
10,000 spectators) could be subject to a certification process under the Act. However, this certification
process would have to be the full safety certification under the Act. There is no provision for a modified
certification procedure for stadia under the Act as appears possible for sports grounds under Section 15.1
have to consider the immediate problem, until the Act is amended, if it is. If it is thought that in the long
term an amendment is the most sensible method of approach, I have to say however that a designation
order under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 seems the only immediate step which can be taken to deal with
the fire risk now.

                                                     22
      3.45 Thus, while there are alternatives to the recommendations which I made in paragraph 3.34, they
    require amendment to Acts of Parliament, and until those amendments have been made, I am firmly of
    the view that my recommendation should obtain.

      3.46 Much "'the same point may be made about indoor sports facilities, as I shall explain below (see
    paragraphs 3.53—3.59).

    Structural safety of undesignated sports grounds and stadia
       3.47 I return to the question how best to ensure the structural safety of those grounds and stadia^not
    designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. It might be done by amending Section 15 of the
    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 as I have already indicated. Unless and until that is done, what are the
    alternatives? It appears that there are three authorities who have the power to deal with breaches of
    structural safety at undesignated sports grounds: the Health and Safety Executive (under Section 3 o t e
    Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974); a county council (under section 10 of the Safety of Sports
    Grounds Act 1975); and a district council (under Section 77 of the Building Act 1984).

       3.48 It is alsd clear that while these authorities have the power to enforce provisions of their respective
    Acts, they have no duty to inspect the premises to ascertain whether there have been any breaches. This
    difficulty was highlighted by the events at Bradford referred to in my Interim Report.

I     3.49 It is in my view essential that one authority, and only one authority, should have the responsibility
    for the structural safety of undesignated sports grounds and stadia. If not, there will not on y e a
    duplication of effort and waste of resources, but also a risk that no-one will in fact inspect these grounds
    and stadia.
       3.50 The necessary inspection must depend on the perception of risk, particularly having regard to other
     buildings within the jurisdiction of the particular authority. But a duty to inspect and ensure compliance
     with reasonable standards of safety is necessary.

       3.51 The next question is on whom this duty is to be imposed. The Health and Safety Exfec^ive are
     reluctant to intervene where there is already specific legislation (in this case the Safety o por s
     Act" 1975). They do not have the resources. Nor may they have quite the same expertise such as is readily
     available to a county council.
    3.52 Alternatively, the duty could be imposed on a county council or district council. This is a mat ter
  upon which I do not have the evidence to judge, except to observe only that the county c°unc>l a             y
  have a team who are expert in structural safety at sports grounds. On the other hand, I ^ t h a t m a n y o
  the powers of the Metropolitan Counties will shortly be transferred to M e t r o p o h t a n D.stnct Counals^
  Additionally, it is suggested in a Consultative Document published by the Health ^and
  -     “Draft proposals for revising the Health and Safety (E n fo rcm g Authority) Regulations 1977, hat som
I of the powers of the Health and Safety Executive should be transferred to the district council In theresult .
‘ this must be a matter for Ministerial decision but I recommend that o                n        e      £ "sft
  responsibility fo r securing structural safety at undesignated sports grounds and stadia. The potential cons
  quences of long term neglect in this area do not need to be highlighted by me.

     (iv) Indoor facilities in England and Wales
        3.53 In my Interim Report I was minded to recommend that d e s i g n a t i o n should be ^tended _to cover
     indoor facilities in England and Wales.1 A survey has been undertaken by           ie i                ^Most of
     premises (in Scotland 26 premises were surveyed) with an o v e r a l l spectator capacity o w JU JM , M c g r t
     the premises are used for more than one sporting activity, of which t e o owi g                      vollevball
     boxing, wrestling, judo, k a r a t e , gymnastics, athletics, football, tennis, basketb _ >        ’fencing and
      badminton, hockey, squash, weightlifting, billiards, snooker, darts, table tennis, go ,       ry,
      bowls as well as water, ice and equestrian sports.

         3.54 In England and Wales over 80% of the premises are licensed under the Local S fa a M tie s
      (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 or equivalent GLC legislation because one or              covered bv
      requires licensing. Numbers of sporting activities within these premises will not, however, b
      their licence against fire risk._____________________________________ ________ __________ ______
      1Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 5

                                                           23
 • i j        e .l^an         t^e remainder are subject to liquor licensing and/or other legislation which
 includes consideration of .the adequacy of fire safety measures, eg the Fire Precautions Act 1971, the
 Theatres Act 1968, the Cinemas Act 1985 and local legislation in relevant parts of the premises. In only
 five per cent of these premises does no fire safety legislation apply at any time.

  3.56 In 1983 there were around 200 fires in indoor sports premises in the United Kingdom. It appears
that at about half of these fires no-one was present at the time. In approximately 40 per cent of the total
cases the cause was suspected to have been malicious ignition or children playing with fire.

 _ 3.57 These figures reveal that there is a fire risk at indoor stadia. There is no evidence to suggest that
there is a crowd problem, nor that there is a problem of structural safety. Accordingly, it seems to me that
what is necessary for all indoor sports facilities with accommodation for more than 500 spectators is a fire
certificate under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. It may be in many cases that nothing further needs to be
done. In others, it may be necessary for the protection of the public that further steps should be taken.
  hat s®en?? .t0 me t0 balance the risk to the public with the expense to those responsible for the indoor
sports facilities and also to bring the control of the fire risk at these premises within a single Act. Accordingly,
I recommend that all indoor sports facilities with accommodation fo r over 500 spectators should require a fire
certificate under the Fire Precautions Act 1971.

   3.58 If, however, the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 or equivalent G lM ^
legislation were amended to include all sporting and recreational activities, then I am satisfied that the
necessary control in relation to fire precautions could be assured. Unless and until the Act has been
amended m that way, I repeat that these premises should be designated under the Fire Precautions Act
 1971 by Order and require a fire certificate.

(v) Indoor facilities in Scotland
   3.59 Fire precautions at indoor facilities in Scotland are governed by a number of different Acts. It is
by no means clear to me that all activities at indoor stadia in Scotland are presently covered by fire
regulations. Accordingly, / recommend an urgent review o f the existing legislation and i f there is such a gap,
indoor facilities in Scotland should be designated under the Fire Precautions Act 1971 and require a fire
certificate.

Section 10 and prohibition notices
   3.60 As I have indicated, I do not regard the proposals in the Consultative Document for what I call
self compliance as appropriate for premises covered by the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. There is,
however, an important proposal in the Consultative Document about prohibition notices which is highly
relevant to the application of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

  3.61 I had occasion, in my Interim Report (paragraph 3.60), to make some observations about the e ff^ tt
of Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971. This section seemed to me to be available only when there
was an immediate risk of a fire taking place. The Consultative Document deals with this in this way:
     “32 In circumstances where an inspection revealed the existence of abnormally serious risk it is important
     that the fire authority should have power to prohibit or restrict the use of the premises until the necessary
     remedial action has been taken. So far as England and Wales are concerned the power currently available
     for this purpose under section 10 of the 1971 Act has not been wholly effective. Some of the defects of
     Section 10 are:
        (a) because of pressure on Magistrates Courts there are sometimes delays in obtaining the hearing of
        applications and some Courts insist on prima facie evidence before granting a summons;
       (b) considerable documentation is involved in cases where there are a number of occupants since they ,
       must each be summoned;
       (c) it must be demonstrated that the dangerous condition exists at the time of the court hearing.
       Consequently Section 10 procedures are not easily applied to situations which can be manipulated by •*
       the occupier to frustrate proceedings. Examples are the storage of inflammable material in exit ways
       and dangerous overcrowding at night;
       (d) In the event of failure to comply with the court order the only sanction is to proceed under the
       law of contempt which does nothing to remove the hazard which gave rise to the original complaint
       to the court.”


                                                       24
  3.62 I made a provisional recommendation at paragraph 3.61 of my Interim Report that Section 10 of
the Fire Precautions Act 1971 should be amended so that the fire authority could go to court, not when
the risk was so serious, but when the risk was an ordinary one. I hoped that the power would be exercised
in cases other than those which were regarded as exceptional. Additionally, I was minded to recommend
that there should be power under Section 10 to apply for an injunction to the High Court or for an interdict
to the Court of Session in Scotland.1

 3.63 The Consultative Document (Paragraph 33) recommends a simpler method of approach and one
which seems to me to be sensible. It says:
      “33 It is therefore proposed that provision should be made for authorised officers of the fire authorities
      to have a power similar to that accorded to Health and Safety inspectors under Section 22 of The e a t
      and Safety at Work Etc Act 1974 to issue a Prohibition Notice. The 1974 Act procedures have the
      advantage of being simple to operate and, because no court hearing is involved, of achieving t e aim o
      restricting the use of premises with the least possible delay. Once issued, a prohibition notice has more
      impact than action under Section 10, and is evidence of the situation, which if continued or repea e ,
      could ^ead to immediate prosecution for failure to comply with the notice. As in the case of improvemen
      notices, there would need to be suitable appeal provisions. Like Section 10 of the 1971 Act, the power
      to issue restriction or prohibition orders extend to any premises falling within the general class o use
      from which a particular use could be designated.”

   3.64 Accordingly, I recommend that provision be made in the Fire Precautions Act 1971 fo r authorised
officers o f a fire authority to have power to issue a prohibition notice.

   3.65 A similar difficulty also arises in the application of Section 10 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975. As I explained in my Interim Report, under the terms of this provision a court has to be satisfied
that the danger is so great that immediate action has to be taken. There are thus difficulties or e
authorities who are responsible for enforcement in ensuring that some safety precaution is taken y a c u
where there is no immediate risk of danger. It may be that the t h r e a t of S e c t i o n 10 has, and willcontmue
to persuade clubs to do what is needed. However, it is clear that recently some local authorities have been
requiring clubs to carry out certain expensive precautions which the club, on professional a vice, o n
themselves regard as either being a problem, or as being an immediate problem. Thus                               *
conflict between local authorities and clubs, which may have an adverse effect on the sa y                     P°
grounds. In my Interim Report, at paragraph 3.76,1 was minded to make a
to Section 10 similar to m y recommendation on Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Ac                    •
me, however, that the introduction of the power t o issue a p r o h i b i t i o n notice similar to
 the Consultative Document on the 1971 Act would be a sensible provision and / recommend
 be made in the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 for authorised officers o f the local authority to haxe pover
 to issue a prohibition notice in relation to sports grounds and stadia.

 Revocation of certificates; reinspections
   3.66 Once a safety certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds A ctl975 has been ^ s^                    t^ e !^n°
 power for the local authority to revoke it. By Section 4(1) “the local author.* may, m my
 appears appropriate to them to do so - (a) amend the safety certificate by notice in writm* to its hoi                 ,
 (b) replace a safety certificate.” It would be possible for the local authority, if a club did
 an instruction, to amend the certificate so that the particular area o f * * 8 " ^                 t m a v htve
 limited. I do not believe that this section was intended to act like a prohibition orde ,       » ..     * ice
 that effect. It seems not, however, to have been used in that way. In addi on              p         authority
 powers should be given to the local authority to revoke the safety certificat .              f rev0cation But
 to amend a certificate to reduce the capacity, could have the same effectas the p o ^ e i ^ o f f
 this is a device. The right to revoke a certificate should be available to the local authority and a nght oi
 appeal should be available to the holder of a certificate.

    3 . 6 7 Another possibility would be to require that the s a f e t y certificate shall b.e. Jt^ w o u fa ^ v e th e \ocal
  would have two effects. It would ensure that there »s an annual inspection, secon y                                 , th
  authority added power if a club were dragging its feet in carrying out some ^'°rk whu*■ “                               ™
  local authority. Some local authorities have complained to me that wor w i                        m ^ h a t limited
  done as quickly or as efficiently as it should be, and that the effective sanctions are somewhat limited.------

                                                              25
    3.68 Nor is there any duty, under the Act, on the local authority to make a regular inspection. As a
  matter of practice it appears that some local authorities do make regular inspections. Representations have
  been made to me that in order to ensure that the provisions of the certificate are being carried out, there
  should be a statutory obligation to have an annual re-inspection. / therefore recommend ( I ) an annual
  renewal o f the certificate (2) a duty on the local authority annually to inspect the premises prior to re-issuing
  the certificate and (3) the power to revoke.

  Composition o f local authority team
    3.69 I have been generally impressed with how well the 1975 Act has operated in designated grounds.
  There have been some criticisms by the various members who make up the certificating team that their
  particular expertise has not been given the full recognition that it should. In any organisation, let alone
  several organisations, some difficulties are inevitable due to the personalities of those involved. But the
  teams for the most part have worked together well.

     3.70 The fire service have made representations to me about their position in the “team”. They rightly
  say that it is the local authority who issue the certificate. When the local authority receives a copy of an
  application for a safety certificate, it is to the chief officer of police and the building authority for the area
  in which it is situated that a copy of the application is sent. The local authority are obliged to consult then^fc
  about the conditions to be included in the certificate. There is no express requirement that the fire service^
  shall be similary consulted. They also point out that on the hearing of an appeal relative to the terms o f .
  the certificate, the local authority can be a party; so too can the-chief officer of police and the building
  authority and any other person who may be concerned in ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions
  of the safety certificate. But not the fire service as such. If there is an appeal against a court order made
  under Section 10, under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975, the local authority, the club, the chief
  officer of police and the building authority may be parties but again not the fire service as such.

     3.71 The powers of entry and inspection are given to persons authorised by the local authority, to the
   chief officer of police and to the building authority. Again the fire service do not have the same power
   unless it is delegated to them by the local authority.

       3.72 The fire service point out that though fire is one of the major risks at a sports ground, the fire
-• -serviceis not identified as having any particular role in the issue of the safety certificate or its enforcement;
    (I am dealing now with the position before the abolition of the Metropolitan Authorities). They complain
    that even if changes are made to permit a local authority to issue a prohibition notice under the provisions
    of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, they will be unable to do it on the spot. They suggest that it
    will be necessary for the solicitor to the local authority to be contacted, and that there are times when he
    may not be readily available to give the necessary authorisation for the prohibition notice to be issued.

     3.73 I am unconvinced by this argument, particularly so since the fire officers produced no evidence to ^1
  me as to any real problem during the years since the introduction of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
  1975. In the event that problems should arise in future because of the non-availability of the authorised
  local authority official, the matter can be speedily remedied by the local authority giving delegated powers
  to the chief fire officer.

    3.74 It was further pointed out when district councils are given the local authorities’ responsibilities in
  the Metropolitan County Council areas in 1986 there may be even more difficulties. I hope this is a »:eedlsss
  anxiety. The elected local authority is, in the end, the body responsible not only under the Act but to local
  people. It would be possible for the local authority to delegate to each discipline the power to issue a
  prohibition notice - that must be a decision of each local authority. At the moment I do not accept that
  there is any problem in practice.

    3.75 The fact that the Chief Fire Officer is not named as a party to the Act is said, albeit by only a
  minority among fire officers who spoke to me, to give rise to difficulties. It is argued that because o f their
  expertise the fire service should be in charge of issuing the certificate and in enforcing the provisions.

     3.76 It has to be pointed out that the fire service, important as it is, is but one arm o f the local authority,
  which includes the surveyor’s, architect’s, engineering and building and legal departments of the local
  authority. The reason that the Chief Officer of Police gets a special mention, and the Chief Fire Officer
  does not, is due to the constitutional position of Chief Constables and for no other reason. I find it difficult
  to believe that simply because the fire service does not get specific mention in the Act it should not be able

                                                          26
to work harmoniously with other sections of the local authority; nor do I believe that if it were mentioned,
greater harmony Would result. I do not believe that it should be given the leading role in the team. The
certification procedure is essentially a team exercise in which all the disciplines have to be consulted and
in which all have an equal part to play. I do not in any way underestimate the immense value of the fire
service but in my view the present system should continue. It would be a very unwise local authority which
did not obtain and take full account of the views of the fire service.

   3.77 The Society of Chief Building Regulation Officers also submitted evidence to me that its members
 should be responsible for the operation of the Act and that they are not, in fact, being consulted, on some
 occasions, as the Act requires.

   3.78 There is no doubt that the chief building regulation officers do have a very important role to play.
 Their duties include linked statutory controls over existing buildings in relation to the safety of users. They
 have responsibility for the enforcement of other legislation controlling safety in buildings which are licensed
 as places o f public entertainment or for public exhibitions or certain sporting contests. It is obvious t at
 they, individually and collectively, have a large amount of expertise relevant to safety at sports groun s.
 They may well hive as much expertise, or indeed more, than those who are part of the team at county
 level. They are physically closer to the actual grounds with which they are dealing.

    3.79 For reasons which no doubt appeared valid at the time they were not, however, given the task of
 leading the team, when the Act was passed. For my purpose it matters not what the reason was. The tact
 is that the present situation has now obtained for ten years and has been working satis acton y.            is,
 therefore, quite impossible now to start again, nor right for me to suggest that the chief building regulation
 officer of a district council should take over this function of the county council. Of course t e istnc
 council in the metropolitan areas will, from early 1986, be exercising the powers of the loca aut onties in
 respect of this Act previously exercised by county councils.

   3.80 The Society of Chief Building Regulation Officers has also suggested to me that the
 imposed upon the local authority under Section 3(3) of the Safety o f S p o r t s Grounds Act        w »_
 building authority, has not.in all circumstances b e e n complied with. One of the difficulties that has been
 pointed out to me is that because of the geographical distance between the building aut onty an
 authority, the level of consultation with the building authority may be less good t an wi             ® °. .
 interested parties. I should be unhappy to think that was so. I have no firm evidence that but in&
 are not fully consulted; but if it is necessary to emphasise the necessity for consultation, I am nappy so
 do..

  A model safety certificate
    3.SI I have seen a number of safety certificates. They vary enormously as to their detail. It would       be
\ useful if the local authorities could draw up a document which contains the conditions which m ost3e         y
  need to be included. They will have to avoid the danger of their model being treated as c° ^ in^             y
  minimal conditions or of a local authority treating the model as of universal app ication, ea gr            _
  different problems and a flexible approach is n e c e s s a r y . But guidance is needed, and^ 1
  Association o f Metropolitan Authorities, Association of County Councils and th«- onv n
  Local Authorities will be able to draw up a suitable model.

  The Green Guide
    3.82 I have been asked to review this document. I have had many representations asi to what shodd
  into it. It has to be a document which is sufficiently detailed not to be merely a blan.^ x p o sU ^ n
  precautions and at the same time it has to be flexible. Accordingly, I set up a
  distinguished m em bers under the chairmanship of Mr Killoran, my Fire Assessor, o
  or alterations are needed to be made.

     3.83 Their recommendations, which I accept and commend to you, are contamedinA^^^
   their names. I am grateful to them for giving up so much of their valuable t i m e f o r the s ^ e d and
   expertise which they brought to the task. I add below my own comments and emphasis on one o r tv o
   important matters connected with the Green Guide.

                                                         27
(i) Status o f the Green Guide
   3.84 I am satisfied that the Guide should continue to be voluntary and not form a statutory code; but it
is important that all those concerned with sports grounds should read and understand the contents, and
apply the lessons relevant to their own sports grounds.

   3.85 A number of officials of sports grounds I have visited have pointed out that the Green Guide has
in some cases little relevance to their particular sport. For instance, questions of a perimeter fence at a dog
or horse race are largely irrelevant. The Guide needs to be applied in a common-sense way.

(ii) The Use o f Timber in Stands
   3.86 In my Interim Report, paragraph 3.132,1 said I would like totally to prohibit permanent wooden
stands, including those made from combustible material. I recommended that the building of new permanent
stands of combustible material should be prohibited as a general rule1 and I pointed out that treatment
with fire retardant materials may not be effective. That recommendation was made on the advice of the
fire authorities to whom I had then spoken. I had not then consulted the timber trades. N ot unnaturally,
such a recommendation caused a certain degree of consternation in the timber trades, and representations
have been made to me that this sweeping recommendation should be reconsidered. In particular my
recommendation was taken to mean that no wood should be used in new stands.

   3.87 I have now had the opportunity to have a full discussion with the trade. I had, and have, no
 intention of banning all combustible materials from a stand. I was, however, anxious to reduce the fire risk
 as far as possible and it seemed evident that, the less combustible material in a stand, the less the fire
 hazard.

   3.88 It was urged on me that if proper exits were provided then the danger from combusitible cladding
 could be ignored. I believe it is important to deal with the risk of an outbreak of fire occurring by the
 provision of proper structural fire precautions, as well as providing an adequate number of exits for use in
 an emergency.

----3.89 On-11 November 1985 new Building Regulations came into force which covered, inter alia, stands
  at sports grounds. It was suggested that if a new stand were to be built in accordance with the Regulations,
  there could be no criticism.

   3.90 Unhappily, I have been advised that under the guidance issued in support of the new Building
 Regulations it would be possible, in certain circumstances, legally to build a Bradford-type stand. The
 Department of the Environment recognise the problem and are to give urgent consideration to altering the
 guidance on how to comply with the requirements. / recommend that they do so without delay.

   3.91 What then is to be done in the meanwhile? It is obviously possible to build a stand in combustible
• material which, because of its construction, will have a fire retarding effect, thus providing sufficient length
 of time to allow spectators to escape. Having regard to the general level of safety at sports grounds w h^h
 has been revealed since the Bradford fire I am not optimistic that anything more than minimum standards
 will be adopted by some clubs because of financial problems.

     3.92 I am anxious, therefore, about the possibility that some new single-storey stands lacking adequate
  structural fire precautions might be ba'.lt prior to any necessary amendments to the Building Regulations
  Guidance Codes. When they have been so revised conforming with them should be sufficient. Until then. I
  have to say that construction of a new stand with inadequate structural fire precautions constitutes a fire
  risk to which members of the public should not be exposed.

  (iii) Artificial Pitches
     3.93 Some concern has been expressed to me, in the light of greater use of artificial pitches, that there
  may be, in the circumstances of a fire such as occurred at B r a d f o r d , danger to the public from toxic furces
  if.the artificial pitch is exposed to too great a heat. I have not sufficient evidence upon which to pass aa\
  judgement. It is, however, a matter, which those who are concerned, namely the fire and football authon.:es.
  need to examine in close co-operation, to see whether there is, in fact, a problem, and if so to devise means
  by which such problem can be avoided. The Sports Council. I understand, have set up a Working Parr>
  ‘ Interim Report: Recom m endation 13.
with the assistance of the Fire Research Station to investigate the problem and hope to be able to report
in 1986.

(iv) Temporary Stands and Marquees
  3.94 In England and Wales and in Scotland there appears to be no general legislation governing the use
of temporary stands and marquees if they are only in existence for less than 28 days. Fears have been
expressed to me that the increasing use of these stands at golf matches and elsewhere gives some cause for
concern, both from the safety of the structure in the case of stands and the fire hazard in the case o f
marquees and stands.

   3.95 Hospitality tents which involve cooking facilities are now commonplace at sports grounds. Control
of their use needs, in my view, to be considerably stricter. Fire authorities to whom I have spoken are
concerned that, even when they are notified, it is sometimes not possible to be sure that a temporary stand
is safe because it may be erected in the morning for use in the afternoon. It is not then possible for them
physically to check their condition before the public are admitted.
               \
   3.961 therefore repeat the Recommendation in my Interim Report that consideration should be urgently
given to how best the question of temporary stands and marquees can be dealth with;1 at present they
undoubtedly constitute a risk to the public. I understand that there are plans for you to publish national
guidance for fire precautions in places of public entertainment including temporary structures and marquees.
I hope that this can be done quickly.

Variety of legislation
   3.97 It has already been noted that there is a variety of laws governing sports grounds and indoor sports
facilities and therefore there are different bodies with legal responsibilities. This is not likely to lead to
efficiency of enforcement. One anomaly appeared during the course of my Inquiry. If Wembley arena is
used for boxing it needs to be licensed because it is “entertainment” under the London Government Act
1963 but the same stadium used for the “Horse of the Year Show” does not. The result is that two quite
different standards of safety can be applied to the events in the same building.

  3.98 It is not possible always to eliminate anomalies in legislation which have grown up through a
piecemeal approach to a particular problem. The anomalies apply to both outdoor and indoor sports
grounds and stadia. In the long term they need consideration by the appropriate Government departments.




'Interim Report: Recommendation 18.
                                               CHAPTER 4

                                               Crowd control

Who is to deal with the problem?
  4.1 Everyone is agreed that there is no single answer to the problem of hooliganism at football grounds;
there are, however, a number of steps which can be taken by various bodies interested in football which
together may result in better control of the problem.

   4.2 Thus Parliament needs to ensure that the police have the necessary powers. The police need to ensure
that they identify and apprehend the law breaker and provide the proper evidence to secure a conviction.
Courts need to pass the appropriate sentences and without undue delay. Clubs need to ensure that their
grounds are physically safe, with reasonable facilities and staff properly trained to control those who are
invited into the grounds and to deal with any emergency. They should involve themselves in community
affairs. Managers need to ensure their players, by their behaviour on the field, do not incite the spectators.
Parents too a^e involved. They have a general responsibility for where their children go and what they do.

  4.3 The genuine law-abiding supporters, who are the vast majority, have an interest in ensuring the
peaceful result of a football game by helping to support those enforcing law and order. The football
authorities need to take a positive approach to football problems.

   4.4 Persons in authority cannot stop violence by condemning it: but one thing is certain, that failure to
condemn violence undoubtedly encourages it. Those who hold responsible positions, who encourage others
to commit violence by failing to condemn or worse by praising violence, have much to answer for.

  4.5 There is no typical football club. Among the league clubs in England, Wales and Scotland there are
wide differences in quality of management and in attitudes. They range from the very good to the indifferent.

   4.6 Every club has different problems. Each problem may need a different approach. Some clubs are
virtually trouble-free, both in relation to their own supporters and supporters from other clubs. Some clubs
may be trouble-free when they play at home but their supporters may cause trouble elsewhere. Some, a
very small minority, have troublesome supporters generally. No one method to combat hooliganism will
be successful on its own. What is needed is a recognition by all concerned, and particularly by football
clubs and the football authorities, that nothing less than a determined and imaginative attack on the
problem will save football.

   4.7 While football is the national game and enjoyed by millions, it has no natural entitlement to survival.
It is but one form of entertainment in a highly competitive world of entertainment. The public are voting
with their feet. Gates in the English League were down from 28 million ten years ago to 17 million last
year. This year, except in the Fourth Division, figures are again down. Those clubs who are currently at
the top of the League do not need reminding of other great names who once were regarded as the “greatest”
and who now languish in lower Divisions with large grounds, small crowds, large debts and faded memories.

   4.8 With 92 League clubs in England and Wales, it is not surprising that agreement on almost any
proposal for action is difficult to reach, or that the football authorities are regarded by some clubs as quite
ineffective. I do not see my role as laying down a blueprint for the survival of football. I am concerned
with safety only. But if football falters then safety will suffer. Like others before me I can only poin.' a
way. I can guarantee no success. But one thing is clear—those clubs which are unimaginative, weakly ied
or determined to live in the past will certainly go the way of the Dodo and the Brontosaurus.

4.9 Finally, it may be of interest to note the attitude of some football clubs in England and Wales. After-
the fire at Bradford and the riot at Birmingham a general invitation was issued by me to all those interested
in football to give me the benefit of their advice. This many did, and I was able to write my Interim Report
with the advantage of their views. I was also able to visit a number of clubs myself and I had useful
discussions with them.

   4.10    In the Interim Report I again invited those interested in the very difficult problems in football to
let me have their views. To make sure that I did, indeed, have the considered views of those most closely
affected by the problems and most experienced in the game, I wrote a personal letter in the following terms
iO all 92 football clubs in the English League:
      “ I am anxious to have the views of the Clubs about what steps can be taken or recommended to prevent
      the repetition of the events at Birmingham. I shall, of course, be getting t h e collective views Of the Clubs
      from the FA and Football League when I meet them again.
      I would also welcome any views of your Club about other aspects of my Inquiry. In addition, if jou
      would like to come and have a discussion with me I shall be happy to see you or any of your Board at
      your convenience.”
      Oliver Popplewell (sgd)

   4.11 I am glad to say-that a number of clubs helped me by giving me the benefit of their experience,
either in writing or by taking the time and trouble to come and talk to me—in some cases clubs have done
both. I also managed myself, together with my Assessors, to visit a number of clubs. I am very grateful to
them. Their views have been of immense value. I have, however, rather sadly to record that over 50 out o
the 92 League Clubs did not even take the trouble to acknowledge receipt of my personal letter.

 How can the problem be controlled?
   4.12 I turn to deal with the elements which combined are necessary for coping with the problem of
 hooliganism.

^A.. The Police
    4.13 I made it clear in my Interim Report that the state o f the premises and the conduct of the event
 therein is not the responsibility of the police. A club is a commercial organisation, which is run for profit,
 and its legal status is little different from that of the person who organises a pop concert a garden par y,
 or many other private events. Because, as a matter of practice, police officers have regularly attended m
 large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been assumed by the clubs that the responsibility tor
 control of what goes on inside the ground has passed from them to the police. A police presence is there
 to assist in the enforcement of law and order. Those responsible for organising a private fu n ctio n , however,
 have the primary and continuing obligation and responsibility to ensure reasonable safety for t ose w o
 are invited onto their premises.

  " 4 . 14 This responsibility,'which is a legal responsibility, continues throughout the tim e that those whom
 they have invited onto their ground remain there. It does not, for instance, cease when an emergency arises.

    4 15 The police’s responsibility is to preserve law and order. When an emergency arises they are likely
  to be the only body there capable of dealing with it. They have the facilities. They have the training. 1hey
  have the authority. As I said in my Interim Report, the police have to take the de facto responsibility ot
  organising the crowd with all that entails.
    4.16 This has given rise to a certain apprehension amongst police officers. W h a t a r e the resource
  implications? Does it require a police presence at a ground which hitherto has not hadone. Does it requi
  the presence at a ground, which presently has three or four constables, of a senior officer or more men
  case an emergency arises?
    4.17 It was never intended that my Recommendation that: “ Evacuation procedure should be a matter of
  police training and form part of the briefing by police officers before a football match should result n ii
  increase of resources or of a' greater presence by police officers at a ground. Their purpose     g
  to assist in the preservation of law and order.

     4.18 It is agreed generally that evacuation procedures, at major grounds at any rate, should be th^ s^ . ^ c_t
  of pre-planning, involving the club and its stewards, the local fire service (whose experience in
• is second to none) and the police. The nature and extent of police manning wi var>                   Hifferent
  Thus at a ground where there are only two or three police officers there w.U undoubtedl;y be aJ* 1"
  system from that which exists at a ground where there arc present 3Q0 officers in the charge of a ry
  officer.
     4.19 Thus, whilst it is important that the police should treat evacuation procedure as a, ^ t t e r for^training
   and briefing, they do that in order more readily to assist the owners of the private club to carr> out _h
   responsibilities, as they would any other private organisation in an emergency, an no s— ------- —
   'Interim Report: Recommendation 1.


                                                           31
legal responsibility resting upon the police. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club,
or the occupier of the ground who is putting on the function, that the primary and continuing obligation
rests.

(i) Stewards and Policing
  4.20 A number of clubs have been impressed by the presence of stewards from visiting clubs who look
after their own supporters. This is a practice which has much to commend it. One witness reported that at
Ostend a serious confrontation between the Belgian police and Liverpool supporters was defused by the
presence of Liverpool stewards.

  4.21 In some police forces it has been possible for one or two officers to travel with fans when they go
away and thus assist the “home police” in identifying trouble-makers. In other cases home stewards have
been able, at away matches, to stand at the home turnstile and ensure that their own supporters do not
infiltrate the opposition terraces.

  4.22 A number of clubs have shown me the handbooks which have been issued to their stewards. I have
seen also caflds issued to police officers with instructions as to their duties in the ground. The handbook
for Bristol Rovers, for instance, was written pursuant to the conditions of their Safety Certificate and was
approved by the police. It is a thoroughly comprehensive and sensible document dealing both with general
matters of stewarding and with the question of evacuation in the event of an emergency. It is to be hoped
that all other clubs will have done the same.

   4.23 In my Interim Report I recommended that the Green Guide should be amended to read: “All exit
gates should be manned at all times while the ground is used by the public and be capable of being opened
immediately from inside by anyone in an emergency.” 1 Leicester City Football Club have a system of exit
doors worked on a magnet system which are automatically controlled from a central office. Ipswich have
a similar sort of system. Understandably there is concern that if my Recommendation were applied to
them they would be required to have a steward at each gate and that this would vitiate the whole scheme.
It was not my intention that this Recommendation should apply to exits which are automatically controlled,
if these types of mechanisms are acceptable to the responsible local authorities.

(ii) Powers o f Search      -
  4.24 In my Interim Report I said that I was minded to recommend that, in England and Wales, the
police be given the unfettered right of search before entry into football grounds, by statute.2 I there set
out the problems relating to police powers of search which are contained in the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984 which comes into effect on 1 January 1986.

   4.25 The disquiet arose because, by Section 1(3) of the Act, a constable only has power to search a
 person or a vehicle, or anything in or on a vehicle, if he has reasonable grounds fo r suspecting that he will
find stolen or prohibited articles. A prohibited article includes an offensive weapon.

  . 4.26 The passage of the Bill through Parliament gave rise to considerable controversy about the extent
and nature of police powers. On the one hand there were those who expressed disquiet about what were
called colloquially the “sus laws” and those who wanted to give the police a more effective weapon against
crime. It is not part of my function to comment on the arguments nor on the result. Nor do I wish to
make any observation about the Act, save in relation to sports grounds (and particularly football grounds)
with which I am concerned. The wider implications are not for me to consider.

   4.27    Football grounds are in their way unique in that they are a regular place for very large numbers of
people to meet. Some of those who attend football do so intending to cause trouble. Every Saturday, for
about three-quarters of the year, about half a million people go to football matches. Thus football is
different in kind, nature and purpose from any other activity of the community.
  4.25 The “reasonable ground for suspicion” safeguard in the Act, which is there for the general protection
of citizens as they go about their ordinary business, needs to be reconsidered in the light of what actually
happens at football grounds.
  4.29   The effect o f the “reasonable ground for suspicion” clause is that anyone can go into a football
ground carrying a weapon without fear of detection or search by simply carrying it in his pocket. There is
'Interim Report: Recommendation I t.
’Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 1.
nothing thereby to give a constable reasonable ground for suspecting that he will find an offensive weapon.
No one wishes to see a situation in which it is possible for a large number of people to be at a football
ground in possession of offensive weapons. If there is, as I believe there is, a determination by all responsible
members of the public to seek ways to remove violence at football grounds, any measures which assist in
that task need to be considered*

  4.30 The difficulty which arises at present is this: 5,000 fans seek to enter a football ground. Experience
shows that some will be carrying an offensive weapon. A police officer has no special method of detecting
which of those 5,000 is carrying an offensive weapon. He may reasonably suspect that some, or many, will
be doing so. He cannot individually identify those persons. Thus he is not empowered by the Act to search
that person, either before or after entry.

   4.31 I have observed police searching visiting fans on a number of occasions. They were light-hearted
affairs to which no one appeared to take objection. They were speedily done. No one was asked for their
consent. It has been put to me that if there is a general search there is less likely to be trouble than if a
single person is picked out and wants to know why he has been individually selected.

  4.32 What then is to be done? I believe a football ground should be treated as a special case. So far as
searching people entering the ground is concerned, it has been suggested that it can be made a condition
of entry that they agree to be searched. Thus, it is said that anyone who is inside the ground is deemed to
consent. Therefore the search by a police officer is not a search under the provisions of the Police and
Criminal Evidence Act 1984 but is contractually agreed to by reason of an arrangement made between the
football club and the spectator. This is an arrangement which can be properly made. It takes it outside the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Of course it only applies after the spectator enters the ground,
because the contract is made as he enters the ground. But at many grounds there are physical problems
about searching within the ground. Thus that solution is not really a practical one.

   4.33 What then about searching a spectator before he enters the ground? It is suggested that the limitations
of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 do not apply if a policeman says, in effect, to a spectator:
“I propose to search you” . If the spectator says nothing, or agrees, then because it is a voluntary search
the policeman need not have reasonable grounds for suspicion under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
 1984. If the spectator does object, then the police officer says to him: “ I cannot therefore search you, but
you will not be allowed into the ground” . He then will go and report that fact to the operator of the
turnstile, who will decline to admit the spectator.

  4.34 This allows a police officer to search by a method outside the provisions of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984.

  4.35 Unless a search is made lawfully by agreement or under the provisions of the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984 it constitutes an assault. But if a spectator agrees to be searched, a police officer is not
guilty of an assault. There are, however, a number of problems. Firstly, the police, on the occasions I have
witnessed, invariably search without any sort of discussion. Is Silence by the spectator consent? If the
consent is obtained by the threat of refusal of entry, is it consent? And finally, at what age can consent be
given by a spectator? If it is not until 16 or 18 years of age then the proposed system is of little value.

  4.36 It is not my task to give a definitive ruling on these matters; but the disquiet which has been
expressed by the police leads me to suggest that if the present practice of searching those who enter a
football ground is to be allowed to continue, it should be carried on in circumstances where the practice is
clearly legally based.
    4.37 It has, I think, to be recognised that a football match is an occasion outside the ordinary run of
 normal activity of the community. Accordingly, there is no reason why there should not be specific
 provisions relating to activities at football matches. This is the case with the Sporting Events (Control of
 Alcohol etc) Act 1985. It has been recognised to be wrong to give the police a general power of search m
 all circumstances. But I am absolutely satisfied that the control of hooliganism at a football ground could
 be seriously hampered by the inability of the police lawfully to search at random those entering the ground.

   4.38 / recommend, therefore, that in England and Wales the unfettered right to search those who are either
 entering or trying to enter a football ground should be conferred by statute. In Scotland there are divide
 views. Consideration should be given as to whether this Recommendation should be extended to Scotland.
 The Scottish police do not as a matter of practice search before entry as the police in England and Wales

                                                        33
 do. It may be that because of their “breach of the peace" offence (see Paragraphs 4.68-4:70 below) they
 have found that fans dump weapons and other undesirable items, including alcohol, outside the stadium
 before they enter without the necessity for searching. There is no doubt that the knowledge that there is
 to be a search has proved to be a deterrent to bringing into the ground these undesirable items.

   4.39 A similar problem arises out of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985. That Act
 was designed, among other things, to prevent those entering sports grounds from taking alcohol in with
 them. By Section 7(2) “ a constable may search a person he has reasonable grounds to suspect is committing
 or has committed an offenceunder this Act and may arrest such a person.” While the police officer obviously
 has reasonable suspicion for looking inside a bag which plainly contains bottles, or bears the name of some
 well known supermarket, those whose ingenuity is greater will not be subject to suspicion if they bring a
 bottle or cans in an inside pocket of a heavy overcoat. Thus the clear intention of Parliament is flouted.

    4.40 An additional problem has been drawn to my attention in relation to the searching of vehicles on
 suspicion of carrying alcohol. By Section 7(3) the police have power to search vehicles being used for the
 principal purpose of carrying passengers for the whole or part of a journey to or from a designated sporting
 event on reasonable suspicion. The Act, however, does not cover all vehicles but only public service vehicles
 or railway pa%senger vehicles.

    4.41 The problem of control, which has arisen, is that a large number of trouble-makers now no longer
 go by public transport. They do not wish to be organised or disciplined, and choose to go in their own or
 hired vehicles. Minibuses are favoured but they are by no means the only type of vehicle used. In some
 cases, the trouble-makers carry with them a large quantity of drink which they consume before they get to
 the ground. They may even intend to smuggle drink into the ground. There is presently no power to search
 such vehicles for alcohol, whether or not there is reasonable suspicion. The right to search these vehicles
 gives rise to a number of very difficult questions, but you should be aware of the problem.

 (iii) Offences
    4.42 There is general agreement among the police officers to whom I have spoken that their powers to
 deal with the more serious specific criminal offences are adequate. These include assault, wounding, actual
 bodily harm, assault on the police, obstructing the police, criminal damage and possessing offensive
_>£apons.In addition, the Law Commission has recently made a number of recommendations about offences
 relating to public order (Law Commission 123) which appear in your Review of Public Order Law (Cmnd
 9510).

    4.43 The recommendations of the Law Commission do not, however, deal specifically with other
 unacceptable forms of behaviour at sports grounds which have come to my notice, namely the throwing
 uf missiles, running onto the pitch and obscene and racialist chanting. They are less serious in the sense
 that throwing a missile is not as important as an offence of riot. On the other hand, it is quite obvious that
 throwing a missile at a football match often triggers disorder. It is the inability to prevent or check that
 trigger which leads to greater disorder. Just as a bucket of water might extinguish a fire, if detected in time,
so the ability to deal with the first sign of trouble on the terraces is likely to have a beneficial effect. It is
no comfort to be able eventually to punish those who engage in a full-scale riot, if the riot could be
prevented at a much earlier stage, by stopping those guilty of missile throwing or other disorderly conduct
just as soon as they begin. Should they be specific offences or can they be dealt with by an offence of breach
of the peace or disorderly conduct?

   4.44 It is acknowledged that the mood of a football crowd can be very volatile because of the nature of
the game, the excitement the game engenders and the behaviour of the spectators. The margin between
order and disorder at a football match is very narrow and it does not require very much to turn an exciting
but peaceful afternoon into a scene of grave disorder. The balance is a fine one and can be upset by what
would be regarded elsewhere as a trivial incident. Thus disorderly conduct which would pass as unremarkable
in everyday life takes on a new significance in the context of a football match.

(a) Throwing o f Missiles anil Running on to the Pitch
   4.45 The first question to be asked is whether either should be an offence at all. Nearly everyone is agreed
that throwing a missile at a football ground should constitute an offence. So far as running onto the pitch
is concerned there are divided views. Those who are against it say, quite rightly, that a properly organised
stadium will have perimeter fences which will prevent people from running onto the pitch; therefore those
who run onto the pitch may only do so because they want to escape from danger on the terraces. They

                                                       34
may also run onto the pitch at the end of play in excitement, but do no harm to anybody. If there is a
specific offence and it is not enforced, this brings the law into disrepute. Indeed, it may be very difficult to
enforce if a substantial number of people run onto the pitch. There is also the difficulty of drafting an
offence so as to exclude the person who legitimately comes onto the pitch.

   4.46 The contrary argument is that if there is an offence of running onto the pitch people will not do it.
In Scotland, where the breach of the peace offence seems to me to be effective, large football grounds do
not have pitch perimeter fences as a general rule. The-fact that it may be difficult to arrest all those who
come onto the pitch does not mean that those who do and can be arrested should not be arrested. Those
who come onto the pitch for a proper reason are unlikely to be arrested. The offence canvassed would give
the police power immediately to deal >vith an offence and thus prevent more serious trouble. Sometimes
running on the pitch is done specifically to stop the game, sometimes to make a protest, sometimes to
exchange pleasantries with the referee or umpire or to congratulate a player on scoring a hundred runs. In
all cases it is likely to lead to further disorder.

  4.47 I am clearly of the view that running onto the pitch without good reason and missile throwing
should constitute offences. The police should have the power to arrest such offenders. It is often the start
of disorder. It should be stopped at the earliest possible moment. I shall need to consider whether these
should be specific offences or can be dealt with by an offence of disorderly conduct or breach of the peace.

(b) Chanting Obscene or Racialist Abuse at a Sports Ground
   4.48 One of the Provisional Recommendations in my Interim Report was that consideration should be
given to creating a specific offence of chanting obscene or racialist abuse at a sports ground.1 Nearly
everyone who has given oral evidence or submitted written evidence is equally of the view that this is a
very disagreeable feature of crowd behaviour at some football matches and indeed at other sports grounds.
I can support that view from my own observations on the terraces. The terraces are certainly no place for
the prudish or fainthearted. There are, however, divided views as to the practicability or otherwise of
enforcing this as an offence,

  4.49 The contrary view is that if a very large crowd chooses to make disagreeable observations about a
player such an offence would be difficult for the police to enforce. If it is not enforced the law is brought
into disrepute. It upsets those against whom the chants are aimed if it is an offence which is not enforced.
There is the further view that bad language has always been part of the football scene. It is a man’s game
and thus language which would be objectionable in more polite society is the norm on the football terraces.
Finally, it is said that it really is not possible to legislate for every disagreeable piece of behaviour.

   4.50 Those who favour some legislation, point out that a lot of people who attend sports grounds have
what would be a pleasant and agreeable afternoon totally ruined by constant foul language from those
around them. But while it may not always be possible to detect all those who behave in this way, if it is
occurring, a police officer should have the power to stop it. The very fact that there is legislation may of
itself persuade people to refrain from indulging in action which may not only upset other spectators but
may also encourage potential hooligans to act in a disorderly way.

   4.51 There are, of course, immense difficulties in drafting suitable legislation. Booing a player because
of the colour of his skin is disagreeable and distressing; however, it would be quite impossible to make it a
criminal offence to boo the referee^ or a player on the opposing side simply because he was on the opposing
side. That is not to say that it is a habit which contributes anything to the well-being of the game, any
more than the booing of the opposition’s national anthem at an international match or the kicker of a
penalty at a rugby union match. However, it is not possible always to legislate for bad manners. Additionally,
there is the very real difficulty of enforcement.

  4.52 The fact that there is some legislation governing foul language and racialist abuse at football matches
may have the effect of reducing the incidence and effect of it. On balance I believe that consideration should
he given to drafting some appropriate legislation in order to prevent it, either as a specific offence or
included in the offences of disorderly conduct or breach of the peace.

  4.53 I note that a number of clubs have as part of their ground regulations provision for precisely this
type of offence. For instance, Bristol Rovers’ Football Club Regulations read:                         -
 ‘Interim Report: Provisional Recommendation 8
     “The Club reserves the right to prosecute or to eject or cause to be ejected any person who within the
     Club premises is considered by the Club, its employees or agents (hereinafter called ‘the Club’) to their
     absolute discretion to be or have been behaving in any of the following ways:
         (i)   entering upon the field of play during the course of a game
        (ii)   using obscene language or swearing
       (iii)   making vulgar gestures
       (iv)    using terms of racial abuse
        (v)    taunting opposing team supporters
       (vi)    entering areas of the terraces designed for use by opposing team supporters.
     The Club may, in its absolute discretion, bar from entry to the Ground, for any period up to FIVE
     YEARS, any person prosecuted or ejected in accordance with this Regulation and may take such steps,
     including informing the parents or guardians of the person concerned, necessary or desirable for the
     implementation of this bar.”

   4.54 The naxt question which arises is whether the present legislation or amendments to the legislation
proposed by the Law Commission or by the Review of Public Order Law are sufficient to cover either of
the three canvassed offences of missile throwing, running onto the pitch or chanting obscene or racialist
abuse. In 1936 the Public Order Act was enacted. It was introduced following the public disorders involving
the Black Shirts in the East End of London. Section 5 of the Act reads as follows: “Any person who in any
public place . . . uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to provoke a breach of
the peace or whereby a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned; shall; be guilty of an offence.” Thus it
js not enough to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour—an intent to cause a breach of
the peace or the likelihood of a breach of the peace occurring has to be proved.

   4.55 So far as missile throwing is concerned, if it can be proved that a missile hit somebody, then the
offence of assault is committed. But throwing a missile in a football ground is conduct which ought to be
stopped. It is the trigger for disorder. It is difficult to think of a legitimate reason for throwing a missile at
a sports ground. It is often impossible to show where the missile landed, particularly when some of the
missiles which are commonly used are coins of the realm. Section 5 is often inapplicable because it may
not be possible to show that the behaviour was intended to provoke a breach of the peace. It is even more
difficult to show that a breach of the peace is likely to be occasioned when it may be impossible to
demonstrate where a missile fell. The offence of possessing an offensive weapon may not cover this problem.

   4.56 Likewise, running onto the pitch or chanting obscene or racialist abuse at a sports ground of itself
is unlikely to be covered by the provisions of Section 5. The Law Commission points out that Section 5
may not cover intimidatory conduct if the victim is, for example, a policeman or an old lady because they
are not likely to be provoked into violence by the defendant’s behaviour.

   4.57 The limit of Section 5 is further shown by the case of Cozens against Brutus 1973 AC 854: during
an international tennis match the appellant went onto the court and disrupted the game. He was charged
under Section 5. It was held that his conduct did not come within the terms of the Section. Lord Reed
said: “Parliament had to solve the difficult question of how far freedom of speech or behaviour must be limited
in the general public interest. It would be going much too far to prohibit all speech or conduct likely to occasion
a breach of the peace because determined opponents may not shrink from at least threatening a breach of the
peace in order to silence a speaker whose views they detest. Therefore vigorous and it may be distasteful or
unmannerly speech or behaviour is permitted so long as it does uot go beyond any one of the three limits. It
must not be threatening, it must not be abusive, it must not be insulting. I see no reason why any of these
should be construed as having a specially wide or specially narrow meaning. They are all limits easily
recognisable by the ordinary man. Free speech is not impaired by ruling them out. Before a man can be
convictcd it must be clearly shown that one or more of them have been disregarded.”

  4.58 It is also clear that on occasions magistrates have taken the view that, having regard to the
background of the Public Order Act, Section 5 is inappropriate for minor acts of hooliganism. In your
Review of Public Order Law, at paragraph 3.24, there appears: “The police have sometimes been reluctant
to use section 5 of the 1936 Act to deal with minor acts of hooliganism. They do not wish to over-react to
such incidents by charging too serious an offence with a disproportionately high maximum penalty and the
courts have on occasion deprecated the use of section 5 in cases where it was doubtful whether the conduct in
question amounted to “threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour”.”
    4.59 Accordingly, your Review of Public Order Law proposes an amendment to Section 5 of the Public
  Order Act 1936 so that it reads: “Any person who whether in a public or private place, uses threatening,
  abusive dr insulting words or behaviour which is intended or likely—(a) to cause another person to fear
  unlawful violence or (b) to provoke the use of unlawful violence by another shall be guilty of an offence.”
  (paragraph'3.7).

    4.60 This revised offence clearly will not cover running onto the pitch nor chanting obscene or racialist
  abuse. It was, however, hoped that it would cover missile throwing. Your Review says, at paragraph 3.12:
  “Missile throwing: Under the Law Commission’s proposals, unlawful violence will include violent conduct
  towards property as well as towards persons, and will not be restricted to conduct causing or intending to
  cause injury or damage” . . . In one respect the Law Commission’s definition of unlawful violence may prove
  particularly useful: the police have suggested that at football matches and on similar occasions, it can
  sometimes be difficult to find appropriate offences with which to charge those picking up and throwing
  missiles in circumstances where the injury or damage caused by particular missiles cannot be identified.
  The Law Commission gives as an example of unlawful violence: “ throwing at or towards a person a missile
  of a kind capable of causing injury which does not hit or fall short” .

    4.61 This, says the Review* should remove evidential difficulties related to intent or recklessness; and in
  cases of group violence the police should be able to charge missile throwers with violent disorder, thus
  exposing them to a maximum penalty on indictment of five years imprisonment.

    4.62 This proposed amendment in my view may still leave a gap in the legislation. Somebody who throws
  a missile may not intend to cause another person to fear unlawful violence? he may be seen simply to be
  throwing a missile and it may not be possible to say where it went or what it was aimed at. It will often
  not be possible to show that it is likely to cause another person to fear unlawful violence because it is not
  known where it lands. It may also require the evidence of another person to say that he feared unlawful
  violence. It seems to me that there is very real difficulty in applying Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936,
  even as amended, to a missile thrower at a football ground where the evidence is merely of a fan throwing
  something.

     4.63 If, as I believe, there is a gap in the legislation and missile throwing, running onto the pitch and
.. chanting .obscene or racialist abuse at sports grounds are not covered by the present or by the proposed
   legislation, what then is to be done?                                                 _

     4.64 The Review of Public Order Law, paragraph 3.25, recognizes the problem of dealing with those
  who create a disturbance. It reads as follows: “Even if it amounts to threatening, abusive or insulting
  behaviour, disorderly conduct of this sort may not be caught by section 5 at present because it may not be
  intended, or likely to occasion a breach of the peace; or when the section is amended, because It may not be
  likely to cause fear of violence to people or property. This may be because the fear engendered is not directed
  to any specific result likely to follow from the conduct but instead consists of a more general state of anxiety
  or alarm. Alternatively the apprehension may be directed at a consequence of this behaviour, such as a
  stampede by a crowd or an accident being caused by the articles used to blockade an entrance, which is not in
  itself unlawful violence. But behaviour of this kind does constitute a real nuisance to the public which would
  seem to justify invoking the protection of the criminal law.” In order to deal with it the Review suggests a
  new offence. At paragraph 3.26 it says: “The main elements of a new offence intended to cover disorderly
  conduct which falls outside the scope of section 5 as amended might be as follows: (a) threatening, abusive,
  insulting or disorderly words or behaviour in or within view of a public place; (b) which causes substantial
  alarm, harassment or distress.

    4.65 The addition of the clause “ which causes substantial alarm, harassment or distress” has apparently
  been inserted in order to provide a safeguard so that merely to be annoyed or disturbed will not suffice.
  The legislation is designed, according to the Review, to protect the weak and vulnerable, and therefore the
  proposed definition requires evidence that the victim suffered substantial alarm, harassment, or distress.

    4.66 No one would want to criticise that as a proposal covering the sort of behaviour which your Review
  had in mind; namely groups of youths persistently shouting abuse and obscenities, or pestering people
  waiting to catch public transport, or to enter a hall or cinema, or rowdy behaviour in the streets late at
  nsglu which alarms local residents.

   4.67 Unfortunately it is insufficient for the unacceptable behaviour with which I am concerned at football
  watches. Somebody running onto the pitch does not substantially alarm, harass or distress anyone, but it
is often the trigger for disorder. Somebody throwing a missile or chanting obscenities does not necessarily
cause substantial alarm, harassment or distress. Spectators on occasions start shaking a perimeter fence in
concert as a preliminary to breaking it down. But under the proposals of the White Paper, because this
would not cause substantial alarm, harassment or distress it would not amount to an offence.

  4.68 The matter is dealt with efficiently in Scotland by the common law offence of “breach of the peace \
This covers a very wide range of circumstances. Originally constituted to cover the situation when one or
more persons conducted themselves in riotous or disorderly manner to the alarm and annoyance or
disturbance of the lieges, it has now been extended to cover those who provoke a disturbance. The offence
may be committed in a public or private place and although evidence of alarm is normally produced such
evidence is not essential.

  4.69 There is a wide interpretation placed on the type and nature of disorder which may amount to a
breach o f the peace. It has been common practice for the police in Scotland to use the offence for such
behaviour as chanting obscene or abusive slogans, running onto the pitch, throwing objects at spectators
or onto the pitch, climbing flood-light pylons and assaulting or attempting to assault spectators or players.
             -«■

  4.70 The list is not exhaustive and police bring a charge of breach of the peace in circumstances of
disorder at a football match. The use of this charge has been of great value in Scotland in dealing with a
wide range of unacceptable conduct at a football match. Actual violence or disorder does not need to have
occurred, nor is it necessary for a complaint to be received about the actions of the individuals before the
police can intervene. Power of arrest is without warrant and the offences -are normally dealt with within
the minor courts although in very serious cases they can become an indictable offence triable in the Sheriff
court or the High Court.

   4.71 I have paid three visits to Scotland and have spoken to the football and police authorities. I have
also observed, for example, how well the crowd behaved at a Celtic/Rangers match where there was no
perimeter fencing. The offence of breach of the peace is widely regarded as a very successful preventive
measure. It is a common law power. It is not difficult to recognise at a football ground somebody who is
disturbing the peace at that football ground.

   4.72 At present there is statutory provision in England and Wales for binding over a person for breach
of the peace pursuant to the Justice of the Peace Act 1361. He is brought before the court and bound over
to keep the peace or to be of good behaviour, but the preventive nature of the bind over means that no
immediate penalty can be imposed. Thus in England and Wales binding over for breach of the peace which
is appropriate for “peeping tom” cases is wholly inappropriate for football-related offences.

   4.73 As an alternative to the introduction of an offence of breach of the peace in England and Wales,
similar to the Scottish offence, the offence of disorderly conduct which the Review of Public Order Law
proposes should be considered applicable in the context of a football ground, but without the clause ‘ which
causes substantial alarm, harassment or distress.” It is argued that disorderly conduct ought to be defined.
But nobody finds it necessary to define it in the well-known offence of being drunk and disorderly. There
is no reason why somebody who is sober but disorderly should not be equally guilty of an offence. In
paragraph 3.24 of your Review of Public Order Law there appears “If a person who causes this type of
disturbance is drunk, he may be charged with the offence of being drunk and disorderly; but there is no
corresponding offence to cover similar conduct by a person who is not drunk even though the nuisance caused
is no less, and may be thoughtmore culpable in someone who is sober.”

    4.74 Quite clearly a new offence in England and Wales of disorderly conduct or breach of the peace on
 the lines of the Scottish common law offence, would be of substantial assistance in dealing with hooliganism.
 It would avoid the problem of trying to define all the different types of behaviour which give rise to disorder
 at football matches and would undoubtedly enable the police to take action much earlier than they can
 under the present law. This offence should be confined to sports grounds where the disorderly conduct is
 likely to have such a devastating effect on crowd safety. Disorderly conduct would clearly include throwing
 a missile, running onto the pitch, seeking to climb over dr to pull down a perimeter fence, shining a mirror
 towards a batsman, throwing bottles or cans onto the field of play, or interfering with a greyhound or
 horse race. I suggest that it should be triable summarily and there should be a power of arrest. I recommend,
 therefore, that consideration should be given to creating an offence o f disorderly conduct at a sports ground.

   4.75 I make these suggestions about legislation with some diffidence, because I am conscious that it is
 for the Legislature to make the laws and for the Judiciary to interpret them. I am naturally anxious not to

                                                       38
trespass on Parliament’s function. But as these matters have been fully canvassed in evidence before me I
hope I may be forgiven for expressing my own views,

(iv) Powers o f Arrest
  4.76 I made a Provisional Recommendation in my Interim Report that the police should be given the
power to arrest a hooligan subsequent to the offence under Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1936.' At
present he can only arrest when the hooligan is actually committing the offence. If he is subsequently
identified on Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) there is no power under the Public Order Act 1936 to arrest
him. I do not believe that Section 24 (5) and Section 25 ( 1) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
cover the matter. With the proposed future use of CCTV it is important that this gap in police power
should be closed and the .power to arrest be given even in amended legislation. I recommend that the power
to arrest under Section 5 o f the Public Order Act 1936 should be widened.

(v) Alcohol
   4.77 Alcohol plays a part in some of the outbreaks of violence which occur at sports grounds. Even if
it does not give Vise to violence, it gives rise to disorderly behaviour; if fans could be prevented from coming
into the ground without having drunk excessive quantities of alcohol, there can be no doubt but that the
standards of behaviour would improve. To ban a fan from physically bringing drink into the ground, and
from obtaining a drink when in the ground, does not unfortunately prevent him from coming into the
ground with drink inside him.

  4.78 The introduction of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 has been generally
welcomed, subject to two reservations; firstly, whether drink should be available at all in the ground and
secondly, whether there should be an automatic exclusion of alcohol from boxes within view of the ground.

  4.79 In my Interim Report I observed (paragraph 6.17) that by reason of the introduction of the Sporting
Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985, the question of spectators being able to obtain drink in the
ground was no longer a problem for me to consider. Nevertheless there was, and still is, a considerable
divergence of opinion about the question of spectators being able to obtain drink in the ground and of the
extent, if any, to which it should be available. Considerable feeling also has been expressed to me about
preventing people in private boxes, who have paid substantial sums of money for the privilege (and who
contribute nothing to hooliganism) from obtaining drink in those boxes, while drink may be available to
those who go onto the terraces, albeit not in the sight of the field of play.

  '4.80 The effect of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 is to allow the Magistrates, on
application by a club, and after hearing evidence from any objectors (usually the police) to decide whether
any part of the premises shall be licensed to sell drink. By Section 3(3) “ an order under this section shall
not apply to any part of the premises from which designated sporting events, at the designated sports groun ,
may be directly viewed.”

   4.81 Thus a bar beneath a terrace; at which a notional hooligan can obtain drink, may be licensed; but
 the Directors’ Box which is so placed that the event may be directly viewed from it, may not.

   4.82 Each Licensing Bench is perfectly entitled to adopt whatever view it feels in its judicial wisdom is
 proper in respect of a particular licence sought. The Act was intended to bestow upon the Licensing ustices
 a complete discretion. Some criticism has been made that in some way the exercise of that discretion ma es
 a loop-hole through the Act. It does not, because it was always intended that magistrates should have e
 discretion.
   4.83 There is a division of views as to whether drink available in the ground contributes in anyway to
 hooliganism. Those who contend that it does point out that if it is not available, however muc as e®n
 drunk before the game starts, there will be at least a \\h o u r period of drying out; nor will there have been
 an opportunity to top up; the peak moment of potential violence is often when the opposing . ans me
 after the game, by which time it may well be two hours since the potential hooligan last had his dnnK.
 Thus there is some measure of protection by forbidding it in the ground altogether.

   4.84 Those who favour allowing drink to be sold on the ground, certainly before the game starts, point
 to the fact that if there is no drink available in the ground, those who want to drink simp y go in o— e
 1Imerim Report: Provisional Recommendation 7
nearest public house. If that has been closed, they will go to the nearest supermarket and fill themselves as
full as they can right until kick-off time. Thus the potential hooligan arrives at the ground, full of
considerably more drink than he would otherwise consume; more particularly because he has spent the
time up to the kick-off drinking in a bar. He arrives late, and that of itself may cause disorder because
once a game starts, fans who are not able to see the game are likely to become agitated. It is further pointed
out that at most sports grounds the service is such that, having regard to the number of people present, it
is often very difficult to get more than one drink. It is concluded that spectators should be encouraged to
come early into the ground, thus avoiding the twin difficulty of consuming quantities of drink and of
arriving late.

  4.85 No doubt the purposes of the Section which prevents drink being obtained in any part of the
premises from which the sporting event may be directly viewed, was to prevent it being too readily available
to spectators, and also to prevent containers being used as missiles. Football clubs have, however, pointed
out that users of private boxes, who provide a substantial part of their revenue, contribute nothing to the
problem of crowd control, and that it is wholly illogical that they should be prevented from having drink
while watching the match. But one argument is that if drink is forbidden elsewhere at a ground it may, in
some way, be provocative to a crowd standing on the terraces to see other people able to obtain drink in
a private box. It is an argument unconnected with the fight against hooliganism and wholly irrelevant to
the purpose of the Act. Nor is the difference between an alcoholic and non-alcohofic drink in a box easily
discerned from the terraces.                                                                            ^

   4.86 The effect of the Act in relation to income for a number of clubs has been little short of disastrous.
It has been particularly so in some of the most forward looking clubs who have spent a great deal of money
in providing better facilities for their spectators, which should be encouraged. It is now clear that a good
deal of expensive improvement works at football clubs can only be supported if boxes'of one sort or
another are operating. It is now too late to suggest that the provision of business and dining facilities has
no part in the football world. It is now part of business. And business is needed to support football.
Families, too, are using these facilities and their support is essential to a well run club and needs to be
encouraged.

  4.87 At Manchester United, for instance, there are a number of bars which are used, and from which
the football can be viewed. They are behind glass windows. Thus there can be no element of hooliganism
involved. To use them it is necessary to be a member of a club and membership is not inexpensive. In
addition, there are provided dining facilities from which the diner is able to view the game. It is still possible
for the diner to view the game, but he is not able to have an alcoholic drink with his lunch while he is so
doing; as a result the dining area has been sadly depleted of diners and it is unlikely that those who have
paid substantial amounts of money for the right to have the use of the table for a year will renew their
subscription next year. Thus a forward looking club like Manchester United may be deprived of an income
of well over £500,000.

  4.88 Nor is the loss of revenue confined only to the very' big English clubs. The. sponsors at Heart
Midlothian are able to watch the game from a box behind which is a bar and eating facilities. There has
had to be erected, between the seats which look out onto the pitch and the bar area, an opaque glass panel,
so as to prevent those having a drink from watching the game. As a deterrent to hooliganism it has no
purpose at all. Its effect may be to deter much needed finance from being injected into the game.

  4.89 Bristol Rovers have what it called a President’s Club. There were 115 members. Because there was
a view of the field from the Clcb,- drink was banned. Membership has already dropped and no doubt will
continue to drop. Next year’s membership could be in doubt. The loss of revenue to the Club, though
modest compared with that of Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United, is a serious one for this Club.

   4.90 Crystal Palace have 25 executive boxes. The absence of alcohol in the boxes has resulted not only
in the immediate loss of revenue but also in the loss of sponsorship and programme advertising, which was
generated by those using the boxes. These are only a few examples. I have been shown a list of some 30
clubs in the four Divisions in England and Wales who have already suffered financial loss and will continue.
so to do.

  4.91 Now that the Act has been in force for a short time, and its effects can be seen, it must be sensible
to have another look at Section 3(3) to see whether it really is a necessary provision. / therefore recommend
that the provisions o f Section 3(3) be reviewed in relation to executive boxes.

                                                       40
(vi) Closed Circuit Television
   4.92 The introduction of CCTV as a weapon against hooliganism seems to have met with universal
approval. It is essential that the equipment which is installed is of a high quality. This is a matter for the
individual choice of the police authority and the football management. But nothing could be worse than
to waste a considerable amount of money on equipment, if it is of no practical Value in identifying hooligans
so that they can be prosecuted and convicted. It is important too to recognise that the operator needs to
be properly trained and that maintenance of that equipment is vital to the success of its operation.

   4.93 Its use a t Huddersfield Town Football Club, for instance, has proved its value. During 1984 there
was a total of 253 arrests for offences of assault, damage and threatening behaviour committed by supporters
attending the Huddersfield Town ground. There were 26 matches played in the season. 113 arrests were at
games against one particular team and 75 against another. It was decided that the next visit of one of these
teams was a suitable occasion to assess the potential of video-recording incidents of disorder. Following
the recording of incidents in the ground, two officers were selected to examine the recording, to effect the
arrest of the parties involved in the violent incidents. Identification of offenders was achieved by the officers
repeatedly visiting Huddersfield Town’s ground and the ground of the visiting club on subsequent home
games, and Attempting to identify those caught on camera in the crowd. Extensive briefings were also given
to other officers and more routine inquiries including the visi ting of railway and bus termini were undertaken.

  4.94 The results to date, which are by no means final, are that eight persons have appeared before the
Courts, where the main evidence has been the video-recording of themselves committing offences of assault
on police, threatening behaviour, criminal damage and assault.

  4.95 It is clear that the most beneficial factors are firstly, the effect on offenders who have been identified
from the video; secondly, the knock-on effect on their similar minded friends and thirdly, there is the
opportunity presented to Magistrates to exercise their sentencing powers to the full, in the confident
knowledge of having seen the undisputed violence involved in the incident. They have been able to witness
the scene which cannot be set in words alone.

   4.96 One of the accused charged with an offence at Huddersfield said that he had not been at that
particular game, but he was then shown the video and said; “ I can't get away from that; you are doing a
good job.” Another of the accused, who had tried to pull down a safety fence, said that he had been playing
a local soccer game on the day of the offence but admitted the offence after having been shown the video­
film with him on it.

  4.97 At the end of the 1984-85 season another club visited Huddersfield. There were a number of arrests
based on video evidence. The fact was given considerable publicity in the area of the other club. When the
same club next visited Huddersfield in a fixture in the current season, there was no trouble at all. The
football clubs themselves have little doubt but that the publicity given to the arrests of their visiting
supporters as a result of the video-film had a very strong and marked deterrent effect on the behaviour of
their supporters when they re-visited Huddersfield.

  4.98 A further use for CCTV is for crowd control before a game starts or after the match. This was
vividly illustrated when I visited Manchester United during their match against Liverpool. Some 4,000
Liverpool supporters arrived; they needed to be brought from their transport to the ground and at the end
of the match to be safely removed. It was possible for the Operational Commander in the control room
on the ground, w ith the aid of five television monitors, to have a complete view of the area inside the
ground which contained the Liverpool supporters and the area outside the ground which included the route
by which it was intended they should leave.
  4.99 At the end of the game the Liverpool supporters were asked to remain on their terrace. They were
held there for some fifteen minutes. During that time the Manchester United supporters left. The police
outside the ground, at the end where the Liverpool supporters were, cleared the concourse of other
spectators; and when they were ready to receive the Liverpool supporters and it was clear to the Commanding
Officer that this was the right moment, he was able to give the instruction that the Liverpool supporters
should leave.
  4.100 He was also able to see that along the route which they were intending to take, there were a
number of Manchester United supporters still about. Thus he was able to direct police officers from his
position inside the stadium control room to advise the Manchester United supporters to move on, so that
the Liverpool supporters could be escorted to their transport, which is in fact what happened.
   4.101 The Football Trust has made a substantial contribution towards the purchase of this equipment
 as they and the Football Grounds Improvement Trust have done in respect of other facilities at football
 grounds. This is much to be commended and they play a very important part in ensuring the welfare of
 the game. -

 (vii) Radios
   4.102 I had occasion in my Interim Report, to make some observations about the way that the police
 radios had operated at Bradford (paragraphs 3.27-3.33). I recommended that early attention should be
 given by the Home Office Directorate of Telecommunications to consider the practicality of producing a
 more suitable personal radio for the police.1

    4.103 Subsequently, at one ground I went to I was able to observe the relative efficiency of the police ,
 radio operated by a police officer and a commercial type of radio of similar construction and appearance,
 operated by a steward employed by the club. Messages from both were received in the police control room
 situated in the ground, by an experienced controller. The reception from the steward’s commercial radio
 was markedly better than from the police radio.

   4.104 One police force expressed confidence in their equipment. They had been able to purchase their
 equipment on the commercial market and had found no operational difficulty in its use. However, I
 observed at one ground a Police Sergeant being asked by a Chief Superintendent to send a message on his
 police radio. He was unable to do so, to general embarrassment, apparently due to the batteries having
 worn out. The point has also been made by the Fire Brigades' Union that their radios are not as good as
 they would like because the batteries, if used for any length of time, tend to wear out. I see no reason,
 therefore, to alter my view that the quality of both the police and the fire service radios (though each are
 different) still needs to be reviewed and the importance of regular maintenance emphasised. I am pleased
 to learn that a detailed study is being commissioned by the Horne Office Directorate o f Telecommunications
 into the problem of personal radios.

  (viii) Police Manpower
    4.105 In my Interim Report (paragraphs 6.9 and 6.10) I drew attention to the large number of police
—officers it is necessary to deploy for the purpose of controlling crowds at a football match. It is a matter
 of some concern that such a large proportion of police resources should be devoted to the task of controlling
 a football crowd, when there are so many other aspects of law and order to which they ought to be devoting
 their time. The police are the first to recognise this.

    4.106 At a recent Mill wall/Portsmouth match over 500 police officers were required to be deployed in
  and outside the ground (and properly so required) to control a crowd of under 7,000 spectators. Any steps
  which can be taken to reduce the necessity for a police presence at a football ground are to be encouraged.
  A successful membership scheme may well have this effect.

  B. The Clubs

  (\) Membership Cards and the Football League Scheme
    4.107 I recommended in my Interim Report that urgent consideration.be given by football clubs in
  England and Wales to introducing a membership system.2 No other Recommendation has given rise to
  such discussion or indeed criticism. There were three criticisms of the idea of a membership system. Firstly,
  that I was advocating an identity card system. I was not, nor did I so suggest in my Report. Secondly, that
  a membership pass was the equivalent of an identity card. It is not any more than a driving licence, work
  pass, season ticket, credit card, bus pass, library ticket or the many thousands of membership cards of
  different clubs, both football and others, which presently exist. Thirdly, there was the suggestion that to
  require a card or pass at a football ground was interfering in some way with the liberty of the subject. This
  I have to say is simply emotional nonsense.
     4.108 There are, how'ever, two much more serious objections which have real validity. Firstly, that any
  system of membership cards is likely to prove impractical at the turnstiles because there would not be
  enough time to check the card presented, given the tendency of football spectators to arrive at the very
  last moment.                                     ______ _      ___________ _______ ____ __________
  'Interim Report: Recommendation 3.
  2Interim Report: Recommendation 20.
                                                                                                                           15




  4.109 The figures for Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, for instance, support this objection. On 17
August 1985 when they played Watford, the final attendance figure was 29,884. At 2.45 pm there were
19,217 in the ground, at 3 pm there were 27,785. The figures for Liverpool this season for five games show
that on averajge only 65 per cent of total attendance were in the ground 15 minutes before kick-off and 92
per cent at kick-off. Thus, on average, some 9,000 spectators were still trying to get into the ground 15
minutes before kick-off and 2,500 were still outside when play began.

  4.110 The second objection is that it would prevent a casual spectator, who wanted to go and visit his
own club on occasions, from So doing; and also that the spectator, who supported a number of clubs would
be prevented from attending matches. It was also pointed Out that if away s u p p o r t e r s were banned some
clubs would lose large revenues. In the lower Divisions, except f o r lo c a l d e r b ie s , away fans are only a small
proportion of the crowd, but in the First and Second Divisions they may be very substantial.

   4.111 These were, and still remain, very strong arguments, more particularly as they come from a large
 number o f the more responsible and reputable clubs. They have been repeated many times to me, both
 orally and in writing, since my Interim Report. On the other hand, the Football Association, the Football
 League, the Professional Footballers’ Association and the Sports Council all favour some form of
 membership scheme. So too do many supporters’ clubs, and a number of clubs who are introducing their
 own scheme. A partial membership scheme has much to commend it and, in fact, exists at many c u s
pplready.
    4.112 A number of matches this season have shown that the casual supporter cannot, in fact, just go to
 any game as he pleases. One example is what happened in the Watford versus Chelsea game in September.
 It was played at 12 noon. It was all-ticket. I wanted to go on to the terraces. As a Watford supporter
 needed to be in possession of a voucher from a previous programme. As a Chelsea supporter I needed to
 be a member of the Supporters’ Club and to go and get a ticket from Chelsea during the week. Watiord,
 in fact, held 1,000 tickets for Chelsea supporters available at the ground on the day, though this was not
 made public. Thus, if on the Saturday morning I had as a casual decided I would like to go to the game,
 would not have got in and thus I was no better off than I would have been under a membership scheme.

   4.113 All-ticket games in England and Wales involve a severe limitation of those who can attend. A
 number of big games are all-ticket. The usual method of distribution of the tickets to the away team is to
 channel them to members of their supporters’ club or to season ticket holders. In those cases it is clear
 that the casual supporter will not get a ticket. This year all Leeds United matches, when they p ay away
 from home, have been designated by the Football Association to be all-ticket games, t us t e casua
 supporter of Leeds United is unlikely to be able to get a ticket to see his team when they are playing away.

    4.114 The system which Leeds United has adopted is to allocate their away tickets first to season ticket
  holders and shareholders: the remainder are distributed to the Supporters’ Club. I was told that to be a
  member of Leeds United Supporters’ Club you need to be proposed, interviewed and'approved by a
  particular branch. Unless you are so approved you cannot join the Club; at some b r a n c h e s unless you re
  personally known you will not be approved; if you cannot join the Club you cannot get into an away
  match. It appears to be a membership scheme with very strict membership control. However* >               g
  misbehaviour of Leeds United fans at a recent match has caused the FA temporarily to ban all Leeds
  United supporters at away games.
    4.115 The Football League have set up a working party to consider the w h o le question of membership
  cards. TOs reported on 9 September 1985. Because of its importance, it is w o r t h setting out some cl the
  details of that Report.
        “ 14. Many football clubs have in recent years carefully considered how to attract desirable groups of
        spectators, such as families and children, to attend their matches . .. .
        15. To this end accommodation has been set aside for these groups, and often admission to them is
        controlled by the use of membership cards . .
        16. In addition numerous clubs have established supporters’ membership schemes, open to ind^*du^
        good character who are not eligible for membership of family or children s schemes and for season ticket
        holders.
        17. Safety of Sports Grounds Act regulations lay down strict guidelines for segregation of rival SUP P ^ ^ ’
        and these structures greatly facilitate the creation of reserved areas for members of p articular schemes.

                                                            43
At many clubs, facilities have been specially improved to cater for these groups particularly refreshment
kiosks, lavatories, additional seating and so on.
18. A particular benefit of schemes of this sort is that the club and its supporters can be confident that
in those areas of the ground where admission is controlled by membership, the likelihood of disorder is
minimal. If offences do occur, membership is withdrawn and the individual banned from the ground.
23..It is thus necessary to consider how a membership system could help solve the away travel problem.
The answer clearly lies in building on the success of the individual club schemes and extending the
privileges, which membership confers at home matches to away games. To achieve this will require a
high degree of compatability between one club’s scheme and another’s.
24. The first step, therefore will be for all clubs to have a membership scheme the basic principles of
which will be common to all. In our view these should cover:                                          ~
   (a) the categories of membership (eg the season ticket holders, families, young people and/or children,
   accredited supporters, etc).
   (b) Tjie specification of the membership card.
   (c) A photograph on the card and a duplicate held by the     club   (except .for season ticket holders for
   whom this may not be necessary).
   (d) The length of time for which a card is valid. We recommend that they should be renewed each
   season.                                                         -
   (e) The information about the applicant to be supplied on the form requesting membership (eg, full
   name, address, date of birth).
   (0 Agreement with the clubs on the proportion of ground capacity to be covered by membership
   arrangements. We recommend that this should normally be not less than 50 per cent.
   (g) In view of the fact that some clubs are contemplating the introduction of electronic readers at
   turnstiles, it will be important to see that the electronic data on cards (presumably in the form of a
   magnetic strip) also conforms to a common standard.

25. To ensure that these criteria are complied with, we recommend that the Football League issue
guidelines to all clubs to be included in the arrangements, thus establishing the concept of a ‘ Football
League approved membership scheme.” Clubs should be encouraged to provide reserved and safe
accommodaton at their ground for away supporters who are members of approved schemes.
26. Whilst we do not recommend that every match should be ‘members only* for reasons we explain
below, we believe it would be possible through the use of reciprocal membership arrangements to reduce
the likelihood of crowd disorder at difficult games by insisting that not only are these ‘all ticket but also
that tickets are to be sold to members only. We envisage that in due course, as membership schemes
gain increasing acceptance, more and more areas in football grounds become reserved enclosures, to
which only ‘home’ members or ‘away’ members are admitted.
28. . . . We hope, however, that it will never be necessary to refuse admission to persons of good
character, who for whatever reason, are not members of the home or away team’s scheme (the so called
‘casual’ supporter, who perhaps only attends a handful of games in a season, or likes to visit a number
of clubs or who has a conscientious objection to being in a membership scheme).
37. The Working Party concludes that it is possible to establish a national membership card scheme *or
Football League clubs which does not require extremely expensive computer-based electronic equipment
at each ground, or which totally excludes away supporters or decent football fans who are not members
of schemes from the great majority of matches which are expected to be trouble free.
38. We recommend that the Football League urgently draws up guidelines for ‘inclusive membership
schemes (following the advice given in paragraph 24 of this report) with a view to ensuring their
compatability with one another and at the same time providing guidance with the help of the Central
Computer and Telecommunications Agency to clubs wishing to install electronic equipment to check
cards.
 39. We recommend that the Football League, in full, introduce regulations requiring clubs to establish
 areas of their grounds for the use of members, with normally at least 50 per cent of the ground s capacity
 reserved for this purpose.

                                                    44
     40. We recommend that the Government includes in its proposed Public Order Bill a provision for
     exclusion orders on football offenders, to back up membership schemes, and for clubs and police to
     double their efforts to prevent undesirable non-members from entering their grounds, including the
     circulation by clubs of black lists of banned persons.
     41. The Working Party believe that if these recommendations are followed the system -introduced will
     comply with the agreement reached between the Government, the F o o t b a ll Association and the Football                    1
     League at the Downing Street meeting on 30 July, The national membership card scheme should impose                           v
     little financial burden on clubs, and indeed provide s o m e c o m m e r c ia l opportunities for them as a resui t          :
     of their obtaining more information about their customers. The successful operation of the scheme " i l ,                         -
     in addition, provide a measure of security and reassurance for the decent supporters who continue to be
     the backbone of English professional football, as well as a demonstration to UEFA and FI .                      a
     English football is determined to put its house in order.”
    4.116 Reading propose to introduce a computerised system, with cards, w h ic h would exclude non­
 members. It has not yet been implemented. It is, however, one type of scheme. So too ha\e renttor .
 Under their scheme they issue a form which asks for name and address and employer. A person is issue
 with a card witK the type of membership he requires. It costs £1. The cost of producing the car was
 substantially covered by advertising. Armed with this card, w h ic h the member presents at the turns i e                        \I
 is admitted to that part of the ground where his ticket allows him to go. Those without tickets go t roug i                           ---

Ipatrol the non-members’ areas.
  4.117 So far this season Brentford have sold about 5,000 membership cards. They find that the list of                           ;
members has important commercial potential and are optimistic that there will be considerab e spin-o s
from the scheme.
                                                                                                                                  «1

  4.118 In the 1984-85 s e a s o n Crystal Palace operated a limited membership card system m which 25 per
cent of the ground had been f o r “members only”. In April 1985 they announced that 50 per cent o        e
ground would be so organised. There was an initial fee of £3, but members paid 50 pence ess or s a. i g
accommodation and £1 less for a seat. There were some 3,800 members. The membership scheme led to a
reduction of one third in the level of police manning at the ground.

   4.119 Leicester City have introduced a similar scheme. They have 3,000 members, nearly 5,000 s^asoti
 and family ticket holders and 1,000 members of the Supporters’ Club. Because of the success of J e scheme
 which has led to improved behaviour, they have been able to reduce the amount of
 hope, as membership rises, to reduce the fencing further. Millwall have an a w a y travel club. ^PP cations
 require the name and address, date of birth and description of the applicant and r e q m r e the applicant to
 say whether he has been convicted of any football-related offence. The card contains a p o g P
 applicant. A number of other football clubs have supporters’ associations or clubs which require a
 membership card including a photograph.
   4.120 An example of a match containing substantially only home spectators^was. the M-ilw_al1
 Portsmouth game on 26 October 1985. Because of previous troubles, it was an all-ticket g^ e‘ ^ ° rlsI? ° .
 Football Club did not accept any tickets and dissuaded their supporters from going to the g
 result only about thirty Portsmouth supporters watched the match which was trouble-tree.

    4.121 Another proposal, which Has found favour w ith s o m e witnesses, is                                     Thus
 supporters should be limited to a person holding membership ot the visiting c u s _                             en t^ev
 it is hoped that a football club would be made responsible for the behaviour of its suppor
 are visiting another ground.
    4.122 It has to be remembered that all clubs at present have a structure for              *nf ^ ^ e r s V i p
  season ticket holders, family membership and so on. There is no reason w y             ^ the facilities for
  should not be encouraged at the expense of the potential hooligan. Thus,
  members, by offering discounts on away travel, by offering tickets at preferential prices and by mvohin0
  members in the general well-being of the club, there will be two particular benefits.

  4.123 Firstly, the club will gain from all the commercial benefits of a membership schemeand
  in the cost of maintaining law and order in the ground. Secondly, the mem J * 5       ctart to win back the
  contact with the hooligan. Thus, gradually, a club with a membership scheme y
  families and children as well as other supporters who now stay away.'

                                                            45
  4.124    The Football Trust and the Department of the Environment recently commissioned the Sociology
Department at the University of Leicester (who are very experienced in investigation of football problems)
to examine and report on Leicester City’s membership scheme.

 4.125 The Leicester sociologists conclude that the most practical strategy would be to encourage the co-
ordinated introduction of club based schemes. “Such an approach” , they say, “would enable each club to
become familiar with the operation of its own scheme and, following that, it might be possible to establish and
to monitor a pilot project involving reciprocal arrangements.”

   4.126 In my Interim Report I set out the various problems of a membership scheme and said that despite
the problems, these could be overcome with goodwill and effort. I did not pretend that any membership
scheme would necessarily be successful, or that I could guarantee that it would cure football hooliganism.
I suggested that clubs could keep away fans away if they were so minded. I did not then recommend this
as the only scheme, nor do I do so now. It is to be hoped that a partial membership scheme which still
allows casuals to enter the ground will be the first step in trying to secure greater peace and harmony at a
football match. In the end, it must be for the football clubs to take whatever steps they think necessary to
ensure crowd control at football matches. Membership schemes are one, but certainly not the only step.
Trie Football League have taken an important step in this direction and their efforts are much to be
commended.

  4.127 Clubs in the Football League have reacted to the Football League's proposal with varying degrees
of enthusiasm ranging from downright opposition to warm acceptance. Given the history of the Football
League clubs no one should be surprised that there is no agreement on this suggestion anymore than on
any other suggestion.

   4.128 The fact that this season, as I write, trouble on the terraces has been appreciably less than last
season, is no ground for complacency. I recognise that the great majority of football matches are trouble-
free, but any practical step which can be taken to lessen the risk is to be applauded. The Working Party’s
Report is but a first step. So too are the experiments which I have recorded. No doubt there are other
promising schemes elsewhere. It will have to be seen how successful they are and adjusted in the light of
experience. For my part, I recommend that consideration should continue to be given to some form o f
membership scheme for Football League clubs in England and Wales.

(ii) Stewards
  4.129 I have already expressed my view about the responsibility of the clubs, as private organisations
inviting spectators into their grounds for profit, to bear the responsibility for ensuring the reasonable safety
of those spectators. To that end, I have already recommended that stewards should be properly selected
and properly trained. The days when all they are required to do is to act like an usherette at a cinema to
show people to their seats should have gone. They have a very important public responsibility to ensure
the safety of the spectators, as do the cabin staff of an aeroplane. I have been impressed at a number o jfl)
grounds which I have visited, by the steps which have now been taken (albeit belatedly) to ensure that
there are competent stewards who are properly briefed. No doubt the presence of a large number of police,
which is now the accepted practice on a ground, had led some clubs to be less energetic than they otherwise
would be in looking after their own property and the safety of spectators.

(iii) Community Affairs-
   4.130 Clubs like Aberdeen and Watford (no doubt there are other shining examples) have involved
themselves *n community affairs. They have provided a place were families and children can attend. They
have encouraged a relationship between the club and the local community which can only result in greater
harmony at the ground. The current financial problems affecting a number of clubs will no doubt result in
a rethink as to whether a football ground, often used only for football once a fortnight, is being put to its
best practical use* Some 40 hours use in a year scarcely seems an economic use of an expensive ground.
On the Continent, the sharing of grounds and their facilities, not only for spectators and players, but for
members of the public, has much to commend it. This, of course, cannot happen overnight. A number of
forward looking clubs already involve the community. Many do not and there can be no doubt that it is -
to everyone’s advantage that they should.
(iv) Behaviour O f Players
  4.131 The behaviour of some players on the field of play undoubtedly contributes on occasion to bad
behaviour on the terraces. This is not confined to football. Indeed some of the antics of cricketers and

                                                     46
tennis players are substantially worse than those of football players. The public conduct of professional
golfers and snooker players, who are subject to pressures and tension, certainly no less than other sports
players, has much to commend it. A number of footbajl.clubs take a much firmer view about the behaviour
of their players than some of the other sporting authorities. It is a fact, however, that in some cases the
play-acting when a player goes down, the childish kicking away of the ball when a free-kick is awarded to
the opposition, and the throwing away of the ball when it is the opposition’s throw-in, all cause upset on
the terraces, and play a part in contributing to disorder. Worse still is the so-called professional foul which
in ordinary language is plain cheating In some games it might call for a ban for life. It seriously increases
tension among the crowd.

(v) Supporters’ Clubs
   4.132 It might be thought that with falling attendances supporters’ clubs would be positively encouraged
 and welcomed by football clubs. Far from it. Some football clubs have no supporters’ clubs. Some who
 do treat them as if they were a rival organisation. The result is that instead of harnessing the goodwill of
 those who provide some of the livelihood to the club (and are often their keenest supporters) some clubs
 take active steps to discourage them. In some football clubs “the customer knows best” has a hollow ring.
                    5
 (vi) Facilities at Football Grounds
   4.133 I have little doubt but that the provision of good facilities at football grounds is likely to result in
 better behaviour from the fans. A number of clubs do provide first-class facilities. At others the facilities
kcan at best be described as woeful, at worst non-existent. There is a tradition of standing on the terraces
^tnd even a modern ground like Ibrox Park has one side of the stadium which has all standing. But it is
 possible to provide comfortable facilities. There is a strong view that while better facilities will not necessarily
 prevent people from behaving like hooligans, they a r e likely to lessen the chance. There is no reason why
 clubs should continue to provide facilities no better then were available a hundred years ago. Clubs must
 be encouraged to improve their facilities.

   4.134 Professor Canter of Surrey University was invited to carry out some research for me into the
 problems of crowd behaviour. He interviewed a selected number of people living near grounds as diverse
 as Celtic and Millwall; Coventry and Preston North End. They were asked a general open question about
 the reason why people do not go regularly to football matches and what would encourage people to go
 more frequently. The largest percentage (29%) said that improved comfort would encourage people to go
 more frequently. That figure varied from as little as 8% at Coventry to 44% at Southampton.

  4.135 This view is not wholly supported by the findings of the Dunfermline College of Physical Education,
 who carried out a survey of crowd behaviour at football matches in Scotland. In particular they looked at
 Rangers, Aberdeen and Hibernian Football Clubs. Their conclusion was:
       “ Fans rated the quality of the football and the trouble-free crowd as being more important than the
       quality of facilities. Further, entertaining football was valued more highly than a winning team. However
       the relative importance placed on the importance of facilities appeared to depend on the experience of
       the fans. For example at Easter Road (the Hibernian Football Club Ground) a predominantly terraced
       ground, where there have been few ground improvements, concern was centred on improvements to the
       stadia such as covering the terracing and more seating. However, at Ibrox (Rangers Football Ground)
       and Pittodrie (Aberdeen Football Club Ground) where the fans feel there is little room for improvement
       of the facilities, the concern was focussed on the quality of the football and additional types of
       entertainment.”

   4.136 It would be splendid if perimeter-fencing and segregation barriers could be removed. They are in
 England and Wales, of comparatively recent origin. In the past we looked with superior amusement at
 countries elsewhere where it was thought necessary to introduce them. It is, however, quite clear that in
 England and Wales, at any rate, a very great deal of trouble would exist without them, although they are
 not universal. In Scotland they a r e a l m o s t non-existent. The grounds at Pittodrie and Ibrox are a model.
 One advantage of introducing successful membership schemes could be to reduce the number of perimeter
 fences.

    4.137 In my Interim Report I recommended1 that consideration be given to the design of a standard
 efficient perimeter fence with proper exits. That was understood in some quarters to mean that I had
 recommended that perimeter fences should be installed as a matter of routine at all grounds. That was not
 1Interim Report: Recommendation 24
                                                                                                                     i

my intention. What I was saying was that if perimeter fencing was to be installed at a particular ground,
it would be sensible that the design of it should be standardised. I have seen a number of perimeter fences
in various parts of the country. They varied in quality and design enormously and I suspect also in cost.
Some were efficient, some not particularly so. At one ground there was a perimeter fence which could not
possibly be criticised on grounds of efficiency. However, because of the nature of its construction, those
inside the stand had very great difficulty in watching the football. Thus while they were physically controlled,
their enjoyment was exceedingly limited. Nor are perimeter fences the only method of preventing spectators
from getting on to the pitch. There are very efficient methods adopted at some Continental grounds like
double fencing and dry moats.

   4.138     It would, in my view, be of immense help to those clubs who are intending to put perimeter fencing
in, or are minded to alter their existing fences, to have a standard specification, so that an efficient perimeter
fence, if one is required, can be installed. I would like to have persuaded the Football Association to set - .
up a small working party to help the clubs develop a standard design. They declined the invitation pointing
out that if their design was unsuccessful and the fence surmounted, this would undermine their disciplinary
power. I still think they are the proper organisation to look at this problem.

                                                    Hooliganism

    5.1 I do not believe that my Report would be complete without an examination of some of the current
  theories about hooliganism.

    5.2 There are three popular fallacies about hooliganism. Firstly, that it is something comparatively new.
  Secondly, that it is only found at soccer matches and thirdly, that it is an English disease.

  (i) Hooliganism is not a new phenomenon
     5.3 Seneca (who died in AD. 65) devoted the last three years of his life to philosophy and to writing
  letters to Lucilius a native of Pompeii. In one of them he wrote (Penguin Classics translation): “You asked
  me to say what you should consider it particularly important to avoid. My answer is this: the mass crowd. It
  is something to which you cannot entrust yourself yet without risk. . . Associating with people in large numbers
  is actually harmful. There is not one of them that will not make some vice or other attractive to us or leave
  us carrying the imprint of it or be daubed all unawares with it. And inevitably enough, the larger the size of
  the crowd we mingle with the greater the danger.”

     5 .4 .... “ I happened to go to one of these shows at the time of the lunch hour interlude, expecting there to
       ome light and witty entertainment then, some respite for the purpose of affording people’s eyes a rest from

 t     ran blood. Far from it. AH the earlier contests were charity in comparison. ... What we have now is murder
       pure and simple . . . In the morning men are thrown to the lions and the bears but it is the spectators they are
  thrown to in the lunch hour. The spectators insist that each, on killing his man should be thrown against
  another, to be killed in his turn; and the eventual victor is reserved by them for some other form of butcher}';
  the only exit for the contestants is death. Fire and steel keep the slaughter going. And all this happens whilst
  the Arena is virtually empty. . . . And when there is an interval in the show there is a cry ‘let’s have some
  throats cut in the mean-time so that there is something happening’.”

    5.5 Writing in 1788 from Downing Street, Edward Gibbon described in his History of the Decline and
  Fall of the Roman Empire the factions of the circus in Rome in AD. 548 thus: “The race in its first
  institution was a simple contest of two chariots whose drivers were distinguished by white and red liveries; two
  additional colours, a light green and cerulean blue were afterwards introduced; and as the races were repeated
  25 times, 100 chariots contributed in the same day to the pomp of the circus . . . The bloody and tumultuous
  contest continued to disturb the public festivity till the last age of the spectacles of Rome” . . .

    5.6 “Constantinople adopted the follies though not the virtues of ancient Rome; and the same factions which
  had agitated the circus, raged with redoubled fury in the hippodrome. Under the reign of Anastasius, this
  popular frenzy was inflamed by religious zeal; and the greens who had treacherously concealed stones and
  daggers under baskets of fruit massacred at a solemn festival 3,000 of their blue adversaries” . . .

      5.7 “The blues affected to strike terror by a peculiar and barbaric dress, the long hair of the Huns, their
   close sleeves and ample garments, a lofted step and a sonorous voice. In the day they concealed their two-
   edged poinards but in the night they boldly assembled in arms and in numerous bands, prepared for every act
   of violence and rapine. Their adversaries of the green faction or even inoffensive citizens were stripped and
   often murdered by these nocturnal robbers, and it became dangerous to wear any gold buttons or girdles or to
..appear at a late hour in the street of the peaceful capital.”

    5.8 Gibbon then describes the sedition which occurred and continued: “It is computed that about 30,000
  persons were slain in the merciless and promiscuous carnage of the day . . . the Hippodrome itself was
  condemned during several years to a mournful silence; with the restoration of the games, the same disorders
  revived and the blue and green factions continued to afflict the reign of Justinian and to disturb the tranquility
  of the eastern empire.”

    5.9 Antonia Fraser reports in her book “Cromwell Our Chief of Men” that in 1655 in the Midlands, in
  order to preserve the Peace it was considered necessary to ban football matches and race meetings.

    5.10 The Leicester Daily Mercury records a disgraceful scene at the match between Burnley and Blackburn
  in 1890 when: “the Referee was mobbed at the close, the official had to be protected by the Committee and
  so demonstrative were the spectators that the Police could not clear the field. He had to take refuge under the
 grandstand and subsequently in a neighbouring house. The police force was increased and eventually the
 Referee was hurried into a cab and driven away followed by a howling stone-throwing mob.”

   5.11 There are more recent examples of football hooliganism. In 1909 at Hampden Park some 6,000
 spectators pulled up goalposts, fences and pay-boxes, set fire to them and danced round them in the middle
 of the pitch. Police, firemen and ambulancemen were stoned, fire engines damaged and hoses slashed.
 Police, after throwing the stones back at the rioters, finally cleared the ground at seven o’clock at a cost
 of fifty-four Constables injured and the destruction of virtually every street round Hampden. Sixty other
 people were also injured.

    5.12 Neither of the New Year’s Day matches at Parkhead in 1898 or Ibrox in 1905, between Rangers
 and Celtic, were finished because of pitch invasions. There were serious outbreaks of disorder in Scottish
 Football in 1941, 1949, 1953, 1955, 1957, 1958 and on into the 1960s. The disorder consisted of fighting,
 bottle-throwing and pitch invasions in addition to ritual chanting, obscenities and jeering. The Glasgow
 Herald wrote in 1952: “This hooliganism on the sports field cannot be allowed to go on. The sport of football
 must be cleared up.”
               t
 (ii) Hooliganism is only a football problem
    5.13 This is not wholly true. 1954 saw the MCC in the. West Indies playing the third Test Match at
 Georgetown, British Guyana. The West Indians were about to put on 100 when one of their batsmen was
 run-out. Scuffling broke out in the stand behind square-leg. Dozens of bottles were hurled towards the
 square-leg umpire who had given the batsman, out and mounted police had to be moved onto the scene of
 disorder.

   5.14 Six years later in the second Test at Queens Park, Port of Spain, there was a similar occurrence.
 Again a West Indian was run-out. Again bottles were thrown onto the field by the crowd. Beer cans, fruit
 and anything else which came to hand was also thrown. Then the crowd came onto the field of play; finally
 the game had to be abandoned for the day.

    5.15 In November 1963 there was a riot at a horse race track in the New York area. There were fifteen
-arrests and fifteen taken to hospital. Booths were set on fire and cars damaged.

   5.16 In 1955 at an ice hockey match between Montreal Canadians and Detroit Redskins there was a
 major riot. A smoke bomb was thrown. Cars were overturned, stores were looted and there were one
 hundred arrests.

 (iii) Football hooliganism only occurs in this country                      -
    5.17 This is not the case. In Brazil, in September 1950, one person was shot dead and several others
 injured, four seriously, when an angry crowd tried to drag a football referee from inside a police car at
 Rio de Janeiro. In Italy, in March 1951, police used tear gas to disperse thousands of angry football
 spectators who broke into a visiting football team's dressing room at Bari, Southern Italy, injured a player
 and the trainer and chased the referee four miles to a farm house.

    5.IS The official communist newspaper, Bauber, described a game near Belgrade in 1955 in this way:
 “ Fans rushed on to the field carrying knives, knocked down the Referee and put him out of action for at least
 six months.”

    5.19 The St Louis Post Despatch, in December 1976, described a football game in this way: “At a
 National Football League game at Foxborough, Massachusetts between the New York Jets and the New
 England Patriots, rowdy fans continually ran out onto the field, stopping play a dozen times. By the time the
 game ended two fans had died of heart attacks, 30 were taken to hospital with cuts and bruises, 49 were
 arrested, a policeman’s jaw was broken and a spectator had been stabbed. In the parking lot a policeman was
 giving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a heart-attack victim when a drunken fan urinated on the officer’s
 back.”

 The extent of hooliganism
   5.20 There is then considerable evidence about the age and generality of the problem. It is less easy
 however to measure its extent and development. One of the problems confronting anyone enquiring into
 ?he problems of hooliganism is the total lack of any reliable statistics. It is possible to ascertain from the

                                                          50
police the number of arrests during a season at a particular ground. By comparing these figures with the
previous year or years, some sort of conclusion can be drawn, particularly if the number of spectators is
also known. Thus arrests as a percentage of spectators can be calculated.

  5.21 Unfortunately this is an unreliable approach. Firstly, the data often do not distinguish between
those arrested inside and those arrested outside the ground. Secontily the offences are not denned; they
may be, for example, pick-pocketing, drunkenness or violence. Thirdly, the number of arrests may not
indicate the extent of violence because when a riot takes place police may have to spend more time defending
themselves than arresting people; on other occasions which are less violent they may be more able to arrest
the trouble-makers.

   5.22 It might have been thought that this violence has been a problem for football clubs for many years
the first thing the football authorities would have done would have been to seek to establish the extent of
it. Far from it.

  5.23 Presently at every Football League match in England and Wales there is an observer appointed by
the Football League to assess and report on the performance of the referee. In European and International
matches there is an assessor who reports on the game, including crowd problems. When I suggested to the
Football League that their observers at domestic matches might also observe and report on any crowd
problems they were not enthusiastic. Nor it appears are there any official plans for the central collection
   statistics on this important subject. The result is that any student of the problem has to make do with

f adequate statistics and a good deal of folklore because the authorities are unable to provide the assistance
  so that the necessary lessons may be learned.

    5.24 In July 1976, a panel established jointly by the Sports Council and the Social Science Research
 Council reported on the problems of anti-social behaviour at sporting events.1 In its recommendations tor
 research the Report said this: “During its discussion the Panel was constantly hindered by a lack of basic
 statistical information about hooligans and hooliganism. As a result it cannot be claimed t at it asac ie' e
 a thorough understanding of the nature of the problem or of its extent. It appears that much of the data needed
 mioht already be available in police records, but not in a readily accessible or systematised form. While tnis
 is not a recommendation for research as such, the Panel feels that a routine system of‘ collecting information
 from police forces in England and Wales about football hooliganism should be established.

    5.25 Although that recommendation was made in 1977 no serious attention appears to have been paid
 to it. Recently, however, the Football Association wrote to all Football League Cliaos in Englan a ^
 Wales: “ We at The Football Association are monitoring the problems of various Clubs and trying to
 that where potential problems exist a Club is forewarned. Some form of information service is therefore
 necessary to enable us to provide meaningful help to Clubs and, for this reason, we wou as ' jo**           .
 a report on your home matches equally with reference to the visiting supporters. Albeit late in the da>, this
 is a helpful approach and to be encouraged. It is still vitally important that the police and Ahe clubs shou _
 get together so that henceforth it is possible for the clubs to obtain statistics on the number of arrests and
P the nature of the offences which occur on their property.
      5.26 The figures of arrest at the twelve London clubs, over the last ten years a r e int^esting^In 1975-76
  there were just under three arrests per 10,000 spectators. They went up to four in               ’ . p f
  a train in 1978-79, up to five in 1980-81, down to four in 1982-83 and is now on the way up a^inP rofessor
  Canter, a consultant to my Inquiry says: “The general trend is clearly upwards. Overall the ^ tio is increasing
  but what is also noticeable is that there appears to be a 4 to 5 year cycle, the roug s o
  coincide with World Cup years.”

    5.27 Professor Canter has also looked at the casaulties at a ground to see whether their n^ ber 's 'n
  proportion to the arrests and ejections; he concludes that there is a direct relationship between the number
_ of incidents and the number of casualties.

      5.2S His conclusion is: “Taken altogether, the figures show an increasing trend towards violence n^c jsimting
    arrest or ejection. They also show that the violence linked to these arrests appear:s to >ejin*.ed
    Those Clubs, especially in the major cities that attract larger followings, appear to h^ 'e        .
    associated with their matches and these appear to be typically, although not solelv, at g
    larger crowds” . ________________________ ________ ____________ _____________ ________ _____

                                                                   51
  5.29 “The thesis that some clubs and special matches are the prime focus of acts of violence is supported
by these figures. Discussions with police and other researchers argue this too. Our figures do corroborate these
generally held views to some extent.”                                                          ^

   5.30 “But there is an important caveat. Few Clubs are without incident during a season, so to ‘blame’ a few
clubs is to ignore the widespread pattern. Further, whatever the threat of ‘away’ supporters, ‘home’ supporters
are not completely innocent.” Professor Canter says: “Two other comments follow from these findings. The
first is that it is possible to identity patterns to incidents from available data provided that enough data is
collated together. Secondly, this being the case, the football authorities (as well as the Police) can tackle the
clubs directly whose supporters are frequently associated.”

   5.31 The point is made however that differences between clubs are enormous. Professor Canter says: “It
is clear that each club has its own ethos. The question is thus raised whether this might relate to aggressive
acts as indicated in arrests.” The arrest levels at the Tottenham Hotspur and Millvvall grounds have
remained fairly constant over this time, at between three and four arrests per 10,000 spectators while at
Chelsea it has fluctuated from two or three per 10,000 from 1975-79 to between seven and eight per 10,000
today.      t

   5.32 A team of sociologists at the University of Leicester who have made a’special study of hooliganism,
say: “It is not our contention that, because hooliganism at football matches can be shown to be deeply rooted
in the British past, it has therefore been entirely unchanging in its forms, contents and consequences. Among
the factors a t work shaping the specific character of the ‘football hooligan-phenomenon’ since the late 1950s
have been:
   1. the structural changes that have occurred in the ‘rough’ and ‘respectable’ sections of the working class,
       and in relationships between them;
   2. the rise of a specifically teenage leisure market;
   3. the increased ability and desire of young fans to travel to away matches on a regular basis;
   4. changes in the structure of the game itself;
   5. specific attempts by the Football Authorities to curb hooliganism and, above all, the involvement of
     _ central.govemment in this process;                                                    '
   6. changes in the mass media, above all the advent of television and emergence of the ‘tabloid’ press with
       its competition-generated and commercially-orientated concept of newsworthiness;
       and
   7. finally, the recent virtual collapse of the youth labour-market.”

   5.33 In our view, these features, which are all in some sense at least historically specific have made a
significant contribution to the form, content and extent of football hooliganism since the 1950s.

  5.34 Almost everyone to whom I have spoken both in the football world, in the press and the media
generally, in the police and in the academic world, agrees that the amount of violence which is related to
soccer, has increased; the statistics also tend to support this view. A distinction needs to be made, however,
between violence which occurs inside the ground and violence which occurs outside the ground. There is a
good deal of evidence that as the art of controlling a crowd within the ground increases and the physical
constraints are improved, so the problem is simply transported from inside to outside the ground.

  5.35 This may be a matter of congratulation and pleasure to the football clubs and.to those who have
inside the ground but it is not much consolation to spectators when going to or from the ground or to the
ordinary citizen going about his lawful business in the streets of the town where the football match is being
played.

Characteristics of the hooligan
   5.36 Who then are these hooligans and why do they behave as they do? A good deal of work has been
done by sociologists and others in an attempt to answer this question. The Sports Council Report* says:
“There is a substantial body of literature describing and analysing the sub-culture of violence which is followed
by young men in the lower classes of many societies . . . It is a culture which values additional masculine
virtues of courage and skill in fighting, of heavy drinking and exploitative sex; of loyalty to other members of
'Ibid
the group and control over local territory. It would appear that the core members of fan groups are drawn
From communities where those values still hold and these values are reaffirmed and given a new location in
Football hooliganism. These values have not only been challenged by alternative values held by other classes
in Britain but by the emergence of new youth cultures with which they come into conflict.”

  5.37 “The sub-cultural violence has found a new location in football. Football has created new heroes who
exemplify its values and extend its territories well beyond the local street, cafes and public houses.”

  5.38 The Report goes on: “Whatever the experts are likely to say about the natural aggressivity of young
males and the way this is released in crowd situations, those who have to deal with the problem of football
hooliganism, whether the police or the management of the clubs, believe that in some way it reflects on the
breakdown of authority in modern Britain, and the ineffectiveness of home, school and churches in bringing
up children.”
  5.39 “They believe it is society’s problem and represents the consequences of a permissive society. There is
a sense in which it may be society’s problem but a different explanation might be offered. We have already
drawn attention to the nourishment which football hooliganism draws from certain elements in traditional
working class culture; the value it places on masculinity, violence and loyalty. These elements far from being
the result of social change are extremely resistant to it. There are however important changes taking place in
British society which may bear upon any long term solution to the problems of football hooliganism.

   5.40 The Sports Council Report points out that there is nothing new about violence in the young: “ Gangs
of young adolescents who are alienated or in direct revolt against society are not a new phenomenon. Th§
post-war years haVe seen the rock and roll riots of the Teddy Boys, the Mods and Rockers, the Skinheads
and the Bower Boys. All seem to be seeking a distinct identity for themselves by special clothes, a feeling of
solidarity by concerted actions and a sense of being wanted through companionship. Football fans are in a
similar mould. They seek ‘male bonding’ because they are in a critical gap between the stage of detachment
from family dependence—if they ever enjoyed this fully—and the stage of marriage. This is a simpler
explanation than the claim that they retain vestigial traces of instinctive hunting beha>iour from their
evolutionary forebears, although the latter is as difficult to falsify as it is to prove.

   5.41 “They not only seek each other’s company, but are pressed into it by a society whose structure does
not offer them much in the way of alternative affiliations. So we see young males ‘moving around’ together in
varying degrees of mutual dependence from the occasional ‘meeting up’ to the closely knit gang. If masculinity
and aggression (let us not forget spontaneous wit and mutual loyalty) are values adopted by these groups, it
is the understandable consequence of a socialisation which shapes the heed to acquire these qualities as a mark
of manhood.”
   5.42 “The football match turns out to be a natural arena for the rehearsal of these qualities and for the
strengthening of bonds with each other. It offers an acknowledged meeting place, a carnival atmosphere and
exciting contrast to the drabness of the workaday week. But principally it offers scope for belonging to a
loosely constructed group, a gang or a clique; for assuming a role and taking part in t e action. ^ or a an
group has an explicit shared aim although it may not be held with the same degree of conviction by all
members. It is that the team should win. The aim Is victory. This objective, to support a team and in so doing
help it to win, far from being reprehensible in our society is generally regarded as desirable.

   5.43 One of the Leeds United supporters to whom I spoke expressed it in this way. He said he would
 rather see his side win a boring game b y 1-0 than see an exciting game which his team lost 5-4. Winning is
 everything. Losing is nothing.

 Why football particularly? *
    5.44 The report continues:
 "We still have to ask, however, why football support to a much greater degree than other sports provides a
 situation that is so primed that it sometimes erupts into disorder.
   5.45 “Some of the differences between football and other sports can be spelt out in greater detail. It is
 important to emphasise that no single feature but only a combination will suffice to portray the football match
 as a situation with a potential for extreme behaviour.”
   5.46 “ 1. There is a very strong belief that the presence of large numbers of supporters spurs; a teamto
 greater effort. It is also widely felt that if this presence can be made explicit by shouting and chantm0 the

                                                       53
   effect will be that much greater. It is partly for this reason that organised supporters and fan clubs are strongly
   encouraged by management and why teams are expected to perform better on their home territory.. . . The
   belief in clamourous support does not obtain in ail games and the differences are not merely accidental. Football
   is a continuous physical activity that proceeds so rapidly that each action seems almost a reflex. It does not
   require the concentration or ‘cerebration’ of a chess match or a golf tournament, where the players’ moves are
   invariably accompanied by a hush on the part of the spectators and not by shouting. It is in general accord
   with research on social facilitation and ‘audiences’ that support can induce ‘arousal’ and hence more physical
   effort but that for tasks requiring careful thought at the time when the action is carried out, audiences are
   distracting and counterproductive.”

           “ 2. There are only two parties to a football match, for the entire event. The competition is completely
   polarised; if one team wins, the other loses and there is no fine gradation of awards. The same applies to the
   supporters. They are in direct and simple opposition and this implies also that each side is united within itself
   into a huge collectivity for the purposes of direct competition with the other side. This competition does not
   end with the match - there are traditional enemies, old scores to settle and reputations to attack or defend and
   the frequency of the meetings reinforces the partisanship.”

           “3. The game itself includes a fast moving series of direct physical confrontations as well as cooperative
   movements between team members. The spectators can readily identify with these movements, both individually
   and collectively because all the action can J)e seen by the whole of the audience at the same time. They can
   follow and respond to the shifting fortunes and experience vicariously the often aggressive encounters. Quite
   often the outcome is unpredictable up till the closing minutes.”

             “ 4. A strong sense of ‘involvement’ or identification with what is happening on the field of play, whether
   it is a clash of individuals or a team movement, arises from the fact (relatively unique to football) that a high
   proportion of the spectators have played the game themselves through the early years of their lives or are still
   playing.” I have to say that I question this view. I am by no means sure that such a high proportion of
   football supporters have in fact played the game to the extent suggested and I am equally doubtful that in
   other games like rugby union and cricket the proportion of spectators who themselves have played or are
   playing is necessarily less than at football.

           “5. An additional factor to combine with the preceding ones to further delineate football is its strong
— basis in working class culture. Football is still an institution that is distinctly working class. The terraces at
  big matches have become obvious and prominent places for proudly displaying and emphasising class values
  and this process is of course mutually re-inforcing. It is readily observed not only at the cultural but also at
  the individual levels. Some social scientists say that aggression is more encouraged in the social upbringing of
  working class children but more heavily punished when it is employed and that punishment further reinforces
  its use because it is itself aggression and administered by a revered model ie the parent. In middle class
  upbringing, physical forms of aggression are less encouraged as acceptable social behaviour and they also
  receive less punishment when they are deployed.”

            “6. The alignment of football teams is territorial. . . the large majority of supporters are drawn from
   a fairly localised territory. Unlike middle class people, whose attachment is more likely to be temporary and
   whose lives are more mobile, working class youths and adults have a very strong attachment to place” . . .

      5.47 The report continues: “It may be noted that we have not so far referred to the possibility of frustration
   which in one of the main theories of aggression is regarded as a main instigator. In football hooliganism, it is
   doubtful if it adds much strength to the explanation. If some young people are frustrated by unemployment
   and the many social deprivations to which they are exposed, this is a chronic condition and not something that
   is acutely experienced at football matches. Indeed, the reverse is more likely. It may, however, be argued thut
   the fan groups’ major aim is frustrated if its"team is defeated or one of its members unfairly treated, and that
   this frustration intensifies if the fans are prevented by the police and by the layout of the Ends from correcting
   the injustice of humiliation,”

      5.48 Finally the Report says: “It must be re-emphasised that none of the conditions we have outlined are
   enough by themselves to distinguish football from similar spectator sports such as rugby union and league,
   American baseball and football and ice hockey and so on. However, when taken in combination they amount
   to a formidable set of predisposing characteristics. It must follow that if action is to be taken to minimise the
   undesirable consequences of football, it must be taken at many points. There cannot be a single panacea.”

     5.49 The reference to Rugby League points a contrast between the atmosphere at that sport and at
   association football. I was able to watch a Rugby League club game attended by 12,500 spectators. There


                                                          ,54
     were no perimeter fences. There was no form of segregation. There were no incidents. Only some 20 police
     officers were on hand. There were large numbers of women and children present; the afternoon was an
     enjoyable day out for everyone. On the previous day when England played New Zealand, however,
     policemen had had to go onto the pitch to sort out players who were fighting among themselves.

        5.50 Professor Canter in his Report to me said: ‘'The general concern with violence, at and around football
     matches, has been the reason for a great many official and technical reports and a number of studies. From
     these examinations some general explanations of violence at football matches have been put forward. These
     explanations! do carry implications for crowd safety and control.”                                                                       t

       5.51 “The following hypotheses have been put forward to explain violence at and around football matches.
     As will be apparent the different hypotheses are not necessarily competitive or mutually exclusive, although
     they do carry differing implications for control.”

        5.52 The various explanations identified by Professor Canter are these:
      “ I.Violence is a conscious deliberate activity sought after by particular organised groups.
       2. Particular football clubs have attracted, a membership that contains small numbers of supporters groups
          that are especially prone to violent behaviour.
       3. Watching football can be an intensely rowdy activity. Under given physical or emotional circumstances
          notably on the terraces and at important major matches, this rowdyism will burst into violence.
    « 4 . Violence is'a direct product of uncontrolled confrontation between rival groups of fans.
       5. Football hooliganism is a quasi-political reaction by unemployed disaffected vouth against an uncaring
          society and against Clubs more interested in their players than in their supporters.
       6. Most aggressive behaviour among football supporters is essentially ritual not intended to lead to actual
          acts of violence. It only evolves Into violence when the ritual breaks down say due to misunderstanding
          by the supporters or the police.”

     The “new” hooligan
       5.53 Many responsible organisations and individuals I have spoken to in the course of my Inquiry
     expressed serious concern about the rise of what they saw as a new breed of football hooligan. The Leicester
     sociologists say:1
     ‘‘In our research we have been particularly interested in what the football hooligans themselves and other
     young fans call ‘fighting crews’ specially those of the ‘super hooligan groups’ which have evolved in recent
     years at some of the larger clubs.. ... One of their main distinguishing marks is the fact that they do not
     travel to matches On ‘football specials’ and official coaches but tend instead to use regular coach or rail services
     or cars and hired vans. They also eschew the forms of dress, the scarves and favours (also the club banners)
     that still tend to be widely associated with football hooligans in popular opinion. One of their main objectives
     in attending matches is to confront and fight opposing fans and to ‘take their end’. Fans of this kind travel
     without identifying colours in order to avoid advertising themselves too soon to rival fans and the police.”

       5.54 The way they operate was graphically described in a recent trial at the Old Bailey before Judge
     Hilliard.

       5.55 On the day of the offence Chelsea were due to play Cambridge United Football Club at Cambridge.
     A large police operation had been mounted involving over 400 officers. Chelsea supporters had. apparently,
     on a previous visit to Cambridge caused damage to property anu possibly to other persons. A number of
     Cambridge supporters, about 60-80 you.ng men, gathered at a public house. There was no trouble in the
     public house because police officers visited from time to time. It is clear, however, that look-outs had been
     posted so that they could give warning not only of the approach of Chelsea supporters but also of the
     police.

        5.56 The leader of the group was known as the “General” . He had been subject to a life ban from
      Cambridge United Football Club from November 1983.

        5.57 Some time about midday, a group of about 50 youths were seen running from the direction of the
      public house. They were carrying weapons in the forms of bottles or stones. A local resident realised tae>

were hunting or hounding Chelsea supporters. He could hear the sound of bottles being broken and glasses
being trampled into the ground. The Cambridge supporters proceeded to ambush and then attack the
Chelsea supporters.

   5.58 One of the accused was a;sked what he had against Chelsea supporters. He said: “They’re animals.”
And when asked what he got out of it he said: “It’s a bit of excitement. What is there in Cambridge for
young people.. . . The bastards give you a good hiding up there anyway. What Cambridge needs is something
like a Mecca.” One of the other youths said: “ I have been depressed for some time now and I formed the
opinion that if I was going to take my aggression out on anybody I may as well have one with football
supporters. I knew the people in there— [the public house I—would be looking for trouble.”

   5.59 One of the accused said: “I knew there would be trouble because other years when that many people
 meet, it always leads to trouble, and it was obvious from the talk in the pub that some people were intent on
 getting Chelsea fans on their way to the ground.” And another said: “It was obvious what was going to
 happen . . . when those teams are in town a lot of kids go out looking for trouble.”

   5.60 The Jadge said this: “Now in this case a group of youths and young adults at different times and
 varying, according to estimates, between 30 and 150 took part in attacks on Chelsea supporters between noon
 and 2 pm . . . The final exit from [the public house], about 2 pm was a determined and cunning attack by
 about 80 people. At a nearby road junction the mob split into two parts and each part then approached the
 main Newmarket Road by separate side roads, thus trapping Chelsea supporters and ordinary members of the
 public going to the football ground. The site for this was carefully chosen to permit of no escape, the main
 road at that point having iron railings upon the entire length of the centre reservation. Sticks, pool cues, bottles
‘and glasses were carried as weapons by some of those in both groups, and were used on those caught in the
 pincer movement. Some Chelsea fans escaped by jumping over the railings. One who failed to make it was hit
 over the head with a bottle and jabbed in the neck with a broken end, severing an artery, and might well have
 died but for skillful first-aid by a police officer and good medical attention. Another young man had his jaw
 broken in three places, merely for being in the way, and was kicked and beaten to the ground in front of
 ordinary men and women who were helpless to intervene.”

    5.61 “This was organised, pre-planned violence which endangered life. An experienced policeman said it was
-the worst series of indicents he had seen in ten years, and there were a number of other incidents involving
 groups of youths attacking single youths with feet and fists and weapons—too many to mention.”

    5.62 Of the leader, who was sentenced to five years imprisonment, the Judge said: “An intelligent and
 reasoned letter which I have read shows that you have some insight. . . It also shows that you are articulate,
 fluent and persuasive in a high degree.”

    5.63 Many of the accused did not fall into the so-called “ rough” working class category. One, who was
 sentenced to ten months imprisonment, was described by the Judge as having a good work record and
 attractive references. Another who had no previous convictions was described by a probation officer as
 being a very decent young man. Of another it was said by his employers, that he had worked well for them
 and that his behaviour was out of character. Yet another, was a computer engineer; he was buying his own
 home and he was engaged to be married. Another had previous exemplary character and had glowing and                    t
 unsolicited testimonials from neighbours. Another was a hard-working apprentice from a secure home
 background. Others were described as being well-employed with good references, coming from good homes;
 yet another was described as having an exemplary lifestyle, a committed Christian.

   5.64 An example of the ingenuity of the modern hooligan was given to me by one police force. One
 group of hooligans in order to avoid detection by the police on a visit to an away-match, hired morning
 suits and travelled by British Rail having persuaded the authorities that they were going to a wedding.

    5.65 The evidence given to me also shows that one characteristic of today’s hooligan is that often he
 quite deliberately does not take alcohol in order better to carry out his part in the planned operation and
 to keep his mind clear.

 The Scottish experience
   5.66 A study, sponsored by the Football Trust on crowd behaviour at football matches, was carried out
 by a research team from the Centre for Leisure Research, Dunfermline College of Physical Education (then
 part of Edinburgh University) between 1982 and 1984, and was published in January 1984.

                                                          56
   5.67 It is clear from that Report, from my discussions with Mr Coalter (who was a leader of the research
team) and from evidence which I received, both from the Scottish police and the football authorities, that
there are a number of significant differences between what happens in Scotland and in England,

   5.68 The Dunfermline study investigated three football clubs, namely, Glasgow Rangers, Glasgow Celtic
and Aberdeen Football Club. Overall they drew a number of conclusions. They found: “Scottish Clubs and
their supporters [were] distinct from those south of the border and as such [merited| study in their own right.”
They concluded that both Aberdeen and Rangers retained more traditional community links and further,
that: “ The relatively low level of commercialism and the rather more traditional, even populist, links between
the Clubs and their supporters mean that the various theories developed largely on the basis of English evidence
to explain the meaning and significance of the game to supporters (and in particular the roots of football
hooliganism) appear less applicable in Scotland.” The study continues: “In addition, soccer related violence
in Scotland is also distinct from that in England in that it tends to be fuelled by sectarian antagonism. Some
of the forces which tend to promote and encourage violence therefore are well outside professional football
and have long historical roots”.

    5.69 One of thl significant developments in Scottish football has been the emergence of the so-called
 “Casuals”. They were originally so named because of their clothing. They originated in Aberdeen probably
 from copying the style of some English supporters and have now spread to a large number of clubs. They
 attach themselves to a club and adopt its name. They are bent on fighting the opposition fans in order to
^enhance their own prestige.

   5.70 When I talked to Mr Coalter he was somewhat sceptical about the significance of the “Casuals’*.
 Mr Coalter’s view was that they were comparatively unimportant, that the label was simply attached to
 them by the media and that they represented no more than a very small minority of football supporters.
 The Casuals are however, in the view of the police, a very real problem. They are well organised, appear
 to have money and cause a great deal of trouble, particularly outside the football grounds-

   5.71 Other evidence I have received from responsible people tends to suggest that under whatever name
 they use, the Casuals are a greater problem than hitherto. They travel more widely, are very much better
 organised and tend to seek out their opponents in areas away from football grounds like city centres where
 the police are less prepared for them.
    5.72The Dunfermline report goes on: “Surveys at the three Clubs demonstrate that the popular stereotype
 of football supporters as male working class adults is only partly true. Although still predominantly male the
 survey has revealed that the supporters at three Stadiums were predominantly in the younger age group (under
 30) in the skilled occupational groups, whether white-collar or blue-collar but with a significant proportion
 from the professional and intermediate white-collar occupations.” The Report points out a difference between
 Rangers, which attracts a high proportion of the traditional or working class supporters, while at Aberdeen
 there is a significantly larger proportion of white-collar workers.
    5.73    The Report continues: “The analysis of the data on arrests for football related offences confirms the
 conclusions of the McElhone Report that the number of arrested per thousand spectators is extremely low.
 Moreover a small number of matches account for a large proportion of the total arrests and a large number
 of the arrests occur at games in which tensions are heightened by sectarian rivalries. The majority of offenders
 are arrested for forms of vocal aggression and the types of offences commonly associated in the public mind
 with hooliganism - physical violence, damage to property, pitch invasions - form a relative small proportion
 of the total. As such it is argued that much of the disorder which does occur might more aptly be labelled
 rowdyism than hooliganism.” The Report continues: “Seating and segregation have in combination contributed
 to the reduction in level of crowd disorder within stadiums. The segregation of opposing fans within the ground
 is regarded by the police as perhaps the biggest single contribution in the reduction in crowd disorder.

 • 5.74 The Dunfermline Study goes on to say that while the problem of crowd disorder within stadia is
 largely contained, “ if crowd disorder occurs it is more likely to occur outside the stadium after the game.
  Furthermore the offences committed outside the stadiums are more likely to be violent in nature than those
 inside. Ironicallv while solving crowd problems within stadiums, an unintended consequence of the segregation
 of large crowds’mav be to provide the potential conditions for disorder outside the grounds. Segregated and
 coherent groups may provide the basis for the continuation of forms of behaviour which while tolerated inside
  the ground, quickly become defined as unacceptable outside. Many of the officers interviewed saw the major
  issue of football related crowd disorder as being the inconvenience to local residents and damage to property
  outside stadiums; however there was a recognition that given the random nature and geographical spread of
  many of these incidents they pose a difficult problem to combat”.

                                                        57
Experience elsewhere
   5.75 The experience in America and elsewhere is not substantially different. Dr Goldstein, of the
Department of Psychology of Temple University, Philadelphia, reviews (in “Sports Violence” 1), a series of
articles by distinguished international experts, indicating that aggressive sports tend to increase not only
the aggression of those who participate but of also some of those who watch. The argument is that fans
who get caught up in outright violence do not seem to be psychologically different from most other fans,
but the one difference is that they are almost universally young men, some of whom come to sports events
in the hope of a battle;

   5.76 On the question of the relationship between aggression on the field and aggression off the field, the
emerging view was that the particularly brutal and angry aggression that is virtually an integral part of
some forms of competitive sport increases the likelihood of imitative violence among crowds dominated
by young adult males. One of the articles suggests, for example, that anonymity and excitement allows fans
to put aside more readily the inhibitions that would keep them from being openly aggressive in other
situations. Violence on the playing field then holds out to them an example they are more likely to follow.
Drinking adds to that likelihood.

  5.77 In the articles there is also a good deal of support for the view that “perceived injustice” is an
important cause Of much violence among spectators. Put another way a spectator who thinks his team has
been unjustly treated will react violently and aggressively. Certainly, anyone who has been present at a
football match is well aware that the referee’s decision can give rise to considerable controversy, not only
among players on the field, but among spectators in the stands and on the terraces. Bad refereeing has
always led to problems on the field because players are only too ready to take advantage of any weakness
they perceive, or alternatively to redress the balance of what they perceive was an injustice by taking the
law into their own hands.

   5.78 There are, of course, a great number of well-documented outbreaks of violence at sports grounds
which have resulted from a disputed decision by an official. For example on 24 May 1964 there was a
soccer match between Peru and Argentina. With two minutes left in the contest, Argentina was leading
 1-0. Peru then scored. However, the goal was disallowed by the referee because of rough play. Fans broke
W t6 the 'field,' the match was suspended, more fans crashed onto the field, the police fired revolvers and
tear gas and the crowd panicked. As a result of the riot, some 300 spectators were killed.

  5.79 The various types o f disorders are classified in “Sports Violence” into five major categories. They
are:
       1. Frustration disorders They occur when spectators’ expectations of access to the game and the way it
          will be played or adjudicated are thwarted. Included in this is “perceived injustice” when a source of
          frustration occurs as when fans believe that an incompetent or biased official has cost their team
          victory.
      2. Outlawry disorders They occur when groups of violence-prone spectators use sports events to act out
         theiranti-social activities by attacking officials, fighting with rival fans and destroying property. Such
        • crowd violence is seen as the work of a delinquent or criminal element.
      3. Remonstrance disorders They occur when a section of a crowd uses a sports event as an arena for
         the expression of political grievances.
      4. Confrontation disorders They break out when spectators fro/n rival religious, geographic, ethnic or
         national groups come into conflict. Given the appropriate circumstances, smouldering resentment can
         easily spark into open hostility, so that local Derby games where regional supremacy is at stake are
         an ideal setting for confrontation riots.
      5. Finally, there is what is called an expressive riot, which is the intense emotional arousal which
         accompanies victory or defeat, particularly if it is exciting or unexpected and uninhibited behaviour
         is then triggered.

  What is apparent from the above categorisation, if is said, is that no single control measure could cope
with all the triggers of disorder and that action which might be suitable for one situation could be
inappropriate in another.                                                  .       ______ _______ _

                                                                 58
 Extreme Political Activity
   5.80 There is a substantial body of evidence that political activists are present at football grounds in
 England although it seems not to be a problem in Scotland. Football grounds are used in order to recruit
 new members and leaflets are passed out. There is no doubt that at football grounds there are a number
 of people who belong to extreme political parties and they are there often in a group. Equally it is evident
 that some of them take part in the disorders which occur.

    5.81 There is also widespread evidence of the presence of small groups of National Front and similar
 supporters at football matches, of the giving of Nazi salutes, of the distribution of literature and of the
 chanting of racist slogans. They boast in their publications of these activities. Further, a number of their
 supporters have been convicted of criminal offences arising from the use of violence at football grounds.
 But that does not prove the assertion that it is they who are responsible for violence on the terraces. The
 evidence which is available to me, from football clubs generally and from the police in all parts of the
 country, is that while they constitute a presence at a number of football grounds where they recruit and
 cause trouble by racist chanting, there is little to connect them with organised violence. The considered
 view of the police w£o spoke to me seems to be that their importance at football grounds is a self importance
 and that they are not a significant factor in the problems with which I am dealing.

    5.82 That is not to say that anyone, particularly those with memories of events since 1936, should take
     omplacent attitude towards their activities. Nor is it necessary to approve of the contents of their

 •   gazines. However in the search for answers to trouble at football grounds, it is right that too much
     importance Should not be attached to their activities.                            -

    5.83 This view is confirmed by the statistics in the report to my Inquiry prepared by Professor Canter.
 He said: “Where terracing is seen as the physical basis of violence, political activities are seen as the social
 cause. As with terraces, removing political activity would not solve the problem of football hooliganism.
 However it is important to identify the extent of any conscious involvement by such groups as the National
 Front in crowd violence. We therefore asked a question carefully phrased to see if there were any direct
 evidence for the involvement of political groups as seen by our respondents and if there was any difference
 between the clubs in this. After a general question on people’s thoughts we asked for any concrete evidence
 that they might have ‘in their own experience.’ In effect we were asking almost one thousand witnesses
 throughout the country whether they could give any first hand evidence to support the view that political groups
 are involved in crowd trouble.” The question was: “ Do you think that organised political groups such as the
 National Front are involved in crowd trouble?” The answers were:
                                                          Yes         No
                         Celtic                           39          61

                         Chelsea                          65          35

                         Millwall                         43          57
                         Fulham                           48          52
                         Southampton                      55          45

     5.84 Professor Canter Continues: “When it comes to actual evidence the picture becomes more hazy.
. Although 162 of our respondents said they had direct evidence of National Front involvement, closer examination
  reveals that a number of those based that on media reports. All in all, about 10% of our respondents appear
  to have first hand knowledge of National Front activities.”

    5.S5     It is interesting to see what this “political” group was actually doing. Professor Canters figures
  show that 194 respondents had witnessed involvement and that 34 incidents involved either starting a fight
  or fighting. However, Professor Canter reports that most of those who said they saw fights were in fact
  quoting media reports. The evidence of these respondent makes it clear chat the majority of those involved
  uere distributing literature, chanting or making gestures or displaying or wearing signs or symbols.

    5.86 This sample accords with the other evidence which has been presented to me.

                                                        59
Unemployment
   5.87     There have been a number of suggestions that unemployment is the cause of people being violent
at football matches. One might certainly expect it to be so. Those who have nothing to do to absorb their
time and interest are those most likely to get up to mischief; they have not the dignity of labour and the
discipline of the workplace. Historically, however, there is little evidence to support that view, nor is the
statistical evidence clear. Surprisingly, such evidence as there is, is to the contrary—viz the absence of any
obvious increase of violence in the 1930s when there was widespread unemployment; the increase of football
violence in the 1960s when there was little unemployment; the ability of large numbers of troublemakers
to travel long distances at considerable expense; the recent use of £1 coins as weapons; the wearing of
fashionable and expensive clothing; and the evidence relating to the employment of those convicted. Nor
do any of the football clubs or authorities, or the police, or the fans to whom I have spoken give support
to the theory. That a number of unemployed behave like hooligans is undeniable—that they are hooligans
simply because they are unemployed is not by any means clear.

My own conclusions
 * 5.88 I must have read some thirty or forty reports, studies or books, where an attempt has been made
to analyse the problem. I am certainly more knowledgeable on the subject of football hooliganism. Whether
I am any wiser I doubt.

   5.89 I have had the opportunity myself of attending a number of football matches incognito. I have
talked to fans on the terraces and observed their behaviour. I have discussed the problem with Professor
Canter, with Mr Coalter, with the Leicester sociologists, with groups of football supporters, with the police
and football authorities and many other experienced observers.

  5.90 I am of the view:
       I   (a) That there has always been a group, albeit a small group who find violence attractive; who
                 currently find the football ground a convenient theatre for their violence and the football match
                 the occasion for display of their aggressive tendencies which on other days and at other times
                 they will be exhibiting in public houses, the city centre or elsewhere. Their main target at
            -■'V football grounds is opposing fans. They choose to exercise that violence at a football match
                 for a number of simple reasons. The date and place of a match are fixed; the nature of the
                 opposition is known; its presence is certain, so is that of the police. Their own support is
                 knowm Its presence too is certain. The battle lines can be drawn. Thus plans can be made well
                 in advance for the particular acts of violence that they intend to create.
           (b) And while there is a good deal of academic support for the view that violence was at one time
               the prerogative of the so called “rough” working class that is no longer the complete picture
               today. A majority of today’s hooligans no doubt do fit into that category, but some do not.
               They come from a variety of backgrounds, many have reasonable jobs and earn a proper liviflfc
           (c) Whether they are motivated by the same reasons as their predecessors can only be a matter
               of conjecture; there seems little reason however to believe otherwise.
      II   (a) A second group imitates the first element I have identified. Thus those not particularly given
               to violence witness violence in others and see it being exercised, without let or hinderance.
               People expect the spectators on the terraces to behave in an aggressive way and to use foul
               language. It then becomes accepted and the norm and thus becomes a part of the pattern of
               life which would not be tolerated elsewhere. This knock-on effect can be seen in violence in
               the streets of our cities, unconnected with football.
           (b) The feeling of anonymity in the crowd gives rise to a loss of inhibition and self-discipline. The
               association with those of similar disposition, the enthusiasm and the partisan support for the
               team, which itself causes an atmosphere, all create a situation which can readily give rise to
               violence.

     III       Then there is a third group (not always separate from the other two groups) who cause violence
               for a reason, either real or supposed. It may be an inability quickly to get into the ground; it
               may be the presence of rival spectators in a part of the ground to which the fans think they
               have a claim.

     IV        Finally there are those, the vast majority of spectators, who abhor violence and wish only for
               an afternoon of pleasure at a football match.

                                                      60
  5.91 Whether it is ever possible, by altering in some way the structure of society, so chat there are not
people to whom violence is of itself attractive, has given rise to considerable debate. There are, of course,
very many factors which cause a person to have an aggressive disposition. Heredity and environment are
such uncertain barometers of interaction that it is too simple to say, improve the environment and violence
will disappear. Neither of course should be ignoredt

  5.92 I have therefore sadly to conclude that there has always been violence in the world and that there
always will be violence; and that however close social scientists get to determining the true cause of violence
on the football terraces, no complete cure can be prescribed, even for the very long term.

  5.93 It is clear however that there are a considerable number of preventive measures at sports grounds
which can properly and reasonably be taken. These I have set out in Chapter 4 of this Report. By taking
proper preventive measures it may be possible to stop violence inside a sports ground. So far as violence
generally is concerned, I would like to be able to say there is a simple cure. There is not. It would be doing
a grave disservice to suggest otherwise.

Postscript             t
   5.94 I do not pretend that my Report can be all embracing or provide a simple solution to a complex
 problem. There is no panacea. There is no one solution to the problem of violence. More particularly it is
 to be hoped that if violence within the football ground is contained, it will not re-emerge elsewhere. I
jpnfess I do not feel sanguine about that.

  5.95 I trust that by publicly canvassing the problems which affect the game, -both in my Reports and
during the course of the Inquiry and also by stimulating discussions, at all levels, both inside and outside
the game, it may be possible for solutions to emerge so that the national game can regain some of its
former glory. Nor should we ever forget the tragic events which gave rise to my Reports.

  5.96 Although this is my Final Report, the problems of football will continue long after I have returned
to the more familiar and less turbulent routine of my judicial duties. I therefore leave my task adopting
the words of Matthew Arnold;
             ....................   '>‘Peace,p eaceis what I seek and public calm;
                                     Endless extinction of unhappy hates.”                   ,

             to the Belgian House o f Representatives o f 9 July 1985 (translatedfrom the House o f Representatives
             document)

             Terms o f reference:
             The causes, circumstances and lessons to be drawn from the tragic events occurring during the
             Liverpool/Juventus match on Wednesday 29 May 1985.


             AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE TWO FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS (UEFA-BELGIAN
             FOOTBALL UNION (RBFA))                        .

page 73* It should be emphasised from the outset that it was the British supporters who mounted the
         disastrous charge into Section Z. They bear the main responsibility for the terrible events that
         followed and this must remain the case whatever blame might be attributed to others for having
         aggravated the matter.

             There is absolutely no doubt but that the organisers, the RBFA and UEFA were familiar with
             the usual behaviour of the English supporters. This is all the more clear from the fact that people
             were sufficiently concerned for the Brussels Police to send a representative to Liverpool to assess
             the situation. The gendarmerie, who were also invited, did not consider it necessary to send a
             representative.

            The Board of Liverpool FC has made known that it took a number of precautions . . . The Club
            made reassuring statements confirming that its supporters were amongst the most placid in Great
            Britain and that, moreover, the Club could identify all the ticket holders.

            The British Transport Police representatives gave the same kind of reassurance . . . Moreover,
            the RBFA the evening before the match made statements to the same effect and confirmed that
            the match had been perfectly well organised.

            It is nevertheless true that despite the reassuring statements made by UEFA, who should have
            been and perhaps were better informed of the realities of the matter and despite the precautions
            taken . . . some English supporters or so called supporters (a limited number, it is true) became
            a murderous rabble.


            THE ORGANISERS OF THE MATCH

            (a) Organisation o f the match '                                                  -
            It is important to recall that the duty placed on the RBFA and, beyond them UEFA, was to
            guarantee the safety of spectators and in this context it was their responsibility to take the
            necessary precautions and in particular apply the UEFA rules. However, both the RBFA
            and UEFA seemed more concerned with financial and commercial considerations than safety
            precautions.

page 74 The ticket sales . . , got completely out of hand. It has been established that a large number of
        tickets for Section Z (a neutral zone where there should under no circumstances have been any
        Italian supporters) were sold to Italians . . . large quantities of tickets were sold to travel agents,
        football clubs and others without their having been asked to give any written guarantee whatever
        that they would not sell tickets to Italians. The sale of tickets at Heysel Stadium (theoretically
        restricted to five tickets per person) was organised in such a way that anyone, including Italians,
        could get tickets for Section Z without any problems at all. This is in contravention not only of
        UEFA directives but also contrary to the arrangements agreed before the match. Such a procedure
'R eferences to pages are to pages in the H ouse o f Representative docum ent 1232 (I9 8 4 -5 )/l-2
               was bound to create a black market.

               The next point is the requirement to separate opposing supporters within the stadium. There is
               a specific UEFA ruling on this.

               It is clear that natural animosity developed into altercations, fights and charges; the third of these
               had tragic consequences and could no doubt have been avoided had there not been so many
               Italian supporters in Section Z. It is clear that the ticket sales organised by the RBFA were a
               decisive element in this and they are to blame in that respect.

               This, together with the absence of an adequate buffer zone . . . as well as the weakness of the
               fencing separating Sections Z and X-Y, meant that the safety precautions were even less effective.

                It is amazing that knowing about the significance of the black market, the organisers did not
                warn the forces of law and order of the potential danger.

                   *It was decided to create an enclosed area around the outside of the stadium using Heras
                                                                                                                          I
                fencing. The idea was in fact to operate a kind of filtering procedure which would allow spectators
                to be searched as soon as they went through into the enclosures. In fact the fencing proved totally
                inadequate and in so far as it could be considered as much a psychological as a physical barrier,
                the fact was that it could not fulfill this function. It would have been more helpful to have
                passageways or gangways which could have allowed spectators to be shepherded.

                The way in which the match was organised testifies to routine and a lack of seriousness. A number
                of ambiguous decisions were taken . . . the RFBA preparations for the match were too informal,
                no prior agenda for meetings; no regular membership; no minutes. Even if it was only some of
                the decisions which were ambiguous, it remains the case that, for example, failure to decide clearly
                how the gangways between the sections should have been set up and manned was one of the
                causes of the tragedy.

                (b) Lessors and owners o f the stadium
     page 75        The condition of the stadium appeared dilapidated on the occasion of our visit. . . structures
                were deteriorating, columns, crash-barriers and steps. It is also clear that the terracing itself had
                been neglected and had not been the subject of the kind of normal maintenance work which is
                required in a stadium of this size. This made it easy for the supporters to obtain missiles.
                Moreover, the narrowness of the gangways and of the few entrances at the top of the stadium,
                as well as the fact that there were only three exits at the bottom, caused problems when it came
                to evacuation.

                 These problems were exacerbated by the fact that the lower gates could only be opened from the
                 pitch side. According to the organisers and the forces of law and order, the intention was to
               ' make it possible for evacuation to take place in the event of trouble while allowing the forces of
                 law and order to intervene as necessary. . . .

                 It seems surprising that the general regulations relating to safety at work should not be applicable
                 in this instance. If this is the case, then they should be applied . . . certain basic facilities were
                 lacking. There were only a few fixed telephones, which is inexcusable. It is essential that if
                 gatherings on this scale are to be organised there should be an on-the-spot command post where
                 the organisers and forces of law and order can meet. . . .                                               j

.#               It is reasonable to emphasise the responsibilities of UEFA in this respect. In February 1985, the
                 organisation was content to devote less than an hour to the inspection of the stadium and did
                 not comment on its condition.

                 The Authorities
                 A. The local police
                 Precautions made
                 It is part of the duty of the police to implement the provisions of the document Crowd Violence

                                                             72
               at Sports Grounds”. . . . This document, drawn up at the suggestion of the RBFA, in consultation
               with the police was issued by the Ministry of the Interior in the form of guidance on theI7th
               February 1974. It would not appear that the police took any measures to implement the provisions
               of this document.. . .

page 77 Specific preparations
               The police took part in preparatory meetings. . . . On the occasion of these meetings, those                                     ••

               involved apparently discussed all the measures to be taken at the ground as well as transport,
               the arrival of the supporters, the sale of tickets, liaison and co-ordination of the activities of the
               police and the gendarmerie, all organisation of parking facilities, organisation of emergency
               services and sale of alcoholic drinks.                                                                                           -
      :                       \             .                       .                     . .          .                               :    ■■■;<
               . . . the emergency services were not specifically invited to these meetings, nothing was said about
               the condition of the stadium and again no minutes were taken setting out the decisions which                                     v
               had been reached during the meetings.                                                                                        ■■■ ^
               . . . the reports on these meetings were drawn up in retrospect: there is no way to be sure of the                               1
               number of participants, their rank, their precise identity or what they said . . .

               The day o f the 29th May 1985                                                                                                j
page 78 .   There was fighting in the streets from the morning onwards. This fighting was caused by                                        -y j'
        persons under the influence of alcohol. The police decided to limit their interventions in order to
        avoid more serious trouble. . . . Nothing was done to curb the consumption of alcoholic drinks
        on the public highway or the sale of the same.
               One is entitled to question whether everything necessary was done to prevent the troubles which
               occurred later.

               Heras fencing had been erected around the stadium but this perimeter fence was not sufficiently                                       (
               well supervised . . .
               The police arrived at the stadium in good time, they were nonetheless unable to carry out a                                           j
               complete search of the spectators because of a shortage of men (only forty available). Confiscated
               items could not be kept away from the supporters because of a lack of containers. Efforts were
               made to compensate for this by collecting confiscated items by van.
               Fifty men were placed between Sections M, N -0 but they were forced to retreat at about 6.30
               pm because of the agression of the Italian supporters. The gangways were so structured that it
               was not possible to keep officers on the steps.
               The police could not prevent supporters from invading the pitch. Lumps of concrete torn from                                          -

               The police communications system worked well. The police did what was necessary to maintain                                           j
               adequate liaison with the gendarmerie.

          It should be pointed out that Captain Mahieu had not been invited to any of the meetings in
          question.

          4. Action within the stadium
page 81   . . . no member of the gendarmerie who participated in the preparatory meeting was present at
          the Heysel Stadium on the day of the match . . . the Commission considered whether it would
          be appropriate to establish a command post at the stadium or even two, one inside one outside.
          Although the Commission did not feel qualified to form a judgment on this, it considers that the
          point should be made.

          5. Divisions o f tasks within the squadron
          The Commission regrets that within Alpha Squadron there was no precise division of tasks
          between the Commander and his deputy. It was obvious that at certain times both officers were
          together inside the stadium and at other times they were together outside the stadium.

          Tbis was all the more unacceptable because of the inadequacy o f the radio communications.

          The provisions of messengers seems to have made up in some degree for the radio communication
          problems referred to below but according to the witness, these messengers could not in any event
          fulfill their purpose because of the density of the crowd.
                                                                                    -

            •                                                                                ' :
page 82 6. Communications arrangements and equipment
          . . . numerous means o f communicating information were provided.
               ■                         -                                             '                          -
          There were communication links between the Special Branch and the command post, and between
          the police and the gendarmerie both inside and outside the stadium. In addition to these, radio
          contact between police and gendarmerie was assured by liaison officers at HQ, the command post
          and at the ground. In the end, this adds up to an unwieldy system. Perhaps this is the price to
          be paid for trying to ensure that two separate forces, the police and the gendarmerie, worked
          together without losing their separate identities.

          Communications between the Special Branch and the command post did not operate well . . .
          the poor condition of the equipment was mainly to blame. But it is also probable that the Special
          Branch was not properly briefed.

          At the gendarmerie headquarters, messages are recorded by a shorthand writer, who typed the
          messages as they were received. It would appear that the messages were recorded only selectively.

          Communications between the platoons and-their commanding officer did not take place under
          ideal conditions; the Captain commanding in the stadium went outside. No communication was
          possible with him thereafter and this at the very time when the tragedy occurred.
          Even when the radios were working, their effectiveness was reduced by the ambient noise level.
          The gendarmerie niust have known this would happen. One must ask why messengers were not
          used for these communications.

          It is clear from witness statements that communications between the command post and the
          stadium ware not operating properly . . . this means that at a time when it would have been
          useful to call in reserves, the command post was not receiving sufficiently precise information
          from the stadium.
          There are several statements about the state of the equipment. General Bernaert said that the               **
          sets were good quality ones but that there was trouble with the cadmium nickel batteries. The
          batteries were old and, moreover, were not properly used.
          . . . insufficient attention was paid to checking whether those using the equipment were doing so
          in the correct manner.

 Chairman

 WORKING GROUP ON THE GREEN GUIDE
    Ei. Shortly after publication of your Interim Report you asked me to establish a Working Group of
 appropriately qualified scientifical and technical persons who had practical experience of safety at sports
 grounds to assist the Inquiry in its task of reviewing the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
 (the “Green Guide"). As you know, and with the kind cooperation of the Home Office, Scottish Office,
 Department of Environment, local authority associations and technical consultants to the Inquiry, I was
 able to form such a group and this met for a full week (23-28 September) under my Chairmanship.

   E2. Our terms o f reference were: “To review the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
 (Football) - “the Green Guide” - and to make recommendations to the Committee of Inquiry on Crowd
 Safety and Control at Sports Grounds as to amendments or additions considered necessary to the Green
 Guide published in 1976.” A record of the membership of the Group appears later in this appendix.

   E3.1 am pleased to be able to report that the Working Group completed its work satisfactorily and that
it was found possible on the final day of the Group’s week to reach general agreement on the various
recommendations for changes which we wished to see made to the Guide. I have since prepared a self-
contained note of these points and have put the Group’s deliberations into ihe form of recommendations
for you. This note is set out below for your consideration. I support these recommendations.

   E4. As you will see there are, in total, some 63 recommendations. This should not be taken in any way,
however, as an adverse judgment upon the current Guide. The substantive advice in the Guide stood up
remarkably well to a week of detailed scrutiny by experts and fully justifies the high esteem and confidence
in which it is generally- and internationally - held.

   E5. It remains only for me to record my gratitude to the members of the Group who gave up so much
of their valuable time to assist the Committee in its task; to my fellow Assessor, Mr Alan Goodson, for
his encouragement, support and practical advice throughout the week; and to Mr Mark de Pulford for his
excellent work as Secretary.

                                                                             y       MARTIN KILLORAN
                                                                                 Fire Assessor to theinquiry

                                     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

          STRUCTURE OF THE GREEN GUIDE
             E6. The Working Group was dissatisfied with the structure of the current Guide and recom-
Rec I     mends that the Green Guide should be reorganised so as to reflect more closely the needs o f its
          target audience. (The Group agreed that the target audience of the Guide comprises: (a) sports
          ground management in designated and undesignated grounds; (b) engineers, designers and others
          engaged in the improvement, design appraisal or refurbishment of sports stadia to certificable
          standards; and (c) local authorities responsible for enforcing the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
          1975.) The Group considered that, following a general introduction which describes the scope of
          the Guide, sets the scene and briefly discusses the nature and extent of risks to the public at
          sports grounds, the guidance should be re-arranged so as to deal first with general management
          responsibilities and major planning and design matters. (Guidance on these matters should, where
          practicable, include methods for assessing the general safety condition of a ground and the need
          for detailed drawings and plans.) The succeeding categories of detailed guidance should each be
          preceded by a statement of the genera! functional requirement or aim and should include as much
          appraisal, fiosv and other diagrams as may conveniently be arranged. The Group considered that
          a possible scheme for the categories of advice in the Green Guide was: Fire (to include a checklist
          and appraisal flow diagram and reference to the need for professional advice). Structural Appraisal
          (to include a method for appraising existing structures and reference to the need for professional
          advice). Ground Control and Ground Management (to identify responsibilities and duties), and
          Inspections, Tests and Maintenance.
Rec 2     E7. The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to the production by the
        Home Office, or other appropriate body, o f summary documents, training aids and seminars for
        sports ground management explaining the provisions o f the Green Guide and their application.

        INTRODUCTION
          E8. The current Guide is aimed at soccer and rugby grounds (GG (Green Guide, 1976 Edition,
        paragraph): 1:1).

          The Group decided that many of the recommendations in the Green Guide are relevant to
Rec 3   outdoor sports other than football and recommends that the Introduction should say that the
        Guide is applicable as a code o f good practice fo r all sports grounds. The Green Guide should
Rec 4   make it clear, however, that it does not cover measures to ensure the safety o f spectators from
        hazards presented by the sport itself.

          E9. The Group noted that the references in the Guide to the Building Regulations for England
        and Wales would need to be revised and brought up to date. It was further noted that in Scotland,
        the Building Standards (Scotland) Regulations gave requirements for the construction, alteration,
        extension and change of use of buildings, and included standards in respect of means of escape
        from fire including emergency lighting, access for fire-fighters as well as structural fire precautions.
        The Group recommends that full account should be taken of national Building Regulations in
        the Green Guide.

        IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEMS                              '
           E10. The current Guide discerns three particular types of safety problem to be considered
        within a football ground and its immediate surroundings (GG: 2.1 to 2.4): (a) those physical
        hazards which may cause individuals to trip, slip or fall; (b) crowd pressures which may be built
        up in normal circumstances (particularly on terraces and exit routes); and (c) crowd pressures
        which may be built up under abnormal conditions. The Group considered that this analysis was
        correct. However, it felt that the need to tackle these problems should be covered in a new self-
        contained section defining, in general terms, good safety design in sports stadia and enumerating
        other important needs such as managing and controlling crowds, maintaining effective fire
        precautions, making proper provision for the disabled and achieving a reasonable standard of
Rec 5   comfort and convenience for spectators. Accordingly, the Group recommends the incorporation
        o f a new self-contained section on good safety design in sports stadia.

        GENERAL CONSTRUCTION
           El 1. The current Guide recommends that all components and installations should be designed,
        constructed, installed and maintained so as “ to perform safely their required functions” and that
        they should be in accordance with good engineering and building practice, especially as set out
        in all revelant British Standards and Codes of Practice (GG: 3.1).

          The Group approved this recommendation but felt that the reference to British Standards
        might be improved so as to identify those parts of British Standards which are wholly applicable
Rec 6   in the circumstances of the case. The Group recommends that references in the Guide to British
        Standards should be improved accordingly.

           E12. The current Guide recommends that all electrical installations should comply with the
        current edition of the regulations of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (GG: 3.2). The Group
Rec 7   considered that it would be reasonable in some circumstances for the enforcing authority to accept
        a certificate o f satisfaction from a chartered electrical engineer in lieu o f fu ll compliance with current
        IEE Regulations and recommends that the Guide so advises. The Group also recommends a
Rec S   reference to BS 5266: Pt 1 in respect o f emergency lighting.

          E l3. The current Guide recommends that all parts of the ground used by the general public
        should have a minimum headroom of 2.4 metres (GG: 3.5).

           The Group could find no clear foundation for this advice and, accordingly, recommends that
Rec 9   in respect o f headroom the Guide should simply advise conformity to appropriate building regulations.

                                                       78
             INSPECTIONS AN D TESTS
               E l4. The current Guide recommends:
               (i) A detailed annual inspection to ensure compliance with the Green Guide (GG: 4.1);
              (ii) A general visual inspection following each event for damage which might create a potential
                   hazard (GG; 4.2); and, .
              (iii) Testing of crush barriers in accordance with the Guide on installation and subsequently,
                    normally, at intervals of several years (GG: 4.3).
   Rec 10      The Group recommends that the routine general visual inspection by management advised in the
             Guide should also cover features which might reduce the degree o f fire protection offered and that
   Rec 11    there should also be a warning in the Guide against storing hazardous materials under or near stands.
   Rec 12    The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to the inclusion o f additional
             guidance to certifying authorities as to the frequency and content o f inspections.
   Rec 13      E l 5. Tpe Group recommends that regular emergency evacuation drills fo r members o f staff
             should be recommended in the Guide.

                E16. On the testing of crush barriers (GG: 4.3 and Appendix C of the Guide) the Group had
             before it no evidence that the current guidance had permitted dangerous or defective crush
             barriers. However, it seemed to a minority of the Group that certain anomalies exist in the current
             recommendations in the Green Guide as to load factors and testing (for example the table of
             strengths for new crush barriers permitted a different design strength for the bars and posts than
             for the foundations); and there was some evidence that enforcing authorities were unclear as to
   Rec 14    the correct procedures. The Group recommends that representatives o f the local authorities, the
             Home Office and appropriately qualified advisers should, together, review the Guide’s recommenda­
             tions on the design and testing o f crush barriers in more detail with a view to clarifying the guidance
             in future editions o f the Guide (see also paragraph 28 below).

   Rec 15       E l7. The Group further recommends that the Guide should advise that any automatic fire
             protection equipment or emergency lighting system should be tested regularly in accordance with
             relevant British Standard codes o f practice.

             INGRESS TO THE GROUND
               E l8. The Guide currently recommends that the number and location of turnstiles should be
             planned to achieve the smallest crowd waiting for admission that is consistent with the rate at
             which spectators can be distributed inside the ground (GG: 5.1). The Group recommends that
   Rec 16    more detailed guidance to management as to contingency planning in the event o f unusual pressures
             and frustrations (including a reference to the value o f centralised computer-based monitoring)
^ S .ec 17   should be given. The Group further recommends that the Guide emphasise that turnstiles are not
             acceptable as a means o f escape from a ground.
                                                                                                             9

                E l9. The Group considered it desirable that the Guide should specify a notional maximum
   Rec 18    free flow rate past a turnstile. The Group recommends that further consideration be given to
             defining a maximum notional flow rate past turnstiles for incorporation in a future edition o f the
             Green Guide.

               E20. The Guide currently recommends that fences forming the boundary to a ground should
             be of “appropriate height and strength” to avoid spectators gatecrashing (GG: 5.2). The Group
   Rec 19    recommends that boundary walls and gates and any other structure forming part o f the boundary
             should also be o f appropriate height and strength to avoid gatecrashing.

             EGRESS FROM THE GROUND
             E21. Currently, Section 6 of the Guide makes a number of general recommendations as to
           egress from a sports grounds (GG: 6.1 to 6.13). The Group was generally content with these but
           recommends that the wording in paragraph 6.13 of the Guide should be revised to make it clear
   Rec 20, that escape routes are not to be regarded as an alternative provision only fo r use in emergency. The
   Rec 21 Group further recommends that guidance should be included to the effect that doors on exit


                                                           79
Rec 22    routes should always open outwards: and that, where practicable, exit gates should be sited adjacent
          to entrances.

Rec 23       E22. The Group recommends that a study should be undertaken o f the current use and effectiveness
          o f the exit route signposting and exit marking systems recommended in the Green Guide ( GG: 6.6),
          and that consideration should be given to commissioning further research in this area.

          TERRACES AND STANDS

          Safe capacity of terraces
              E23. The Guide currently suggests that the exits from each areas of spectator accommodation
          should be so designed that the spectator can leave that area in eight minutes or less (GG: 6.5).
Rec 24    The Group concluded that this so-called “eight minute rule" was concerned solely with the effect
           o f crowd turbulence (arising from delays in evacuating specator accommodation) on the rate o f
          flow. It was not related to emergency evacuation time criteria (see paragraph 32 below) and the
           Group recommends that the Guide should make this clear.
                s

          Terrace packing densities
           - E24. The Guide recommends packing densities between the limits of 27 and 54 persons per
          10m2 depending on the condition of the terrace or slope and on the extent to which crush barriers
          conform to the Green Guide guidelines on spacing (GG: 15.4). Recommended flow rates from
          the terraces are given at paragraph 16 of the Guide.

             The Group concluded that the flow rates and permissible spectator densities in the Guide were
          satisfactory and reasonable when taken as a whole and that they accorded with experience.
Rec 25    However, the Group recommends that flow rate and packing criteria and their relationship ( if
          any) with those criteria given in respect o f emergency evacuation and crowd turbulences should be
          set out and explained more clearly in the Guide and that further advice should be given as to how
          interpolation between the wide limits suggested in respect o f terrace packing densities may properly
Rec 26    be carried out. The Group further recommends that consideration be given to the possibility o f a
          separate detailed study o f the possible casualties which might be attributable to high packing
          densities.

          Terrace steps and viewing slopes
             E25. The Group was content with the Guide’s recommendations in respect of terrace steps and
Rec 27    viewing slopes (GG: 7.4). The Group recommends, however, that the surfaces o f terrace steps and
Rec 28    viewing slopes should be even as well as non-slip and that the way in which the maximum desirable
          gradient is specified in the Guide should be improved.

          Terrace gangways
            E26. The Guide states that the aim in respect of terrace gangways should be to ensure that
          every spectator on a terrace is w'ithin 12 metres of a gangway or of an exit. (GG: 7.5). The Guide
          further indicates that gangways should be sunk.
            The Group felt that although these recommendations were generally satisfactory', reasons
          should be given for the basic aim stated in paragraph 7.5 of the Guide. Furthermore, it would
Rec 29    be preferable to state the safety objective behind the current recommendation to sink gangways so
          that it could be met in other ways. The Group recommends accordingly.

          Division of spectator accommodation
            E27. The Guide currently recommends the division of a ground into sections to prevent major
          migrations by spectators, and into sub-sections to minimise the sway and surge of spectators
          (GG: 7.6). The Group recommends that the Guide should limit the application o f its guidance on
          segregation to terraces at football grounds (See recommendation 57 below).

          Crush barriers and other physical restraints on movements
Rec 30,      E28. The Group recommends that the Guide should should explain that brick walls and similar

                                                      80
           structures lacking mass or tensile strength are poorly suited to withstand horizontal pressures and
Rec 31     that the Guide should strongly recommend regular structural appraisal by appropriately qualified
Rec 32     personnel. The Group also recommends that consideration should be given to mounting a more
           detailed review o f current literature on the strength o f crush barriers and the effects o f the various
           types o f loading that might be applied to them (see also paragraph 16 above).
Rec 33       The Group further recommends that the aim o f the guidance on migrations be restated as "to
           prevent potentially hazardous migrations” rather than mass migrations as currently indicated in
           the Guide. (See also paragraph 43 below).

           PITCH PERIMETER FENCES
             E29. The advice on pitch perimeter fences in the current Guide deals mainly with the crush
           barrier aspects (GG: 7.9). Access to playing pitches and the need for “anti-hooligan” or other
           protective devices is however, referred to in the section on crowd behaviour (GG: 18).
Rec 34       Th% Group recommends that the Guide should explain more clearly, preferably by reference to
          standardised specifications, the different functions perimeter fencing may serve and that appropriate
          cross referencing is incorporated in any future edition of the Guide. The Group further recom­
Rec 35    mends that the importance o f allowing full access to the pitch where this is likely to be used as a
          place o f safety in emergency should be made plain. (It was noted that Scottish Building Regulations
          required that protected zones such as stairways led to a place of safety, ie a unenclosed space in
          the open a»r at ground level or an enclosed space in the open air at ground level with access (of
          defined widths) to an unenclosed space. A pitch could be accepted as a place of safety only if it
          met that requirement. If, however, it was subsequently fenced off, circumstances could arise,
          under Scottish Building Regulations, where a change of use would be deemed to have taken
          place.)

          STAIRWAYS AND RAMPS
Rec 36       E30. The Group recommends that the current guidance on stairways and ramps (GG: 9) should
          contain appropriate cross references to advice on egress from the ground (GG: 6). The Group
Rec 37'   further recommends that the Guide should advise that, ideally, the rising and going o f steps should
          be uniform throughout an entire escape system. A minority of the Group felt that the method of
          calculation for access to stairways (GG: 9.4.5) of the Guide was anomalous and should be
          reviewed.

          FIRE PRECAUTIONS
            E31. Guidance on fire precautions is currently contained in section 10 of the Green Guide. It
          covers a variety of important matters including fire resistance, emergency lighting and fire-fighting
          equipment.

            The Group was not wholly satisfied with the general advice on fire precautions offered by the
Rec 38,   Guide. So far as existing structures were concerned, the Group recommends that detailed advice
          should be given on means o f reducing the rate offire growth in existing stands. The Group believes
          that consideration should be given to incorporating appropriate references to recent work in this
          area commissioned by the-Inquiry from the Fire Research Station. In particular, the Group
Rec 39    recommends ;hat the Guide should emphasise the hazards o f developedfires breaking into spectator
          accommodation and the consequent need for fire separation under stands to be imperforate. In
Rec 40    addition, the dangers o f fire spread across adjoining stands should be emphasised and half-hour fire
          resistance might need to apply to vertical sections dividing spectator accommodation from other
          areas.

          Evacuation times
              E32. On notional emergency evacuation times, the Guide currently recommends interpolation
           between 2} and 8 minutes, with the higher figure applying where a stand is of non-combustible
          ■fire resisting structure and presents generally a low fire risk (GG: 8.3).

            The Group was satisfied that there was no case for reducing the 2 \ minutes lower evacuation
          time as recommended in the Guide. The lesson of Bradford was the need for adequate measures
          to inhibit the rate of fire development and spread and to improve the efficiency of fire procedures

                                                        81
          rather than to stipulate more stringent criteria in respect of notional values. However, represen­
          tatives of the Fire Research Station felt that the 2+ minutes should be regarded as a maximum;
          they believed that although individual circumstances might conceivably justify increasing the
          figure, it was not currently possible to assign quantitative values to active or passive fire protection
          measures with sufficient precision to enable specific relaxations to be advocated in the Guide with
          any degree of confidence. A majority of the Group believed that the notional 8 minutes upper
          limit indicated in the Guide, although lacking any very clear or relevant technical rationale, was
          reasonable and should be retained. Nevertheless, it was the firm view of a minority including Mr
          Platt that 8 minutes is too long a period to allow for the evacuation of any stand under emergency
          conditions and that, although relaxation of the 2£ minutes figure might be reasonable in individual
          circumstances, it would be misleading to specify an upper limit in the Green Guide.

            The consensus was that the enforcing authority should decide on relaxations in the light of
          professional experience and individual safety circumstances of a particular ground, but that the
Rec A t   Green Guide should offer more guidance as to what latitude was permissible on evacuation times
          and the circumstances to take into account. In particular, the Green Guide should emphasise that
          escape routes should be designed or chosen so that they provide progressive reduction in difficulty
          or danger to people using them and regard should be had to the likely accumulation o f smoke and
Rec 42    combustion products in those routes. The Group recommends that consideration should be given
          to devising a more scientific method fo r assessing the evacuation o f a stand under emergencjjM
          conditions.                                                -

          Fire protection and flre-fighting equipment
Rec 43      E33. The Group considered that there was currently insufficient evidence as to the value for life
          safety o f automatic fire protection equipmen t fo r the Green Guide to encourage trade-offs between
          such equipment and structural fire protection measures. Any implications that such trade-offs
          were permissible should be removed from the current Guide (eg GG: 10.2). A majority of the
          Group rejected also the idea that the Green Guide should suggest similar relaxations where
          management expertise and vigilance were at a high level.

Rec 44      On fire detection and fire-fighting equipment, the Group recommends that reference should be
          made to relevant British Standards such as BS 5839: Part I. BS 5306: Parts I and 3 and BS 5423.
          The Group considered that it was an inefficient and undesirable use of resources for manned fire
          appliances to attend all matches.

            E34. On roof venting, the Group felt that with some stand roof configurations, appropriate
          venting and curtaining arrangements might offer a means of reducing the spread of fire. It was
          agreed however that the science of fire and smoke venting was highly complex and that it
          not appropriate for the Guide to offer more than a general reference to the issue. However, tl^ p
Rec 45    Group felt that some advice on roof venting should be offered in the Green Guide along the lines
          of that proposed by the Fire Research Station in work commissioned by the Inquiry. It was
          agreed that the priority in the Guide was to recommend effective fire precautions relating to the
          early stages of a fire.

          Access for emergency vehicles
            E35. The Group agreed that the Guide’s recommendations as to access for emergency vehicles
          (GG: 11.30) Were soundly based. It was noted that the Interim Report recommendation that
          vehicular parking be banned within quarter of a mile of a sports ground (when it was in use) had
Rcc 46    been made on a “where practicable” basis. The Group recommends that the qualification "where
          necessary" should be added to the current Guide's recommendations on access for emegencv vehicles.

          Hazardous materials
             E36. The consensus was that it was not practicable for the Guide* to offer detailed advice on
          fire spread hazards associated with particular materials. Nevertheless, the Group recommends
Rec 47    that consultation with expert fire advisers should be indicated in the Guide where substantial use
          of, fo r example, polymer seating is contemplated or o f artificial pitches where forward escape onto
          the pitch might be necessary. {Set also recommendation 35 above).

                                                        82
          COMMUNICATIONS
           E37. The Green Guide currently recommends that precise requirements for communications
        within a particular ground be determined after consultation with the police (GG: 17). The Guide
        goes on to give examples of the arrangements likely to be needed at larger grounds. The Group
        considered that this advice and the way in which it was expressed was generally satisfactory.
Rec 48, However, the Group recommends that the advice as to central control points should not be confined
Rec 49 to the largest grounds and that the Guide should emphasise the need fo r ground management and
Rec 50 responsibility to be centralised accordingly. The Group also believed that it would be desirable in
        larger grounds if public address systems permitted messages to be directed towards specific zones
        o f the ground. The Group recommends accordingly.

           E38. On emergency audible alarms, the use of coded messages found little support in the
        Group. The need was rather to communicate essential information effectively to the crowd. For
Rec 51 that purpose, a clear system o f communications covering all the various conceivable crises, including
        the facility to stop the event, should be devised in consultation with the emergency services. The
        Group recommends that guidance to this effect should be incorporated in the Green Guide.
        Further study was required before pre-set formulae messages could be recommended in the Guide.
        However, it was clear that such messages should be in the active mode, that they should be
        directed towards persons from whom a response is required, and that they should be delivered
Rec 52 authoritatively by trained controllers. The Group considered that there was a need for standard
        guidance covering the use o f public address systems fo r emergency purposes. The Group recommends
        that consideration be given to this.                             . . . . . . . . . .

          E39. The Group considered that the development and operational experience of closed circuit
       television (CCTV) facilities was too little advanced to enable the Guide to be prescriptive as to
       particular systems. However, it was noted that CCTV appeared to have significant value in crime
       prevention and detection and that it had a considerable role to play in aiding emergency
       evacuations, police management information and crowd control. The Group therefore recom-
Rec 53 mends that the provision o f CCTV systems should be encouraged in the Guide.

________ CROWD BEHAVIOUR
            E40. Advice on crowd behaviour is currently set out in the Green Guide in the form of
       . recommendations of an earlier working party on crowd behaviour (GG: 18). The Group recom-
Rec 54 mends that the advice fo r management currently presented at paragraph 18 of the Guide should
         be re-organised and expanded so as to explain more fully the major problems and principles of
         crowd control and then go on to elaborate the various methods available which may be relevant
         in certain situations at sports grounds and of the circumstances under which these might be
         appropriate (see also recommendation (1) above).

Rec 55       E41. The Group also recommends that the Guide should emphasise the value o f effective planning
          before events, debriefing exercises and full liaison with the police, in order to predict and prevent
          trouble. In particular, the Guide should stress the desirability of identifying in advance, against
          the local historical background and known travel arrangements, the likely size and nature of the
          crowd.

Rec 56     E42. The Group further recommends that the Guide makes it clear that the responsibility for
         pre-planning and liaison lies with club management subject only to the point that the disposition
         of operational police resources is the sole responsibility of individual chief constables.

            . E43. There was considerable discussion in the Group of the segregation issue which, it was
          agreed, had major implications for planning. The consensus was that clear differentiation of
          opposing fans (with ancillary facilities) remained the only viable and prudent course so long as
          crowd violence remained at current levels; and that the best way to achieve such differentiation
          was by spatial separation and physical containment of opposing groups. The Group was anxious,
          however, that segregation should not be encouraged other than where local circumstances made
Rec 57. - it absolutely necessary. In particular, at the present time segregation should not be advocated for
          sports other than soccer. The Group recommends accordingly. (See also paragraph 27 above).

Rec 58     E44. The Group agreed that certain fire precautions measures, for example plasterboard fire



                                                      83
                                                                                                                     I




          separation and fire protection equipment,7mg/jf be vulnerable to vandalism and that certificating
          authorities should be advised to take this into account where appropriate. The Group recommends
          accordingly.

            E45. On ticketing, the Group agreed that this was not an effective means of crowd control
Rec 59    unless clubs ensured that their arrangements fo r the issue and allocation o f tickets were as efficient
          and effective as possible. The Group recommends that this latter point be strongly emphasised in
          the Green Guide.

Rec 60      E46. On alcohol, the Group recommends that the guidance on alcohol (GG: 18.4) should be
          reworded to make clear that an important objective was to reduce potential missiles and also that
          the police should be consulted over arrangements for the sale of alcohol at grounds. A reference
          to the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 was also needed.

          E47. The Group were content with the material on police facilities given in the Green Guide
Rec 61 ;(GG: 17.8) but considered that the Guide should advise adequate vehicular accessfo r theunobrusive
        removal o f detainees and secure detention rooms at appropriate grounds. The Group recommends
        accordingly.

      •    OTHER MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES
Rec 62      E48. The Group was strongly in favour of the creation of a new section in the Green Guide on
          management responsibilities and recommends that consideration should be given to this. The
          Group considered that it would be helpful if such a section could incorporate a form of
          checklist of necessary tasks organised under broad headings such as: Pre-planning for Emergency
          Procedures, Training of Stewards and First-aid Facilities/Other Medical Provisions. A reference
          to the need for management structure to reflect such responsibilities, preferably including the
          designation of a named individual to take responsibility for the proper execution of such duties,
          was also highly desirable.

            E49. On the question of the relative responsibilities of the police and stewards, the Group felt
Rec 63    that the Guide ought to make it plain that it was the club's responsibility to control and manage
          spectators in normal circumstances and that the police presence (if there was one) was to deal with
          the law and order problems and provide support and leadership in emergencies. The Group
          recommends accordingly. It was noted that there now existed considerable material on the training
          and deployment of stewards and staff likely to be involved in emergency situations.

18.3 Access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as possible
in normal circumstances while, at the same time, providing the
police with proper access to the terraces for the purposes of crowd
control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event of serious
emergency. One alternative to fencing is the construction around
the pitch of a wall with a smooth surface which should be not less
than 4 feet in height on the terrace side. This boundary wall should
have gates or access points to the pitch which could be manned
by the police or stewards. A walkway between the boundary wall
and the terraces, which would be solely occupied by police, first
aid and official club personnel, has been found to be effective as
regards safety and security. In order to achieve this, it might be
necessary to remove one or two rows of terracing and to protect
the walkway from the terrace by a continuous line of barriers, so
designed as to discourage access to the walkway except at authorised
points. The access points from terrace to walkway should be
reasonably near the access points from walkway to the pitch, (see
paragraph 7.9). Where a walkway system is in use, sliding gates
may be installed at the access points from the walkway to the pitch,
ie where there can be no crowd pressure against them, (see paragraph
6.14.2 regarding use of sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the
pitch is unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing
area.

18.4 Clubs should carefully consider their arrangements for the
sale of alcohol. In any case all refreshments should be served in
plastic containers.

18.5 Home clubs should consider, in conjunction with the police,
each of the matches and determine which should be all-ticket,
and the allocation of tickets to the visiting club. So far as the

6. If during any test, even though the barrier or handrail satisfies
   the above loading requirements, doubt should arise for any
   reason (including such matters as cracking of the terracing or
   distortion of connections) as to the safety of the barrier or
   handrail, a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless
   the results of this investigation remove the doubt as to the safety
   of the barrier or handrail, the barrier or handrail, as the case
   may be, should be deemed to have failed the test.                                 ■v

7. A record should be kept of all the barriers and handrails tested
   and of their performances during the tests.

     SOUTH YORKSHIRE EMERGENCY SERVICES LIAISON COMMITTEE
    MINUTES OF THE FIRST MEETING HELD ON THURSDAY 12 JANUARY 1989
 AT 3 PM AT THE FIRE SERVICE HEADQUARTERS WELLINGTON STREET SHEFFIELD

Present: ACC (Operations) Mr Jackson          South Yorkshire Police

Mr Hornsby we leaned everyone to Fire Service County Headquarters and said
he hoped the conmittee would be a success.

Mr Jackson thanked Mr Hornsby for hosting the first meeting and suggested
the Police should chair the committee in view of their role as co-ordinator
for any major incident.

Mr Wade suggested that each of the three services in turn should chair the
cotrmittee as it was a joint effort and this would share the workload.

Mr Jackson said that he felt that it was necessary for continuity for one
service to chair and organise the various meetings and Mr Hornsby said that
he was happy to leave it to the Police.

It was agreed that the Police would chair the committee for the time being
and it would be reviewed in 12 months time. With that Chief Inspector
Edmundson took the chair.

Item 1   The title of the committee was agreed as
         'South Yorkshire Emergency Services Liaison Committee1.

Item 2    The Terms of Reference was agreed as follows -
          'To promote the highest level of effective liaison between South
          Yorkshire's Emergency Services.

          The chairmanship and secretarial duties would be carried out by
          the Police as previously discussed. It was agreed that the
          committee would consist of two officers from each service and
          it would meet quarterly. It was also agreed that from time to
          time various other people should be invited to the committee
          when a particular specialist type topic was being discussed.

          Mr Jackson said that he intended to step down from the committee
          after the meeting and he would leave it to a Superintendent and
          Chief Inspector Edmundson who was the officer in charge of the
          Force Operations Room and the Emergency Planning for South
          Yorkshire Police. Mr Hornsby said that he would be doing the
          same and leaving it to Mr Mellor.

Item 3    Chief Inspector Edmundson then went through the de-brief notes
          for the mock major incident that took place on 23 October 1988.
          He outlined the main points raised which involved the other two
          services.
Organising Site.

The indiscriminate parking of vehicles, particularly by the Fire
Service, effectively blocked the site and caused severe congestion
problems for the Police and Ambulance Services. The Police are
responsible for organising the site and it was accepted in this
case that this was never done and no-one ever tried to do so.

Chief Inspector Edmundson outlined that one of the main
responsibilities of the incident commander was to gain control
of the site and he should, with liaison with the other two
services, designate areas for parking and loading for all the
three services.

Mr Riley said that he had much work to do in educating his officers
about the need to bear in mind where they should park their vehicles
on arrival at the scene of a major incident. He said at normal
incidents fire appliances were positioned as near to the scene
as possible but he was training officers to get away from this
narrow view and -think about the other services1 needs at a major
incident.

Mr Trueman said that the Ambulance Service fully accepted the Police
responsibility for the organisation at a site and they would get
the message across to their officers that they should be guided
by the Police as to where to park and load their vehicles.

Liaison Officers

During the exercise it became obvious that the respective incident
commanders for the three services had so many different tasks to
perform that it was not practicable for them to keep up liaison
with the other two services. It was agreed by all that each service
create the position of Liaison Officer at the scene of any major
incident and that they provide him with a jacket with the words
'Liaison Officer' clearly marked on it.

Mobile Control Roans

The positioning of control rooms was another problem experienced
on 23 October 1988. It was agreed that it was not necessary for
mobile control rooms to be in the immediate proximity of the scene
of a disaster but they should be positioned within sight of it
on a designated area where all three could be accommodated.

Mr Mellor suggested a telephone link between the three controls
would be of benefit. He had in mind sanething like the old field
telephone system. The Fire Service were in possession of such
equipment and could if the committee agreed purchase a small amount
of additional equipment for vise by the Police and Ambulance
controls. The cost would be net by the Fire Service as it would
be very small, probably consisting of purchasing just two hand
sets.

The Police and Ambulance Service thought this an excellent idea
-    3    -



              and Mr Hornsby said he would look into it. Mr Jackson said the
              Police would need special requirements and he would wish his
              communication officer to consult with him on this aspect. Mr
              Mellor then went on to. describe a new mobile control roan which
              the Fire Service were taking delivery of in the near future.
              It would contain amongst other items cellular telephones and a
              facsimile machine. It would be manned 24 hours a day and ready
              to go to the scene of any incident at a moments notice. He
              invited the committee to view the facility at the next meeting.
              This was agreed by other members of the conmittee.

              Mr Trueman mentioned that he understood that there had been
              cormunication problems at the recent disaster in Leicestershire
              and he would obtain further details for a later meeting.

              Mr Jackson said that the recent disaster and other recent
              disasters would make a good item for the agenda at a future
              meeting when each of the three services had received de-briefing
              notes about them.

    3.4       Identification of Incident Commanders

              Mr Trueman said that the Ambulance Service had now obtained a
              jacket similar to that of the Police in green and white for the
              incident commander to wear. This would he hoped alleviate the
              problems experienced at the exercise of identification.

              Mr Hornsby said that he could not change the jacket worn by the
              Fire Service incident commander but he would make sure his
              identification was put on the front of the jacket as well as the
              back.

    3.5       Movement of Dead Bodies

              A discussion took place about the movement of dead bodies and
              it was agreed that if possible and obviously dead they would be
              left in situ. If however they were moved or it was necessary
              to move them their position would be marked on a plan for use
              by the investigation team.

              Mr Wade said that under no circumstances should dead bodies be
              put with live casualties as had been done during the exercise.

              Mr Jackson said that continuity of bodies and property was very
              important but he accepted that the Fire Service on occasions had
              to move bodies for rescue purposes.

    Item 4    Mr Wade said that as a result of the exercise the Ambulance
              Service had completely revamped their Major Incident Plan and
              he hoped to have it ready in the next few weeks. He said in
              addition he would be carrying out one day seminars for his
              officers on major incidents which he hoped the other two services
              would take part in.
A discussion took place on this and Mr Jackson agreed that the
Police would be prepared to take part in the seminars referred
to.

Mr Trueman explained that 26 ambulance officers were now trained
in extended skills and were identified at incidents by jackets
displaying the logo 'Ambulance Paramedic'. It was intended
eventually to train 100 such officers so that each ambulance would
carry an officer fully trained as a paramedic at all times.

Mr Mellor asked whether they should continue to ask for DART if
a person was trapped and needed a doctor. Mr Wade said they would
ask them not to send for DART as their paramedics could carry
out the necessary treatment. He said that DART teams were being
vised less and less as it was thought that they could be better
vised at hospitals. He accepted that in a major incident teams
of doctors would be sent to the scene and be a necessary part
of the team.

Mr Riley said that the Fire Service were reviewing their Major
Incident Manual and training for such incidents as a result of
the lessons learned.

Mr Hornsby said the Fire Service would be running a table top
exercise on major incidents involving all ranks and they were
keen to extend this to the other two services.

Mr Jackson said that the Police already received a lot of training
in such matters and resources were very stretched. He asked that
Mr Hornsby prepare a paper on the subject as he would like to
discuss whether there was a need. This was agreed by Mr Hornsby
and Mr Wade of the Ambulance Service.

Mr Hornsby asked for clarification that the Police had a
responsibility for press liaison at any major incident and this
was confirmed.

A discussion then took place about lighting equipment and the
amount that each service could provide. Mr Hornsby said that
he would be asking for monies to purchase sound seeking equipment
and portable lighting for vise by the Fire Service but of course
it would be available if the Police or Ambulance Services required
it.

Mr Mellor then floated the idea of putting stickers on cars in
a multiple motorway accident for the priority of rescue. This
he said had been done many years ago and he wondered if there
was any merit in the idea. Mr Anderson said he was not in favour
of this as it was open to misinterpretation. Mr Wade of the
Ambulance Service agreed.

 Mr Jackson mentioned the National Working Party to look at the
-   5   -




            need for a National Disaster Team. He said it had been decided
            that there was no need for such a team and that local emergency
            services were more than capable to deal with any disaster. He
            added however that the working party had thought there may be
            merit in there being a National Co-ordinator for Disasters and
            a National Casualty Enquiry Bureau. The latter was being looked
            at by the Chief Constable of Bedfordshire who was carrying out
            experiments at the present time on behalf of ACPO.

            He then thanked everyone for attending for the first meeting and
            said he was pleased with the progress and hoped it would be very
            successful.

Item 5      Date of next meeting Wednesday, 5 April 1989, at 2 pm, Fire
            Service Training School, Handsworth, Sheffield. (This was agreed
            in order that the Police and Ambulance Services could examine
            the new mobile Fire Control Unit and training facilities.)
Control Of ficer___________ 0900 - 1630 OPD - 15.04.89 - stayed until 20.30.




Superintendent R. Clarke asked for all the spare outpatient vehicles to be
despatched to Hillsborough.


12 vehicles were deployed between approximately 1508 and 1600 hours as and
when they became available from throughout the county.


I kept the vehicles updated regarding the hospital status and I also kept
them on the outpatient channel because of the pressure on the "E" and the
ERC channels.    I actually used some of these vehicles for "E" calls within
Sheffield because the incident at the ground had been cleared of all live
casualties.


I also used eight of the outpatient crews to transfer cases from the
Hallamshire Hospital to the King Edward Hospital.    This transfer being
conducted between 1730 and 1854 hours.    As they had completed their role at
the incident the crews continued to transfer patients between hospitals.


At 1534 hours, I transferred a medical team from the Northern General
Hospital to the scene.


We kept informing the Hospital of standby requirements, they asked us not
to do this.


Doctors and Nurses came on 999 lines to ask if they were required at
hospital.     The telephone numbers to the hospitals were blocked, the same
happened with equipment suppliers.


The press calls were very heavy.

    BRADFORD CITY FOOTBALL GROUND FIRE DISASTER - MAJOR IHCIDENT PROCEDURES

1   IOTROPOCTION

    Reports and reaction have been received from Bradford Health Authority,
    Dewsbury Health Authority and Wakefield Health Authority, the three
    Health Authorities involved with the casualties in the incident.
    Subsequently, a meeting was held involving the consultants,
    administrators and wnos to discuss the implications for aajor incident
    plans in general.

2   INITIATION OP A MAJOR IMCIDENT

    in the particular circumstances of this incident, it is understandable
    that the emergency services did not formally declare a "major incident/
    emergency*.   Any hospital may, however, find itself in a situation
    which warrants the activation of its own major incident procedures even
    if the emergency services have not declared that such a condition
    exists.   Therefore a hospital should be prepared and have the ability
    incorporated in its major incident plans to initiate such procedures
    within the hospital on its own initiative.   The "Cascade* call-out
    system should then be carried out.

3   COtHmCATICKS

    The incident has shown that, due to the volume of traffic,
    conminication difficulties can be experiences in the early stages which
    prevent adequate external communication and the efficient activatiop of
    the call out system.   Front line hospitals are best equipped with
    modem adaptable telephone switchboards capable of sustaining both
    internal and external coenunications.   This is an issue for
    consideration when capital programmes are under review.

    The following points may assist in eliminating difficulties associated
    with existing telephone systems:-

    3.1   Telephone External Facility

          (a)   Telephone lines with external facilities, not through the
                switchboard, should be identified and senior staff
                instructed to initiate call-out procedures for their cwn
                section, using these identified telephones.

          <b)   If the hospital switchboard has the facility to restrict
                the number of external lines that can receive incoming
                traffic, this should be built into emergency procedures.
                This ability would allow one of the operators to proceed
                with the call-out system whilst another concentrated on the
                incoming traffic.


                                     1
        Supporting hospitals take the existing patients from first-line
        hospitals so allowing extra space for casualties.   The second-line
        hospital takes the overflow of casualties when the first-line hospitals
        cannot receive any more,   it is advised that the list of second-line
        hospitals should be extended and be made more comprehensive.   The
        decision which one to use would then be discussed at the time between
        the first-line hospital and the Ambulance Control, taking into account
        medical requirements of casualties and traffic routes.

 9      BORNS CASES

       Wiilst the Bradford city Football Ground disaster was unusual, the
       possibility can be foreseen of a large number of burns casualties
       arising from other situations, eg an airport or chemical installations
       disaster.   The balance of treatment between A and E Departments,
       general wards, plastic Surgery Units and the Regional Burns Ohit
       requires further examination.   Dr J A D Settle, consultant in charge
       of the Regional Bums Unit is arranging to carry out this examination
       and further guidance will be issued.

 10    CASUALTY LABELLING

       There would be very many advantages in a coomon system of casualty
       labelling throughout the Region.   Advice from the A and E Consultants
       is being sought.

11     IDEMTIFICATICN OF PERSCNNH,

       To assist in the recognisation of authorised personnel within the
       hospital, identity tags should be developed for all staff.   This is
       inportant in case the particular emergency has security implications.

12    SITE MEDICAL TEAMS

       Caution is advocated in the practice of sending a site medical team
       automatically upon receipt of notification of a major incident.
       Liaison between the Ambulance Service and the A and E Consultant on
       duty should determine the requirement for medical staff to attend the
       site.

13    PRESS AND PUBLIC RELATIONS

       The presence and value of an experienced press and public relations
       officer was noted and the Regional Press and Public Relations Officer
       is to consider whether any additional guidance is required.

14    DISTRICT PLAN

       The above recommendations and procedures should be considered by
       District Health Authorities when amending or rewriting their own Major
       Incident Plans.


Ref: JTVD6
16 January 1986
       (c)   Senior staff called at home should telephone, their next
             contacts in the Cascade System before leaving.    Another
             member of their family may be able to do this from a
             preprepared list.

       (d)   All telephones in the hospital with telephone numbers
             different to the normal switchboard system should be
             included in the Government Telephone Preference Scheme
             Category II, whenever updated lists are supplied to the RHA.

3.2   Internal comnunications

      Experience has shown the necessity of communications within the
      hospital and the use of personal two-way radios (walkie-talkies)
      and cordless telephones for key staff should be considered.   The
      testing of such equipment within the hospital will be necessary
      due to possible reception difficulties caused by construction
      techniques.

EXPANSION OF A AND E DEPARTMENT ACOOMCOATION

Plans should include the ability to expand the accommodation available
to the A and E Department and a large area set aside for such purposes
as the circumstances dictate.   Appropriately equipped, such an area
could be used to eliminate the problems which arise in an overcrowded
A and E Department and allow the specified facilities of that
Department to function to best advantage.

RELATIVES' ACCOMCOATION

Relatives should be accomodated in a separate though adjacent area.
Hiis allows the medical staff access to the information relatives and
friends have regarding the patient. Hospital Major Incident Planning
needs to take into account segregation of enquiries, relatives and
others from patients before the latter reach the A and E Department.
Hiis ensures that the Accident and Emergency staff are not involved in
enquiries.

POLICE CASUALTY BUREAU

Difficulty was experienced in some quarters with communications to the
Police Casualty Bureau.   The problem is being examined and guidance
will be issued in due course.

MmMSEMEOT

In all cases, it is important that the consultant in charge of the
A and E Department (or his deputy on roster) should be informed,
regardless of the natur# of the casualties.   It is inportant that
overall control be kept in the hands of such a consultant, whilst
others may concentrate upon the emergency clinical situation
appropriate to their specialties.

SBCONP-LINE AND SUPPORTING HOSPITALS

To avoid any confusion over the role of second-line hospitals, the
District Health Authorities should clarify in their plans the
distinction between supporting hospitals and second-line hospitals.
SPEAKING NOTE     FOR PRESS COMMENT HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

We have concducted an internal NHS review of     response to this disaster,
both by SYMAS and the Sheffield hospitals.

It appears to us that that response was both speedy and efficient, and I would
like to pay tribute to the dedication and commitment of all our staff that
were involved.

In view of the Enquiry being conducted by Lord Justice Taylor further detailed
comment would not be appropriate. We will of course co-operate fully with the
Enquiry as it proceeds.

N.B. If further comment is called refer to the SYMAS Press Statement of
18th April 1989.
                                                                TA(89)98




IN CONFIDENCE



Trent Regional Health Authority


Report of the Regional Legal Adviser


HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY



1    At the preliminary hearing of the Enquiry convened by Lord Justice
     Taylor in Sheffield on the 28th April, the Authority's Solicitors
     applied unsuccessfully for leave for the Authority to be represented at
     the Enquiry. Overall the responses throughout the NHS to this disaster
     appear to have been both speedy and efficient but it is considered,
     principally for the following reasons, that the RHA should be
     represented:
     1 .1  The vulnerability of staff who will be called as witnesses;

      1.2    Aspects of the involvement of SYMAS with the football club and
             South Yorkshire Police prior to the match, and operationally at
             the match itself could be subject to critical examination by
             Counsel for the other parties;

      1 .3    SYMAS considers it should make representations to the Enquiry
             that the Ambulance Service should be consulted in relation to
             future licensing of sports grounds by the Licensing Authority in
             order in future to make less likely some of the operational
             difficulties of the sort it actually faced at Hillsborough; and

      1.4    there has already been some public criticism of aspects of the
             "medical services" that were available at the ground. These may
             well be given expression at the Enquiry.

     Extensive debriefing has taken place by the RHA's managers, assisted by
     their solicitors and all the indications are that there are sound
     answers to any criticisms that may be forthcoming.




2    Accordingly instructions were given to the Authority's Solicitors to
     renew privately to Lord Justice Taylor the Authority's request for
     representation at the Enquiry.      However, it seems likely that the
     application will have to be renewed in public when the Enquiry re-opens
     on the 15th May 1989.

 On 20th April 1989, the Association of Chief                         Ambulance Officers issued a
 News Release containing the text of a letter                          which its Scottish Region
 had sent to the Secretary of the Football                             league and   the Scottish
 Football   Association.    The News Release                           contained   the following
 statement:

 "To ensure that there is      a professional emergency medicalresponse it
  is surely time that at all International First or Premier Division
  matches   (and other similar large public    events) a professional
  Ambulance Officer should be on duty at the site, possibly in the
  Police Command Post,    to    initially interpret the disorderin terms of
  potential for patient injury and secondly to co-ordinate all patient
  care resources effectively.

     If this had taken place at Hillsborough and Ambulance Staff directed
     to resuscitation, we are left wondering if the death toll would have
     been as tragically high."

 The letter and News Release were issued, we regret, without reference to
 South Yorkshire    Metropolitan Ambulance Service     (SYMAS)  and  were
 inaccurate.   SYMAS have brought to our attention the fact that two
 Station Officers were present with an ambulance and crew inside the
 ground from before kickoff.   They were able to react immediately as the
 incident developed and to deploy substantial resources at the ground to
 cope with the injuries and fatalities arising out of the disaster.

 The Association very much regrets the remarks contained in the letter
 and News Release.   It is accepted without reservation that SYMAS, its
 Officers and staff responded to the disaster promptly and effectively
 and that there was nothing which they could have done, over and above
 their actions on the day, to reduce the death toll.

 The Association         apologises     unreservedly             to        SYMAS,   its   Officers   and
 Staff.

Re ■ H illsborough Enquiry

I attended the opening day of the enquiry and write to briefly
report the events as they particularly effect us.


I.   The RHA was granted leave to be represented at the Enquiry.
     Mr Kalapetis will be there on the majority of the days that
     we require representation,      and on other days we will be
     represented by junior counsel.      There will be some days of
     the Enquiry when only a solicitor will attend.
II.  The Lnquiry will sit from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m.
     to 5 p.m. each day except Mondays when the start will be
     10.30 a.m. and Fridays when the Hearing will end earlier.
      There will be no sitting on Bank H n H d a y -
XXi. During the course of his opening speech Andrew Collins Q . C . ,
     the Counsel for the Enquiry, gave a series of timings, some
     of which we say are wrong, insofar as they are material to
     us, his timings are as follows:
          2.52 - Gate C opened on Police instructions
          Surge forward into the pens.       Barrier broken in Pen
          3 at that time.
          3.02 appreciation had set as to what had happened.
          3.04 - people still coming into the pen through the
          tunnel.
          3.05 1\2 - game stopped.      "An ambulance" was called.
          3.08 - request for a fleet of ambulances.
          3.14 - Fire Brigade called and told there was a major
          accident at Hillsborough.
          3.15 - St J o h n ’s Ambulance Brigade Ambulance on the
          p ileh ,
          3.17 - first fire tender arrives.
          3.20 - first SYMAS Ambulance arrives.

PrivateJ y Andrew Collins accepts that some of these timings may
be w r o n g . As soon as possible we are going to put in a
precisely timed schedule of events as they affected us.   Andrew
Callaghan is preparing this.

IV.    In summing up Andrew Collins listed a number of areas which
       the Enquiry would need to look at:
       1 j - the lack of medical equipment and supplies at the

       2)~ the co-ordination of medical attention/care
       3)- the state of the ground itself
       4)- the adequacy of contingency plans and in particular
       first aid facilities/staff.    In this context he mentioned
       that the first ambulance could not get onto the ground until
       an advertising hoarding had been removed and he referred
      to difficulties in getti ng other ambulances in.

V.    At the moment it. is intended to call witnesses in the
      following order:
      1)     evidence of Liverpoolsupporters (which is likely to
      las*- the remainder of this week.
      2) - evidence from '’independent ' locais.
      3) - evidence from South Yorkshire Police covering
            a) pre-match planning
            b} events outside Hillsborough on the 15th April
            c) events inside Hillsborough that day.
      4) - evidence from ground staff,
      5 ) • evidence from SYMAS and the Fire Service (in respect
      '■f    i,-!h the allocation of resources and equipment were
           *f i     v iTicnttoned J ■
      6) - evidence from the Football Association.
      7)     technical evidence onthe state ox the ground.

There is evident desire to do the Enquiry quickly and a sixweek
estimate has been mentioned.
VI.   During discussions with Mr. Kalapetis he mentioned that he
      required further information on two things.
      First, he wants accurate costings of what we would charge
      for providing whatever we would regard as standard provision
      fox football match - in other words what we would charge the
      Clnb,*  I should be grateful if Don Page could set about
      obtaining this information.

      Secondly, he would like a draft statement from the Regional
      Medical Officer setting out the pros and cons of whether or
      not. there should be a medical director/co-ordinator on site.

VII. I have arranged to see Mr. Kalapetis wit* ndrew Callaghan
     on Friday of this week to discuss in more detail which
     witnesses we should ask the Enquiry to hear, and the case
     which we should put,   1 will report, further on this*.

1-   Ambulance Service Attendant


     At any Specified Activity where the attendance is expected
     to exceed 25,000 and/or the past history and/or other
     circumstances indicate that ambulance service presence is
     desirable (a "critical match"), the holder of the safety
     certificate should invite the statutory ambulance authority
     to attend with such personnel, vehicles and equipment as
     shall be agreed between them but in any event not less than
     an officer with one vehicle and crew,         the appropriate
     payment being made by the holder of the safety certificate.
     This is in addition to the present attendance of St John
     Ambulance Brigade or the British Red Cross.


2.   First Aid Room



     Each club being the holder of a safety certificate, should
     maintain a first aid room, equipped to a basic standard, as
     specified by the licensing authority after consultation with
     the appropriate ambulance authority.
Doctor



The Football League, Football Association and the relevant
licensing authority should require clubs holding safety
certificates and intending to stage a critical match to
arrange that the doctor in attendance:


a.   is trained and competent in advanced first aid to a
     standard equivalent to a NHS TA Paramedic;


b.   is available to treat any injured spectators and to
     attend the first aid room; when called upon to do so.




Communication


There shall be an agreed and common method of communication
between all the emergency services, if necessary with the
assistance of a dedicated radio and/or telephone direct link
to the ground and the respective headquarters.




Liaison


Before each critical match the liaison officers from the
police and ambulance service should make contact and arrange
to be in direct contact with each other during the match.
The police liaison officer should be in direct contact with
police control.


Emergency Plan
                           i


For all designated grounds there should be a joint and
common emergency plan drawn up by the relevant police
authority,   fire service, statutory ambulance authority and
the holder of the safety certificate.         The emergency plan
should detail:



a.   The   relevant    function of each service during an
     emergency.



b.   The liaison officer from each service, preferably by
     name,   their    respective    station    and   particular
     responsibility.



c.   The agreed rendezvous points for each service and the
     (named) police officer who is responsible for collating
     and issuing information to,        and coordinating the
     response of, the relevant services.


d.   Emergency access and egress.
e*   Casualty clearing point.



f.   Preferred routes to and from hospitals, to be kept clear
     by the police during an emergency.




Licensing Authority



The licensing authority should satisfy itself before issuing
the safety certificate that a joint and common emergency
plan (as described in paragraph 6 above) is in existence for
the designated ground.




Advice From Statutory Ambulance Authority


The statutory ambulance authority should be asked to advise
the issuing authority for each safety certificate on the
question of:



a.   access and egress for ambulances


b.   medical equipment



c.   attendance of ambulance personnel and vehicles at
     critical matches
    and should be consulted before there is any variation in
    the terms of the safety certificate as regards items a,
    b and c above.




Amendment to 1975 Act



SSGA 1975 be amended so as to require the licensing
authority to deal with applications for safety certificates
within six months failing which it shall be deemed to have
been refused.

Hi 1lsborough Disaster: Saturday 15th Apri1. 1989

Attached is a copy of a letter which has gone out today to RHA Members, the
contents of which are self-explanatory. Clearly we will have to give a
progress report to the Authority at its next meeting on 8th May. No doubt
we can have a word about this nearer the date, but I thought I should tip
you off now that your attendance at the meeting will be required.

Regards

 Dear          —

 Thank you for your letter of 24 April 1989.

 I appreciate what you say. I understand that several other letters of a similar
 nature from various sources are on their way to the Department of Health.  I am
 placing your letter on the agenda for the Regional Ambulance Officers meeting
 on the 18 May 1989 when I have no doubt they will give you support and refer the
 matter to the Department of Health. We will then consider how best to pursue the
 matter.

 In the meantime, I assume you will keep the Chairman of the enquiry informed of
 your opinions and recommendations.

 I will keep you informed of progress.

                                                                Yours sincererly




                                                                P J HUNT

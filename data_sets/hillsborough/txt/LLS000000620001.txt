STATEMENT OF




LIVERPOOL

D.O.B.




On Saturday the 15th April 1989 I travelled with friends by Barnes Travel
Coach Company to Sheffield to watch the semi-final of the F.A. Challenge
Cup between Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest*


We left Liverpool at 1105 hours arrived in Sheffield at approximately 1400

hours.


 We then walked straight upto the ground and through the tunnel into enclosure

 B.


 The ground appeared to be already packed and it was very difficult to move
 into my position in the middle of the enclosure about 20 foot from the front

 fence,                                              • •


 At about 1455 hours I noticed a crush started getting very bad.        I started
 panicking but I could not breathe, I was gasping      for air. At one point I
 felt that I was going to drop to the floor.


 Everybody around me was either fainting or dying      and there   seem to bevomit
 all over m e . At one point a young lad behind me     was crushed so      tightagainst
 me that he died, his head was leaning on my shoulder.


  I tried to get towards the front gate and onto the pitch but unfortunately

  the crowd was to much*


  I eventually when the crush eased off certain gaps appeared and there was
  nothing but dead bodies all over the ground.     I had to climb over these to
  gain exit from the ground towards the back.


  I eventually got back to the coach covered in vomit and had to wait on the

  coach for others to return.


  I arrived home in Liverpool at about 11 that evening and was very bad over

  night and all day Sunday.


  On Monday morning my mother took me to Walton Hospital at about 8.30 a.m.
      and after being examined I was told that my left side was damaged and I was

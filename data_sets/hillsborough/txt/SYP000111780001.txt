With reference to the enquiry headed by Chief Superintendent WAIN, I can answer
his questions as follows;
1. I reported for duty at Rawmarsh Police Station at 8.00am on Saturday 15th
   April 1989» at this time, I was in full police uniform. I was to be conveyed
   directly to Hillsborough Football Ground by force coach, to be briefed for
   the days duties#
2. I was part of serial 56 under the leadership of PS 21^0 TAYLOR from C2. We were
   under the direct responsibility of Inspector NEWEY.
3. Following the briefing in the North Stand at the football ground, I was deployed
   with the rest of my serial to Rawson Spring Road, an industrial estate near
   to the bottom of Herries Road. At 11.15am that date, I took up my position
   to direct the Nottingham Forest contingent, to suitable parking places allocated
   within this industrial estate.
   The football fans that I saw were conducting themselves in a good natured and
   lighthearted manner. The majority had parked up and entered the ground at an
   early stage. On the approach of 3•00pm, the roads around Penistone Road, Herries
   Road and Rawson Spring Road, were almost deserted. There were the odd late
   commer to the ground, but the numbers were not so great as to cause any problems.
   The next stage of our duties was to attend Claywheels Lane Traffic Office for
   a cooked meal and following this, we were to be on standby outside the ground
   on the Penistone Road end.
   At about 3«05pm that date, I was stood with the rest of my serial at the corner
   of Penistone Road and Herries Road outside the Charlie Browns shop. We were
   approached by a Superintendent, who had just emerged from the football ground,
   he immediately ordered us into the ground.
   At this time I had no idea what was happening, I entered the ground with the
   rest of my serial together with PS TAYLOR and INSPECTOR NEWEY who were both in
   possession of police radios. As I approached the playing area from the entrance
   between the North Stand and the Spion Kop, I saw the players leaving the pitch
   and a large crowd of spectators on the pitch around the Leppings Lane end of the
   ground. My immediate reaction was that there had been a pitch invasion by the
   Liverpool fans. I then ran across the pitch to offer my assistance, there were
   some police officers present but not many.
   As I moved closer to the goalmouth, I realised the full horror of what had just
   happened. From only a couple of feet away from the perimeter fences, I could
   see people were already dead, others were turning blue and some were having
   difficulty in breathing.
   I immediately surveyed the situation, I shouted to the people at the fences to
   wake up, I proded them to stimulate them into breathing but all was in vain.
   I then started to shout to the supporters behind to move back, but there was

     no movement. The rest of my collegues were doing the same. Everything was in
     chaos, there was no guidance on what to do, spectators were climbing over the
     perimeter fences, using the bodies crushed at the front as a ramp. Police
     Officers were starting to pull spectators over the fence, I tried but found
     I was too small. I then went to gate number 3 in the perimeter fence, the gate
     was open but the exit from the terrace was blocked by bodies. I then assisted
     in the dragging out of some of these bodies onto the pitch. This task was
     hindered by some of the fans already on the pitch, they were pulling at us,
     some were wanting their own relatives and friends dealing with straight away,
     which was impossible at this time.
     I could then see that there appeared to be plenty of space to the left in the
     number 2 enclosure. I then shouted to the spectators to move to the left to
     ease the crush on the people at the front. They did not move so I moved over
     to this part of the ground myself, there I discovered that there was a fence
     running from fron to back holding the people in section number 3* As I could do
     no more at this stage, I returned to gate number 3» there I assisted in the
     removal of a very heavy man who was apparently dead. Once this man was removed,
     we could clear a way through.
     I then climbed into the number 3 enclosure, by this time, a space was begining to
     clear and spectators were moving backwards, allowing a rescue effort on the
     bodies crushed together at the front. As I assisted in the removal of the bodies,
     I then realised that one of the barriers had given way halfway up the terrace.
     Chief Superintendent NESBITT was on the other side of the perimeter fence, he
     was shouting for a chain to be formed to carry the bodies away from the terrace
     and onto the pitch. This I continued to do until all of the bodies had been
     removed. This effort was hampered most of the time by some of the spectators
     who were unscathed, they were shouting and jeering and some came across and
     punched out at the police officers attempting to rescue the victims at the
     front.
     When the terrace was clear and the bodies had been moved to the gymnasium
     or to hospial, I made myself available for other tasks. In the confusion I
     tried to help people who had lost friends etc. I then made my way to the centre
     of the pitch to other officers to try and find the rest of my serial, this
     was not successful. I then waited with other officers from C2 to await further
     instructions.
     At if.30pm that date, I returned to Rawson Spring Road to assist in the removal
     of the Nottingham Forest supporters. From there, I returned to Claywheels Lane,
     then back to Rawmarsh Police Station. I booked off duty at 8.00pm that date.
k.   The only thing I can think of that could be relevent in any way to this
     enquiry is that the majority of the supporters at the Leppings Lane side of

     the ground had been drinking.

   On my arrival at the scene, whilst trying to shout to the crowd to move back,
   some of the supporters were obviously unaware of what had happened, they were
   shouting abuse at the police and the tubular part of the barrier was thrown
   over the perimeter fence at the police. At this stage, I had no idea what
   the barrier was that had been thrown, I only became aware of the damaged
   barrier once I was inside the terrace.
5. My reaction was to try and reason with the crowd, but this was impossible,
   the crowd appeared to be beyond reason,
6. I did handle bodies at the base of number 3 gate and inside the number 3
   terrace. The bodies I moved from the base of the gate, were moved onto the
   pitch, there they were tended to by other services. The bodies I helped to
   move from the terrace were passed along a line of police. I have no idea who
   the bodies were passed to. I cannot give any description of any of these that
   I passed on. At this point, everything was happening very quickly.
7. My feelings at this point were of total confusion, there were no person to
   give any guidance at the initial attendance at the scene, everything was done
   as a gut reaction. My only observations of the policing of the event were, if
   we had so many police officers on duty, spread out all over the place, why could
   n't more police have been deviated to the Leppings Lane area, to approach from
   behind and break up the large crowd. It is my understanding that the crowd had
   built up long before the gates were opened. Another observation is that the
   supervisory officers all had radios but when the incident had happened, the
   radios were useless due to the number of transmissions being *ade.
8. I have policed several big matches at Hillsborough Football Ground in the past,
   for matches involving Sheffield Wednesday, I have usually been miles away from
   the ground and had no part in the policing of the crowd. I was on duty on the
   Leppings Lane side of the ground in 1987 for the semi final between Leeds
   United and Coventry City, my duties there entailed the orderly removal of Leeds
   supporters from their coaches and into the ground. I had occassion to arrest
   a supporter for being drunk and he was disorderly on a PSV. In 1 9 8 8 , I was on
   duty at Hillsborough Football Ground for the semi final involving Liverpool
   and Nottingham Forest. On this occassion, my duties included policing the
   outside of the Leppings Lane entrances to the terraces. There I searched the
   Liverpool supporters on their arrival. On this occassion there was no late
  build up of supporters of the same scale as those I have witnessed on the TV
   coverage of this years event#

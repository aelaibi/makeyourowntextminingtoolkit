                From     this     position           we    monitored          th e    crowd who          were     mostly       Liverpool

                 supporters          and     all     of    them were          in g o o d     spirits.           On    several

                 occasions        we    were       asked     to .re c o m m e n d      and      g i ve   directions        to    local

 onwards,             wh o    were     " t o u t i n g ’ for           tickets          to       the       game?       these             we    moved

 on a n d a d v i s e d            them    to     go a w a y          from       the    football                ground.              A     lot      of

 the      Liver po^K^s u p p o r t e r s               were          carrying          cans          of    beer,       these             were

 stopped          and ad v is ed           to     return             the    drink       to       t h ei r       vehicles,                dispose          of

 it,      or     if    it w a s      a s m all         amount          of    drink          to       drink       it,       as    we       were          not

 allowing             them     to    go    nearer           the       football          ground             carrying             or       drinking

 alcohol.              I did        not    get     any abuse,                in fact             the       crowd were                very          good

 humoured             and     went     along       with my             request.              The          majority          of       these

 youths          sat     on the        wall       at L a w s          Garage       and       shared             the    drink             amongst

 other          supporters.




 Approximately                 1400       hours,        a       couple       of    hundred                s u p p o r t e r s .pas^e^j my

 From          this    time        onwards        the       numbers          of    supporters                   grew       to    thousands

 who      were        passing        my    location,                 walking       along             the      carriageway                 of

 Halifax          Road,        causing          traffic              problems          at    the          roundabout.                    I h ave

 Police          Constable           Raybould           and myself                continued                to    stop       supporters

             At     1500     h o u r s , a serial               w ho      had     been working              on H e r r i e s .Road, n ear                 to

             radio      messages             I overheard,                 I believed           they were            having       problems,            ,

             distraught;               at    first         I thought             the    supporters              were    fighting,             but    when

             I got      to    the       b lue       gates       <C),        that       open    onto        the    lane     at    the       b ac k    of

             inside         the    gates          to     the    lane        outside?          then     helped          people       who       were

             injured         from       the       holding        a r e a at        the       rear     of L e p p i n g s      Lane       stand       into

E N D OF   REPORT
 ^srid Neil KENT.
Police Constable 1900,
A 12, Armthorpe,


At 0815 hours, Saturday 15 April 1989* I commenced duty at Armthorpe Police Station for
 duties at the F.A. cup semi-final match at Hillsborough,
After the briefing at Hillsborough football ground at 1000 hours, I was detailed to
 serial 31» under the supervision of Police Sergeant 2881 PEARSON. About 1030 hours I
took up my position at the roundabout junction of Leppings Lane, Halifax Road, Herries
Road and Penistone Road, and worked with Police Constable 1239 RAYBOULD outside the
betting office at the roundabout.
From this position we monitered the crowd, who were mostly Liverpool supporters, and all
of them were in good spirits. On several occassions we were asked to recommend and give
directions to local public houses, but the advice we gave was all local public houses
would either be full or closed, and suggested they give drinking a miss. I was also aware
of a large number of youths, from 1330 hours onwards, who were ’touting* for tickets to
the game; these we moved on and advised them to go away from the football ground. A lot
of the Liverpool supporters were carrying cans of beer, these were stopped and advised
to return the drink to their vehicles, dispose of it, or if it was a small amount of drink,
to drink it, as we were not allowing them to go nearer the football ground carrying or
drinking alcohol. I did not get any abuse, in fact the crowd were very good humoured, and
went along with my request* the majority of these youths sat on the wall at Laws Garage,
and shared the drink amongst other supporters*
Approximately 1^00 hours, a couple of hundred supporters passed my location, I presumed
they were from the special train that stopped at Wadsley Bridge, and was surprised that
there was no Police escort. From this time onwards the numbers of supporters grew to
thousands who were passing my location, walking along the carriageway of Halifax Road,
causing traffic problems at the roundabout. I have spent five years of ray service at
F* Division, and worked many football matches at Hillsborough, and I was surprised that
the Liverpool supporters coming to the ground along Halifax Road were allowed to go where
they wanted, and did not have a Police escort from the coaches parked on Halifax Road.
At this time I remarked to Police Constable RAYBOULD that we may have a 'rough time* of
it, and could well be fighting at the end of the match.
Police Constable RAYBOULD and myself continued to stop supporters with alcohol or football
banners with sticks, and advised them, but as 1500 hours approached, Leppings Lane became
full of supporters, I would estimate a thousand entered Leppings Lane from Halifax Road
just prior to the game starting.
At 1500 hours, a serial who had been working on Herries Road, near to the bus depot, moved
towards the Leppings Lane entrance, and from the radio messages I overheard, I believed
they were having problems; then an Inspector came past our location and told us to go to
Leppings Lane end to help. When I reached the turnstiles at Leppings Lane, I saw a large
number of supporters who were shouting abuse at the Police Officers there, and others who
were crying and obviously distraught? at first I thought the supporters were fighting, but
when I got to the blue gates {§), that open onto the lane at the back of the stand, I saw
several bodies in the lane opposite these gates, covered in Police anoraks and tunics, and
saw sevenal more bodies inside the gates; I then helped other Officers move these bodies
from inside the gates to the lane outside; then helped people who were injured from the
holding area at the rear of Leppings Lane stand into the lane for treatment by a man who
stated he was a Doctor from Liverpool. Whilst doing this, a youth came up to me and asked
for my help; along with Police Constable 139 LANGLEY I followed the youth to the snack bar
built into Leppings Lane stand, and helped a young female with chest injuries} as we carried
her across the holding area to the lane for treatment, we shouted at supporters to clear the wa;
way, but were met by abuse, and had to force our way through the supporters, who by now had
grown in number to approxiamately a thousand, and were hampering Police efforts at this part
of the football ground.
Inspector SYKES took control of the area at gates (C), and organised a serial to act as a
barrier to shield the dead from the supporters leaving the football ground, I was part of
this serial and was subjected to a lot of verbal abuse, and one point had to *fight* with
supporters who were leaving the ground obviously distraught.
Once the fire-crews and ambulances arrived, and several people who stated they were medical
staff* the dead and injured began to be moved from this area.
A Superintendent then deployed the serial I was with to Leppings Lane, instructing us
to move people away from Leppings Lane so the ground could be cleared and to allow
access to the Ambulance and fire—services# We were also instructed to remain calm, and
not to arrest anyone no-matter how provoked we were. Whilst on this duty I was subject
to verbal abuse by the distraught Liverpool supporters, who were blaming the Police for
the incident. One man actually apologised to me for the behaviour of the Liverpool
supporters, and stated the F,A, were to blame for giving Liverpool the ’small end* of
Hillsborough,
When Leppings Lane cleared, we were detailed to the North stand at Hillsborough, where
we were to re-form as serial 31 with Police Sergeant PEARSON. After a de—brief we were
released to meal at Claywheels Lane, before returning to Doncaster, finishing my duty
at 2000 hours, the same date.

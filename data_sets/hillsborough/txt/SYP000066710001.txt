On Saturday             15th A p r i l ,            1 989    (150489)             I was       aware        it wa s       a     cup      semi        -

f i nal    d ay    between N ottingham Forest                                and       Liverpool.                        had        told       us

he w o u l d      be    opening          the        doors        as    usu a l        to    the     Liverpool           fans        and would

close      the     doors          when    full.




From      about        10.30 am          (10 3 0      h r s ) fifteen                 to    twenty       Liverpool            fans

started         to a r r i v e      at    the        pub.            I went       past       the     pub at        about          1.30       pm

<1330      hrs)        and    I could           hear        the       Liverpool             fans     i n si d e    the       pub       singing

songs.          I knew        they were              Liverpool              fans       from       their     accents.                I c o ul d

see    from       outside          the    pub        that        the    fans          were    inside        standing              on    the

chairs      from        the       general           view     1 ha d         I would          sa y    that       there        w as      at    least

250    fans       in side.          It m u s t        have           been    full          because                 had       closed          the

doors      to     the    pub.           I s aw a        couple          of       fans      around        the      back       of     the      pub

climbing          through          the    toilet            window          to    get       into     the    pub.                        a me

around      and asked              them what            they          were       doing.           The    n ex t    thing          I knew

          was     escorting             them        t h r o u g h a door              into    the       pub.




I have      n e ve r     witnessed              a    problem with                 the      fans      using        the    p u b but           on a

faig g a m e      day    I usually              remain           near       the       house       just     in     case       there          is a

problem.           Although             there        were        a    lot    of       fans    about        the a r e a        of       the     pub

and    in the          pub    drinking              they were           not       drunk       and were            no    problem             to my

family.           I would          describe           t h e m as        in h i g h          spirits.




It w o u l d      be    fair       to    sa y       I had a view                 of    the    fans       using         the     pub

throughout             the    day.        It w a s          my       opinion          that    50     to 6 0       fans       left       the       pub

at a b o u t      £.30       pm    <1430        hrs)        to 2 . 3 5       pm       <1435       hrs),     the        majority             had

who    left at           this       time        were      drunk           or    disorderly             they were         merely         in

high       spirits.            They       had       had a few drinks                     quite         clearly and           were

looking          forward         to a g o o d m a tc h ,




I would          sa y    I s aw       nothing            more        of    the      fans     u n ti l    after      I had       learnt            of

the    disaster.               At     a b o u t ,3 , 2 0        pm    (1 520        hrs)     Liverpool            f a n s started            to

congregate              again       in the          v i c i nity          of    the    pub.        They     were     very-

distressed and were                       looking           lost.              From about          3,20     pm     < 1 520    hrs)          to 8.

00    pm    <2 000       h rs)      we    h ad a         steady           stream       of    supporters            coming       in to         our

house       to    use     the       p h on e     and      have        a    cup of        tea.          In tot a l    about         24

supporters              came     to      ou r    house.              In    particular             I remember         a mini         bus

load       of a b o u t     12 fans,                I remember                 that    they       said     the m i n i       bus    wa s

hired and          they        ha d a l s o         hi re d a driver.




The    group were              Liverpool              f a n s and were                in a n      organised         group       from         the

Red Lion          at L i t h e r l a n d .            The       group          s t o p p e d at    our     house     and

When       the    group arrived                  like       everyone              else      they were         distressed and                  in

     great       deal     of     sh o c k .         Two     of       their        group      w ere      s t ill    missing.             I

remember          the     names          of     the      missing           were       F ranci _                          * ^*7° w - s a

time       went     on    it w a s        clear          th e    two       had      been     involved         in    problems            at    the

ground.           T he i r f r i e n d s , w h i c h             included an                off    duty P o l i c e m a n       from

disaster          occurred.




Together          with a         couple          of      friends           I tried          to    contact         local      hospitals

                     but       none    stated          the    lads       were       there.          It w as        c l ear      to me         that    the    lads

                     must       have     been     fatally           injured.              By     this     time             Iw a s a w a r e    the

                    their        group       came       with       me    but     three         were     so      upset        I would          not    let    them

                     in.        I went       in w i t h       the       other       two    fans       and       our    worst        fears       were

 RE: QUERY FROM CORONER

 Thank you for your memorandum of 30th March 1998 in respect of the above mentioned
 matter.

. Chris Dorries was not the coroner at the time of the Hillsborough disaster inquest.

 As you know, I represented the City Council in the judicial review proceedings brought against
 the then coroner, Dr. Popper, by relatives of several of the Hillsborough deceased. Mr. Dorries
 took no part in the judicial review proceedings as he has not been the coroner at the time of the
 inquest.

  The deputy coroner at the time of the Hillsborough inquest, Dr. Forrest, obtained legal advice
  in carrying out his duties from his medical union. The legal representative employed by the
  medical union to advise Dr. Forrest was Chris Dorries. The issue about which Dr. Forrest
; sought Chris Dorries advice was in connection with the blood tests to be carried out on the
  samples of blood taken from the deceased.

 I understand that the families, who are aware of these tests, are seeking to discrediting the
 result of the tests.

 In the circumstances set out above I do not think that Chris Dorries need be concerned about
 any potential conflict of interest. I confirm that I have contacted him and notified him of the
 above in your absence.

I agree with you that the most important point is whether the information itself should be
released. This already appears to have been agreed with the representatives of the families.
In the circumstances, Chris Dorries should get some legal advice advising him as to the
appropriateness/legality of disclosing the information obtained by the then coroner Dr. Popper
and the deputy coroner Dr. Forrest. In my view it would be useful, in terms of transparency, if
he could obtain written advice as to the legality/appropriateness of disclosure as given his
involvement it may be unwise to refuse to disclose the information where there might be a
suggestion that he might have an interest, however tenuous, in not disclosing the information
at the time of the Hillsborough disaster.

House of Commons Hansard Debates for 30 Jun 1997 (pt 8)
Previous Section Index Home Page




Dr. Brian Mawhinney (North-West Cambridgeshire): I thank the Home Secretary
for his statement andfox^-hift^ersonal courtesy in relation to it.

What happened at/Hillsboroughv/as a tragedy of almost unimaginable
proportions. Thousafliilu ul jjuuple— young and old alike— went to a football
game; 96 did not'return and others were injured. Those realities have
blighted the lives of thousands of people for ever. There remain hurt and
loss from which, in varying degrees, those people may never recover, and we
are all affected by their suffering.

Wfe owe it to the families and friends of those who died, to members of the
police force and the other emergency services and to all who believe in
justice to ensure— in the Home Secretary's words—


      "that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do not reach
      a final conclusion without a full and independent examination of the
      evidence."

I agree with the right hon. Gentleman on that. I welcome his announcement and
will support Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in pursuing that important
examination.

I have four specific questions to ask the Home Secretary about his statement.
First, given the urgency involved— not least for those most affected by those

Column 27

t- rible events; primarily the families, but also the police officers— what
timetable does the right hon. Gentleman envisage and can the House have his
assurance that the process will begin immediately?

Secondly, the Home Secretary said that he would make Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith's advice to him available to the House and the public. Will he
also publish all the evidence considered by the lord justice on which that
advice was based?

Thirdly, the right hon. Gentleman has said that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
will consider any further material that interested parties wish to submit.
Will such material be examinable in public and will those who may be affected
by such material be given the opportunity respond to it before the lord
justice reaches any conclusions?

B'inally, given the sensitivity of this matter and the Home Secretary's
constructive attitude, which I hope he feels that I have reciprocated, will
he undertake to agree with his right hon. Friend the Leader of the House that
the House can debate this matter further when Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has
concluded his investigation?

Positive responses by the right hon. Gentleman to those four questions will
help to reassure the families that we are genuinely seeking to help.
t   1




Mr. Straw:  I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his remarks and for his
courtesy. If it is not wholly inappropriate, I also congratulate him on his
appointment as shadow Home Secretary. I am extremely grateful to him for his
welcome for these proceedings. This is not and never has been a matter of
party controversy. As I have said, I know how seriously my predecessor, the
right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe took this matter.

The right hon. Gentleman asked four questions, the first of which was on the
timetable. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has told me that, subject to a case that
he is currently hearing in the Court of Appeal being concluded as soon as
possible, he intends to do some work in respect of the new duties before the
end of July and to start his proceedings in September. We hope that the
matter will be concluded and that he will be able to produce hisreport  by
the end of the year. However, the House will understand that that is a
judgment which only Lord Justice Stuart-Smith can make in the light of all
the representations that he receives.

Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman asked whether, in addition to publishing
the advice that I receive from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, I will publish all
the evidence that is considered by him. My answer to the right hon. Gentleman
is provisional. I shall do my best to ensure that that is the case, but there
may be good reasons— for example, in respect of criminal or disciplinary
p  feedings— why such evidence cannot be published at the same time as the
advice is published. However, if evidence is to be unpublished, I shall make
that clear at the time.

Thirdly, the right hon. Gentleman asked whether there can be examination in
public and whether the families and others would be able to make
representations. The answer to the latter part of the question is yes. As the
House would expect, the exact proceedings of the scrutiny are

Column 28

matters for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to decide and he will base his decision
on his long experience as a senior member of the judiciary.

The fourth issue that the right hon. Gentleman raised was whether, when the
advice is received, I would discuss with my right hon. Friend the Leader of
the House the matter of a debate. Of course I shall do that.


M ia Eagle (Liverpool, Garston): I congratulate my right hon. Friend on his
statement. I also congratulate Granada Television and Jimmy McGovern whose
efforts have brought this matter back to the attention of the House. Can my
right hon. Friend assure the House that the families who have fought for so
long will have the opportunity of legal representation to enable them to
present their cases, whether orally or in writing, to the Lord Justice? Will
they receive some financial assistance to enable them to do that?


Mr. Straw:  I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her remarks and for her
welcome for the statement. The costs of those who have to travel to appear
before the scrutiny will be met by my Department. My hon. Friend asks about
legal representation. That issue has not been raised by me during my
discussions with the families. I understand that they already have legal
representation. If a further issue arises, I shall, of course, consider it.


Mr. A. J. Beith (Berwick-upon-Tweed): Is the Home Secretary aware that
Liberal Democrat Members welcome this focused re-examination of the evidence,
including recently found evidence, on these terrible events, which have been
etched into the minds of all the people who saw the television coverage at
the time and etched dreadfully into the lives of the people who lost family
members, but will he confirm that it is very unlikely— and perhaps
impossible— that police discipline proceedings could be reopened as a result
of what might be found in the inquiry? Does he recognise that the public find
1



it difficult to understand how police discipline proceedings can be brought
to a halt when retirement on health grounds takes place before the hearing
has begun? Given that Lord Taylor's main recommendation was that, although
there were many factors, the main reason for the disaster was the failure of
police control,^that will leave questions in the public mind, which will pass
beyond the inquiry into what can be done when conclusions are reached.


Mr. Straw:  I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his welcome for my
statement. He asked me to say that further police discipline proceedings
would be very unlikely. That is to anticipate the view that Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith may or may not come to and, with great respect to the right hon.
Gentleman, I shall not do that. He also invites me to make general comments
on police discipline regulations. There may be an occasion to debate the
generality of such regulations, but I do not believe that now is the time.

I say only that the police discipline regulations exist and have been
approved from time to time by the House; they are statutory regulations. It
is, of course, open to Secretaries of State and to the House to change them
in the light of circumstances.


Hr •sn Jackson (Sheffield, Hillsborough ) : I am sure that the Home Secretary
realises that the most tragic

Column 29

trauma of the event was suffered by the families of the Liverpool fans who
attended the match, but it was also one of the most traumatic events in their
history for the people of the Hillsborough area of Sheffield— the links that
they have made and maintain with families in Liverpool bear witness to that.
While he considers the evidence that, I believe, he is rightly having another
look at, will Lord Justice Stuart-Smith consider in detail the lessons to be
learned both for the communities living around big football stadiums and for
the policing of football matches?


Mr. Straw:  I accept entirely what my hon. Friend said: this tragedy went
beyond the people directly affected who were supporters of Liverpool
football club and traumatised the people living around Hillsborough and all
the people in Sheffield and in south Yorkshire as well. We should not forget
t> t, on that day, there were many individual acts of great courage by people
fx^m south Yorkshire, by people in the police, fire and ambulance services
and by many other ordinary citizens.

My hon. Friend asked me whether wider lessons, including lessons about the
policing of football matches, can be considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
in his scrutiny. The answer to that, I am afraid, is that we do not
anticipate that they can be. The scrutiny will look at new evidence that has
come forward since the earlier inquiries, to find out whether that evidence
is sufficiently significant to trigger either a new public inquiry, ordered
by myself, or action by the Attorney-General, the Director of Public
Prosecutions or the chief officer of South Yorkshire police. I do not believe
that, at any stage since the late Lord Justice Taylor reported, there has
been any criticism of his wider recommendations, most of which have been
implemented, on the policing of football matches and on crowd control.


Mr. Tony Baldry (Banbury): I am sure that no hon. Member would challenge the
judgment that the Home Secretary has come to today, but will he confirm that,
in his statement, he said that, on the evidence submitted to her, the
Director of Public Prosecutions had concluded that nothing justified fresh
criminal investigations? Could he give two undertakings to the House: that,
in due course, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will make it clear what new evidence
he is considering that was not available to the Director of Public
Prosecutions in making that judgment, and why that evidence was not available

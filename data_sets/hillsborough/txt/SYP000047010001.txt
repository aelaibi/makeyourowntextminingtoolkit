 D e a r M r.       S h a rp ,

 It was very good of you to come to snerrieia ana spena as
 much time as you in fact did at the inquests into the deaths
 of the 95 people who died at the Hillsborough Football
 Stadium on 15th April 1989.  I very much appreciate the fact
 that you were prepared to give your time and to do me the
 honour of your presence at the hearings.

 I am of course aware that you are now the Investigating Officer
 for the purposes of the criminal investigation and I believe
 also the Police Complaints Authority investigations, and that
 Mervyn Jones has withdrawn from these activities.

 As I understand it the D.P.P. has not yet taken a decision
 with regard to the criminal aspects relating to this disaster
 and now that the interim hearings are over I am obviously
 anxious to be kept informed of progress as any decisions which
 I have to take are very much dependent upon the outcome of
 your report as well as the decision of the D.P.P.

 It may be that now that the interim inquests are out of the way
 that it might be a good idea if we met at some convenient time
 or place in order to discuss any outstanding points and in
 particular any problems arising out of the inter-relationship
 of your task as it impinges upon my future activities in a
— C©a?©Ral—eapaeity.----                                         r ---    ------    -------
 It had been our intention that once the interim inquests were
 out of the way that I would be furnished with a copy of the
 recommendations to the D.P.P. as well as a set of the statements
 and documents which have been submitted to him for his
 consideration.  Obviously this is now a matter for you, but if
 you felt able to let me have the documentation it would be very
 helpful.  I should add that I have had the first three volumes,
 two of statements and one of exhibits but without the covering
 police   report or summary.

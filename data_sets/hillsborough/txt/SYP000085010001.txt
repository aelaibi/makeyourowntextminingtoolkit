       collected          light          refreshment                      for       my    serial          members.               After

       refreshments                were       taken,             I took             my    serial          to    the       area       of

       Halifax       Road          between             Browning                Road       and       Deer lands            Avenue .

       Serial       43    were          detailed                to    patrol             this       area       in       pairs,       the       intention

       being       that       good       order          would             prevail.                 Serial       members          were

       instructed             that       Liverpool                   supporters                should          be       directed          to     park     their

      motor        cars       in    side          roads          on       the       adjoining             housing             estate.

       This       serial       was       at       its       appointed                1ocation             at    a p p r o i m a t e 1y           "11 . 1 S a m

       (1115).           It    was       noted          that          whilst             the       Personal             Radio    had       been

       receiving          messages                initially,                   it    later          proved          to    be    operating              rather

      .1 e s s    efficiently.                     This          was       particularly                   noticeable             whilst           working        at

       the       Deerlands          Avenue             end       of       my    appointed                section.              During          the     course

      of     the    phase          of    the       operation,                   I    liaised             with       Inspector             B r o o r nh ea d , the

      officer        in       charge          of       my       sub-section.

      As     the    Liverpool                supporters                   arrived             it    was    noted          that       they        all

      appeared           to    be       in    good          spirits             as       though          they       had       come    to       enjoy      t he

      event.         There          appeared                to       be    no       problem             with    the       parking          of     motor

      vehicles.               Drivers             accepted                instructions                   without          quibble.

      As     time    wore          on    however,                it       was       apparent             that       a    number       of       the

^     supporters              were       intent             on       obtaining                alcohol.              Because          of     licensed

    rtjrpremises         being          closed          in       the       immediate                vicinity             of    the    ground,           peopie

      W e re      seen    to       attend          at       a    public             house          on    Deerlands             Avenue.            Supporters

      were        seen    arriving                by    taxi          at       these          premises.                 The    public          house      seemed

      to     be    known       to       some       of       the       supporters,                   possibly             from    previous              matches.

      At     one    point          there          was       some          cause          for       concern          about       the       conduct         of

      these        persons          attending                   at    these          premises             and       1 took       the        precaution            of

       informing          two       Mounted             Branch             Officers                and    also          spoke    with          officers

       carrying          out       Transit             Van       patrol.                 In    the       event          there    was        no    problem

      caused        at    this          public          house..

      Eiy 2. 1 5 pm       ( 1415)            it    was          noted          that       vehicular             traffic          travelling                in    the
direction           of       Hillsborough                      had     eased           to      a    mere          trickle,             indeed           probably

rather        less       than          a       normal          Saturday.                  At       no    time          during          my

time     working             at    this             location,             was        the       traffic             seem          to    be    ’n o s e        to

tail’.            There       was          a     steady          traffic             flow          and       drivers             seemed          to     be

encountering                 no    real             problems.

By    now     it    was       seen              that        the       vast       majority                of t h e L i v e r p o o l              supporters

had     made       their          way           to     the       ground.              There          washowever                  a    number           who         had

been     drinking             at       nearby             licensed              premises                still          endeavouring                   to

rnake    their          way       to       the       g r o u n d , some              of       these          as    late          as    2.45pm           (1445) »

Comment           was    made          at        this       time       that          these          supporters                   would       be       lucky        to

get     to    the       ground,                 1 et      a 1 one      in       to    the          ground          intime             for    th       e k i ck

off.         All    of       these              persons             had     been          drinking            but none               were     seen         to      be

At    3 pm    < 15 0 0 )      with             rny s e r i a l ,       I made             my       way       towards             Claywheels                Lane

where        we    were       scheduled                   to     take       a    meal.              This          was       detailed             as     Phase        .11

of    the     operation.                       At    3.15        pm w e         were          on    Claywheels                   Lane       when        I was

met     by a n      Inspector                   whose          identity              1 am          not       aware          of.        He

instructed              me    to       take          my     serial          to       Hi 11 s b o r o u c j h           as    we       were       required

at    the     stadium             as       there          was       trouble           at       the       Leppings                Lane       end.           This

was     my    first           intimation                    of      any     problem.                    As    pointed             out       earlier           my

personal           radio          had          not     been         functioning                    properly.

We    were        transported                   to     the       Leppings             Lane          gate          by    a    transit             crewbus,

and     on    our       arrival                were       directed              i nto         the       stadium.                 We    as    a    serial,

entered           the    stadium                by     the       ramp       at       the       north          end       of       the    West          Stand,

and     went       on    to       the          pitch.            As    we       entered             the       pitch          I    could          see

numerous           supporters                   milling             around.               1    could          also          see       that       major

tragedy           had    occurred.                     On      my     way       in     to      the       stadium             I    could          see       persons

g iving       mouth          to    mouth             resuscitation                     to      injured             supporters.                    Those

in c 1uded         police,             ambulance                 personnel                and       other          supporters.                    T h e re        w e re

a    number        of    persons                who       were        obviously                dead          at    this          point.

Once      on     the     pitch          area          I saw             that       the       main       problem             area          was     that

section          of    t e r r a c i.n g      i m tne d i a t e 1 y             behind            the       goal       at       the       West       Stand           end

of    the      ground.             I made             my       way       to     that         part       of       the    ground.                 I saw

police         and     supporters                 tearing                at     the      fencing             round          the       pitch          with

their       bare       hands,           this          in       an       effort        to      get       at       the    bodies             laid        at       the

front       of    the     terracing.                       The          bodies        were         piled          almost             to    the       level           of

the    wail       and     back          up    the          terracing.                    A    glance             was    enough             to     satisfy             me

that      there        was     no       l i v i n g jrerson a m o n g                        this       pile       of       bodies.

instructions              to       be    given.                 Everybody                seemed             to    work          as    though           by

moving         the     bodies           from          the       terracing                on       to    the       pitch.              There          was

•P o r m e d , p a s s i n g       bodies             from          the       terracing                up    to    the          pitch        area.

During         this      time          I noted             that              supporters             were walking                     a b o u t in       a

shocked          and     da::ed         condition.                           They     were         hostile             towards             the police.

They     were         calling           out       remarks                like         "This            is    all       your          fault"          "You        lot

are     responsible                for       this".                 Much       of     this         I    put       down          at    that        time          to

shock.           I am     still          convinced                      that       for       most       of       these          supporters              that

was    the       case.

After       the       bodies           had    been             moved          there          seemed          to    be       a    lack        of

direction.               In w h a t          appeared                   to    me    to       be    a    spontaneous                   movement              a    1 :i.ne

was    formed          across           the       pitch.                 Once       this          had       been       set       I saw          my     function

as    now      being      to       reform             my       serial           (we      had       all       been       separated                 almost

immediately              on    arrival                in       the       stadium).                 I gradually                   gathered              them          in

and    as      events         in       the    stadium                   had    by     now         eased          somewhat,                I. d e c i d e d       that

we    should          next     take          up       our       Phase           III      position.

serial.           Whilst             travelling             to    that          location           we     encountered                  numerous

Liverpool             supporters.                    They    initially              gave        us      verbal             abuse       but    this

did    not       last          for    long.           I took       it       once         again,         to       be    a    combination            of

shock       and       disbelief.                 The       thoughts             seemed        to     be      "Why          us".

Whilst       supervising                   this       area       I took          the      opportunity                  of       telephoning

Rawmarsh          Police             Station          to    inform          the     duty        group            that       myself          and   t he

members          of       my    serial          were       safe    and          asked      that         such          message          be    relayed

to    relatives.

When       all    the          traffic          had    cleared             from     our       area,          I    reformed             my    serial

and    we    then          returned             to    Claywheels                Lane      for      t rans                   ng    to    Rawmarsh

I am       unable          to    describe             any    of    the          bodies        I assisted                   in    removing         from

the    terracing.

Phase       I and          Phase       III       of    this       operation               saw      my     serial            engaged          in

Public       Order             Patrol,          really       ensuring              that       cars        were         properly             parked.

The    mood       of       the       vast       majority          of       supporters              seem          by    me       were    in    good

spirit       and          certainly             appeared          to       be    out     to     enjoy            the       event.

There       was       a    number          of    the       supporters              who     remained               well          away    from      t he

ground,          imbibing             in    alcohol          until          almost         2.43pm            (1445).              Comment         was

passed       that          “t h es e       would       be    lucky          to     get     to      the       ground,             let    alone      in

to    the    g round            in    t ime      for       the    kick          of f "

It    is    fair          to    say    that          I did       not       see     any     supporter                  in    such       state      that

he    should          be       arrested          nor       was    there          any     serious             public             disorder.

proceeded to my office                      to begin some            paperwork.             The     hospital, was               not

very busy.            The D i a gn os ti c and X Ray D e p a r t m e n t s                  do not f u n c t i o n at

Nurse S mith said the                    problems were at               the    football          ground or just at

Hillsborough              but     1 do    recall         thinking       the    football          ground might              be

involved.            I    was      in my office            on E 13 and        I f i n ished what          I was        doing.

that     there was a MAJAX alert,                   1 a s s u m e d the Transit          Ward    (which      is>

holding area          between A & E and the wards)                     would know of the MAJAX                 as

it works       as a unit with              the A & E Department,

The P o l i c y on page           17 provides       that     the Senior Nurse            in charge         of the

hospital       must     inform       certain     people,       including        the Nurse       in charge          of

Accident       and Emergency,              Tran s i t Department,        T h e atres and war d G2.                 i

had a l r e a d y    spoken with Sister Milnes                  and a s k e d her      to alert Mrs

Okogba.        Before         a l e r t i n g Thea t r e and War d G2      I tried to telephone                the

Senio r Ass is tant Mat ron f o r Acute Se rv i ces , Mrs Carter,                            but- she was

not at home and therefore                    I i m m e d i a t e l y t e l e p h o n e d Mr 1 homp s o n who       is

t h e Acting M a t r o n .         I then went       ba ck to t e 1e ph oni ng Th eatre            (I

o b t a i n e d the tel e p h o n e     number     from the      s w i t c h b o a r d and at    the same

time a s k e d whether            the   switchboard          knew they were        on M AJAX alert,

which     they      confirmed        they did).         I    then informed        the Sis t e r    in charge

of Theatre and the Staff N urse                     in charge         of G2.      G2    is the    designated

r eceiving ward and               I told the Staff Nurse               to start        clearing    the ward

to    re c:e i ve   pat i ents .



The    policy then            requires me to assume             the    role     of the Se n i o r Assistant,

M a t r o n until     her arrival.            In that        role I set    up     the Nurse Control                in

the Nurs i n g A d m i n i s t r a t i o n Department.            My bleep        was going       almost

c o n t i n u o u s l y and    I a n s w e r e d many t e lephone       calls.         I also    deployed

memb e r s    of the      nursing       staff    to the a p p r o p r i a t e    areas    of the     hospital.

S h o r t l y after     t e l e p h o n i n g Mr Thompson,       Charge Nurse Brummal              telephoned

me    from Transit W a r d and told me                  he had been jdfViab1 e to          contact Mrs

Be f o r e    I got any further                down the             list of functions                of the Senior                •

functions        of the Senior             as s i s t a n t         M a t r o n had been        performed.             The

Mana g e r was aware           of the MAJAX as                      I had seen her arrive and                      in any

over     the    remainder       of    the       f u n c t i o n of the Senior                 Ass i s t a n t    Matron.              He

My    i m pression at the            time was              that      the    nursing       staff       response was

i n s t antaneous       spontaneous             and very             professional.



I did not know at              that     stage          exactly what was                  involved        in terms            of    the

incident.            I knew there          had been an a c c i d e n t at                     the football          ground

but     I did not       know the        type          of    injuries         involved or the                scale       of    the

disaster.            I presumed a lot                 of    people must            be    involves!.          At about ,4. .3(j™

4.4 3    pm I went          to the A       &    El D e p a r t m e n t      to assess          the    s i t u a t i o n and

est a b l i s h whether        the staff were                   coping,          and also       to give         them some

           I am a Police Constable         in the Souti

           Division,    Motorcycle wing,      Churchfield Barnsley,



           At Sam on Saturday 15th April         1989,          I commenced duty at Barnsley Road

           Traffic office. At 8.30arn I left Barnsley to attend at the South

           Yorkshire Police Driving School,            Brightside Lane,       Sheffield for a

           briefing    in connection with the FA Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough™



           At 9.30am that day,         I/C Pc Mirfin,          I attended at Tankersley

           Intersection,       Junction 36 Ml on standby.

           I remained at that         location until      12.30pm,     when both myself and Pc

           Mirfin travelled to Barnsley for duties                  in connection with the

           Barnsley v Birmingham match.
                                                                          PAGE      2
                                                                          S2444



At 2.20pm Pc Mirfin and myself        returned towards Sheffield and at the

request of Ps Farnsworth,       we went onto the A616 Trunk      road and onto

the A616 through Stocksbridge        into Sheffield,   At this time there was

no problem with traffic,       which was quiet and free- flowing.



At 2.30pm     we   rode down Parkside Road pass i ng the end of Leppi ngs Lane

near to Hillsborough F o o t b a l 1 ground.   There was heavy pedestrian

activity but there was       no vehicular   problem. WE then parked at the

junction with Halifax Road.       We were approached by two Liverpool       fans

who stated they had bought tickets for the wrong end of the ground and

that they had been turned away from the Leppings Lane end by Police

Officer s .

At 2.40pm we moved to the junction with Leppings Lane/Parkside Road.

There were a large amount of pedestrians who appeared quite            ruly at

this time.    There was very little vehicular traffic.



At, 2.45pm    we   were stood down and returned to the driving school.



At 3.10pm     asa result of information received.       I   attended immediately

at Claywheels Lane Road Traffic Office at Sheffield. From there,            at 3.

30pm I attended in Leppings Lane        i/c: Inspector Cooper and several

other motorcyclists,       I saw a large crowd emerging from the Leppings

Lane entrance,      most   in a hostile and abusive mood towards the Police,

some smelt of alcohol.



At 3.35pm I was instructed to move to the Middlewood Road,            Parkside

Road junction to assist with traffic           control. There was still a lot of

pedestrians some of whom appeared drunk.
                                                                                 PAGE       3!
                                                                                 S2444
                                                                                             j
         By 4 . 4 5 pm most of the heavy traffic   leaving the area had cleared.

                                                                                             i
                                                                                             |


         At 5pm I patrolled the A61 out of Sheffield.       At this time traffic

         leaving the city was still     very heavy and numerous supporters      coaches

         were still    parked on Halifax Road.                                               i




         At 6 . 2 0 pm I returned to C l a yw h ee 1s Lane and later went off duty at 8pm

         that day.

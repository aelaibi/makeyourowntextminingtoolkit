              duty,       still     believing             that       the    whole       incident             revolved around                  public

              disorder.            After       only a          couple       of m i n u t e s       someone           came     running          into

              the    gym    shouting           ’M o v e    these        tables,         move       the       tables.’             Together          with

              other       officers        I assisted             to     clear         the    gymnasium           not      knowing         why.        I

              then    saw     officers          enter          the    gymnasium             carrying          a body.             They were

              immediately           followed          by o t h e r s        carrying          another           body,        and       then

              another.           I was        then aware             of a w o m a n ’s b o d y           being         carried          into    the

              gymnasium.            Two       young       children,           aged approximately                       9 years          of age,

              appeared        to    be    following             the    body       screaming             ’M u m m y ,    Mummy.’           The       body

              of    the    w o m a n was       put    onto       the       floo r,      obviously             dead.          Together          with

someone          else     I approached                 the       two       children            shepherding               them away            from

the    body.           We w e r e        then       joined           by a f e m a l e          police        officer           who      took       the

two    c h i l d r e n away.

After       a    few m o m e n t s        I saw a man                  in the        gym who          was      going       w i ld,        trying

to    get       near     to a b o d y           shouting,             "It's        my     brother,           help        him."          Quite

o b v i o u s l y all      bodies           l ai d     in the           gym area           were       dead.          Together            with

another          officer           I approached               the       man.         We    physically              had     to       restrain

the m a n        and     pull       him     out       of    the       gymnasium.                On    getting            out    of      the       gym

I do     not       know where             the m a n         went.          As      I looked around                   I saw          teams         of

officers           and    spectators                carrying            bodies          and     badly         injured          towards            the

g y m n a s i u m a r ea.           I saw        the       situation             was      so    desperate            and       so     many

bodies          were     being          brought        out       that      about          six    bodies          had      been        laid

out'sdde         the     gymnasium             on     the     floor.

A youth\ho               I do       not     k.              .lied me         over         to    the       bo d i e s ,    pointing            to

one    youth       saying,              ’Lool               irn,      I dont         know       if    h e ’s dead.              I d o n ’t

think       he     is.’        I                           the       body and           would        describe            it as        follows:

    White     m a le,     aged              ;o>;imately 2 0 y e a r s ,                    ginger          h air     cut       into a

modern          style     above          the     hair       line at          the        back.         I l o o k e d at          the       body

and    saw       tha t    he       had    s t o p p e d "b<eathirtg.                    I was        of    the     opinion            that        he
                                                                 X
was    dead,        howeve                                                                       then          performed             the k iss

of    life.        After           doing this          again           checked          the      body         and        believe         I f elt

a    pulse.         I then          remained           with          the   body         which        seemed        to     go    into       s ome

sort     of      spasm.            After a       time,        I had         no      idea, h o w       long,        a doctor                ran

over    and        looked          at    the     youth, saying,                    ’H e ’s d o i n g          alright,              h e ’s h y p e r ­

ventilating.’                  By    this        time       ambulances               h a d a r r i v e d at          the       scene       and

were     being         loaded        with        injured             peo p l e .        Together           with      others           I carried

the    youth       to     the       front        of    th e      queue       of      the       injured and               he wa s        taken

From     t his     stage           on m y      recollections                 are        vague.            I remember            there

seemed        to   be     people          everywhere                 and   I was          aware       t hat      by t hat           time      a

             number         of    doctors       and medical           staff      had ar ri ve d        at   the   scene.            My

             other         main    recollection          is     that     together        wit h a CID Sergeant                  (working

             The     next        thing    I clearly         remember       is     being        seated       in the    N o r t h Stand,

             together            with    la rge      numbers     of    other      officers.

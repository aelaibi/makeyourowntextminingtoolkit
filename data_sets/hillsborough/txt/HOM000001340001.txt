              On the        15th April      198?   I went    to the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football Ground,

              S he f fi e ld to w a tc h the semi        final     game     between Liverpool            Football C lub

              a nd N o t t i n g h a m Forest Football        Club.       I am a Liverpool             supporter*

              I left my house at half               past six       in the morning          to   'hitch hike'       to

              Sheffield.           I got my first      lift       in a private        car just near to the M 62

              motorway.           This    person dropped me         off at a service area on one of the

              motorways*           The    car was a Cortina,         white        in colour,     but    I don't know

              who the man was.              At the Serv ic e area          I met some       lads who were going

               to the game,          they were     in a beige       coloured F ord Escort,              there were

               four     lads altogether        but again       I do not know who they were.                    They

               dropped           me off   in Leppings Lane a few yards               from the ground at about

                  9.30am.         Iwas    in possession of a Leppings Lane                 standing      ticket

                  costing six     pounds.     I bought      the     ticket off a man whom               I do not      know

                  in the O ld      Swa n Public    house,     Old Swan,       Liverpool,        he charged me         five

pounds     for        the ticket.

I t r a v e ll ed alone      to the game,           I w al k e d around S he ffield during            the

mo rning a nd a r r i v e d       back     in L ep pi ng s Lane at about 2.3Qpm.                 On m y w ay

to S h e f f i e l d whilst       I was hitching,          I did not experience            any delays        or

hold ups,        we had a good run throughout my journey.                           I did not witness

any f an s      drinking alcohol,            it was too early          in the day,        also    I did not

see a ny fighting,           drunkeness        or disorder       of any kind.         As    I say I

e ve nt u a l l y a r r iv ed at the ground at about 2.30pm.                    I went towards the

standing        turnstiles        inLeppi ng s Lane.          There were      plenty of fans           in

that area at this time                     but nothing out      of the        ordinary.           I saw a         f

policemen near            to the entrance            to the turnstiles       but     I was not

searched,         I also    saw some        stewards       outside    the turnstiles,        they were

just     standing around.

 I had no d i ff ic ul ty         in finding my turnstile,              or entering        the ground.

 I did not        see,    or witness any other gates                 open,   just    the turnstiles.

 I did not see any u n a u th or is ed entry to the ground.                          As   I entered the

 turnstile            I handed my ticket        in as      normal.

 Whe n    I got        into the yard area of the ground                I did not know which way

 to go.        I did not      see any signs           so   I just f ol lowed the rest of the

 fans who        headed across            the yard to a tunnel.           I entered the tunnel

 together with many other                   fans,    but   I did not have any particular

 d if f i c u l t y    in going    through the tunnel.           As    I entered the tunnel             I did

 not     see an y P o l i c e m e n        or Stewards but      I must         admit       I wasn't      reall

 looking for any.             As      I     got to the end       of the         tunnel      I went to my

 into the         pen on the       right     (Pen No. 3).       At this stage         it was just           like

 a normal match,            e verybody was happy and I did not see anyone drinking

 alcohol        or fighting.

 As      I entered the ground area                  I m oved through the fans and managed to

  get near        to the front,           it w ould be about 2.40pm at this                time.      E ve n at

  this     time       it was beginning        to get tight all around me.                  I remember

                                                                                                S977
there was a barrier a bout               one step       in fron tof me,          there was also a

couple    of fans betw ee n me and this barrier.

Just after          the kick off at about            two minutes        past three    I saw a

barrier       s li gh tl y to my    right s ud d e n l y buckle         over just as though         it

was a piece of alumi ni um .                 I saw a lot of fans          fall forwards as the

barrier       collapsed.       W i t h i n a few seconds         of this barrier       collapsing        to

my    right    I felt a terrific             pressure      from the fans behind me.           I went

uncontrollably          forward,     my head above my            right    eye struck a corner

section of the          barrier.        As    I went    over    I remember that this was at a

point after Peter B E A R D S L E Y had struck                 the    crossbar    of the Notts

Forest    goal       posts.     I went       unconscious,       it may have been for a few

seconds       but    I don't    really know,         all    the fans     seemed to be helping

each other.           I was    some ho w helped onto the              pitch but    I don't   know how

I got    there.        I was so dazed          I can't      remember     if I was taken through a

gate    or any other way.            I remember when            I started to come round

properly       I was    lying on the          pitch.       Someone     asked me    if I was alright,

I nodded yes.           I remember       looking       towards       the fencing and seeing

people    being helped over             the    perimeter       fencing    behind the goal mouth.

I even tu al ly stood up a n d started to walk a ro u n d to see if I could

help anyone.           I asked a few people             if I could help them but they

seemed OK.           I saw some     people      lying      dead on the     pitch,    but they had

died before          I saw them.        I cannot       recall    or describe any particular

person.        After a white        I went      to   look for my older brother Richard,

who    I knew had gone          to the game w i t h his mates             but I could not find

him.     After about a half an hour                  I went     back    into the pen,    there were

people's b e l o n g i n g s    lying around and also some                people were    lying dead

still    in the       pen.     I w a l k e d straight       to the tunnel and left the grounc

the same d i r e ct io n       I came    in.       I left the ground of my own accord.

During my time at the game                   I did not witness anyone stealing,               and    I

did not see anyone             fighting       or indeed get assaulted.              I have no

           particular        views     on the way the         incident was handled after           the game

          was       stopped,      everyone      tried to do their best and did their               own thing.

           I feel that         the P ol i c e    in general        should have taken far more         caution

           in controlling all            fans at this m a tc h because           it was obvious       there

           were going        to    be many fans        in a ttendance.

           W he n    I left the gro un d         I did not     seek medical      attention,    I just

           started to hitch hike home.                    It took about       three    lifts before      I got

           home,      I arri ve d back       in Liv er po ol       at about   10.30pm on the same         night.

           At about        11.0pm the       same    night    I went    to my friends      house.    He    is

                                                                                                          He then

           took me to the Royal              Inf ir ma ry    in Liverpool      city*     I spent about         two

           hours at the Hospital*                   I had a full      check   over,    they x-rayed my head,

           they said I had s uf fe r e d slight               concussion,      they gave me some         tablets,

           then                   took me    home.

           Since      this day      I have      had the     occasional    dizzy spell,      but it is less

           often now,          I was   told by the H os pital          to go and visit my own doctor

           but I have not been to see                  him yet*

            I have       c o nsidered all       the q ue stions      you have asked me but I have

            nothing        else   to say     really.




                                                            this   is the main reason                    ^ook me

            to Hospital           in case    I had s uf fe re d further       brain type    injury*

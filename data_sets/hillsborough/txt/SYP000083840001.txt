When       the    P.A.      system announced,                    after        the    bodies                  ha d    been       removed:/

that       the    game      had     been abandoned,                  many      of    the       Forest                fans,       despite            Iht

entreaties,             left      immediately,              a n d we       were      ordered                  back     onto        Penistone

Road       to    supervise         the        dispersal,,            Depsite         a knowledge                      of       events,         we

were       still       called       to    s ort      out    some      fighting            in H i l l s b o r o u g h               Park.            A

of    the       people      to w h o m        I spoke       were      aware         of w h a t           had happened.                       One

pair       of    old men         even     told       us    t hat     the      gates       had       been             forced        open        by

the    Liverpool            fans.         This       was    the      first       mention           of          the     gates          t h at    I

When       the    crow d s       ha d    been     dispersed           effectively,                  I went             back        to

Hillsborough               for    a debrief,              when     the     details         of      the              day were          explained

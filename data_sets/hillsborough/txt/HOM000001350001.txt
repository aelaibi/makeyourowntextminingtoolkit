DAVID JONES will say:

 My date    of birth    is                   I am Assistant Chief

Metropolitan Ambulance Officer            (Operations).         I am a

qualified ambulanceman with a Miller certificate.               I joined

the   service   in June      1972   and worked    as     a qualified

ambulanceman until June 1981 at two stations in Maltby and

Rotherham.      In June      1981   I was    promoted     to    Leading

Ambulanceman in Rotherham and was basically responsible for

supervising the shift.         In July 1982 I was promoted to

Station Officer at Wath Station and was responsible for 35

staff.    In July 1983 I was promoted to Assistant Divisional

Officer,    operations,       Division      2 at the Barnsley and

Doncaster Division.          I was based at      the headquarters

Fairfield, Moorgate Road, Rotherham and was responsible for

the management of six stations              at Thorne,    Doncaster,

Bentley, Barnsley, Holly Head and Penistone.            I was involved

 in all aspects of management attached to that division and

 also participated in the duty officer call out schemes.             The

 scheme meant that on one week in four I was on call for the

 full 7 days, 24 hours a day.         In November 1985 I was made

 Divisional Officer of Operations.           This coincided with a

 management     restructure.          I   took   over     the    entire

 responsibility for operational management for all South

 Yorkshire including all 13 stations and a total of 452

 staff.    In July 1988 I was re-titled as Assistant Chief.                I

 now work one week in five when I am on full call.
On    the   Thursday   and   Friday   before    the   incident     at

Hillsborough I worked a normal 0900 to 1700 hours shift.

On Saturday I was on my day off.      I was also not on official

call for that week.


I returned home from shopping with my wife and family at

about 1500 hours.      I was aware that it was semi-finals day

at Hillsborough but 1 made no deliberate decision to be home

for 1500 hours.     Semi-final day is an awkward shift because

there is more traffic on the road and so there can be

problems with running the normal emergency services through

the traffic.      Shortly after getting home I switched on the

television to see if there had been any early scores in the

gamesv-«-Thtt* television*,was- immediately showing live,pictures ,

 from Hillsborough where it appeared the crowd had spilled on

 to the pitch.    The commentator simply referred to some crowd

 trouble but gave no hint of the incident which              later

 emerged.     After a minute the television coverage went back

 to Hillsborough.      By this time they were showing a large

 number of fans on the pitch and police and I could see

 people lying on the pitch.       I did not watch any more.        The

 time was about 1509         or 1510 hours.     I jumped up and ran

 upstairs to put on my uniform.       I shouted to my fiancee, to

 telephone     control   and inform them I was on my way to

 headquarters.         I am sure that     the    control   based    at

 headquarters would have called me as they would have wanted

     a senior operational officer at the incident to organise
personnel and ambulances.      The senior officer on call was
                  My           telephoned control at 1537-57

(Track 11 page 17).     She then told me that she had spoken to

control when I was upstairs and she had been told that she

was required.    It should be noted that
          a Control Assistant with SYMAS.      She had initial

difficulty      in getting   through to control because the

telephones were very busy.      When she did get through the

dialogue was brief.     I do not know who she spoke to and I do

not believe that they knew the extent of the incident at

Hillsborough.    She said that she was going to get changed as

well but I told her to come as she was.        We left home at

about 1540 hours.      I arrived at HQ at around 1550 hours.     I
                                            where   I - sa w * the-

Superintendent Controller,                   operating from the

major incident control room.     He gave me a brief update.     He

 said that station officers Higgins and Eason were at the

 ground w i t h a n d         Deputy Chief Hopkins en route.

 There were several ambulances already at the ground.          The

 major incident room is a separate room used specifically for

 major incidents of multiple injuries.     It is adjacent to the

 main control room.     There were five in the control room and

 two operators were in the major incident room.



 I said that I was on my way to the ground.     My specific role

 in the major incident plan is to get to the scene as quickly

 as possible and provide senior operational management for
staff   and vehicles     on site and to liaise with senior

officers from other services.



I set off in a staff car shortly afterwards.              As I was

going out of     the   entrance,   I met   Chief Metropolitan

Ambulance Officer Page who was arriving.            We wound our

windows down and I said that I was going to Hillsborough.          I

think I said "Eason, Higgins, Hopkins, ]               and several

ambulances      are   already   there".    I then   set    off    to

Hillsborough.     I went via Sheffield Parkway and overtook a

police car and ambulance who appeared to be going to the

same place.     I arrived at the ground at around 1605.        I was

trying to get to the gym entrance off Penistone Road as I

kn§w       ^hi§t wAS,4:he ,pre-d^signated .casualty treatment and. .

clearing area for Hillsborough under our Hillsborough plan.

That section of the ground was blocked by police vehicles,

fans and traffic.       I got nowhere near the entrance to the

gym so I turned down the road to the executive suites

leading to the back of the stands.         There was very little

crowd down there although a lot of police officers and

vehicles and some ambulances were coming from the end to

 exit   from    the ground.     They presumably came from the

 Leppings Lane end.      I saw about two ambulances coming out

 and one fire tender.     I went down beyond the south stand and

 parked behind the police control box.      I could see down the

 driveway to Leppings Lane but not behind the west stand.           I

 saw two    ambulances     on   the driveway   which    were     both
stationary.    One of the vehicles was
I walked up to them and saw that they were fully loaded with

casualties.       I instructed both crews to leave and go

straight to the hospital.    They were still in the process of

assessing casualties and I knew that they were not the first

ambulance there.      The situation was mayhem.        Everybody

wanted an ambulance and so delays were being caused by the

fans.     The police were on the ambulances         restricting

casualties.     The two ambulances left and I went down the

driveway to the Leppings Lane end.       I was being jostled by

people but it was not so crowded that       I was unable to make

progress.     I saw a group of about 8     bodies lying on     the

drive     against some blue iron railings.        They were all

pa^ially-<;<ivv©r»ed-*wii±h, plastic-.bags, blankets and. clothing,

 (see plan attached and marked with X's.         Although it was

heavily congested the two yard radius around them was clear

 of people.    I went past the bodies and on to Leppings Lane

 as I could see about five ambulances on Leppings            Lane

 together with two more fire tenders.        The area around the

 Leppings Lane entrance to the ground was heavily congested.

 j-
  j-   was very noisy with screaming and shouting.      1 went on

 and checked to make sure that there were no more living

 casualties in that area. (Turnstiles 1 -160 A/G)        I had seen

 the two ambulances and everybody else around me did not seem

 to be injured.     I did not speak to anyone in any detail.       I

 was looking for a senior police officer so that 1 could

 establish what the situation was in the area.        While I was
at the Leppings Lane end I realised that I really needed to

be up at the gym as this was the casualty clearing post.                    I

radioed Control at 1606 (Track 19 page 39) and stated "TA7

now at the ground can't give you any update at this stage am

currently at Leppings           Lane and making my way round to

Gymnasium".       Once I had established that there were no

casualties left unattended to,               I went over to the five

ambulances in the drive and instructed each one to go round

to Penistone Road and stand by near to the gym entrance.                     I

presumed that this was where they would be needed.                 All five

ambulances which set off were empty.               I radioed Control at

1609-16 (Track 19 page 41) and informed them to "divert all

ambulances to Penistone Road gymnasium end, the Leppings

Laneiervd* >iS ‘C'lf<i'aiiS' 0 £- casulati-^s *. ••«•. •♦'I-— b&lieve about 40-

casualties are still in the gymnasium.                    I ’m stopping at

Leppings Lane directing traffic at this stage".



 I then walked back towards the entrance to the stadium.

 There were a great numberof fans in this area and                   I could

 not see which gates were            open.     By chanceI met a senior

 police officer,        Chief Inspector Roy Waring               of police

 headquarters.      I asked him to get me to the gym quickly.               We

 set off through Gate B and as we passed through he pointed

 to more bodies lying on the floor.                 We carried on around

 the side of the North Stand to the gym.                I radioed Control

 at 1611.23 (Track 19 page           42) and stated "Iam now going to

 the gymnasium......        that     is to be regarded as the casualty
clearing point at this stage."          As we walked along a man

grabbed my arm and said he was a doctor.              He came with us

although I did not get his name.        We walked under the North

Stand through to the gym.         The area outside which is under

the North Stand contained a number of casualties being

treated on the floor by ambulance men, police, doctors from

the medical team and St.John's ambulance men.            This was the

first I had seen of the St.John's ambulance men.           I sent the

doctor into the gym while I stayed outside.               I believe I

then saw Mr.I            and I asked him where Alan Hopkins was

located.      I knew that Hopkins was the most senior ambulance

man on site and that I should report to him.              I wanted to'

see what role he wanted me to take.             Mr.         said that

Hopkit st-m      b      gym.    •so X -went »iix.»thece* • I .noticed 3 *

lot of dead bodies lying on the floor, I would estimate at

least 50.      To my left I saw live casualties being treated by

a mixture of personnel.         I saw Hopkins and         I asked him

what he wanted me to do.          He asked me to take over the

organisation         of vehicles,    manpower and evacuation of

 casualties.


 I went out to the yard.       There were four ambulances outside.

 The ambulances were still having problems with access and

 egress but not sufficiently bad that they could not actually

 make progress.        I then supervised the loading of the last

 casualties.         More ambulances arrived after this and so I

 went out of the gate to Penistone Road and saw that it was
     totally blocked with police and ambulances trying to get to

     the gym.       As I went outside I saw a police         inspector

     standing in the road near the entrance.          I told him that I

     wanted to section off the road except for ambulances to

     allow them access and egress.     I said that I also wanted the

     central reservation clearing of police vans and transit vans

     as 1 wanted ambulances to mount the central reservation and

     make a right turn to go to Northern General or Hallamshire.

     He got on with doing that immediately.



8.   I went back to the gym and explained to Hopkins that I had

     ambulances standing by with good access and egress.            He then

     asked for body bags and blankets to be collected from the
     •                           to. -PeniaSitone* Road and instructed

      Leading Ambulance man          | Station Officer Eason, Station

      Officer               1 to bring bags    into    the   gym.     Four

      ambulances then reversed into the area.     I was not concerned

      with getting ambulances onto the pitch and there were

      certainly none on the pitch at this time.          On returning to

         the gym I told Hopkins that there were a number of bodies

         around at the Leppings Lane end.   It was decided to send an

         ambulance to collect the bodies and bring them back to the

         gym which was a temporary mortuary.   I sent three ambulances

         with Higgins and          to retrieve the bodies.           I then

         brought three or four ambulances into the gym car park and

         sent another empty ambulance on Penistone Road upto Herries

         Road bus    depot which was the pre-determined ambulance
     parking point in the Hillsborough plan.         I sent Eason with

     the vehicle to co-ordinate parking at the depot.         A Barnsley

     ambulance arrived at about 1640.         They had a medical team

     from Barnsley hospital and I sent them to the gym.            A few

     minutes later they came back out and said they were not

     needed and would be more use back at the hospital.         I loaded

     them onto     a Doncaster ambulance and told ambulanceman

                  and Station Officer             to take them back to

     Barnsley.



9.   The police then brought two distressed fans to me.               They

     said that they had identified their brother as dead and

     asked whether I could get them to hospital.        I put them on a

     West^XoffiksJiij.e srotiulajiCie eind told the crew to^go to Barnsley

     hospital and once they had dropped these people off to go to

     their own area.       I then returned to Penistone Road and

     continued to direct ambulances to Herries Road bus depot.

      I then contacted      control     by portable     radio   and   was

      acknowledged by controller ___________       1 told him to send a

      duty fitter to Herries Road in case vehicles had mechanical

      problems.    The vehicles returned from Leppings Lane with the

      bodies and were placed inside the gym.         I then received an

      update from one of our officers although, I cannot remember

      who, saying that 24 ambulances were parked at Herries Road.

      I went back to Hopkins and advised him that there were 10

      ambulances in the gym car park and 24 ambulances at Herries

      Road.   We decided to scale down the operation as it was now
    around    6pm.     I returned   all of the other authority's

    ambulances back to their own area        and   instructed   our

    vehicles to return to base except for six which we kept in

    the gym car park.     I left the gym with Hopkins at about 2000

    and went back to control.

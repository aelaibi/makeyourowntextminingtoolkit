              ^\8.45     am    (0845 hrs)     on S a t u r d a y   15th April,      1989     (150489)       I paraded

              at D o m s a s te r DHQ.    F r o m there we were         t r a n s po rt ed to S h e f f i e l d for

              duty at the FA          cup\semi~-f i n a l , Liverpool       v Notts Forest.            I was       in

              the serial.        We    paraded       in the grandstaHjd at H i l l s b o r o u g h a nd were

              brie fe d by senior Officers.


                                                                                                           1 oil
              At    11.15 am    (1115 hrs)       in company w it h Police C on stable                1432 W r i g h t , I

              took    up duty    in P e n i st on e Rd at the junct io n w ith Vere Rd.                     We    placed

              metal    b arriers across Vere Rd at the j un ction                   to prevent        persons       other

              than    residents       entering       into Vere Rd.       This    junction was a busy
j un ct i on having an off              licence     on one    corner and a fish and               chip shop

on the other            corner.        Bot h were      open until     a ro u n d kick off        time.     Bot h

shops were           kept    very busy.         Having    queues    onto the       pavement at times.

The    shops are         s it ua te d at the Notts F                            f Vere Rd a nd the

people       using      the shops a p p e a r e d to be                         st supporters

Customers        coming        out of the off          licence were      carrying 4 can           packs of

beer    or     lager,       bottles     of wine     or cider.       Knowing       they    could not take

the drink        into the        ground,       they drank     their    drinks      in the vicinity,

sitting        on walls,        on the ground,          and on the     central       r eservation        in

P e n i s t o n e Rd.    There were          two occasions whe n       they had to be spoken to.

Once w he n Police C o n s ta bl e Wright                spoke   to some youths who were

s ta nd ing     outside        the    off    licence    chanting and shouting.                 T hey m ov ed on.



The    s econd time was w hen Police C on stable Wright                          had to go across

P en i s t o n e Rd to speak           to some youths who were            throwing        beer     cans,      some

of w h i c h    contained        beer,       onto the    roof of a nearby building.



T h e y m oved on after              being    spoken to.      S u pp or te rs    started to a p p r o a c h

us    in P e n i st on e Rd,         having    come from the       dir ec ti on of S o ut h S t a n d and

S p i o n Kop entrance.               The y were    in two's and t h r e e ’s.           They showed us

tickets        for    the N o r t h and West Stands and we d ir ected them along

P e n i s t on e Rd where        they       could gain access       to Leppings Ln.              Some    of

these     supporters,          m a i n l y adults w ith      children,     middle aged           people,

some women,           a sked    if they       could go along Vere Rd to Leppings                   Ln.        We

a l l o w e d a few of these            through the barriers           but the greater m a j o r i t y

we d ir ec te d along P e n i st on e Rd.               After a while,          I am not sure what

time,    s upporters           came along Vere Rd from L ep pi ng s Ln,                  not    in any great

numbers,        showing        us tickets       for N or th and West Stands.               Some we

d ir ec t ed along P e n i st on e Rd,           but others,       realising       they had       come     from

N o r t h and West S ta nd entrances,                  returned along Vere Rd to L ep pi ng s Ln.

Some    time      before     kick off,         maybe    ten or fifteen minutes,              I am not

sure,     a Police        Inspector       i nstructed us to             let no one enter Vere Rd

except         residents.        S u pp or te rs were        still   ap pr oa ch in g along Vere          Rd,

from Leppings Ln.                The    off    licence       closed shortly before kick off,                    the

propr ietor         saying    he had sold out of beer.                      There were    still    a few

s u p p or t er s wit h tickets          for N orth and West Stand,               making     their way to

L ep pi n gs Ln shor tl y after               kick off.



P ol ic e Con st ab le Wright,            who    had brought          his    radio from Doncaster,

in fo rm ed me that          s u pp or te rs were       on the       pitch.     V ery shortly

afterwards          he told me         there were       fatalities,          I heard no m es sages         over

the    radio.        S u pp o r t e r s were    then    coming       from the ground,        shouting

abuse     at us as        they    passed.        None made any           physical    move    towards       us.

Emergency         vehicles arrived,             we did what we           could to assist         their

passage.



We    r emained at our           posts    in P enistone Rd because               of the atmos ph er e

a m o ng s t    the s u p po rt er s    leaving    the       ground.        Some were    very distressed,

looking         for friends and          relatives,          others were angry,          their anger

d i re c t e d ma in ly at the Police.                 The    sit ua ti on gra du al ly q u i e te ne d

down.          Police O ff ic er s      coming along Pen is to ne Rd towards                 the    ground

told us to return to the                  grandstand.           I don't       know what     time    this was

but    the      crowds    had d i s p e r s e d when we went            into the ground.           We were

d e - b r i e f e d and   returned to C l ay wh ee ls Ln.               We    left C l ay wh ee ls Ln by

coach returning            to D o n c a s t e r and going         off   duty at 7 .45       pm   (1945 hrs).

                                    *

I did not see an y of the                 events       in L ep pings Ln and         I did not       go    into

the ground.            I have     been on duty at other matches at Hillsborough,

i ncluding        semi-f in al s and the          crowds have gone             into and out of the

g ro u n d without any serious                 incident.

Dear Dick,

                     Barrier Testing 1985

    You will recall that the tests carried out last year
completed the five year cycle. All the barriers have now "bien
tested at least twice since 1979,
    Between 24 to 27 June, crush barriers 1 - 22, 2 4 - 2 9 and
31 - 39 (part) inclusive, at the front of Spion kop, were
tested in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Guide
to Safety at Football Grounds. The location of the barriers
is shown on the enclosed print of our drawing 1610/63B. Barriers
23, 30 and spans 1 and 2 of barrier 29 could not be tested
because being in front of entrances there was no reaction point
available against which to jack the testing rig.
    In five instances the barrier posts failed to sustain the
test load. Either the angle frame broke near the bottom of
the leg where it was corroded or the terracing at the back of
the barrier lifted as the barrier rotated under the test load.
New posts and proper foundations have been installed to replace
those that failed the test.
    In all other cases tested the barriers successfully withstood
the applied load.
    Visual inspection of the remaining barriers revealed two
badly corroded rail connections on barrier No. 46. These
have also been repaired and will be tested next year.
    Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing
the results of the tests on the barriers.


                                  Yours sincerely,

                                                                   Date:         ^    January 1998




v^e spoke today about the scrutiny o f evidence concerning the Hillsborough football stadium
disaster which is being conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

2.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been asked to carry out this task by the Home Secretary.
 His objective is to establish whether there is any significant evidence about the disaster
which was not previously available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, to the Inquests, or to the
prosecuting and police disciplinary authorities. If there is significant new evidence, he
intend to see whether it might have affected the outcome o f any o f the proceedings. He
hopes to report his findings to the Home Secretary early next year, and the Home Secretary
intends to publish his report.

3.           You may wish to see his terms o f reference, and I attach a copy.

4.      As I said when we spoke, the Judge is looking at the way in which evidence was
collected from the police officers who were involved in the disaster. We have found that
officers at the scene - including o f course yourself - were not asked to make witness
statements in the usual way. Instead they were asked to write down their ‘recollections’ o f
what had happened. South Yorkshire police later passed these to the West Midlands police,
who investigated the disaster on behalf o f Lord Taylor.

5.      Some officers’ recollections went to the West Midlands police investigators in a
different form from that in which the officers had originally produced them.    They had
been ‘vetted’ by people at force headquarters, who made changes to them and asked the
officers who had made them to sign them again in their altered form. We have o f course
discussed the background to that with South Yorkshire police management and their legal
advisers.

6.      One o f these altered documents was yours. What we are curious about, as I said on
the telephone, is the extent to which officers who were asked to sign altered recollections
were reluctant, and/or put under pressure, to do so. We wanted to make contact with you
because the recollections which you produced seem to have undergone important changes.

  7.    I attach copies which we have made o f your original and amended recollections, as
  they are preserved in the South Yorkshire police archive. The original version exists both
  handwritten and as it was typed up by the South Yorkshire Police typing service, and I attach
  copies o f it in both forms. The amended version is the other typed document enclosed, and
  you seem to have signed it at the bottom o f each page.

  8.     As far as we can see the difference between the original and amended version o f your
  recollections is that the latter omits the last paragraph, in which you make some general
  observations about the disaster (which are if I may say so very similar to the conclusions
  which Lord Justice Taylor came to as a result o f his Inquiry). Please let me know if you see
  any other differences which we have missed.

  9.        The Judge would be grateful for any observations you may want to make to him
  about the extent to which you were reluctant to sign the amended version o f your
  recollections or to which you felt police management pressurised you into doing so. I do o f
^ » u r s e understand that this is a very unusual request, and that it may put you in some
^R m culty (especially since we have unavoidably had to contact you via your police force).
  We entirely appreciate that you may wish to seek advice before responding. But I wonder if
  I might nevertheless ask you to let us have what you want to say by Friday 16 January. I am
  o f course very willing to talk again over the phone if that would help.

  10.         I look forward to hearing from you.

POLICE CONSTABLE 115



HACKENTHORPE POLICE STATION



At 8.30    am on      the    date   shown,    I commenced duty at Hackenthorpe Police

Station.       We were then taken to Hillsborough by bus arriving at the ground

 at approximately         9.00   am.    I was    detailed    to work      in Serial      16 under

 Inspector Purdy and Police Sergeant 1288 Payne.                    At 9.55 am the briefing

 was given in the North Stand.

 Our serial was        to be deployed directly           outside the 7 turnstiles A-G at

 entrance B at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

 At    11.15 am,      »e made our way around        to the rear of the West Stand in

 preparation for the turnstiles being opened about 11.15 am.

 At    11.45    am,   I     commenced duty directly       outside    turnstiles A        and B    in

  company with Police Constable 607 Taylor.                 In the early stages

  just small numbers of fans entering in 1-s and 2's.                    I turned various fans

  away, .ho had either no tickets or tickets for the Kop.                          All   fans .ere

  being searched at this time, the mood .as friendly and jovial.

  From approximately 2.00 pm on.ards, the number of fans entering the ground

  at    this    end   steadily      increased.    During     this   build     up   the   number   of

  officers      in    our    serial    .ere   steadily    depleted       by   officers    escorting

  prisoners through to the Detention Area, so much so that from about 2.30 Pm

   onwards it seemed that there was only myself and Police Constable Wright

   left directly outside the turnstiles.



                                                                    if
After   2.30    pm,     the   crowd   outside    the   turnstiles   appeared    to   swell

enormously within a few minutes and from the queues being orderly and well

defined, it suddenly became one large mass pushing towards the turnstiles.

I found myself being pushed into the wall at the side of the                    turnstile

entrance.      A Police horse came up to the entrance in an effort to regulate

the crowd but this had very little effect as the pressure from the back of

the crowd grew.        Eventually myself and Police Constable 2980 forced our way

into the turnstiles and into the ground.               We went around the back out of

the large Exit Gate C and continued to try and control the crowd, which

|seemed to be trapped into the area between Exit Gate B and a single blue

barrier which runs away from the turnstiles.

From my position at the side of this barrier I could see that the crowd

 pressure was becoming severe.         People near the barrier were red in the face

 and straining to push back.          Some fans were panicking.      Many were shouting

 and pleading at us to do something.            There were punches thrown as some fans

 came around the barrier and tried to join the crush nearer the turnstiles.

 A small boy was passed over the head of the crowd to us.              I pushed a small

 space to allow a young          lad to escape the         crush, but he wouldn't come        under

 the barrier shouting at         me that he wanted         to see the match.

 Behind me there were a large number of fans standing away from the main

 crush just outside Exit Gate C.            Many fans were shouting and pleading for

 the gates to be opened to ease the crush.                 I could see that there were

 numerous fans climbing on top of the outer wall and entering the ground.

 There was some talk amongst the Police Officers present and Inspector Purdy

  informed     the    officers   directly   outside Gate C that it was         going to be

  opened.      The Gate wasopened a short time afterwards from                 inside and a
                                                 -   3   -




    large number of fans rushed           inside,            someone     stumbled as they wentthrough.

    The gate was then closed again.             It had been opened for approximately 30-60

    seconds.        It had the effect     of clearing the area directly outside            the Gate

    but did nothing to ease the           general            crush at    the turnstiles.        Thesituation

    continued to deteriorate, people were in distress, many fans continued to

    shout for the gate to be reopened.                 That they all had tickets.         It seemed

    that    it was     only    a matter   of    time     before   someone was     injured,     if not

    already.         Many fans were helpless in the crush and could hardly move as the

    pressure        from the fans behind forced them towards the turnstiles.                   I could

Q   see 3 or        4 Police horses up near the large iron gates bordering on Leppings

    Lane,     the    crush of    the   fans    seemed to stretch well           into Leppings Lane

     itself.        Most of the Police Officers I could see were between the blue

     barrier and the temporary barrier guarding the sterile area at the rear of

     the South Stand.
     With the situation getting worse the Exit Gate C was opened again from the

     inside.        This time there -as a much larger influx of fans into the ground.

     The majority of them weren't running but all were anxious to escape the

     crush and get into the ground.             I positioned myself directly outside Gate C

     in the flow of fans who had to pass either side of me.                      They were told not

      to rush, to take their time.             Hundreds of fans must have passed me.                Only a

      few running,       the others were orderly.              The influx died down to a small

      trickle after a few minutes and the Gate was narrowed to allow one fan at a

      time,    and     this time each showing their tickets to a steward,

      outside the turnstiles was now clear.                   I regrouped with officers from my

      serial.         Almost    immediately     someone       reported   that    there   was    a    pitch

      invasion.         In company with other officers, I went in through Gate C past
the tunnel to the Centre section of the terracing into the 'South Stand and

onto the pitch.       There were many people walking and standing on the pitch.

There was a lot of confusion as to what was happening.                         I could see that

there were numerous Police Officers                near the perimeter fence behind the

Leppings Lane end goal.            I couldn’t see the crowd beyond.              Next the Police

Officers began to pass injured people                  from an open gate in the fencing.

Along with others I took them from these officers and placed them in a

safer    position    further       on   the   pitch.     Many seemed     short of breath and

distressed but each person I helped was alive and conscious.                        I helped one

£>uth    who     said to me     that     people   were   dying   in    there    pointing at the

terrace.       At this time, due to the number of people on or around the fence,

I still couldn’t see through to the terracing.                       I moved closer and I saw

 that there was a mass crush of bodies just inside the fence.                           It was a

 confusion of heads, arms and legs.                I saw one man who was obviously dead

 but he was held upright by the crush and his body moved with the crowd.                       By

 this time I was directly outside the small open gate.

 Officers inside the terracing were passing the injured onto the pitch and

 giving    first    aid,     if necessary.        I worked myway        across    to between the

 ambulance which had pulled onto the track and the perimeter fence which had

 been    forced apart.         I continued to assist           in carrying injured onto the

 pitch.

 After a short time, I climbed into the terracing through the hole in the

 fence     and    assisted    in    carrying people       to   the   fence.      I assisted   with

 approximately 10 people, all of whom were already dead.

  Eventually,      the Centre section of the terrace cleared.                     I remember that

  soon after this an announcement was broadcast that the match would not be
                                      -    5   -




continued.    Whilst I was in the terracing and on the pitch helping the

injured,   many Liverpool   fans   were    directing   their anger at the Police.

Calling us murderers and that it was our fault.         Others thanked me.

After the    terracing had cleared,       I joined other officers on the halfway

line.   Eventually we made our way back to the North Stand via the Leppings

Lane terracing.

       few minutes and from                 thequeues being orderly                    and well        defined,         it

       suddenly became             one    large mass       pushing           towards      the    turnstiles.            I

      found m y s e i r being pushed               into    the wall          at the side           of the    turnstile

      entranc^       A police horse                came up to the entrance                      in an effort         to

      regulate       the    crowd but         this had very          little          effect as       the    pressure

     Jp/'orn the back           of the    crowd grew.            E ve n t u a l l y myself and PC 2 980

      forced our way             into    the turnstiles           and    into        the ground.           We went

      aro u n d and back__out of the                large                       C and      continued         to try and

 ^jjontrol         the     crowd,        w hich seemed to be trapped                  into      the are a between

      Exit Gate B          and a single blue barrier w h i c h                     runs away         from the

      turnstiles.

     From my position at the side                       of this barrier              I could see           that/the

      crowd    pressure was             becoming     severe.         People        near    the     barrier were             red

      in the face and straining                    to push back.              Some    f a n U ^ e       pani eking.

     Many were        shouting and           pleading at us           to do something.                 There      were

     punches      thrown as         some fans        came ar o u n d         the barrier and           tried      to join

     the    crush nearer           thr- turnstiles.            A small         boy was       passed over          the

     head of the          crowd to          us.     1 pushed a               small    space           to a llow ayoung            lad

     to escape y ^ h e      crush,          but he w o u l d n ’t            come under         the barrier shouting

     at me tb6t he wanted                to see the match.

     Behind/me       there were a large                 number    of fans standing                away     from     the

     m a i n / c r u s h just    outside Exit Gate C.                Many fans were                shouting and

     pleading      for     the gates         to be opened         to ease       the    crush.         I could        see

^ y l lhere w e re numerous fans climbing on top of the outer wall                                                   and

     entering      the ground.               There was        some       talk amongst                the Police O f f i c e r s

     present and          Inspector          P urdy in f o r m e d       the       officers          directly        outside

      someone    stumbled as they went               through.        The gate                     1 osed

      agam.      it had been opened for a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 0-60 seconds.                      It had

      the effect of       clearing         the area d i r e c t l y outside         the Gate    but did

      nothing    to ease       the general        crush at    the     turnstiles.         The   s i t uation

      continued to deteriorate,               people were       in distress m any          fans   continued

      to shout    for the gate            to be   reopened.        That     they all    had tickets.            It

      seemed that    it was only a matter              of time       before      someone was      injured,

      if not already.          Many fans were         helpless       in the      crush and      could

      hardly move as the         pressure         from the    fans    behind forced        them towards

      the turnstiles.,          I could see 3 or 4 police                  horses    up near     the    large

  | ° n 9a'
          tes b o r d e r i ng on Leppings Lane,                the       crush of fans      seemed      to

  stretch well        into Leppings Lane              itself.        Most    of the Police O f f icers

  I cou^        see were       between the blue         barrier and the t e m p o r a r y         barrier

  guiding        the sterile area at the               rear of the S o u t h Stand.

  With the s 1 lua ti °               t                      Ex i t Gate C was         opened again

  from the       inside.       This       time there was a much             larger    influx    of fans

  into the ground.             The m a j o r i t y of them weren't            running     but all      were

  anxious       to escape      the    crush and get         into     the ground.        I p o sitioned

  myself      directly outside Gate C in the flow of fans who had                               to pass

  either side       of me.       They were         told not     to   rush,      to take   their     time.

  Hundreds       of fans must         have    passed me.       O nly a few running,             the others

 were     orderly.       The    influx died down to a small                  trickle after a few

 minutes and the Gate was narrowed                     to a l l o w one      fan at a time,        and

 this ^/ime each showing              their       tickets    to a steward.           The a rea outside

 the .turnstiles was            now   clear.        I regrouped w ith officers             from my

 serial.        Almost    immediately someone               reported that there was a pitch

 invasion.        In company with other o f f icers                  I went     in thro u g h Gate C

 past    the    tunnel    to the Centre           section of the terracing              into    the South

 stand and onto          the    pitch.       There were many          people walk i n g and

 standing       on the    pitch.          There was a lot of confusion as to what was

            tharperimeter           fence behind the L e p pings Lane                  end goal.           I couldn't           see

                e crowd beyond.              Next     the   police     officers       began to       pass      injured

            people out from an open gate                     in the     fencing.           Along wit h others             I

lcSC Ut     l0° k lhenr' fr0rr' lhese           o f f icers and      placed them           in a safer        p o s ition

-           furlher       on the pitch.              Many seemed short of breath and d i s t r e s s e d                      but

tfsj+k&y    e a ch person        I helped was alive and                conscious.           I helped one y o u t h who

            said      to me that        people were         dying    in there        pointing at        the        terrace.

           At     this    time due        to the number         of   people     on or ar o u n d       the    fence      I

           still       c o u l d n ’t see    through to the          terracing.            I moved     closer and            I saw

          ^^hat       there was a mass              crush of bodies       just       inside    the fence.             It was

           a confusion of heads arms and                       legs.     I saw one man who was                 o b viously

           dead but he was             held upright         by the      crush and his body m o v e d w i t h                  the

           crowd.        By this time           I was d i r ectly outside             the small       open gate.

           Officers        inside      the terracing were              passing       the   injured      onto       the   pitch

           and giving         first aid        if n e c essary         I wor k e d my way across              to between

           the ambulance w hich had                  pulled onto        the   track and        the    perimeter          fence

           w hich had been forced apart.                     I continued to assist                in carrying

           injured onto          the      pitch.

           After a short          time      I climbed       into the      terracing         through      the hole         in

           the fence and a s s i st ed              in carrying        people    to the fence.             I assisted

           with a p p r ox im at el y       10 people all        of w h o m were a l r e a d y       dead.

           Event u a l l y the Centre           section of the           terrace      cleared.         I remember

           that       soon after       this an a n n o u n ce me nt was         broadcast       that     the match

           would not be          continued.           Whilst    I was     in the      terracing and on the

           pitch helping          the     injured many Liverpool                fans were       di r e c t i n g    their

           anger at the Police.                 Calling      us m u r d e r e r s and that       it was       our

           fault.         Others       thanked rne .

           After      the terracing          had     cleared    I joined other             officers      on the

           halfway       line.     E v e nt ua ll y we made our way back                   to the N o r t h Stand            via

         the Leppings Lane          terracing.

         Throughout     the    incident both outside and                   inside      the    ground there

         seemed to be       commu n i c a t i o n    problems.         It seemed that many             d i d n ’t know

         what was going        on or what was           the     best    course     of action.          The    crush

         outside    the ground       could     possibly have            been better          c o ntrolled with

         more Police Officers and a better                      r e g u l a t i o n of the    flow of fans        up

         to the turnstiles.            At the time w hen            the    crush     reached      its height         our

         particular     serial     seemed      to be down to a quarter                  s t r e n g t h of what      it

         should have been.           I believe         that opening         the outer         gates was a very

         necessary d e c ision as the situation was                       becoming      out    of hand and a

      ^serious      risk of     injury.        Knowing        the H i l l s b o r o u g h G r o u n d as   I do and

         how the Leppings Lane            end fills       up it might           possibly have         been better

         to direct the fans          coming         in through the open gates                 into   the     flank

         areas,    w hich   I saw were       by no means          full.

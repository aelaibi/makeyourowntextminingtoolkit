          HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER; SATURDAY 15th APRIL 1989.

I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police, presently stationed at
Hackenthorpe Police station in Sheffield.
On Saturday 15th April 198 9, I was on duty at the Sheffield Wednesday Hillsborough
football ground for the FA Cup Semi-Final, Notts Forest PC v Liverpool FC.
I went on duty at 8.30am that date, at Hackenthorpe Police station. I ascertained
that I would be in Serial No k under PS 266 Jacques. Shortly after my arrival at
Hackenthorpe, our Serial travelled to Hillsborough in a Ford Transit Police
Personnel Carrier, arriving at the ground about 9.00am.
On arrival at the ground we obtained a cup of coffee etc and made our way into
the North Stand for briefing which took place, to my recollection,between about
9.^5«m and 10.30am. The briefing was held by Chief Supt. Duckenfield and Supt.
Marshall, and in view of the match being a semi-final tie was quite lengthy. As
I remember the main topics were info on crowd control, evacuation procedures and
mention was made of travelling Liverpool pick-pocket teams. I had worked the
identical semi-final the year before and in my opinion the briefing was no different
from that given at any other semi-final cup tie.
About 10.30am my Serial deployed to it's position. Basically our duties were around
the car park and turnstiles for the South-Stand which was allocated to Notts Forest
fans.
By   12 noon large numbers of fans were coming into the ground and I noted that some
of   them were Liverpool fans, who were directed to the parts of the ground allocated
to   their team. As time went on the crowds coming to the ground became very heavy,
as   was to be expected.
The overall mood of the crowd was very good: they were very good-natured and there
was a gerenal ’carnival’ atmosphere. On about   or 5 occasions I and other officers
from my serial stopped fans who were drinking alcohol and made them pour it out
onto the ground prior to entering the stadium proper, as no alcohol was allowed
inside. This was done by the fans without any complaints or trouble. I do not recall
seeing any person drunk.
My exact position outside the South-Stand was by the main gate leading onto the car
park off Penistone Road. I was with PS 266 Jacques, PC 2621 Wood, PC 2679 Astin and
PC 1200 Woodward. Other officers from our serial were at the turnstiles for the
South-Stand.        >.
Leading up to kick-off time about 3pm, I was made aware that ticket-.touts were
operating somewhere in the viscinity of Penistone Road. Two fans from Notts Forest
who had purchased tickets from a tout asked me if they were genuine. I could give
no answer as by that time were were pulled out overseeing the crowd. It became
difficult to move through the crowd and in any case by that time we#* were in groups
of about 2 - 3 officers amongs hundreds of people. Simllwrly> tottte-had-aot ba«a

Between 2pm and 3p® large numbers (say about 25 to 35 people) either asked me
personally where they could buy a ticket from or alternatively I heard them
shouting out, asking if anyone had a ticket to sell* I did in fact note at the
time that the majority of these people enquiring about tickets were from
Liverpool - this was made obvious by their accents.

About2.40pm I was stood withPS 266Jacques^*the only officer in our serial
who had apersonal radio ■ and I couldoverhear transmissions coming from
officers on Leppings Lane who were clearly having problems with crowd control.
As it seemed that these officers were experiencing some kind of trouble I then
stayed next to PS Jacques to listen-in.

On the approach to 3p® I could hear the voices of the officers at Leppiagp Lane

Either at or very shortly prior to 3p®» I heard radio transmissions saying that
people were being killed and seriously injured at Loppings Lane turnstiles and I
heard an officer asking             for a gate to be opened.
I then distinctly heard someone shout on the radio: " 10/99 10/99 "• I
recognised this call as the South Yorks code for a disaster. I then heard a
command being given to open a gate.
For some while then I was engaged dealing with crowds still entering the ground
through our position, and although I was awre that something unusual was taking
place at Leppings Lane I do not think any of us knew exactly what it was.
About 3*20pm, I was informed by PS Jacques that it appeared some kind of pitch
invasion had took place by the Liverpool fans, and that the match had still not
kicked off, or had been started and abndoned. Notts Forset fans were still trying
to enter the ground at this time, through our position, and I noted that small
groups of Liverpool fans kept coming round trying to buy tickets. By this time
our position had virtually cleared and the fans we saw had obviously been drinking
though none of them were outright drunk.
About 3»40pm we were made aware that some people had been killed inside the
ground.    ? ■ < -i* mow i i t u h ,   j.,           Q r.nwf-irmerf rimd. We had been
due to take our meal at 3p« but obviously this went by-the-board as circumstances
developed.
We then received info stating that the match was abandoned as a disaster had
taken place, there being about 15 to 25 people dead. We were directed out onto
Penistone Road to assist ambulances, the Fire Brigade and off-duty nurses,
doctors etc into coming into the ground.
From about 4pm onwards, people began to leave the ground and this presented
problems getting emergency service vehicles in. As time went on this became
thousands of people leaving the ground, streaming onto Penistone Road, which was
full of ambulances etc. BaeicaH-y it-was ehaosi It was apparent that many Notts
Forest   fans were not aware of what had taken place as many came up to me, asking
a) if the match wap abandoned and b) how they could go about getting refunds.
About 4.30pm I noticed some Liverpool fans on Penistone Road who -wggc. trying to
start fights with the NottsForest fans* Vij if n j nT im m lip Apparently some Notts
Forest   fans had been cheering when the disaster         occurred, not knowing thefull

moved on the Liverpool fans and continued to see ambulances in and out. Under
the extreme circumstances I myself decided not to arrest anyone but to try and
calm them down.

We stayed in Penistone Road till about 5>3Qpm, at which time the majority of
the crowd had cleared. We were then recalled inside the ground, to sit again in
the North-Stand. At this time we heard that there were 84 confirmed dead.

      experienced no particular problems as all our fans      well-behaved. if we

As it seemed that these officers were experiencing some kind of trouble I then
stayed next to PS Jacques to listen-in.
On the approach to 3p® I could hear the voices of the officers at Leppings Lane
becoming more and more desperate, asking for more men and horses. I then heard
an officer saying that he was in the gymnasium with extra men who were on standby,
and he was asking if they should be deployed. I cannot remember the reply to this.
Either at or very shortly prior to 3p®» I heard radio transmissions saying that
people were being killed and seriously injured at Leppings Lane turnstiles and I
heard an officer asking desperately for a gate to be opened.
I then distinctly heard someone shout on the radio: " 10/99 10/99 M. I

a) if the match was abandoned and b) how they could go about getting refunds.
About if.30pm I noticed some Liverpool fans on Penistone Road who were trying to
start fights with the Notts Forest fans, by way of revenge. Apparently some Notts
Forest fans had been cheering when the disaster occurred, not knowing the full
extent of what had happened. Other officers and myself broke up two small fights,
moved on the Liverpool fans and continued to see ambulances in and out. Under
the extreme circumstances I myself decided not to arrest anyone but to try and

were dishevelled. I thought it rather stupid on someones part that these officers
were forced to sit so long with the Leppings Lane terraces - the scene of the
disaster - right before their eyes.
About 7pm we were stood down and walked to the Traffic Div at Claywheels Lane
where we had a bite to eat and recovered our Personnel Carrier. We then returned
to Hackenthorpe and went off duty at 8pm.

The only criticisms I can raise about this matter are as follows:
1. Even at our position, we appeared to be a bit thin on the ground for the
   numbers of people involved. I was quite impressed for the number who had
   turned up at the ground, and I believe that it was substantially more than
   the year before. However I can only say this with hindsight and luckily, we
   experienced no particular problems as all our fans were well-behaved. If we

2. Poor supply of personal radios. It seemed very bad that only one man in our
   serial - our Sergeant - should have a personal radio. We had great difficulty
   in finding out what had happned/what was happening and for too long a time we
   were basically working in the dark. And yet the majority of Special Constables
   and Traffic Wardens that we saw each had a radio. One of our officers - PC
   1200 Woodward, tried to get a radio off a Traffic Warden when we learnt the
   extent of what had happened, so that we could give whatever assistance might
   be required. The Traffic Warden refused to give it to him however.


These notes are made to the best of my knowledge for my duties during the time
of the disaster.

For the Attention of Mr. Metcalfe.

Dear Sirs,

                  Calling of South Yorkshire Police Witnesses

    I am writing to express my concern over the fact that it was not until
literally the very last minute today (i.e. when the Officer was called to give
his evidence) that I learnt that neither P.C. Scott (away on annual leave until
26th June) nor P.C. Woodward (away on annual leave until 12th June) was
available to give evidence.

    I was able to ascertain from Miss Norcliffe that your own firm was itself
only aware of this fact this morning. But, if I may say so, I find it
regrettable that no-one from your office saw fit to pass this message on to us
as soon as you were aware of it. I would hope that you will be able to observe
this normal courtesy in future.

                                  Yours faithfully,




                                 D. Brunmell
                                 Assistant Treasury Solicitor

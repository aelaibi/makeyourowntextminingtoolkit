Dear Sir,

Re:    Membership Schetne/Local plan

Please find enclosed, as requested, the proposal for a membership scheme here
at Hillsborou^i.

At present the capacity of the stadium stands at 54,324.                                      This comprises:-

Kop (Heme Supporters Standing)                                                  21,000                        '/«
South Stand covered )          Heme                                              5,567'
South Stand uncovered)     Supporters                                            3,310
North Stand            )     Seating                                             9,882
West Stand (Visiting Supporters Seating^                                         4,465
Leppings Lane (Visiting Supporters Sealing)                                     10,000
                                                                                54,324


If we deduct the parts of the ground allocated to visiting supporters then we
are left with 39,724 of capacity; and of this balance seme 21,000 is on the
Kop.

I have had meetings with the South Yorkshire Police who have stated
categorically that they do not want the Kop to fall within the scope of a
membership scheme, as it is the only area of standing accommodation for home
supporters and cannot be partitioned.

                                                                              continued . . .
                   Chairman: H. E. McGee, Secretary: G. H. Mackrell, F.C.C.A. Manager: H. Wilkinson
 Directors: M. Sheppard, J.P., F.C.A. (Vice-Chairman), S. L Speight, O.B.E., C. Woodward, K.T. Addy, E. Barron. G. K. Huliey.
                                               Registered in England No. 62478
In light of this advice we were left with the natural choice to designate the
next biggest area, the North Stand, as our membership area. Its capacity of
9/882 would mean that 24.87% of the available capacity would be within a
membership scheme.

Whilst we fully acknowledge and accept the target of 50% grounds such as
Hillsborough, with large capacities/ present special difficulties/ and taking
in account the advice of the local police I trust that you will find the
scheme as proposed acceptable.

A copy of ray local plan is attached to this letter.

Yours faithfully.

                       SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY F.C. LOCAL PLAN

       relation to the surrounding area.

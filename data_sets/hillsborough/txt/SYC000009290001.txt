(           Dear Sirs,                             ,

            Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


             If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
             of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
             on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.   Details of venue will be notified in
             due course.

             I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
             evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
             coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
             inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

             Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
             under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
             witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
             this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

             Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
             to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
             appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
             consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

             May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
             attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

             I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
             names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
             to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

             I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
             heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
             submit.

     RE: MARTIN KEVIN IRAYNGR MEASES - INQUEST

     We have now had an opportunity of going through the Summary with our client, and the following
     are sane of the matters which our client would wish to have raised at the Inquest, if possible
     by the presenting officer:-

     1. How was the abrasion to the left temple of ffertin Kevin Traynor caused?

     2. How was the superficial abrasion on the left shin of ffertin Kevin Traynor caused?

     3. Can it be confirmed whether Mr. Jfertin Kevin Traynor was found in the "sump" being the gap
     between the foot of the fence and the steps to the terrace. Our client asks this because when
     she viewed the video by fest Midlands Police, the Police Officers indicated to her that Mr. Martin
     Kevin Traynor had been found by the side of the barrier which had collapsed. They were apparently
     lying to the left-handside of the barrier, as one looked towards the pitch.

     Our client will be represented at the Inquest by Mr. Fraser of the Hillsborough Steering Ccmmittee.

Re:        IS&iffiDg im m 3MM3K (daoaased) So,57*
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

 I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
 has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
 behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
 Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

 I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
 Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
 he may wish to undertake.

 I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
 or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
 matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
 a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
 on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

You .will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
in fact put in as evidence.

However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
report of your client(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

      a.    They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
            subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
            they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

      b.    They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
            conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
            legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
            in which solicitors may be engaged.

      c.    Subject to the,‘ca'fe5E'§, they are to be kept confidential until
            they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cairnot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is 55p    per nheet (total £ l.lOp )
Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

Yours faithfully,




S.L.Popper,

Re: CHRIS-AND KEVIN TRAYNQR.

Thank you for your letter of the 2nd of August.

      1.   It is not my normal practice to release post mortem
           reports prior to the resumption of the Inquest
           when they are given in evidence. However, in
           this particular situation I am making arrangements
           for post mortem reports to be released to the
           families solicitors, or if they are not represented,
           to their general practitioner, subject to certain
           safeguards.

      2.   I would not, generally speaking, be prepared to release
           the post mortem report directly to one of the bereaved
           at this stage.

      3.   With regard to the items belonging to Chris Traynos,
           I will be sending a copy of your letter to the
           West Midlands Police to see whether they are able
           to trace these belongings.

Yours sincerely,



S*L.Popper,

     The mother of Chris and Kevin Traynor who were killed
at Hillsborough has made contact with me.  Mrs. Traynor lives
a"t                               ~~1 She is anxious to have
a copy of the post mortem report on her two sons and to know
what has happened to Chris's front door keys and both sons'
shoes.    Would it be possible for these belongings to be
returned to her?

     Thank   you   for    your       help      and   I look   forward   to   hearing
from you.

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

         Saturday      15th April         1989        (150489)     at about half         past nine quarter      to

         ten we set off           in my Ford F i e s t a                    w           along   with

                                                                      and a chap name                    I d o n ’t

         know his      other      name,    he    is a mate of

         got the tickets for the semi                      final     match against N o t t i n g h a m Forest        at

         S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y ’s ground,     Hi ll sborough.           These were four Leppings

         Ln End Gr ou n d Ticke ts and one                   for    the seating area situat ed above              the

         ground also        in Leppings Ln End.                    We paid si:< pounds       each for the

         ground tickets,           and twelve             pounds    for the stand ticket.          Q         drove

         my car and        I sat     in the back wi t h 1                   1-and           while H —     sat   in

         from Ma nc h e s t e r    but to use other                roads.       We had several     delays    once

         leaving      the mo to r w a y wi t h roadworks aro un d the little villages going

         to Sh effield.           At about        half      past    twelve we stopped on the outskirts

    S h e f f i e l d at a pub.        I c a n ’t remember      the name of     it.     We had about

    two    pints of beer           except for              who had a pint of lager             shandy.

    We    left the     pub about        five   past - ten past one.           We had driven for

    about    five    to ten mins at the most wh e n ahead of us was a metal

    barrier across           the    road and four        policemen directing          traffic to the

    right,    this was not a dual              carr iag ewa y but a normal           two-way    road.       We

    turned     right and e v en tua lly          parked our      car   in one of the side         roads.

    Where we       parked was on a very steep hill.                    On walki ng     down the hill

    we ak ed a wo man         if any     pubs were       near and we were told that             they were

    all    closed aro un d the ground but the Sp o r t s m a n pub was opened and we

    made our way there.                We went     into the     p*ub and    it was    ch oc a— block

    every one trying           to get served.                   ~~| stayed outside     even at the

    first    pub.     Their were         no pint glasses         so                                  shot

    aro und and got glasses              in half     pint ones.        We had two more         pints in

    the S p o r t s m a n then made our way down the hill.                    The Hill was that

    steep that you were virt ual ly                 running.       Instead of going        down the side

    roads    to the football            gro un d we stayed on the main           road where a large

    boozer     is on the        left whi ch was all            boarded up.     Here we had to turn

    left doubling            back on ourselves,          the    crowd was    having a laugh and           a

    joke whilst mak ing             their way to the ground and              I did not     see any

    fighting       or drunks.          We a r riv ed at the ground at about             half    past two

    to twenty to three.                As we   reached the area behind the Leppings Ln

    End    I saw a crowd of about              three     to three and half       th ousand      people        in

    front of us being              jostled but      not going far.          I then saw a policeman

    on horseback,            he was the first        one   I saw from when we          left    the

    S p o r t s m a n Pub.     I was    then st arting         to get jostled by the fans behind

    me.     The     policeman on hors eb ack           then shouted to us and            I said shouting

    above    the    noise of the          crowd,    " I ’ve got four       tickets    to get    in, what

    am    I sup pos ed to do."            He then started shouting at the                crowd to move
c
back.        I was told that          the ground was         choca and the turnstiles shut.
                                                                                                 PAGE




The    pol ic ema n then st art ed to move              his horse among          the crowd.      The

crowd started to get             pushed forwar d towards            the turnstyles when as

far as       I can    remember       two   large gates about        10 ft high and six feet

wide    each were opened             inwards towards the ground.                 The   crowd then

surged t hr ou gh the opening                toM/ards the tunnel       under      the stand.       I saw

no stewards          or    police when we went          through the gates          into the area

where    the tunnel          is sit uated where you could see the top of the

crossba rs of the goals.                   I did not see any one        climbing        over any

gates    or wall          to gain access       into the ground.         As we entered the

tunnel we were all             together,       me,    ________________________________ had gone

into the stands w ith his                  ticket.     On coming out of the tunnel the

crowd was still             surging f or wa rd and we went          into the       pen number 4.

At this       point       I was slung f orwards         and at an a ngle         down towards      the

front where          the fencing and wall             are.    I lost                             and

        |a n d was        t hrown f or w ar d onto a barrier at the front a nd about                     in

the m id dl e    of the       pen.     I tried to push a gainst            the    crowd holding

the barrier and e ve nt u a l l y had a space                 to duck under        the barrier.          I

fought my w a y back up into an upright                      p osition and a lad who was            by

me on my       right was also trying             to get up but had his head jammed

ag ai ns t    the bar as the          crowd was surging forward.                 I tried to turn

a r o u n d but a f el lo w behind this              lad was also      pushing     back a way from

the barrier and             I pushed this       lad's head down towards his knees and

e v e n t u al l y got h im up by the          side of me.       I could feel          bodies,   arms

and     legs under me and            people b ehind were         passing    chi ld re n down to the

front.        We were       s creaming      to the    police who were on the track

p erimeter      on the other side             of the     crowd   control    fence      to open the

gates.        P eople at the front were               passing bodies       over the fencing a n d

some were       trying to climb over                 the fence and the      police were making

them get back             into the       crowd.     I then felt a body under my feet and

it was a young              lad about      sixte en or se venteen who was .crying and I

ma n a g e d   to    lift    the    lad by the       hair and head and with the                help of

anothe r       chap we       ya nk ed this        lad up.     Another man about         forty years           of

age was        lying un de r ne a th where          this young        lad had been lying.               His

eyes W ere just             staring and ws m a n a g e d to          lift him up and were          then

slung     to the         left where        I lost hold of the man and                I went    down on my

back     and shot         round onto my hands and knees and forced my way

upright.            At   this time we were           climbing all          over   bodies trying         to

pull yourse lv es            up.    After    only a couple           of minutes we        seemed to have

a bit more           room.     We start ed         pulling at the fencing at the front and

a P o l i c e w o m a n M.*as screaming          to the other        coppers      to pull     the fences

down by breaking              the welding.          We e ve ntu al ly m an age d to break the

fence      in the bottom left hand                 corner and started to bend it towards

us an up.            We then start ed on the fence                  next    to    it and manage d to

break the welds              and    pull    this meshin g         towards    us and up.       We then

started to           pass    bodies out          to the fans and the             police who     were on the

pitch at this             time.     We     past seven out,          four of whom who ap pe a r e d

dead,      they were         blue and eyes open and the other                      three were    seriously

injured.            I then m an ag ed to climb out and started to remove the bill

boards from the wall                to move the        injured       people from the          pitch.         It

was about           four o'clock when             I left    the    pitch and saw                I, we

wa l k e d back to the             car and then                   wa l k e d up fo llowed by Jimmy

about           mins      later.     We     left             by the car and went            to look for

               We all       split    up and met again by the ground.                    We did not find

him and        returned to the             car where we then se arched the ar e a arou nd

the S p o r t s m a n Pu b then went              back to the ground where             I asked a

po liceman where             the nearest Pol ic e S t at i o n or Hospital                was    but he

 informed me that              he was      not    from this area and did not know.
                                                                                              PAGE


       E v e n t u a l l y we found an Hospital      but            was not there.       We were

       told to wait        in the waitin g a r e a of this Hospital,              I do not know    i t ’s

       name,   where we stayed for about             two and half hours.           We eventually

       found that              was at the Royal           Hal la m Hospital    in Sh ef fi el d where

       we went.     Whilst at the Royal Hallam,               I started to have breathing

       difficulties and        pains    in my     left    side.    A nurse then took me up to

       casualty where        I was    examined by a doctor who            informed me that     I had

       a couple of fract ure d ribs.              I was    not kept     in the hospital    but told

    ^pto   see my doctor       for any pain killing            drugs.     I have my ticket and

       the other three tickets            still    in my    possession.       We were   not asked to

        produce    them.     I was at the same match              last year   in the    same end and

       the o r g a n is at io n was   co mpl ete ly different,        their were     police and

       barrier s set up directing           the fans       into the     correct    rows for the

       turnstiles.         This year    it was     like a melee everyone           for himself.      I

        have   now handed the tickets over               to the enquiry team,                            I

       am willing to att end any en q u i ry             into the disaster.

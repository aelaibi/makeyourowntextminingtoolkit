                           following morning to complain about the event.

                           fellow colleagues about the crush of fans outside.            I looked

                         by other fans      into the West Stand. At this stage I

            The first body I referred to was that of a white male? about 5*8 tall

            a teenager perhaps               17— 18 years old.    He was on a Jioatd being car r ied

            by fans.         I grabbed the front right hand corner a / the b o a r d .            Which

            would be at the lads right foot.                 I recall he >/as wearing dark

            clothin g T a blouson type jacket which was bl/j<ck.                  He had blue denim

                       I seem to recall that his jacket was on the wrong wway round as

            though someone had taken it off and placed it over him.

            He had black hair.               He was slim build and I think clean shaven

            although he may ha/ve had a small               ’te en age rs’ m o u stac he.   We took him

            to the gymnasiumja nd left him on the floor.                    When I first saw the fans

            struggling with this body they were around the 18 yard line to the

          I then grabbed a stretcher and went onto the pitch to the area by the

          North Stand at the Spion Kop I was w ith a POL PC from D Div Crime and

          Vandals    I can't recall his name but I seem to think/fTis collar number

          I saw a man who I think is now the clubs d o c t V r . He was bald glasses

          and had a light coloured suit on.             He was giving mouth to.mouth to a

          man but after a short time he said there was nothing he could do and

          instructed me to take the body away.

          That body was of a white male between 25 and 3 5 ^ / a r s .       I remember he

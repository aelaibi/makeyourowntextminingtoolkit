                  because          of    the    congestion            around           the       ground.          As    we    drove     along

                  Middlewood             Rd    I could      see        a    continuous              stream        of    peo p l e     making      t h ei r

                  way     towards         the    football             ground.              Cars     were    parked           s o l i d L ^ up

                  towards          the    ’M i d d l e w o o d    T a v e r n ’ public              house    and        as           passed      by    t h er e

                  I saw about             10 -- 13 L i v e r p o o l             fans       sitting        on a w«a 11          by a     river-

                  drinking          from       large      bottles           of    ’Pi Is"         lager,      jfh e time             no w was     E„30

                  pm     (1430)         and    I have      since           confirmed             t ha t   "Unis    p o int      is    1.4 m i l e s

                  from      the     ground.          It    struck           me    at       the    tin/e t h a t        they would         h ave       been

                  struggling             to    get   to   the         ground          in    tirnsr for      the        match.         They      couldn't

                  have      driven any           nearer          to    the       ground/because               there          was     nowhere      nearer

                  for     them      to    park.

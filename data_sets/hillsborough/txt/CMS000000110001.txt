     Dear Chx'istopher

     I thought that I would let you settle in to your         new post    as
     Secretary of State before writing to you in my           capacity    as
     Chairman of the All-Party Football Committee.

     Following the publishing of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report
     and the obvious collapse of the Dutch ID card scheme, I am writing
     to request a meeting of the officers of the All-Party Football
     Committee, so that we may share our thoughts with you on this
     important subject.

People        s ta rt ed to      climb over           the fence        onto the       pitch and       I saw the

Police        help tl4em.        I nevej^aw             the P o li c e      or a n y b o d y else    do a n y t h i n g

to    impede        this   .VJ i w f g a t e    was o pe ne d a nd        people s t ar te d to get onto the

p e o p l e ’s heads,         including mine,              to get down to the               pitch.

It must        have    been a r o u n d t we nt y past            t^fee         (1520)     when   it a p p e a r e d to

A m a n was         h elping      people        to gefc/over the            pen fence       into the a d j o i n i n g

pen,    pen two. W i t h my feet                        his    knee    he    p ushed me over         the    fence

into    the a d j o i n i n g       pen.       ay^ol iceman a n d other             fans got hold of me as                I

came over           the fejnce.          I yC u rn e d a r o u n d a nd     I saw             also being         pulled

over    the fence. V-drtra not see                              being       pull ed over      but he j o in e d us

a s hort       time    later w h e n we            got onto      the      pitch.

On the        pitch    I sat a n d t ried to get m y b r e a t h back.                       I was    in deep

s ho ck a n d       I was     b ru i s e d all      over my body.            My    ribs felt      painful as

well.     I saw people              lying on the           pitch,      w i t h some being g iven

but    it was f ai rl y o bv io us               some    of the       people       lying    on the    pitch were

dead.     I saw one a m b u l a n c e            come    in the       ground,       but    instead of d ri v in g

              I have     lived here        for    some                 /ears and have        experienced Saturday

On    15 April        1989       (150489)          it was    the    cup semi       final     m atch between

Liverpo ol          and N o t t i n g h a m Forrest and            the venue was W e d n e s d a y ' s       ground

at Hillsborough.                     On this day          I wa n t e d   to attend the football              m atch

but     unfortunately              I had not got a ticket,                   my friends        however    had got

tickets and at one                   o'clock I saw them walking                   to where      I was ,

                                                                           they were         going    to the Park

Hotel        pub.      I told them            it was     closed and          so all     four    of us

                                             ana                         m o v e d towards     the Gate Public

House        situated at P e n i s t o n e Rd North,                 on the way up to the               pub I saw a

large        number     of fans who            1 presumed          to be Liverpool            ones,    by their

accents        and the         colour        of their       scarfs.



The     supporters who               came     towards       us were       not   drunk     or d i s o r d e r l y just

great        in number and on our way to the                         pub     I recollect        some    fans asked

us and other            people        if we had any spare                 tickets,      I would say between

15 to 20 asked f or spare                      tickets



Po l i c e Officers            could be seen along                 the    route    near      to the    barriers     on

the ends        of the         road.



We got        to the g ate^i m d went                to the Tap Bar,            I stopped       in the    pub until

about 2.50,           (1450),              however    the others          left earlier about 2.40

(1440),        because at this stage                   1 hadn't          got a ticket         to see    the match.

Whilst        I was     in the        pub I had a p p r o x i m a t e l y       four    pints    o/ beer.

Wh i l s t    in the Tap Bar                that    there were       between       100--200 i f a.ns corning in

the     back    door     to the            pub and going        into the        lounge,      tnere were a large

number        of fans      in the           pub on our arrival.                 The    number    of s upporters

in the        pub was      great           enough    for them to filter               into   the Tap Bar       to get

served,        the fans were                carrying a fair amount                of ale.

             Whilst     in the       pub I was a p p r o a c h e d       by         Liverpool     Fan who asked           if I

             wa n t e d to buy a spare              ticket      for    the/Spi       Kop w h i c h suited me        because

             my friends were w a t c h i n g             the game       ¥ r or/

             that    end,     I    paid £ 5,00 for          the ticke/i and           left

             the    pub at about           ten to three          C145CM       leaving       the m a j o r i t y of the     fans

             in the Gate           public       house.         I walked       down to the         ground by myself,          on

             my way down there were a great                       n u m b s / of Liverpool          fans    everywhere,

             they a p p e a r e d    to have        been d r i n k i n g and were           in high spirits,         there

             was    no trouble        on the way to the ground,                      quite a few were            drinking

 '•          from    cans and holding               two more.



             I went     via Leppings Ln and                 into Vers Rd            purely    because      the volume       of

             fans    was    too great,           normally       I would       cut    through,      but    there were       too

             many    fans     to do this          I. went      down Vere Rd,          walking      past    the    police    on

             both    ends of the street and through onto P e n istone Rd N o r t h .                                  I

             w a l k e d along      this       road without       e n c o u ntering any other             fans,    there were

             no queues at all and                 I entered the ground via turnstile                        seve n t y seven

             because my ticket was                 for Block N and my viewing                     point was       on the

             S p i o n Kop,       I went       in and made my way to my                   position on the terrace

             about    mid- w a y up in line with gate                    number       five.



             I encountered           no    problems        reaching my m a t / h viewing point there was
                                                         C A T '  C P f C r r y vCC>^
             plenty of        room,       as    I_ rea c h e d my s t a n d i n / spot the players had star t e d

             the    game,     the    only thing          I noticed was             that    the outer      pens    to the west

             end terraces w e r e n ’t as               full   as they n o r mally w ould be for a big m atch

             game,    1 noticed the              pens    in the       centre       behind the     goal     mouth were       full,



             I watched        the    game and as Peter Beardsley,                         a Liverpool      pla^sr,    hit    the

Fbe>T&\\j^   bar    of the N o t t i n g h a m Forest           goals with          the    ball   1 noticed at       point

some youths           were     climbing         over    the    fence     onto/the       p i t c I noticed

Po l i c e Officer's were               helping       them over and 1           just    thought    the    fans

were     playing        up.



Whe n    I got       into     the ground         I must       have mis s e d      the first      few minutes        of

the game         because all            I saw was an attack              made     by Liverpool      B e a r d s l e y ’s

shot,        and the      next     thing was a policeman going                     onto the      football

pitch,        he a p p r o a c h e d    the    referee and then the               players and the         referee

left     the     pitch,       I have      no    idea what was          happening,        all    I could see was

fans     coming       onto     the      pitch and they were              being a t t e n d e d to by St

Jo h n ' s    persons.           After a good few minutes                  some a mbulances         came     into

the     ground and waited just                   below the       terraces where           I was    standing,

anot h e r     two a mbulances            went    onto     the    pitch by the goal m outh A t               the

west     stand end,           I saw some fans            being     brought        to the S pion / ( a p end and
                              ^                                                                /______________
out,     they were          being       carried       on stretchers and even ad v e r t i s i n g            boards.



There was          so much going              on as    I just    looked around           not taking much

notice        of any      individuals           1 c o u l d n ’t see much at           the other    end because

a police         line had been formed across                     the w i d t h of the          pitch virtually

on the        centre      line,        people were       being     treated        on the West End stand

but     none were         being        treated on the Spion Kop                 side of the       police     line.

I. c o u l d n ’t see any          reason for the             police     line and the only          people who

came     through the           line were walking               injured or being           carried    through on

stret c h e r s      to the waiting             a m bulances     between the Spion Hop and                 the

north stand.                I stood with many other                 fans     in the Spion Kop,            not

knowing what            had happened            or whether       or not      to    leave or go,       I stood

watching,          personally           I think       they left     us    in the dark          in order    that

the     e m ergency services              could have          free m o v ement      to and from the ground.

the m a tch had been abandoned,                 a lot of fans          had    by this   time     left the

ground,     but   it did ask       us to wait a while             to allow the a m b u l a n c e s       to

leave    first.         I wa i t e d another       ten minutes         or so and event u a l l y

slo w l y made my way out          of the ground still             not       knowing    really what        had

happened,       I know that       by the way the          bodies were          being    carried out

that    some    people    had died       in the     incident,      I noticed       these    people were

carried off       somewhere as opposed to being                   put    in the ambulances.



I. moved    out   of the ground          into Pen i s t o n e Rd up Vere Rd

                                                        where     my wife worked.               There was

a sea of fans at          the j u n ction of Fielding             Rd at Leppings          Ln,    some

crying     stric k e n with grief,            others   shocked.          I joined my wife          in the

shop and at       this stage       there was a steady             stream of fans          coming    into

the shop to use the             phone    to    phone   relatives and friends,              some    said

they had       lost    relatives and          c o u l d n ’t find them,       I let them use       the

’phone.         I couldn't      describe        any,   they were        just a mass       between       fifty

to si;-:ty people        used the       phone.



My wife and       I wai t e d for       the fans m o v ement       to die down

               and went    home about          seven thirty       (1930).



                                                                                 trouble and that

 le police        did a good job to control               the    incident



I do believe          however    that    the Liverpool          fans    should have       been

posi t i o n e d on the S p i o n Kop.



I c a n ’t describe       individuals          or a n y b o d y ’s individual      movements,       to me

there was such a lot going                on.

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your faxed letter of 24 June 1999.

I can confirm that I have received a letter from Dr Popper, the Coroner for the
Hillsborough Disaster Inquest, following your approach to him. I have
acknowledged his letter and fully considered the points that he drew to my attention.
I telephoned him on the afternoon of 24 June and he gave me some further
information based on the correspondence between us in 1997.

That discussion, and my later telephone conversation with you, has persuaded me that
there is further voluntary disclosure that I should give both to you and to the other
parties to the private prosecution. I have obtained the consent of Dr Popper to
disclose our correspondence to you, and you have agreed that your letters may also
be disclosed to the other parties. I consider that it is in the interests of justice and also
of fairness to all parties that my relevant correspondence with the police is disclosed.
I have spoken to Mr Peter Metcalfe of Hammond Suddards and he has no objection as
long as it is emphasised that PII attaches to CPS/police correspondence as a class of
documents and that a precedent is not being set in this case for the disclosure of any
other documents in the class.

The chronology of this matter is that Dr Popper wrote to Mr Pearson, the then Branch
Crown Prosecutor at this office, on 16 April 1997. Based on his recollections he
expressed some concern about the differences between the evidence of Inspector
Harry White and that of Superintendent Murray as to when the latter became aware
that the gates to the tunnel had been closed in 1988. A copy of that letter is attached
together with my reply o f 18 April 1997.

In order to conduct a review of this new information, I sent a fax on 18 April 1997 to
the South Yorkshire Police with a copy of Dr Popper's letter attached and asked for a
response and all copies of any relevant statements. They replied by fax that day and
formally by letter on 21 April and 23 May. Copies of these three documents are
attached. The enclosures that were sent to me on 21 April were Inspector White's
statement of 10 June 1989 (number S2223) and Superintendent Murray's undated
statement (number S207). The enclosures sent on 23 April 1997 included an undated
manuscript statement of Inspector White which I was told had been made at the time
of the inquest hearing for the Coroner's viewing. A copy of that statement is also
attached. No other statements were provided to me by the police. I was informed that
no further statements of the Inspector had been found on the database.

My personal file note of 2 June 1997 was made after I had reviewed the new material.
I noted that Inspector White had not given evidence at the inquest and that his
statement(s) were not read out. Superintendent Murray's evidence throughout had
been that he did not know of the 1988 closure of the central tunnel to regulate the
flow of fans into the pens until after the 1989 disaster. The June 1989 statement of
Inspector White did not mention the tunnel. In his later undated statement he says that
during the briefing for the match no mention was made about the tunnel gates being
used to control ingress of the crowd. He goes on to discuss his knowledge of the gates
being used in the past. He gives no indication of the purported knowledge of
Superintendent Murray re the closing of the tunnel in 1988. I made a comment in my
file note that unless there was a statement of Inspector White that is not on the
database but was considered by Dr Popper, then I must presume that the Coroner's
recollection is wrong. I also noted that the police were doing final checks on the
number of statements made by Inspector White and that in the end no more were
found.

I considered the above matters during my 1997 review of the allegations made by
yourself and Mr T Hicks.

On 3 June 1999 you wrote to me and made a number of requests for disclosure. I
replied to you on 15 June 1999. However you copied your letter to Dr Popper and
asked him to consider the papers and then write to me. You sent me a faxed letter on
24 June requesting the disclosure to you of Dr Popper's letter sent in response to your
request to him. His letter to me of 21 June is attached. You will see that he refers to
the 1997 correspondence with myself and Mr Pearson. He also mentions a file note of
which I was not previously aware.

On 24 June I rang Dr Popper at his home and he told me that his file note of 5 March
1991 states that he saw Inspector White's statement, which was said to be dated 25
February 1991, where the officer says that he had discussed the previous closure of
the central tunnel gates with Superintendent Murray before the 1989 match was
played. I understand that there is no detail of the exact time of that discussion. Dr
Popper informed me that he had not told me of the date of Inspector White's statement
because at the time of our correspondence in 1997 his file note was in papers stored
elsewhere and he was working from a recollection only. He only obtained a copy of
the file note in August 1997. On now looking at the chronology of the events, he
considers that he may have made a mistake in his file note in that the date of Inspector
White's statement could be in 1990 and not 1991.
Dr Popper also says that he discussed this statement of Inspector White with Mr
Manning who was representing Superintendent Murray. Relevant parts of the
statement were shown to Mr Manning on or about 5 March 1991.

Dr Popper tells me that he does not wish to disclose his file note nor does he wish to
make a statement or appear as a witness re these matters.

I have copied this letter to Walker Morris, Winckworth Sherwood, Hammond
Suddards and Dr Popper together with enclosures. I have also advised the Chief
Constable through the solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police that every effort
should be made to confirm of otherwise the existence of any other statements made by
Inspector Harry White concerning the Hillsborough Disaster.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your latest letter of 10 June 1999. I am now able to give you a
substantive response to the four requests set out in your letter o f j June 1999.

We have taken into consideration the points made in the above letters and the one
volume of evidential material provided. Both yourselves and the solicitors acting for
the two defendants have received schedules of all the material in our possession,
including that said to be legally privileged or subject to Public Interest Immunity. All
parties have examined the non sensitive material at this office and any requested
photocopies have been provided as part of voluntary disclosure by the CPS.

You have invited us to :

•   Provide a copy of counsels'advice from 1990
•   Provide a copy of the final West Midlands Police Report
•   Make a statement indicating the material received and considered re the closing of
    the tunnel to the centre pens
•   Give guidance to the South Yorkshire Police under section 3(2) of the Prosecution
    of Offences Act 1985 re making the whole of the Hillsborough archive available
    to the HFSG, and for the archive to be resited.

Counsels' Advice

Mr C Enzor's letter dated 31 December 1998 and addressed to you set out the CPS
position on voluntary disclosure. Our view was that we would not voluntarily
disclose material which attracted either legal professional privilege or public interest
immunity. This would cover such documents as counsel's advice, internal
memoranda and opinions, and correspondence with the police. My letter to you dated
6 January 1999 confirmed that position.


                                                                                         1
i




    The above stance is unchanged. In coming to this decision we have considered your
    representations about the reasons why you require disclosure of counsels' advice and
    also your submission that it is highly doubtful whether our relationship with counsel
    can be described as one between lawyer and client so that privilege can be invoked.
    In particular, I find your last point to be misconceived.

    We do not agree that the disclosure of counsels' advice to either Lord Justice Stuart-
    Smith's scrutiny or to the police at the time of the Taylor Inquiry would constitute a
    waiver, whether implied or express, for the purpose o f disclosure to you in your
    private prosecution. You will have noted that counsels' advice has not been placed in
    the House Library as part of the material shown to the scrutiny. My understanding is
    that it was acknowledged as being subject to legal professional privilege. While I
    accept that you are aware of the conclusions of counsel as to there being insufficient
    evidence (as this was noted in chapter 1 of the scrutiny report), the body of that advice
    is plainly hearsay opinion which I do not consider to be relevant to any of the issues
    either at an abuse of process or committal hearing..

    It has also been decided that it is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case for
    the DPP to consider the waiver o f legal professional privilege.

    Final West Midlands Police Report

    Our previous correspondence with you confirmed that we would not give voluntary
    disclosure of PII material. This applies to any of the police reports to which PII still
    attaches. Evans -v- Chief Constable o f Surrey [1988] 1QB 588 is the authority for the
    proposition that a report sent by the police to the DPP seeking the latter's advice falls
    within a PII class. Kelly -v-Commissioner o f Police fo r the Metropolis [1997] TLR 22
    August 1997 confirms that proposition. The police and CPS prosecution team must be
    able to discuss details of cases and give advice freely and frankly without fear of such
    documentation being disclosed to third parties in other proceedings.

    I have considered the cases of Goodridge and Alfred Crompton Amusement Machines
    that you mention in your letter of 3 June, but I am not persuaded that they contain
    support for your request.

    In these circumstances we are declining to give you voluntary disclosure of the
    requested report in whatever form that we have it. I note your argument that there is
    no justification for withholding the Final Report when the Interim Report is in the
    public domain. However, as all the reports were generated by the police you may
    consider that, as a Chief Constable is the only person that can waive PII (see Kelly
    above), your approach should be to the Chief Constable for the force now holding the
    Hillsborough archive, that is, the South Yorkshire Police. In the end you have
    recourse to the courts for an adjudication on disclosure.

    CPS Statement

    The statement that you request concerns the CPS review of parts of the evidence
    covering the Hillsborough disaster and the subsequent judicial hearings and
    complaints arising. You have received a detailed schedule of all the material
    considered by various CPS lawyers, including myself, between 1989 and 1998. You


                                                                                                2
•   <'■' ' .   £
    {,    „



                   have also had the opportunity to view this material. I consider that your request has
                   been sufficiently actioned by the provision of the relevant information as part of
                   voluntary disclosure, without the need for a formal statement that we perceive would
                   have no relevance to any of the issues in the case.

                   Guidance to the Police

                   In his scrutiny report at chapter 5, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered the extensive
                   Hillsborough archive held by the South Yorkshire Police. He gave his opinion of the
                   status of that archive in that access to the material not covered by the Coroners Rules
                   was at the discretion o f the police. He made no adverse comment on the holding of
                   this material, indeed he stated at paragraph 32 that from his own knowledge he would
                   be surprised if criticisms of lack of disclosure (concerning body files) by the police
                   were true.

                   I understand that Mr M G Kennedy wrote to your Mr Coombes on 25 August 1998 to
                   explain that the CPS was not in the position to make any request for alternative
                   measures in relation to the safekeeping of the archive material held by the South
                   Yorkshire Police.

                   I have spoken to the solicitors acting for the Chief Constable and they confirm that
                   they have had no instructions to ask the CPS for advice under the provisions of the
                   Act. The CPS position concerning voluntary disclosure was made known to the South
                   Yorkshire Police in our letters of 31 December 1998 and 6 January 1999.

                   That position still remains the CPS view on voluntary disclosure. The police are
                   aware of it and it is a matter for the Chief Constable, who acts as a third party holding
                   relevant and unused material in your private prosecution, as to how he deals with your
                   requests. Ultimately it is for the court to carry out the exercise of the balance of
                   conflicting interests, a process which you have already used.

                   Conclusion

                   I note your comments on the attitude of the DPP to disclosure. His presentations were
                   of course directed to our core role o f conducting criminal prosecutions where one of
                   our most important objectives is to scrupulously comply with the duty of disclosure.
                   We fully accept that the same principle applies where, as in this case, we are a third
                   party to the proceedings. We consider that our voluntary disclosure in your
                   prosecution has been in accordance with the relevant law on disclosure and is to the
                   high standard that the Director has envisaged.

                   I have been particularly mindful of the recent case of R -v- CPS ex parte Lee[1999]
                   unreported, and the duty, among others, of a ’prosecutor’ to disclose material which
                   might enable a ’defendant* to make a pre-committal application to stay the
                   proceedings as an abuse of process. While it may be argued that the same duty does
                   not rest upon a third party, I consider that we have fully complied with it in all the
                   circumstances of the case.




                                                                                                            3

Mr. P. Pearson,
Branch Crown Prosecutor,
York Office,
United House,
Piccadilly,
York,
Y011PQ

Dear Mr. Pearson,

I understand that you or one of your colleagues are reviewing the evidence in
connection with the Hillsborough Disaster.

During the conduct of the Inquests I inter alia considered the statements by Police
Inspector Harry White. In the light of what I was told about Mr. White’s state of
health I decided that it would not be right to ask him to give evidence at the Inquests.

I do however seem to recall that there was a comment in a statement of his which
differs from the evidence of Mr. Murray as to when the latter became aware that the
gates to the tunnel were closed in 1988 . Mr. Murray said he learned about the tunnel
being closed off in 1988 after the 1989 disaster while as I recollect it Mr. White
indicated that he knew about this before.

I think that it is in everybody’s interest that your review is as full and comprehensive
as possible which is why I have drawn the above to your attention. You may of course
be aware of it anyway. Either way it is a matter entirely for you to decide whether this
is material and what reliance, weight and significance should be given to this.

Finally I would mention that I do not have a copy of the relevant statement by Mr.
White . If you do not have this statement already I am sure you can obtain a copy
from the Data Base. Please check the accuracy of my recollection.
DR S L Popper

Dear Dr Popper

Thank you for your telephone call and letter of 16th April 1997 which Mr Pearson has asked
me to acknowledge.

I am obtaining the statement of Inspector White that you mentioned and also the transcript
of Mr Murray’s evidence to your hearing.

I shall certainly consider them for my review.

South Yorkshire Police have a set of 186 video tapes made during the inquest and are able
to forward copies to me as requested. Your information as to their existence is greatly
appreciated.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Croston,                                                 YORK
                         Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

On 19th June 1999 L received a letter from Ann Adlington via the present Coroner in
Sheffield enclosing a copy of a letter to you dated 3rd June 1999 with various annexes.
She has asked me consider these and write to you.

I am extremely reluctant to get involved in Hillsborough again particularly as I have
been retired for a considerable period and for obvious reasons the detail is not as clear
as it used to be. I also for personal reasons (including geography) have no ready
access to the vast bulk of the material in the Coronal archives.

It seems to me that the majority of the points made by Miss Adlington are matters on
which for various reasons I cannot, need not, or should not comment. I want to
make it absolutely clear that merely because I have not commented or mentioned any
matter raised by Ms. Adlington cannot and must not be construed that I agree
with or accept ( or for th at m atter disagree with or reject) w hat is stated.

 I also want to make it clear that anything I say has to be read with the caveat that it
must be checked out as in view of the passage of time, my age and any other factor my
recall etc. may not be accurate.

Before I turn to her letter I would remind you that in 1997 when the CPS were
conducting their own review I was in touch with Mr. Pearson and you, and wrote to
Mr. Pearson on 16th April 1997. I do not know what became of your review but no
doubt you will bear in mind what I then said and act as you think fit. Perhaps on this
point for the sake of completeness I might just add that I see from a copy file note in
my possession that in early March 1990 I drew Mr. Manning’s attention to the
relevant part of the statement but he said his client would emphatically deny this.
 That would I suppose have made it impossible to admit the statement in its entirety as
documentary evidence under Coronal rules.

Turning now to Ms Adlington letter and referring to her numbered paragraphs.

1. Paragraph 38. I have no recollection of Mr. Mervyn Jones appearing before me on
18th April 1989. He did appear before me on 18th April 1990. I wonder if there is a
dating error here.

2. Paragraph 42. I am not clear why Mr. Daines states he is holding papers “on behalf
of the Coroner”. Mr. Dorries is looking into this. It may be that when West Midland
Police handed over their paper work (which was of course much more wide ranging
than the coronal enquiry) they passed over copies (and ? originals) of various
documents videos etc. which they had held but which had been specifically prepared
for the Coroner and it is these he is referring to. As far as I am aware the Coroner has
the Coronal documents used in the inquests under his care.

I hope the foregoing is of help to you.

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter.

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your letter of 21 June 1999.

I appreciate your concern at becoming involved in the present private prosecution by
Ann Adlington against the above two retired police officers.

 Since my letter to you of 18 April 1997 the CPS have completed three reviews. The
first was as a result of the Granada drama-documentary aired in December 1996.
Your recollections noted in your letter of 16 April 1997 were considered by me and I
obtained copies of all the relevant police statements including the statement of
Inspector Harry White that was prepared for your hearing. My comments on this
point were incorporated in the report of my recommendations that was sent to the
Director of Public Prosecutions in early May 1997. On 30 June 1997 the Home
Secretary was able to announce to the House that the Director considered that none of
the material made available to the CPS would justify fresh criminal investigations.

Further reviews were carried out by me following the publication of the Lord Justice
Stuart- Smith's scrutiny report and the instigation o f the private prosecution (when the
Director was asked to take over the case in order to discontinue it). As you know our
decision in declining to take over the case was taken to judicial review resulting in the
private prosecution still proceeding on the manslaughter and wilful misconduct
charges. I understand that the oral committal proceedings commence on 5 July at
Leeds Magistrates' Court.

Ms Adlington has not written to me concerning her requests made to you. I am
unsure as to what advice she considers you are able to give me. On the matter of the
Hillsborough 'archive' held by the South Yorkshire Police, the CPS have indicated to
her on a number of occasions that we did not consider ourselves to be in a position to
make any request for alternative safekeeping measures for the archive. In his scrutiny
report at chapter 5, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gave his opinion of the status of that
archive in that access to the material not covered by the Coroners Rules was at the
discretion of the police. He made no adverse comment on the holding of all the
material, indeed he stated that from his own knowledge he would be surprised if
criticisms of lack of disclosure (concerning body files) by the police were true.

 I am grateful that you have asked Mr Dorries to look into the some of the points
raised by Ms Adlington and I trust that eventually her fears will be laid to rest.

Again thank you for your assistance in this matter. I feel that the CPS must ensure
that all the relevant material has been considered and your contribution has gone to
the core of the allegations before the court. All the non sensitive documents held by
me have been fully disclosed to the two defendants and the Hillsborough Family
Support Group.

Please let me know if I can be of any further help.

Yours sincerely




George R Croston
Prosecution Team Leader

Mr. P. Pearson,
Branch Crown Prosecutor,
York Office,
United House,
Piccadilly,
York,
YOl 1PQ

Dear Mr. Pearson,

I understand that you or one of your colleagues are reviewing the evidence in
connection with the Hillsborough Disaster.

During the conduct of the Inquests I inter alia considered the statements by Police
Inspector Harry White. In the light of what I was told about Mr. White’s state of
health I decided that it would not be right to ask him to give evidence at the Inquests.

I do however seem to recall that there was a comment in a statement of his which
differs from the evidence of Mr. Murray as to when the latter became aware that the
gates to the tunnel were closed in 1988 . Mr. Murray said he learned about the tunnel
being closed off in 1988 after the 1989 disaster while as I recollect it Mr. White
indicated that he knew about this before.

I think that it is in everybody’s interest that your review is as full and comprehensive
as possible which is why I have drawn the above to your attention. You may of course
be aware of it anyway. Either way it is a matter entirely for you to decide whether this
is material and what reliance, weight and significance should be given to this.

Finally I would mention that I do not have a copy of the relevant statement by Mr.
White . If you do not have this statement already I am sure you can obtain a copy
from the Data Base. Please check the accuracy of my recollection.
DR S L Popper



                                                         PR3/GRC/HILLSBOROUGH/97

Dear Dr Popper

Thank you for your telephone call and letter of 16th April 1997 which Mr Pearson has asked
me to acknowledge.

I am obtaining the statement of Inspector White that you mentioned and also the transcript
of Mr Murray’s evidence to your hearing.

I shall certainly consider them for my review.

South Yorkshire Police have a set of 186 video tapes made during the inquest and are able
to forward copies to me as requested. Your information as to their existence is greatly
appreciated.

Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your faxed letter of 24 June 1999.

I can confirm that I have received a letter from Dr Popper, the Coroner for the
Hillsborough Disaster Inquest, following your approach to him. I have
acknowledged his letter and fully considered the points that he drew to my attention.
I telephoned him on the afternoon of 24 June and he gave me some further
information based on the correspondence between us in 1997.

That discussion, and my later telephone conversation with you, has persuaded me that
there is further voluntary disclosure that I should give both to you and to the other
parties to the private prosecution. I have obtained the consent of Dr Popper to
disclose our correspondence to you, and you have agreed that your letters may also
be disclosed to the other parties. I consider that it is in the interests of justice and also
of fairness to all parties that my relevant correspondence with the police is disclosed.
I have spoken to Mr Peter Metcalfe of Hammond Suddards and he has no objection as
long as it is emphasised that PII attaches to CPS/police correspondence as a class of
documents and that a precedent is not being set in this case for the disclosure of any
other documents in the class.

The chronology of this matter is that Dr Popper wrote to Mr Pearson, the then Branch
Crown Prosecutor at this office, on 16 April 1997. Based on his recollections he
expressed some concern about the differences between the evidence of Inspector
Harry White and that of Superintendent Murray as to when the latter became aware
that the gates to the tunnel had been closed in 1988. A copy of that letter is attached
together with my reply of 18 April 1997.

In order to conduct a review of this new information, I sent a fax on 18 April 1997 to
the South Yorkshire Police with a copy of Dr Popper's letter attached and asked for a
response and all copies of any relevant statements. They replied by fax that day and
formally by letter on 21 April and 23 May. Copies of these three documents are
attached. The enclosures that were sent to me on 21 April were Inspector White's
statement of 10 June 1989 (number S2223) and Superintendent Murray's undated
statement (number S207). The enclosures sent on 23 April 1997 included an undated
manuscript statement of Inspector White which I was told had been made at the time
of the inquest hearing for the Coroner's viewing. A copy of that statement is also
attached. No other statements were provided to me by the police. I was informed that
no further statements of the Inspector had been found on the database.

My personal file note of 2 June 1997 was made after I had reviewed the new material.
I noted that Inspector White had not given evidence at the inquest and that his
statement(s) were not read out. Superintendent Murray's evidence throughout had
been that he did not know of the 1988 closure of the central tunnel to regulate the
flow of fans into the pens until after the 1989 disaster. The June 1989 statement of
Inspector White did not mention the tunnel. In his later undated statement he says that
during the briefing for the match no mention was made about the tunnel gates being
used to control ingress of the crowd. He goes on to discuss his knowledge of the gates
being used in the past. He gives no indication of the purported knowledge of
Superintendent Murray re the closing of the tunnel in 1988. I made a comment in my
file note that unless there was a statement of Inspector White that is not on the
database but was considered by Dr Popper, then I must presume that the Coroner's
recollection is wrong. I also noted that the police were doing final checks on the
number of statements made by Inspector White and that in the end no more were
found.

I considered the above matters during my 1997 review of the allegations made by
yourself and Mr T Hicks.

On 3 June 1999 you wrote to me and made a number of requests for disclosure. I
replied to you on 15 June 1999. However you copied your letter to Dr Popper and
asked him to consider the papers and then write to me. You sent me a faxed letter on
24 June requesting the disclosure to you of Dr Popper's letter sent in response to your
request to him. His letter to me of 21 June is attached. You will see that he refers to
the 1997 correspondence with myself and Mr Pearson. He also mentions a file note of
which I was not previously aware.

On 24 June I rang Dr Popper at his home and he told me that his file note of 5 March
1991 states that he saw Inspector White's statement, which was said to be dated 25
February 1991, where the officer says that he had discussed the previous closure of
the central tunnel gates with Superintendent Murray before the 1989 match was
played. I understand that there is no detail of the exact time of that discussion. Dr
Popper informed me that he had not told me of the date of Inspector White's statement
because at the time of Our correspondence in 1997 his file note was in papers stored
elsewhere and he was working from a recollection only. He only obtained a copy of
the file note in August 1997. On now looking at the chronology of the events, he
considers that he may have made a mistake in his file note in that the date of Inspector
White's statement could be in 1990 and not 1991.
Dr Popper also says that he discussed this statement of Inspector White with Mr
Manning who was representing Superintendent Murray. Relevant parts of the
statement were shown to Mr Manning on or about 5 March 1991.

Dr Popper tells me that he does not wish to disclose his file note nor does he wish to
make a statement or appear as a witness re these matters.

I have copied this letter to Walker Morris, Winckworth Sherwood, Hammond
Suddards and Dr Popper together with enclosures. I have also advised the Chief
Constable through the solicitors acting for the South Yorkshire Police that every effort
should be made to confirm of otherwise the existence of any other statements made by
Inspector Harry White concerning the Hillsborough Disaster.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Yours sincerely

   Fresh evidence
   3         The first three o f these requests are directly relevant to the issue o f abuse o f process
             which the defence will raise before the magistrate. The fourth is primarily relevant to
             the presentation o f the case generally. I raise these issues in the light of the enclosed
             material that the Assistant Chief Constable o f the South Yorkshire produced to the
             Leeds District Magistrates Court on 24* May. There are three sets o f typed notes
             dated 16* 17* and 19* April 1989, marked Annex A, B and C, respectively, recording
             the content o f meetings held by the Chief Constable, Mr Peter Wright with senior
             officers o f his force. These notes contain important evidence, the contents o f which
              we believe were not disclosed to any o f the previous inquiries.

       4     We became aware that meetings had been held on those dates from the statement of
             DS Carr o f 25* April 1989, (Annex D)which was one o f the South Yorkshire police
             statements placed in the House o f Commons library in April 1998 at the insistence o f
             the Home Secretary after the “Scrutiny’’ o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. At a hearing
             before Mr Cadbury at Leeds on 10* May this year the SowthYorkshire police,
             represented by counsel and solicitor, objeetftd to the production o f the notes, and
             indred to all the material we listed in an application for a witness summons, on the
             ground that it did not fall within section 97 o f the Magistrates Courts Act 1980.

       5     The magistrate disagreed. He accepted the argument o f the prosecution that the
              records of these meetings were likely to be material within the requirement o f section
              97, because statements in those meetings were likely to be admissible in their own
              right, as direct evidence, under section 24 o f the Criminal Justice Act 1988;
              alternatively as admissions made by the defendants. As directed by the magistrate,
              these records and other material were produced at court by Mr Dain«», Assistant Chief
              Constable, on 24* May.

                       “Top o f the tunnel solid with horses - procedure that happened last year.”,

                To which the Chief Constable responded;

                       “The fact that encourages me is that we have a team of officers who have seen
                       and done it all before.”

                Murray was present at this meeting. For example, at page 6, Chief Superintendent
                Mole said, about 1989;

                       “What did we do about the tunnel and people seeing it and going for it?

                       Murray - “Total lack o f information apart from Marshall’s information.”



          9     Mr Duckenfield then suggested that the tunnel was shut off as a matter o f practice
                when the tunnel becomes full:

                        “The Order has officers listed, and once that central tunnel becomes full the    /
                 i ,   officers control that and it is shut off and people directed to the wings.” ' , ^         .   /

                       they were going through gate C, there was no action taken on that. You were               /

                       shutting o f the tunnel.”

          10    On 19* April, page 1, it is noted that there was nothing in the operational order or
                briefings about closing the tunnel but;

                       “Officers remembered (particularly Chief Inspector Creaser) that in previous K(fV
                       years the above has been done by the use o f horses and static police lines
                       (referred to as Supt Freeman’s policy).”

                No-one present at these meetings expressed any ignorance o f this policy and practice.

11     At Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, a different ac<x>unt was presented by the South Yorkshire
       police. For example, Superintendent Marshall, who is shown as present at the 16 and
       17"1April briefings in annexes A and B, was asked about the matter by Mr Woodward
       QC, representing the South Yorkshire policc, on 31*’ May 1989, transcript pages 45F-
       46E. Mr Marshall had o f course been inside the ground as a Superintendent in 1988.

              “There has been some suggestion that there was at a period during the 1988
              event a blocking off o f the tunnel to go to the terrace. Do you follow? A. Yes

              Do you know anything about that having been done? A. N o          1 was not           /

 12    Paragraph 171 o f the Taylor Interim Report records evidence that at league games a
       policy was followed o f filling pens one by one, but:

               “At cup semi-finals, a different approach was adopted. All the pens were
               opened from the start and the policy was “to let the fans find their own level”.
               This phrase was repeated over and over again by police officers at the Inquiry.”

 13     Paragraph 181 records that when the central pens became full in 1988, entry to the
        tunnel was blocked off by police shortly before kick-off. However, paragraphs 230-
        231, contain Lord Taylor’s central findings:

               “230. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been
               closed off whether gate C was to be opened or not. The exercise was a simple
               one and had been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was for a few
               officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans
               elsewhere. Unfcitunltely, the 1988 closure seems to have been unknown to
               tfc*S*mor officers on duty at the time, it did not figure on the debriefing notes.
               Therefore, it had no influence on the planning for 1 9 # .

               231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room
               where there was a view o f the pens and o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the
               tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect when gate C
               was opened, the fans could have been directed to the empty areas o f the wings
               and this disaster could still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a
               blunder o f the first magnitude.”                     ^

   14       Lord Taylor’s findings accurately record the evidence. The policy to block off the
            tunnel, spoken about by Supt Nesbitt, Supt Duckenfield, the Chief Constable, and ^              7
            known as “Supt Freeman policy”, is fundamentally different to a policy o f “find their
            own teyel” That phrase does not appear in the briefing notes o f 16* 17* and 19*            .


       15   However, the question whether senior officers knew that the central pens had been
            closed off by police officers in 1988 was not, apparently, a major concern at the
            Ttylor Inquiry, for the reason given in paragraph 231, The Taylor Inquiry continued,
            at paragraph 232, to describe the failure to close off the tunnel (whatever the officers’
            knowledge o f 1988) as “a blunder o f the first magnitude”, ( /

   The Interim Report o f the West M idlands Police and the 1988 isstie

   16       This question did, however, become important later. As you know, we found a copy
            o f the Interim Report o f the West Midlands Police in the Public Record Office last
            October. Section 17, part (v), deals with the 1988 issue. It says,

                    “Firstly a number o f supporters who attended the same game in 1988 sgtted the
                    tunnel access was at one point subject o f a blockade by police Officers. If thisy
                    happened it is not documented and was not a decision made by the Senior
                    Officws present at the 1988 game Enquiries have found just one retired
                    offfccr who recalls this happening. He, it must be said, is vague in his
                    recollection but the probability is that some officers acting on their own
                    initiative turning [w ] supporters away having recognised that p vt o f the
                    tcwace was full        Without doubt the feet that access to the tunnel was not /
                    controlled aggravated the overcrowding in pens 3 and 4 and is a significant
                    factor in the deaths o f the 95 people ”

   The 1990 accounts o f M urray and M arshall as to the 1988 issue

   17       The interview with Murray o f 25* June 1990, conducted by the West Midlands Police,
            a copy o f which has been supplied by you to us, demonstrates the increased
            importance o f this issue ir> the minds o f those conducting the investigation At page
            22,         answers a question about the closure o f the tunnel in 1988 (“by one form
            or another”) by saying he had no knowledge:

                    ‘T venever know [wc] the tunnel be closed under any circumstances.... it’s
                    never come to my attention, the, that the tunnel’s been dosed, at any o f &e
                    matches I went to, particularly the 1988 (000688) aemi-flnaf”             /

   18       Similar questions, with similar answers, were put to Superintendent Marshal I,^/(Neither
            Duckenfield nor Greenwood answered questions, but Greenwood put in his own
            statement, which did not deal with this issue.)

   19     Hie answers given by Murray and Marshall are, o f course, quite inconsistent with the
          accounts given in the briefing notes o f 16*, 17* and 19* April 1989.

   20    In his interview with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith o f 2nd December 1997, Detective
          Superintendent Fosterof the West Midlands Police indicated that the questions put in
          June 1990 to Murray, Marshall etc were put after a consultation with leading counsel.
          (Mr Foster referred to “Mr Williams”, now Lord Williams o f Mostyn QC). It is
          therefore reasonably clear that leading counsci must have advised that the 1988 issue
          was important, perhaps critical, to his advice. Furthermore, a formal witness statement
          (Annex E) dated 30* June 1990 was taken from PC Lang about the closing o f the
          gates in 1988, presumably by the West Midland Police, which would also have resulted
          from a query by counsel or the CPS.

   The South Yorkshire police presentation o f the 1988 issue

   21    The South Yorkshire police had themselves drawn a similar favourable conclusion as
          they prepared for civil proceedings, and had no doubt communicated it to the West
         Midlands police. I enclose as Annex F a statement by Chief Inspector Bettison (then o f
         the South Yorkshire police, now Chief Constable o f the Merseyside police), dated 12*
          July 1990, in which he too remarks;

                 “The fullest information on the closure o f the central tunnel at the 1988 setni>
                 final was obtained and forwarded. It was an informal initiative at junior level
                 not reported to command level. It was performed exclusively by police."

   22    Mr Bettison has admitted in public since his appointment at Liverpool last October that
         he was part o f a small group o f South Yorkshire officers who were investigating the
         disaster in the Spring o f 1989. You will note from the attached statements A w iex G
         that Mr Bettison has initialled the statement o f an officer who gave a short statement at
         the end o f April 1989 contradicting the assertion that horses had been used to shut off
         tlg| tunnel, and attached his own written comments. No evidence is available that
         contradictod the other assertions made in the briefing notes. The conflicting evidence
         about control by horses was not brought to the attention o f the CPS, nor, we believe,
         any o f the other inquiries. Mr Bettison’s conclusion o f July 1990 cannot be reconciled
         with the briefing notes o f April 1989.

   23    It may be assumed that the South Yorkshire Police drew this matter to the attention of
          West Midlands Police, who shared the same Holmes computer system on which
          Dettison’s statement o f July 1990 was stored, The West Midlands Interim report
          indicated that, unusually, South Yorkshire police collected and supplied evidence to
          the West Midlands on some aspects o f the criminal enquiry to influence the
          investigating force’s recommendations. (See last paragraph o f the Interim Report,
          page 20.)

   24    Mr Metcalf o f Hammond Suddards, solicitors to the South Yorkshire police, told Lord
         Justice Stuart'Smith on 11* November 1997 (Annex H) that,

                 “The only record o f the request [asking for officers’ impressions and
                 comments] will be in Chief Inspector Bettison’s notes of the meeting of 17th
                 April which I have not seen.”

   25    Counsel appearing for the Chief Constable at recent hearings in Leeds in relation to
          witnesses summonses offered the magistrate the explanation that Mr Metcalf was
          wrong in saying that Bcttison attended the 17* April meeting. However, he was
          evidently involved in 1989 and the summer o f 1990 and came up with an explanation in
          July 1990, identical to that offered to the CPS by West Midlands police in the Interim
          Report, which cannot sit with the material in the fresh evidence.

   26    It is, I believe, obvious that the final report o f the West Midlands police will have
          emphasised and strengthened the comment in the Interim Report o f October 1989,
          cited above, in the light o f the evidence o f Murray and Marshall, and the statement of
          Bettison, and will have presented to leading counsel a fairly clear evidential conclusion
          that senior officers like Murray were not aware o f the dosing o f the tunnel at the 1988
          final, or any otter big game.

   The Coroner and the 1988 issue

   27    The Coroner’s Inquest also attached significance to the 1988 issue. The Coroner had
         the final West Midlands police report He informed Lord Justice Stuart-Smith that
          when selecting potential witnesses, he used the DPP index as his screen. The Coroner
         directed the jury at Day 75 that the senior Commanders had not been aware of
          diversions from the tunnel by police officers in 1988. (Divider H o f the documents
          accompanying the HFSG submission to the CPS o f 24* September 1998 sets this out.)

   28    Mr Murray’s answers to the Coroner’s questions demonstrate the evidential
         significance o f the briefing notes. He said he knew nothing o f the closing off o f the
         tunnel in 19M until after the disaster;

                 “It m e to toy attention someone said the tunnel was closed in 1988. I
                 disputed that but if people say ft was dosed, it was closed.”

   29    Mr King, for some o f the Liverpool families, asked, on the basis o f evidence from
         supporters;

                 “Were you not aware o f the system operated by the Police in the past, that is,
                 before 1989, if they so chose, o f diverting fans from, shall we say, the centre
                 pens to the side pens on the terrace.

                 A, What system was that, sir?”




                                                   7

    30       Mr Murray repeated this answer twice, (Day 67, p 55F-G ) No-one outside the South
             Yorkshire police knew that a system had been described in front o f Mr Murray on 17*
             April, that he did not dispute it, and that not one officer o f the large number present
             had disputed the description o f a system.


    The significance o f the briefings notes in relation to the edited statements

    31       Our formal Representations o f 24th August and 24* September 1998 described at
             length the process adopted by the South Yorkshire police in the early weeks after the
             disaster o f excising factual material from statements o f junior officers. In particular,
             references to the 1988 closure o f the tunnel and the practice by which the Control
             Room monitored the terraces and the closure o f the tunnel was dealt with in one or
             more o f the early statements o f Inspector White, PC Woodcock, PC Lang, and PS
             Crawford. All o f the rcfcrences to 1988 were then expunged.

    32       Furthermore, none o f the statements o f the senior officers, dated for the most part in
             etfly May \99p (copies o f which were placed at the insistence o f the Home Secretary
             in the House o f Commons library in April 1998) dealt with the subject o f 1988 at all.

    33     We know that only the edited versions o f statements were sent to the DPP and the
           Coroner This much is clear from the Master Witness List o f April 1990, and has been
           in any event admitted by Detective Superintendent Foster in a letter to the Home
           Office in the course o f the “Scrutiny”, that the edited, not the unedited, statements
         , were to be used as the basis for submission to the DPP and Coroner.
         ^                                 HML 0V“l(j/\C iM tdU&jU                                        CPS
    34       The comments in the briefing notes about 1988 and the established practice
             demonstrate that the most senior officers o f the South Yorkshire police realised the
             relevance o f those matters to the inquiry. They make it impossible to argue that the
             deletions o f assertions about 1988 and the closing o f the tunnel were matters which
             could be deleted from statements as being comment, opinion, or repetition.

    The wider significance o f th^ fresh evidence

    35       These notes disclose that the senior officers o f the South Yorkshire police were
             meeting to formulate an agreed approach as to the facts o f the disaster, before any o f
             them made a witness statement, and, it appears, before they made detailed notes.
             Annex A shows that various matters were “Agreed”. For example, there were short
             very short contributions from three officers, one o f whom, Superintendent Marshall
             (who had, it appears, contrary to the general practice, made some kind o f note),
             imputed "drinking outside off-licences” to the Liverpool fans.

    36        The Chief Constable then put the following proposition to the 28 persons present,
             including 24 officers o f the rank o f Inspector or senior:

                      “So there is no evidence whatsoever o f the delay in transit o f the fans. Then
                     fans arrived at the ground vicinity early enough to go in the ground but instead
                     went drinking. THIS WAS AGREED. ”

       ,1    Various other propositions were agreed, no questions critical of police were posed,
             and the meeting concluded with a speech by the Chief Constable in which the tactical
             presentation o f the facts was considered,

       ;B   The second and third meetings took place after the announcement o f the institution of
            Lord Taylor’s inquiry, after the West Midlands police had been appointed by the Chief
             Constable to conduct an independent inquiry, and to investigate for Lord Taylor. The
             third took place the day after the inquest had been opened on 18* April, at which Mr
             Mervyn Jones o f the West Midlands police had appeared as Coroner’s officer. Annexes
             B and C show some discussion about safety, but principally a similar tactical approach
             to the investigation o f the disaster as had characterised the first meeting.

       39   The basic and obvious approach to any police investigation is to obtain statements or
             notes from witnesses as soon as possible, so as to ensure that a witness puts down his
             own honest account while it is fresh in his mind, and so that no-one can suggest that,
             his account has been influenced by the opinions, recollections and observations o f
             others. A normal, proper and honest investigation would have involved the writing o f
             formal witness statements within a day o f the disaster. Critical questions should have
             been posed and answered in writing as to why, for example, Duckenfield had falsely
             told so many people, including Assistant Chief Constable Jackson, that the fans had
             broken down the gates.

       40    The briefing notes show that the South Yorkshire police did not do any o f this. They
             show that the most important aim in the minds o f those responsible for policing the
             event was to achievc a consensus on critical issues, with which later statements and
             evidence would be consistent. The prosecution are in no doubt that the CPS was not
              shown these briefing notes, nor any pocket book notes. They disclose a disgraceful
             approach to the investigation o f a disaster which was without precedent in British
              sport, and which demanded honesty, integrity and utter candour.

       The relevance o f the advice and police rep o rt^

       41    The contents o f the police r€port and counsel’s dfwions are obviously relevant to
              tames before the magistrates’ court, namely, whether H is an abuse o f procew to
              prosecute when (a) the CPS decided not to prosecute in 1990, (b) the Coroner’s
              verdicts (founded on evidence referred to in the report) were accidental death, and (c)
              Lord Justice Stuart-Smith ruled that no fresh investigation was warranted. We have
              material already which implies that those inquiries were misled. No-epe has
              contradicted the inferences which we argued in September 1998 ought to be drawn
              from the material available. We have presented the material to the South Yorkshire
               police themselves in conncction with the issue o f funding the defence, and have
               rcccivcd no denials or contradictions o f those facts and assertions.

^^4 2   Nor have we been supplied with any explanation why South Yorkshire police should
        have the police report and advice o f counsel Assistant Chief Constable Daines made a
        ‘^witness statement” on 19“’ May 1999 (Annex I ) , The second paragraph o f the first
        page shows that the papers were “generated” by West Midlands, who prepared papers
        for Lord Taylor, and for the CPS. Mr Daines is holding papers “on behalf o f the
        Coroner”. The Coroner has indicated that apart from the limited category o f
        documents he is obliged to disclose under the Coroners’ Rules, he considers that the
        law prohibits him from disclosing documents to the prosecution. Why then do the
        police hold them?

   43   Mr Daines contends at page 2 that “The archive is a historical record o f the
        tragedy     I would ask that these documents are returned to me at the conclusion of
        these proceedings so that 1 can preserve the integrity o f the archive.”

   44   We know o f no possible legal basis for the “archive” to be held by South Yorkshire
        police, but this is the first time we have been told that this is a “historical record”. The
        phrase suggests that the archive is to be made available to writers in the future, hut
        presumably, only after an undetermined number o f years. It is not reasonable for a
        decision as to the release o f such information to be left in the hands o f the police force
        which has admitted negligence, which has argued that the defendants costs should be
        paid in full out o f its police fund, and which has argued that the documents sought by
        the prosecution ought not to be produced to the court.

   45   It is absurd to argue that a historian should be able to see the material in the future, but
        that the prosecution cannot have access to it now.

   46   Mr Daines has argued that the facts o f the case justify the funding o f the defence by his
        Police Authority. That authority has agreed to fund it, on the basis that it accepts Mr
        Dames’ verdict that the officers acted “in good faith”. The prosecution itself involves
        allegations o f negligence against the South Yorkshire force. In these circumstances it is
        offensive and unjust that the South Yorkshire police should hold the papers which
        were prepared by others who reported to Lord Taylor, the CPS, the Police Complaints
        Authority, and the Coroner, The material in their possession that has been disclosed in
        the last year has come to our attention only through the intervention o f the Home
        Secretary, allowing us to see the edited statements o f the officers, and to discover the
        existence o f the meetings o f SYP which took place in the days following the disaster.

   47   Most offensively o f all, the solicitor to the South Yorkshire police, Peter Metcalf of
        Hammond Suddards, who was directly involved in the editing process in 1990, has
        demanded that before any “voluntary disclosure” is made by way o f the supply o f copy
        documents, we identify to him the suggested relevance o f each document, and that we
        agree to pay the extortionate figure o f £30 per hour for the work o f an officer (a) to
        locate the documents, (b) to copy and provide them to prosecution, and (c) to copy
        and provide them to both solicitors for the defence, each o f whom is funded in any
        event by the South Yorkshire Police Authority. This extraordinary condition amounts
        to a requirement that we subsidise the costs incurred by the South Yorkshire Police
        Authority in paying for the dcfcnce.

                  Legal professional privilege

                  48     There is no legal impediment to your disclosing the report and the advice o f counsel.
                         The police can claim no privilege in the advice, because the CPS asked for it. It &
                         highly doubtful whether your relationship with the counsel can be described as one
                         between lawyer and client, so that privilege can be invoked

                  49     If, alternatively, privilege does exist, it was surely waived when the advice was
                          disclosed successively to the West Midlands and South Yorkshire forces and to Lord
                          Justice Stuart-Smiih. The report o f the “Scrutiny"refers to some limited parts o f the
                          advice but not others- The limited part o f the report quoted by Lord Justice Stuart-
                          Smith will be used against US. We, and the court, will need to see the rest o f it.

                  50     If it is contended that privilege has not been waived by these previous disclosures, the
                          CPS can waive it now. In the circumstances, the CPS has a most powerful duty to
                          ensure that the court hearing the abuse o f process application is not misled by general
                          assertions about the thoroughness o f the West Midlands investigation, the experience
                         o f two leading counsel, the suggestion that the CPS saw all the evidence, and other
                          assertions o f the kind advanced by the defencc hitherto to you or the South Yorkshire
                          Police Authority.

                  51     Tfthere are any parts o f the report or advice which contain confidential comments
                         upon persons who are not concerned in this prosecution, or other unusually sensitive
                         material, it would o f course be open to you to redact or obscure such material in the
                         familiar modem way.

                  Confidentiality

 r>. r     52             It cannot possibly be argued that considerations o f confidentiality justify withholding

                          doctrine o f privilege, and the restrictions upon the effectiveness o f claims o f

                  The attitude o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions to Disclosure

                  54      I^efNefeetor has publicly affirmed twice in recent weeks the great importance to the
                          *d*»W**«»n o f justice o f proper disclosure o f all relevant material to the defence. It
                          cannot be right, or consistent with this policy o f openness, that disclosure o f matters
                          relevant to important issues o f abuse o f proccss, which fall to be decided by the
                          magistrate, can be withheld from the prosecution.

   55    We invite you to disclose the police report and advice to us well in advance of the          ftM O
         committal, and 1 respectfully suggest by 25* June so that we can deal with its
         significance by advance written submissions to the court and defence. We also invite
         you to provide us with a statement by the same date setting out what the CPS knew
         about the practice o f closing the tunnel and confirming that in 1990, the DPP and
         Counsel were provided with the edited versions o f police officers’ statements

   56    In view of the importance of these matters, we shall send a copy of this letter and its
          enclosures to Mr Metcalf, the Police Complaints Authority and the former Coroner,
          ami ask them to make comments to you, and to draw any facts they consider relevant
          to your attention. If matters within their own knowledge show that we are wrong in
          any of the inferences we have made from the facts as known to us, they can tell you.
          We shall also draw the attention o f this letter and your reply to the attention of the
          magistrate, Mr Cadbury, when we contend that the prosecution should proceed.
                                                                                       HOC*

   57     Section 3 (2) (c) o f the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 imposes the duty on the
          Director “to give, to such extent as he considers appropriate, advice to police forces
          on all matters relating to criminal offences”. This duty does not arise only when a
          force requests advice, Mr Justicc Moore-Bick said so specifically in the Goodridge
          case at pages 902h-903a, citing reg 4 ,gfthe Prosecution of Offences Regulations 1978
          as well as section 3 (2) of the 1985 Act          KP1 >K/hA& kOM

   58     In the light o f the history o f the case, our previous representations, and the new
          material, we contend that it is overwhelmingly in the interests o f justice that the
          Director advises the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that the archive as a
          whole should be handed over to the CPS, or to some other party nominated by you
          after consultation with us. If you advised merely that the papers should be retained by
          the police, but that we should have access to them, past experience shows that endless
          petty obstructions would be placed resentfully in our way when we planned to travel to
           Sheffield to inspect and take copies.

   59     We will complete our preparation of the committal papers this week, and are anxious
          to continue our investigations of the evidence as soon as possible thereafter. We may
          be placed under time pressure by the Crown Court if the matter is committed, and we
          shall of course have obligations of disclosure to the defendants. Accordingly, it is
          important that we gain access as soon as possible to the archive. I look forward your
          reply,


   Yours sincerely,

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your latest letter of 10 June 1999. I am now able to give you a
substantive response to the four requests set out in your letter o f ^ June 1999.

We have taken into consideration the points made in the above letters and the one
volume of evidential material provided. Both yourselves and the solicitors acting for
the two defendants have received schedules of all the material in our possession,
including that said to be legally privileged or subject to Public Interest Immunity. All
parties have examined the non sensitive material at this office and any requested
photocopies have been provided as part of voluntary disclosure by the CPS.

You have invited us to :

•      Provide a copy of counsels' advice from 1990
•      Provide a copy of the final West Midlands Police Report
•      Make a statement indicating the material received and considered re the closing of
       the tunnel to the centre pens
•      Give guidance to the South Yorkshire Police under section 3(2) of the Prosecution
       of Offences Act 1985 re making the whole of the Hillsborough archive available
       to the HFSG, and for the archive to be resited.

    Counsels' Advice

Mr C Enzor's letter dated 31 December 1998 and addressed to you set out the CPS
position on voluntary disclosure. Our view was that we would not voluntarily
disclose material which attracted either legal professional privilege or public interest
immunity. This would cover such documents as counsel's advice, internal
memoranda and opinions, and correspondence with the police. My letter to you dated
6 January 1999 confirmed that position.


                                                                                         1
«




    The above stance is unchanged. In coming to this decision we have considered your
    representations about the reasons why you require disclosure of counsels' advice and
    also your submission that it is highly doubtful whether our relationship with counsel
    can be described as one between lawyer and client so that privilege can be invoked.
    In particular, I find your last point to be misconceived.

    We do not agree that the disclosure of counsels' advice to either Lord Justice Stuart-
    Smith's scrutiny or to the police at the time of the Taylor Inquiry would constitute a
    waiver, whether implied or express, for the purpose o f disclosure to you in your
    private prosecution. You will have noted that counsels' advice has not been placed in
    the House Library as part o f the material shown to the scrutiny. My understanding is
    that it was acknowledged as being subject to legal professional privilege. While I
    accept that you are aware of the conclusions of counsel as to there being insufficient
    evidence (as this was noted in chapter 1 of the scrutiny report), the body o f that advice
    is plainly hearsay opinion which I do not consider to be relevant to any of the issues
    either at an abuse of process or committal hearing..

    It has also been decided that it is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case for
    the DPP to consider the waiver of legal professional privilege.

    Final West Midlands Police Report

    Our previous correspondence with you confirmed that we would not give voluntary
    disclosure of PII material. This applies to any of the police reports to which PII still
    attaches. Evans -v- Chief Constable o f Surrey [1988] 1QB 588 is the authority for the
    proposition that a report sent by the police to the DPP seeking the latter's advice falls
    within a PII class. Kelly -v-Commissioner o f Police fo r the Metropolis [1997] TLR 22
    August 1997 confirms that proposition. The police and CPS prosecution team must be
    able to discuss details of cases and give advice freely and frankly without fear of such
    documentation being disclosed to third parties in other proceedings.

    I have considered the cases of Goodridge and Alfred Crompton Amusement Machines
    that you mention in your letter of 3 June, but I am not persuaded that they contain
    support for your request.

    In these circumstances we are declining to give you voluntary disclosure of the
    requested report in whatever form that we have it. I note your argument that there is
    no justification for withholding the Final Report when the Interim Report is in the
    public domain. However, as all the reports were generated by the police you may
    consider that, as a Chief Constable is the only person that can waive PII (see Kelly
    above), your approach should be to the Chief Constable for the force now holding the
    Hillsborough archive, that is, the South Yorkshire Police. In the end you have
    recourse to the courts for an adjudication on disclosure.

    CPS Statement

    The statement that you request concerns the CPS review of parts of the evidence
    covering the Hillsborough disaster and the subsequent judicial hearings and
    complaints arising. You have received a detailed schedule of all the material
    considered by various CPS lawyers, including myself, between 1989 and 1998. You


                                                                                                2
have also had the opportunity to view this material. I consider that your request has
been sufficiently actioned by the provision of the relevant information as part of
voluntary disclosure, without the need for a formal statement that we perceive would
have no relevance to any of the issues in the case.

Guidance to the Police

In his scrutiny report at chapter 5, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith considered the extensive
Hillsborough archive held by the South Yorkshire Police. He gave his opinion of the
status of that archive in that access to the material not covered by the Coroners Rules
was at the discretion of the police. He made no adverse comment on the holding of
this material, indeed he stated at paragraph 32 that from his own knowledge he would
be surprised if criticisms of lack of disclosure (concerning body files) by the police
were true.

I understand that Mr M G Kennedy wrote to your Mr Coombes on 25 August 1998 to
explain that the CPS was not in the position to make any request for alternative
measures in relation to the safekeeping of the archive material held by the South
Yorkshire Police.

I have spoken to the solicitors acting for the Chief Constable and they confirm that
they have had no instructions to ask the CPS for advice under the provisions of the
Act. The CPS position concerning voluntary disclosure was made known to the South
Yorkshire Police in our letters of 31 December 1998 and 6 January 1999.

That position still remains the CPS view on voluntary disclosure. The police are
aware of it and it is a matter for the Chief Constable, who acts as a third party holding
relevant and unused material in your private prosecution, as to how he deals with your
requests. Ultimately it is for the court to carry out the exercise of the balance of
conflicting interests, a process which you have already used.

Conclusion

I note your comments on the attitude of the DPP to disclosure. His presentations were
of course directed to our core role of conducting criminal prosecutions where one of
our most important objectives is to scrupulously comply with the duty of disclosure.
We fully accept that the same principle applies where, as in this case, we are a third
party to the proceedings. We consider that our voluntary disclosure in your
prosecution has been in accordance with the relevant law on disclosure and is to the
high standard that the Director has envisaged.

I have been particularly mindful o f the recent case of R -v- CPS ex parte Lee[1999]
unreported, and the duty, among others, of a 'prosecutor' to disclose material which
might enable a 'defendant' to make a pre-committal application to stay the
proceedings as an abuse of process. While it may be argued that the same duty does
not rest upon a third party, I consider that we have fully complied with it in all the
circumstances of the case.




                                                                                         3

Dear Mr Croston,                                                YORK
                         Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

On 19* June 1999 I received a letter from Ann Adlington via the present Coroner in
Sheffield enclosing a copy of a letter to you dated 3rd June 1999 with various annexes.
She has asked me consider these and write to you.

I am extremely reluctant to get involved in Hillsborough again particularly as I have
been retired for a considerable period and for obvious reasons the detail is not as clear
as it used to be. I also for personal reasons (including geography) have no ready
access to the vast bulk of the material in the Coronal archives.

It seems to me that the majority of the points made by Miss Adlington are matters on
which for various reasons I cannot, need not, or should not comment. I want to
make it absolutely clear that merely because I have not commented or mentioned any
matter raised by Ms. Adlington cannot and m ast not be construed th at I agree
with or accept ( or for that m atter disagree with or reject) what is stated.

 I also want to make it clear that anything I say has to be read with the caveat that it
must be checked out as in view of the passage of time, my age and any other factor my
recall etc. may not be accurate.

Before I turn to her letter I would remind you that in 1997 when the CPS were
conducting their own review I was in touch with Mr. Pearson and you, and wrote to
Mr. Pearson on 16* April 1997. I do not know what became of your review but no
doubt you will bear in mind what I then said and act as you think fit. Perhaps on this
point for the sake of completeness I might just add that I see from a copy file note in
my possession that in early March 1990 I drew Mr. Manning’s attention to the
relevant part of the statement but he said his client would emphatically deny this.
 That would I suppose have made it impossible to admit the statement in its entirety as
documentary evidence under Coronal rules.

Turning now to Ms Adlington letter and referring to her numbered paragraphs.

1, Paragraph 38. I have no recollection of Mr. Mervyn Jones appearing before me on
18th April 1989. He did appear before me on 18th April 1990. I wonder if there is a
dating error here.

2. Paragraph 42. I am not clear why Mr. Daines states he is holding papers “on behalf
of the Coroner”. Mr. Dorries is looking into this. It may be that when West Midland
Police handed over their paper work (which was of course much more wide ranging
than the coronal enquiry) they passed over copies (and ? originals) of various
documents videos etc. which they had held but which had been specifically prepared
for the Coroner and it is these he is referring to. As far as I am aware the Coroner has
the Coronal documents used in the inquests under his care.

I hope the foregoing is of help to you.

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter.



Yours sincerely,




                                               H S.

Dear Mr Popper

RE: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for your letter of 21 June 1999.

I appreciate your concern at becoming involved in the present private prosecution by
Ann Adlington against the above two retired police officers.

 Since my letter to you of 18 April 1997 the CPS have completed three reviews. The
first was as a result of the Granada drama-documentary aired in December 1996.
Your recollections noted in your letter of 16 April 1997 were considered by me and I
obtained copies of all the relevant police statements including the statement of
Inspector Harry White that was prepared for your hearing. My comments on this
point were incorporated in the report of my recommendations that was sent to the
Director of Public Prosecutions in early May 1997. On 30 June 1997 the Home
Secretary was able to announce to the House that the Director considered that none of
the material made available to the CPS would justify fresh criminal investigations.

Further reviews were carried out by me following the publication of the Lord Justice
Stuart- Smith's scrutiny report and the instigation of the private prosecution (when the
Director was asked to take over the case in order to discontinue it). As you know our
decision in declining to take over the case was taken to judicial review resulting in the
private prosecution still proceeding on the manslaughter and wilful misconduct
charges. I understand that the oral committal proceedings commence on 5 July at
Leeds Magistrates' Court.

Ms Adlington has not written to me concerning her requests made to you. I am
unsure as to what advice she considers you are able to give me. On the matter of the
Hillsborough 'archive' held by the South Yorkshire Police, the CPS have indicated to
her on a number of occasions that we did not consider ourselves to be in a position to
make any request for alternative safekeeping measures for the archive. In his scrutiny
report at chapter 5, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gave his opinion of the status of that
archive in that access to the material not covered by the Coroners Rules was at the
discretion of the police. He made no adverse comment on the holding of all the
material, indeed he stated that from his own knowledge he would be surprised if
criticisms of lack of disclosure (concerning body files) by the police were true.

 I am grateful that you have asked Mr Dorries to look into the some of the points
raised by Ms Adlington and I trust that eventually her fears will be laid to rest.

Again thank you for your assistance in this matter. I feel that the CPS must ensure
that all the relevant material has been considered and your contribution has gone to
the core of the allegations before the court. All the non sensitive documents held by
me have been fully disclosed to the two defendants and the Hillsborough Family
Support Group.

Please let me know if I can be of any further help.

Yours sincerely

Mr. P. Pearson,
Branch Crown Prosecutor,
York Office,
United House,
Piccadilly,
York,
Y011PQ

Dear Mr. Pearson,

I understand that you or one of your colleagues are reviewing the evidence in
connection with the Hillsborough Disaster.

During the conduct of the Inquests I inter alia considered the statements by Police
Inspector Harry White. In the light of what I was told about Mr. White’s state of
health I decided that it would not be right to ask him to give evidence at the Inquests.

I do however seem to recall that there was a comment in a statement of his which
differs from the evidence of Mr. Murray as to when the latter became aware that the
gates to the tunnel were closed in 1988 . Mr. Murray said he learned about the tunnel
being closed off in 1988 after the 1989 disaster while as I recollect it Mr. White
indicated that he knew about this before.

I think that it is in everybody’s interest that your review is as full and comprehensive
as possible which is why I have drawn the above to your attention. You may of course
be aware of it anyway. Either way it is a matter entirely for you to decide whether this
is material and what reliance, weight and significance should be given to this.

Finally I would mention that I do not have a copy of the relevant statement by Mr.
White . If you do not have this statement already I am sure you can obtain a copy
from the Data Base. Please check the accuracy of my recollection.
DR S L Popper

Dear Dr Popper

Thank you for your telephone call and letter of 16th April 1997 which Mr Pearson has asked
me to acknowledge.

I am obtaining the statement of Inspector White that you mentioned and also the transcript
of Mr Murray’s evidence to your hearing.

I shall certainly consider them for my review.

South Yorkshire Police have a set of 186 video tapes made during the inquest and are able
to forward copies to me as requested. Your information as to their existence is greatly
appreciated.

Yours sincerely

two    sets       of    turnstiles.                  J.      became      aware        of a        movement        of p e o p l e .           From

there       were       too m a n y         for      waiting         friends          responding               to a k i c k        off       or

screaming          trapped             in them.              Gate       *C*    was     open and            people       were       coming

through.           The          terror       in the          turnstiles             communi, c a t e d         itself        to me

By word          of rnouth            information                 p as sed,       "Inside         - Pitch          invasion".                Went

to    the      pitch         via     rear        of     police          control,        box      and      down     the       first       steps

The      invasion appeared                       to     h av e      spread         as    far     as     the p e n a l t y      spot.         .1!

those       on    the        pitch         were        not    running           towards opponents                   end        or a w a y

from      Police            Officers.              Some       were        holding         themselves,              others           lyin g

down.          I looked             towards            the    fence          holding        back       fans      in the         Leppings

Lane      terraces.                 Police         Officers             were      standing           on    the     fence        and      leaning

over.          Through            the      gaps        in the          legs      I could         see      the    faces         of    fa ns

pressed, a g a i n s t              the     fence.            I realised               they      were      stood        up     dead.         The

Automatically                  (or       it s e e m e d )         Police        Officers          formed         a double            line     up

there       was     no       one     at     your        end       of    the      line     to     pass      on    the     casualty,            you

carried          it on         to    the        pitch.            Police        Constable            2417 Pete           Rotchel           and     J'.

his      condition             very        closely,           keeping            him warm and              protected.                I

[ heard         someone          say,       "They*re           charging".              I looked              towards        th e     Spion

At a b o u t     1350 hours               I      was      joined          in    the      control           r o om by C h i e f

At    about      1415       hours,            looking          around          the     stadium,          I noticed            that     the

the      north       stand was               probably           not       a quarter               full         and     the     same         with     the

people         to m o v e         back.         I may also             have       requested              cutting        equipment              for

the     fences.              With       other        officers,             I attempted              to    c le a r     other        people

from        the    fi el d,        who    appeared              to    be    j u st     standing           around and            getting             in

t he    way       of    injured          people.             Some      of     these         people        were        .in an

agitated           state.

At     1 !i 10 h o u r s         there     was       s t il l    no a p p a r e n t         movement, at              the    back        of    the

that        many       police        officers           were         engaged          in    the     rescue        operation

along        the       fence.

At about           1 !:>14 hou r s,            I made        my way         to    the       rear       of L e p p i n g s      Lane

terraces           and       into       the     central          tunnel.              The    tunnel        was        almost,       clear,

with        about       50       persons        in     it.       I saw an             Inspector           and with           him and

other        officers             moved        people        out      of    the       tunnel       and      on    to    the     concourse

encroaching              up to          th e    half       way       line,       some       in a n g r y       and     threatening

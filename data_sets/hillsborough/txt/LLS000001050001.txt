I                                 of

D♦0 ♦ B •             till say as follows



1)      I went to the Football match at          Hillsborough on 15th     April

1989.       I got there by mini    bus with members of my family and
  1
friends.      There were eleven of us on it.        There was no drink on

board.       I didn't have a ticket although everyone else on the bus

did.




2)     We parked up at 1-00 p.m.         I bought a ticket for the Leppings

end "B” entrance just as I got off the-bus.            I paid £6-00 for it

which was the proper price.            We went to a club for a pint.     The

club was about 15 minutes walk from the ground.               We left at 2-50

p.m. and got to the ground at 3— 05 p.m.          I had drunk two pints of

lag?iT- only.    When we got to the Leppings Lane end it was quiet

and there were a few people milling around.            I got straight to

the     turnstiles.     I noticed that one       gate was open at the     side and

two     Policemen were holding a narrow          gate open.     We were asked if

we had tickets.       We said yes and I d i d n ’t have to show mine as I

was let in.      We went to the central tunnel under the stand.            It

was so crowded you coul d n’t even see the pitch.             We walked to the

right hand side of the ground but I couldn't see anything from

there so as we turned back to walk to "B" entrance behind the

stand suddenly about one hundred Police Officers ran towards us

and went into the entrance we had just come from.               They must have

ran past the mouth of the tunnel under the stand in the centre.

We went to the toilet and then went up the stairs to the stand at
the left hand end.     There were no stewards there and we just went

in.     The pitch was empty except for about 20 or 30 people, not

players.     I could see chaos at the front of the terrace below.

People were in distress and being crushed.      The Policemen didn't

seem to be very helpful.     I saw them pushing people back in the

penned fenced in area where I could see that people were being

crushed because there were so many people within the pen.



3)    Before I arrived at the match I saw many groups of Police

Officers on the outskirts of Sheffield laughing and joking and

stopping vehicles and searching them.     They d i d n ’t seem to know

why they Were doing this and certainly there were too many of

them doing this in my opinion.     I became very annoyed having now

seen what they were doing down below the stand.



4)    I stayed up in the stand for about an hour to an hour and a

half.    I saw the rescue attempts by the Police which did begin to

help.    What I did notice was that many Policemen went up the

pitch to separate the fans.    It was infact the Liverpool fans who

saved many lived and pulled people out and gave people the kiss

of life.    Certainly the fans did more that the Policemen did.          I

didn't see any Policemen being attacked although I did see some

cameral men who were attacked.    They were filming people dying

which was disgusting.



5)    I would like this statement to be submitted to the Government

Public Inquiry.    The above is as much as I know with regards to

exactly what was going on at the time the Disaster struck.
 *%)   I do not work and I am unemployed.                  I receive invalid care

 allowance for my mother at the rate of £34-00 per week.



 7)    Myself I was very upset by the whole episode seeing all those

 people dying.    Emotionally it is very hard to explain.                      I have

 been to the football match since but I just broke down crying.                           i

 am still crying now and then.         i feel guilty about it all.                 i am

 not doing anything and I am very angry.



 8)    I was disgusted at the way in which the Police dealt with all
of this, it was terrible.



9)     I suffered no injuries apart from ray upset.




Signed.

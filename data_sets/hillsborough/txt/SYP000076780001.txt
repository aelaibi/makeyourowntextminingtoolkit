                I obtained tickets for the Hillsborough Semi Final                        from the Forest

                ground,      paying £14.00 for the tickets and they were for the jjytiuth

               Stand.

               April     1989 <130489),           I left the Nottingham area for the match at about

                1215 hours,        travelled up in my car with my son                          (14 years)            and

                We    arrived       in S h e f f i e l d         at    about       1315 h o u r s ,        experiencing                  no    delays

                and    not    stopping           on      the     way.        I parked          the       car    about          a twenty minute

                walk    from       the    ground.               In fact,          I found       a    car       park a b o v e        a    "Tesco*

                Store       and    left       the     car       ther e .




                On walking          to    the       ground,           I noticed most                of    the       Public       Houses         on    the

                way    had Forest             f ans      inside        and       outside       drinking             in them.             I never

                noticed       any       Police        direction             to    the     ground and            n e ver        witnessed            any

                disorder,          fighting           and       drunkenness             on   the     way.




                I arrived          at    about        1 33 0     hours       to    the       entrance          to    the       South Stand            and

                there       were    only       about         three         people       in f r o n t      of    us w a i t i n g         to    get

                through       the       turnstile.               There       was       no P o l i c e     directions             outside            the

                turnstiles,             but    at     th e      main       gate    at     the S p i o n        Kop       end    of    the S o u t h

                sta n d ,    I was       informed            tay a S t e w a r d        which       way    to       go    to    enter         the    South

                Stand.



                Before       r e a c h i n g the g r o u n d          I     was    a p p r o/ c h e d o n c.e by a              per s o n o f f e r i n q
^   OnJiX                                  "     "                                 -
            .   to    sell    us    t i c k e t s , but         also        on    several       occasions                were    approached               by

                people       enquiring           if      I had        got a n y        spare    tickets




                On    entering          the    ground           through          the    turnstile          w h i c h was         the      only       way       I

                could       see    of    using        to     enter         the    ground,       I h a n d e d my           ticket         to    the

                turnstile          operator,             who     in    turn       ripped       the       counterfoil             off a n d

                returned          the    r est      of     the    ticket.



                I did       see    signs       directing              me    to m y      seating          position,             which      I found

                without       any       difficulty.                I never         witnessed             any    disorder             from      the    time

                I entered          the    ground           to    the       time    I took       my       seat,       which       would         have       been
                                                                                                                                       PAGE         3
                                                                                                                                       S2104

at    about       1400 h o u r s .



My    seat       was    in the          l o wer     tier       directly           in      line     with         the    penalty          spot,

towards          the    Leppings             Ln    end.        I was        seated          with      my    so n a n d        friend




On    taking       my    seat          and    surveying             the     ground          I did      remark          that       it    did

seem      very     packed          behind          the    goal        at    the      Leppings          Ln       end,       but    there

seemed         plenty        of    space          available           either         side     of      the       goal.         I did

notice         before        the       kick       off    supporters              were       climbing            out    of     pen t h r e e

over      the     segregation                fence       into       pen     two      and also          people          climbing          from

pen    two       into    pen       three.           I believed              t hi s     was    happening               at    th is      time,

supporters             just       getting          over       this       fence       both ways             to    be    nearer          friends.




From      th e    time       of    seating,             up to       the     kick       off,      I could           not      believe       my

eye s ,    when        more       and    more       people          were       getting        into         the     pens       behind      the

goals      (mi d d 1 e s e c t i o n ).




Just      before        the       kick       off    I witnessed                a surge        i n t h e s a rne p e n s a n d

could      see     the       reason          being       t hat      people        seemed         to    be       pu s h i ng      fr o m t he

area      of     the    central          tunnel          at    that        end.




I had also             noticed          from       the    t ime       I took         my     seat      t hat      supporters             were

climbing          up    out       of    the       terraces          into       the     West      Stand,          believing

initially          they were             doing          this     to      get     a better          viewing            position.




After      the     game       had       started,          due       to     the    crowd       in t h e s e         pens,         I c o u l d n ’t

concentrate             on    the       match       and       had     one      eye     on    the      game       and       one    eye    on

the    match.
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      S 2 104

I then         witnessed             a    second          surge        in t h e s e    pens        much       greater       than       the

first         which       came       from         the     same       direction         again.




It w a s       after       t his         t h at     1 saw       people        climbing           over     the       perimeter          fence

on t o    the       pitch       to       get      out     of     these        pens.



Then      I noticed             two       policemen              carrying          a youth         t h r o u g h the      crowd        t hat

had      already          got    onto          the       pitch.         They       placed        him     on    the       pitch      nearly

directly            in f r o n t         of    us    and       the     two P o l i c e       Officers          began applying

first         aid    to    the       lad a n d           mouth       to m o u t h     was     used.           Then       I saw      two

people         l e a ve    the S o u t h            Stand,          push   the      Police         Officers          away      from       the

youth,         then       they       tried          to    revive        the    lad,        but     it    became          obvious       the i r

attempts            failed.



I have         since       heard          t h at     one       of    the    people         leaving        the       stand      to

administer               first       aid       to    this        youth was            a medic.




W hen     I re a 1 i se d w hat                s e e m ed      t o b e ha pp e ni n g a nd w i t n e s s in g this                     death,

I wanted            to    l ea v e       because          it w a s      become        distressful              to me       and      concern

for      my    son,       so we          decided          to    leave.




We    approached             a Policeman                  standing          near      to     the    g ate      where      we     had

entered         the       stan d,         this       being          at a b o u t    1 5 30    hours,          explained          to    him

that      we    had wi t n e s s e d              a death           inside     on     the     pitch,          which      was     quite

o b v i o us    tie had         no       id ea w a s        g o i ng    o n ins :i.de .




He    let      us    out     through              this      gate,       t h e n we     made        our    way       to   the     gates       at

the      South       Stand/Spion                  Hop     corner        where       again        there        was    policemen
                                                                                                                         PAGE           5
                                                                                                                         S2104

Outside        the       g a te    I was       surprised          to    see    in e x c e s s       of at    least     one

hundred        Liverpool             supporters          outsi.de,        pressuring            the      Policemen       inside

to    let     them       into      the    ground.           Due    to    the    way     these        supporters        were

behaving           outside         the    gate,       he was       very       hesitant         about      opening      this

gate     to    let       us    out,      due    to    the    possibility             t ha t    these      supporters         would

rush     through.



My    i m p r e s s i o n was        that      this    Police          Officer       had      not    been    informed        what

was    happening              in side.




He    did     open       the      gate    to    let    us    out a n d w i t h        a struggle            was   able      to

stop     the       Liverpool          supporters            gaining       entry.




Some     supporters               were    also       trying       to    climb       o ver     the    fencing      next      to    the

gate     to    gain       entry,         but    were     prevented            doing     so     by a n o t h e r   Police

Officer        inside          the    gat es.




We    then made           our      way    to    the    car a n d        drove       home.




Whilst        at    the       ground,        I never        witnessed          any    criminal           offence




Whilst        I was       witnessing            people       being       attended           to w i t h    injuries       that

had    brought           out      of / h e     terraces        behind         the    goal,      I did       observe      t h at

the    1 evel       of    competence            in b a s i c      first       aid    skills         appeared      to   be

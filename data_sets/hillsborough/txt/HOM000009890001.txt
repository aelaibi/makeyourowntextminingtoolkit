                                    REPORT



              LIVERPOOL V NOTTS FOREST : F.A. CUP SEMI-FINAL
           SATURDAY, 15TH APRIL, 1989 AT HILLSBORUGH, SHEFFIELD




1.   PLANNING

     1.1    In 1987 a meeting took place between the then Divisional
            Commander, Chief Superintendent LEY, Superintendent
            NICHOLAS and senior officer's of the South Yorkshire

#           Police regarding the reception and disposal of football
            supporters arriving and departing from Sheffield Midland and
            W a d s l e y Bridge Station, particularly with regard to the regular
            football semi finals being hel d in Sheffield. . The existing
            arrangements were discussed, refined and agreed without
            major changes.

     1.2    The procedure at Wadsley Bridge Station is that supporters
            arriving by special train are passed from the British
            Transport Police to the South Yorkshire Police and walked along
            Penistone Road to Hillsbrough, a distance of about half a
            mile.

     1.3    Supporters arriving at Sheffield Midland Station are placed on
            Sout h Yorkshire Transport buses and taken to Hillsbrough by
            road.

     1.4    The procedure for returning fans is as at paras.      1.2 and 1.3 but
            in reverse.

     1.5   On the build up to 15th April, 1989, the District Inspector at
           Sheffield, Inspector MABBOTT, liaised w i t h his counterparts at
           Liverpool and Nottingham, British Rail and officers of the South
           Yorkshir e Police in addition to discussions with his own local
           senior officers.

     1.6   A short order was issued and circulated      (copy attached)
           (Appendix A ) .

     1.7   In the planning stages the only p r o blem which was envisaged
           was that of conveying a large number of supporters by rail.

2.   ARRIV AL OF SUPPORTERS BY TRAIN

     2.1   During the morning prior to the match 3319 identifiable football
           supporters arrived at Sheffield.

                                       cont..............

    2.2    As far as can be established 1932 were Nottingham Supporters
           and 1337 were Liverpool Supporters.    There were also a number
           of fans w h o had no affiliation but only came to watch the
           match.

    2.3    Four special trains from Nottingham conveyed 1241 supporters
           into Sheffield Midland Station.

    2.4    One special train from Liverpool conveyed 430 supporters to
           W a d s l e y Bridge Station.

♦   2.5    Three additional service trains from Liverpool conveyed 395
           supporters to Sheffield Midland Station.

    2.6    All other supporters arrived at Sheffield Midland Station by
           service train.

    2.7    On arrival at Sheffield Midland Station, all supporters were
           separated and the Nottingham Supporters left the station via
           the North Gate where they boarded buses which conveyed them
           directly to the ground.

    2.8    Liverpool Supporters left the Station via the South Luggage
           Entrance where they also boarded buses and were conveyed to the
           ground.

    2.9    The 430 Liverpool Supporters arriving at Wadsley Bridge by
           Special train were walked from the Station to the ground.  This
           journey takes about 15 minutes.

    2.10   The Special Train arrived at 13.55hours, about 5 minutes early
           and after the fans had detrained they were handed to an escort
           of South Yorkshire Police w ho immediately escorted them to the
           Hillsbrough football ground.

    2.11   For all train arrival times see Appendix B

    2.12   No problems were encountered with the fans travelling on
           the inward journeys and on the whole they were happy, good
           natured and looking forward to an exciting days football.
           Very few arriving supporters showed signs of intoxication.

2.13   A Yorkshire Television programme about the 'disaster*
       suggested that one of the factors contributing to the
       excessive build up of fans outside the ground was the fact
       that fans arriving by Special trains at Wadsley Bridge
       Station had been he l d there for an excessive length of
       time before being walked to Hillsbrough.        This is a
       complete fabrication.        Estimates from B.T.P. Officers at
       W a d s l e y Bridge indicates that from detraining to moving
       the fans off under escort by South Yorkshire Police took a
       maximum of 10 minutes, see reports from j
       (Appendix E) and enclosed statements from Officers at
       W a d s l e y Bridge.

INVOLVEMENT AT MATCH

3.1    Following arrival of the train at Wadsl ey Bridge and
       consequent of messing facilities having been arranged for
       the B.T.P. Police Officers in the Gymnasium at the Football
       Ground the following Officers made their way there in full
       uniform.

                     L ......................... Liverpool   M.S.U.
       I            1 ......................... Liverpool    M.S.U.

                      |......................... Liverpool   M.S.U.
                     L ......................... Leeds

       arriving at 14.25 hours.

3.2    After they had dined                □ and              left
       the ground to return to Wadsley Bridge.      The other
       Officers were standing in the tunnel entrance to the
       Gymnasium when the emergency occurred.     They were asked by
       a South Yorkshire Superintendent to assist with crowd
       control. At the time 1_ _ _ _ _ _ . If and 1           heard of
       the problems at Hillsbrough and they returned to the
       ground to assist.  At the request of Senior Officers of
       the South Yorkshire Police British Transport Police were
       involved in crowd control, public order situations, the
       administration of first aid and the removal of bodies to
       the temporary mortua ry in the gymnasium.

3.3    |   w  a  s    asked to assist in the removal of a body to
       the mortuary and on arrival there he was directed to
       remain with it until   it was identified.   This
       occurred at 04.30 hou rs Sunday, 16th whe n       Istood
       down, travelled back to Leeds. He signed off duty at
       0630hrs after working for 20 hours.

BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE REACTION TO EMERGENCY

4.1    As soon as it became apparent that an emergency had
       occurred and the game was about to be abandoned, Acting
       Chief Inspector CRAGGS who was in overall command of the
       B.T. Police operation immediately took charge and
       co-ordinated the urgently needed reorganisation of the
       return arrangements for the travelling supporters.

4.2    Arrangements were made for the Special train to return to
       W a d sley Bridge Station, which it did, arriving at 16.00
       hours.     This train departed at 17.15 hours, 10 minutes
       later than scheduled, wit h 450 passengers.

4.3    The Nottingham Specials were brought to S h e f f i e l d Midland
       Station and the first one placed at Platform 1 prior to
       fans arriving.  This train and the following trains
       departed as follows when laden

       1)   17.25   h o u r s ................... ..500   passengers.
       2)   18.05   h o u r s ..................... 600   passengers.
       3)   18.34   h o u r s ..................... 550   passengers.
       4)   19.04   h o u r s ..................... 150   passengers.

4.4.   All Service trains to Nottingham and Liverpool were
        monitored and policed where necessary up to 20.30 hours.

4.5    In all, a total of 18 trains conveyed an estimated 3,600
        Football Supporters to their various destinations.

4.6    In all 10 trains were policed by 41 Officers.

4.7    For all train departures see appendix C

CONCLUSIONS

5.1    The conveying of Supporters to and from Sheffield by
       British Rail was carried out swiftly and without problem.

5.2    There was no bui ld up caused by fans arriving at the
       Ground after travelling to Sheffield by train.

5.3    British Rail reacted with speed and efficiency when faced
       with the emergency.

5.4    The attitude of Supporters returning from Hillsbrough was
       that of shock and, in many cases, disbelief.  A number of
       them were blaming the Police for the disaster and because
       of this showered abuse on any Officer they saw.

5.5.   Only one B.T. Police Officer highlights any aspects of the
       operation that could be construed as a 'criticism' and
       these are contained in the last paragraph at page 2 of
                         report. (Appendix E ) .

Details are

       5.5.1 Communications - h e adversely comments on radio
       communication between Wadsley Bridge and Sheffield Midland
       Station.

       Comment - This is not disputed and the problem which has
       b e e n reported on previously is highly prevelant in the
       No rth East of England.    However, communications were not
       such that they in any w ay hampered the transmission of
       messages through to Wadsl ey Bridge as is evident by the
       fact that it was po ssible to redeploy additional Officers
       from Sheffield Midland Station to Wadsley Bridge to assist
       in the returning operation as a direct radio request from
       a Sergeant at that location.

       5.5.2               ~1 comments that whilst his Officers
       were to all intents and purposes 'missing' for some 2 hours
       at the ground no Senior Officers of this Force visited the
       scene to find them.

       Comment - It was known and p re planned that Officers
       arriving at Wadsley Bridge Station would be authorised to
       attend at Hillsbrough to take refreshments under South
       York s h i r e Police arrangements and they were not under
       instructions to return to Wadsle y Bridge other than to be
       in good time for the returning special train.       Hence it
       would be quite normal for them to remain at Hillsbrough
       for up to 2 hours. Additionally once the scale of the
       disaster began to unfold Senior Officers quite rightly
       concluded that our Officers would use their initiative and
       give all possible assistance to the South Yorkshire Police
       at the ground hence there was no reason at that point in
       time to be unduly concerned over their whereabouts.

       5.5.3.  I              finally makes adverse comment as to
       the fact that when he eventually returned to W a d sley Bridge
       to all intents and purposes            was still
       'missing'


                                          cont
      British Transport Police


                             -   6-



      Comment - The previous comments made in 5.5.2 in this
      apply up until the time that the special train d e p arted
      from Wadsley Bridge Station.     What              T would
      not know was that after that departure Acting Chief
      Inspector CRAGGS made arrangements for checks to be made
      wit h the local hospitals and the South Y orkshire
      Police Control in order to ascertain if               had
      come under notice as be i n g an injured Officer in any way.
      These enquiries proved negative and it was rightly
      concluded that he was still assisting at Hillsbrough. This
      assumption proved correct as illustrated in paragraph 3.6.
      No senior Officer of this Force was able to attend at
      the ground because of

        a) They were totally engaged in commanding and
        co-ordinating the urgently needed return arrangements,
        and
        b) It was not physically possible due to traffic and
        pedestrian conjestion to make any practical effort to
        attend at the ground.      Indeed to have done so would have
        b e e n unwise? taking into account the needs at Sheffield
        Midland Station at that time.


5.6   The British Transport Police Officers should be praised
      for their cheerful forebearance in the face of extreme
      difficulty when dealing with this type of situation.

     to the Railway Station, this group would number

     approximately 200 to 250.       They were very

     boisterous and were shouting loudly, they

     were all positioned on or near to the grassy

     slopes which skirts the parade of shops, and

     nearly all of them had cans of beer in

*♦   their possession, which they were climbing.

     We parked the vehicle by Wadsley Bridge

     Station where we met up with             _

     |        from B.T.P. Sheffield.    We then all

     waited for the arrival of the Special train

     from Liverpool, which was due at

     Wadsley Bridge at 14.02 hours.           As the

     time drew near to the Special's arrival

     I took up a position trackside just

     over the bridge on the Sheffield Midland

     side of the platform and I had a

     view of the supporters who were sitting

     on the grassy slopes drinking.           They had grown

     a lot louder than when I had first

     seen them and singing and shouting could

     be heard quite clearly above the noise of

     vehicles which were passing on the Barnsley

     road which runs underneath the Railway

     bridge towards Hillsborough football ground.

     The Special train then arrived

     at approximately 13.55 hours this day and the

     last coach managed to pull onto the platform

     without overhanging the bridge, which meant

     the supporters could disembark without having

     to walk through the last carriages in

     order to get off the train onto the platform.

     I then went up onto the platform

     and monitored the supporters disembarking

<•   from the train which they did in an

     orderly fashion.     I then, together with

     other B.T.P. Officers, followed the supporters

     down the steps and onto the

     footpath outside the Bridge Inn Public

     House.    The supporters number 430 in all

     and they were headed by the South Yorkshire

     Police until all the supporters were

     together as a group and then escorted down

     to the ground by the South Yorkshire Police

     after about five/ten minutes.        I then,

     together with                  and three Constables

     from B.T.P.   Liverpool, walked down the Barnsley

     Road to the Hillsborough football ground

     in order to get a pre-arranged meal.

     As we walked down on the opposite

     side of the road you could see

     supporters drinking from beer cans and

     generally waving their arms and shouting

     loudly.   We arrived at the ground

     and were directed to the Gymnasium

     where the meals were being served.

After being suitably refreshed.    I, together with

two other Liverpool Officers,    vent to

the corner flag by the Spion Kop and stood

by the Gymnasium entrance to the playing

surface.     At this time the match was

in progress and after a few minutes ve

were approached by a Senior South Yorkshire

Police Officer and requested to stand in

front of the Spion Kop

on the track surrounding the pitch as he

was taking a contingent of men towards the

Lepping Lane end of the ground.     I then

looked towards the Lepping Lane end

of the ground and I could clearly see

people climbing over the fencing and

jumping down onto the perimeter track

behind the Liverpool goalmouth.     At

this stage it appeared to be a

pitch invasion.     I then turned back towards

the Spion Kop in order to monitor the

Nottingham Forest fans who were massed

there.     The players then went off the pitch

and the Forest supporters were becoming

incensed towards the Liverpool supporters.

I then looked back towards the Leppings

Lane end and saw that people were

being laid on the ground and assistance

was being given by Police Officers,      St.

Johns Ambulance and supporters alike.          It

was at this stage that people were

beginning to use the advertising hoardings

as stretchers and ferrying the people via

the Gymnasium entrance to the pitch towards

the First Aid Post.      The pitch was by

now being covered by injured supporters and

I then saw that towards the middle

of the pitch supporters were running towards

the Spion Kop end of the ground and

that some of the South Yorkshire Police

were trying to pull them back.         I

ran onto the pitch towards the supporters

and managed to turn them back towards

the Lepping Lane end of the ground,        I

then returned to my original place

in front of the Skion Kop and shortly

after a South Yorkshire Police Officer requested

my assistance to help with the

removal of a body.      I went with

him and had to push a photographer

out of my way in order to reach

the body.    I then took hold of the

body together with 2 South Yorkshire

Officers and a Liverpool

supporter.    We then carried the body

to the Gymnasium and placed it in

the temporary mortuary.         As we did so

I was approached by a South Yorkshire

Senior Officer and requested to stay with

the body which I did.      We had arrived

at the Gymnasium at 15.35 hours and I

checked again for signs of life, but

there was none.     I then proceeded to take

a description of the body and check the personal

property.     At 16.06 hours this day life was

pronounced extinct by Dr. REDGRAVE.            The

only possible form of identification found on

the body was an Amberline Coach ticket

from Walton to Hillsborough in the name

of McGRATH.     I then logged all the details

down and awaited the arrival of the next

of kin.

At 04.30 hours on Sunday,        16th April,    1989,

the body was formally identified as Hr.

Keith McGRATH,    age 17 years of

                                    Keith McGRATH

was formally Identified by

his uncle.

At 04.45 hours I went, together

with the body of Keith McGRATH,        to

the Medic Legal Centre,        Sheffield, wherefore at

15.05 hours I handed over the body of Keith

McGRATH to     ________ of the South

Yorkshire Police.     I then returned to Leeds

by Police vehicle and signed off duty at 06.30 hour

 expected.

 In the event of a draw at the end of full time,   thirty

                    REPORT BY

     SUBJECT        LIVERPOOL -V- NOTTINGHAM FOREST : FA CUP SEMI-FINAL
                    SATURDAY, 15TH APRIL, 1989 AT HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD.



    Sub-            Sir,
    Divisional
    Commander       With regard to the above, I signed on duty at 1000
    Eastern &       hours on Saturday 15 April 1989 I travelled together
    Anglia          with                    1 in Police Vehicle Charlie 62.
    Division
                    Upon our approach to Wadsley Bridge Station as we
#                   turned onto the Barnsley Road which leads to
                    Hillsborough Football Ground, I could see about 200 to
                    250 football supporters gathered outside and around an
                    Off-Licence which was on a parade of shops a short
                    distance from Wadsley Bridge Station.    They were very
                    boisterous and shouting loudly.    Nearly all of them
                    were drinking from cans of beer that they had in their
                    possession.    At approximately 1150 hours the vehicle
                    was parked by Wadsley Bridge Station and I met
                    _________ from British Transport Police, Sheffield.   We
                    then awaited the arrival of the Football Special from
                    Liverpool.    As it got closer to the expected arrival
                    time of the train I went onto the railway track and
                    from the position I took up I could clearly see the
                    supporters on the grassy slopes leading to the
                    shopping parade, they had grown a lot louder than when
                    I had first seen them, they were singing and shouting
                    and you could clearly hear them above the noise of the
                    vehicles passing underneath the Railway.

                    The special train then arrived at Wadsley at
                    approximately 1355 hours and the supporters
                    disembarked and made their way towards the Bridge Inn
                    Public House where the South Yorkshire Police Escort
                    was waiting.  The supporters numbered 430 in all and
                    they were held there until the last of the supporters
                    from the train had joined them, the escort then made
                    its way towards the ground.  I then, together with
                    four officers from Liverpool BTP, walked down to the
                    ground in order to get a pre-arranged meal.

     As I walked down to the ground I could see large
     groups of supporters drinking beer and generally
     waving their arms about and shouting.  Upon arrival at
     the ground I was directed to the gymnasium where I was
     provided with a meal.  After having been suitably
     refreshed I, together with two of the Liverpool
     Officers, made my way towards the Spion Kop, I stood by
     the Corner Flag near to the entrance/exit which leads
     to the gymnasium, the match was in progress at this
     time and after a few minutes a Senior Officer of the
     South Yorkshire Police requested us to take up the
     positions of his contingent In front of the Nottingham
     Forest Supporters as he wished to take his contingent
     to the Lepplng Lane end of the ground.

     Upon looking towards the Lepping Lane end I could see
     people climbing over the fencing and jumping down
     onto the perimeter track behind the Liverpool
     goalmouth.   At this time It appeared to be a pitch
      invasion.  I then turned back towards the Forest
     supporters.   The players then went off the pitch and
     the Forest supporters were becoming Incensed towards
     the Liverpool supporters.    I then turned to look at the
     Lepping Lane end and I saw that people were being
     laid on the ground and assistance was being given by
     Police Officers, St John's Ambulance Personnel and
     supporters alike.   People were now beginning to tear
     advertising hoardings down and started using them as
     stretchers to ferry the injured and dead.    As the
     First Aid Post was positioned in the gymnasium the
     supporters had to run past the Spion Kop.    As the
     injured and dead passed the Spion Kop, a small section
     of the Notts Forest supporters were spitting at the
     helpers and bodies as they passed, then one Forest fan
     in particular kept shouting, "ANOTHER FAT BASTARD
     SCOUSE IS DEA D”, and laughing.   This Incensed the
     Liverpool supporters who were carrying the dead and
     Injured to the gymnasium and every time the helpers
     came back the were treated to a torrent of abuse and
     spat upon by the Forest fans so much so that a few of
     the Liverpool supporters had to be dragged away from
     the Spion Kop fencing.

     As the situation worsened and more and more people
     were lying down on the pitch, I saw that towards the
     middle of the pitch supporters were running towards
     the Spion Kop end of the ground and the South
     Yorkshire Police were trying to hold them back.  I ran

                       -3-



     across to assist and we managed to turn the supporters
     back towards the Lepping Lane end.  I returned to my
     original position in from of the Spion Kop and a short
     while later I was approached by a South Yorkshire
     Police Officer and upon request assisted with the
     removal of a youth's dead body.

     Whilst attempting to get to the youth's body I had to
     push a photographer out of the way.  Upon arrival at
     the gymnasium the youth's body was placed in the
     temporary mortuary and I was approached by a South
     Yorkshire Superintendent and asked to stay with the
     youth's body, which I did.

     At 1606 hours this day life was pronounced extinct by
     Dr REDGRAVE.  All officers who were In the temporary
     mortuary were then Instructed to remain with their
     bodies until they had been identified by the next of
     kin.

     At 0430 hours on Sunday 16 April 1989, the youth's body
     was identified as a Keith McGRATH, age 17 years, of


     Details were then taken of the youth and at 0445 hours
     I went with the body of Keith McGRATH to the Medico
     Legal Centre, Sheffield where the body of Keith
     McGRATH was handed over to           af the South
     Yorkshire Police. I then returned to Leeds by Police

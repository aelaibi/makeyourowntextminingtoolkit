              - AMBULANCEWOMAN - LONGLEY STATION


Date:   19.4.89

Time:   1315-1500

Call Sign:   Sierra 407


On Saturday 15th April 1989 I was on day duty 0900-1730 along with my
colleague A m b u l a n c e m a n . Throughout our shift up to just before
1500 we were busy on normal domestic duties and were returned to base for a
break.

At approximately 1510 when we were close to Longley Station, Control
radioed us to proceed to an incident at Hillsborough Football ground
Leppings Lane end. We arrived at this location in approximately 3 minutes
and I saw several police officers on horses and several officers on foot at
the entrance to the ground, there were very few fans outside the ground at
this time and we were the first ambulance to arrive at Leppings Lane.

We asked some police officers were we needed and they seemed surprised and
were not aware that ambulances were required at Leppings Lane, at this
stage we were directed onto the driveway to a barricade of approximately
four or five moveable metal barriers which were moved by police officers to
allow us to get in.

We stopped adjacent to gate *C*, I left the ambulance through the rear
doors and the gate ’C' was partially open, in a split second the gates were
opened fully and I saw a group of people carrying on an injured person
towards me and the ambulance. They carried the injured man straight onto
my ambulance. We placed him on the stretcher and he was making a lot of
noise and breathing quite freely, a girl also got on the ambulance with an
arm injury. I turned to go and close the doors and saw three bodies lying
on the driveway at the rear of the ambulance, they were not breathing so I
told                  Ito take our two casualties off the vehicle because
the other three required more urgent attention.

At that point I saw two other ambulances behind us. I told .           from
one of the other ambulances to take one of the three bodies. As we did so
I saw that the rear doors to              ambulance were already opened. I
found that a body had already been placed on one of the stretchers, a
policeman then jumped in the ambulance and started to work on the patient.
I cleared the man's airway and used an automatic resuscitator on the
patient. I then left the ambulance with the patient being treated by the
policeman and by now a fireman was assisting.

I went back to my ambulance where there were now two stretcher cases on
board being treated by two policeman and Ambulanceman           |» One of
them was breathing with difficulty. I immediately placed him on his side
and administered oxygen and left him in the care of one of the policeman.
I turned to the other casualty who was not breathing, I started to clear
his airway and resuscitate him and A/M            jumped in the driving seat
and we set off for the Northern General Hospital.

We arrived at the Hospital and we were assisted by casualty staff to unload
our patients and we handed them over inside the casualty department. We
loaded our stretchers into the ambulance and contacted control by radio.
They instructed us to transport the Northern General Medical Team to the
football ground and take them to the Penistone Road entrance. We arrived
back at the ground with the team and they quickly disappeared to what I now
know was the gymnasium. We then drove our ambulance onto the football
pitch where we saw a doctor working on a casualty. We loaded the patient
onto the ambulance and I noticed that he had been intubated. I connected
the bag and mask to our oxygen supply and the doctor continued to ventilate
the casualty. By now there was another doctor doing cardiac massage. We
drove off the pitch and on towards the Northern General Hospital.

We arrived at the hospital and the casualty was taken off us by hospital
staff. We loaded our stretcher back onto the ambulance and proceeded back
to the football ground. On arrival back at the ground on Penistone Road we
were now in a line of ambulances, the stretchers were taken off most of the
ambulances and taken to the gym. I left my ambulance to assist at the
treatment area and was assisting with the treatment to a young man who had
pelvis and internal injuries. We loaded this patient onto an ambulance,
the attendant w a s missing so I took over as attendant and crewed up with
A/M              who drove the ambulance to Hallamshire Hospital.

Throughout the journey I was assisted by a policeman. We arrived at the
Hallamshire and handed the patient over to a doctor. We then contacted
Control by radio and were told to go and standby with other vehicles on
Netherthorpe Road.

After some time we were returned to the Hallamshire to start transferring
patients to the King Edward Hospital. After transferring four patients
Control then gave us a transfer from ITU Northern General Hospital to CT
Scan at the Hallamshire, on completion we radioed green and were returned
to base signing off duty at 2030.

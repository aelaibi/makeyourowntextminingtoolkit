 . - A. That is correct, yes.

   final and for the 1988 one? - A.Yes, that is correct, sir.

                                                                                                        S. SEWELL

                             first item of course              that w e are concerned with.                 - A.
                             Yes, sir.

                       Q.And there is a reference to the building s u r v e y o r s me m o ­
                          randum of the 2nd of February, 1988. — A. Yes, sir.

                   B   Q. We see that on             the previous page, page 434.           Did you
                          have a copy of             tnat m e m o r a n d u m before the meeting
                          started? -A. I             went wit h Superintendent Stewart.          He
                          would have had             a copy.      I do not think I did, sir.

                       Q. W o u l d y o u h a v e seen it t h o u g h at the meeting                  itself?
                          - A. Yes, I w as a w a r e of it, yes, sir.

                       Q. And you will see that the me m orandum is concerned with
                          stewarding on the Kop? —A. That is correct, sir.

                       Q. And complaints about the crowd occupying radial gangways?
                          - A. Yes, sir.

                       Q. And there was a complaint that stewarding must be of a
                          quality and of such n umbers to maintain gangways free
                   D      from congestion? —A. That is correct, sir.

                              Did you regard this m e m o r a n d u m as being solely relevant
                       Q
                            : to the Kop? -A. - Yes,- sir.      .       I ^   ‘ \ uV     1a ' '-.U-

                             Not at all r e l e v a n t to L e p p i n g s L a n e terraces? - A. That
                       Q
                             is correct, yes, sir.

                       Q/And     a g a i n there wa s a r e f e r e n c e to the turnstile c a p a c i t y
                             on the P e n i s t o n e R o a d end? - A. Yes, sir.


                        Q .There is the comment man y of the spectators were still
                              entering the ground up to 15 minutes after k i c k - o f f ? /
                              - A. Yes, sir.           I t h i n k c e r t a i n l y wit h home s upporters
                              at L e a g u e g a m e s it is f a i r l y w e l l - k n o w n the h o m e ^ s u p p o r t e r s
                              do com e in the last few mi n utes.

                        Q     So that w a s a r e f e r e n c e the n s p e c i f i c a l l y to the P e n i s t o n e
                              R o a d end a n d to the K o p a g a i n ? - A. That is correct, yes,
                              sir.

                        Q.    It then goes on to say the c o m bi n a t i o n of late arrival
                              and i n e f f e c t i v e s t e w a r d i n g could lead to dangerous
                              o c c u r r e n c e s ? - A. Yes, sir.

                        Q.    D i d y ou k n o w w h a t that r e f e r r e d to? What sort of o c c u r re n c e s ?

on the gangways k e e p i ng them clear.

Well now, w h e n we look at the minute of the meeting itself
on 434A there is the c o m m e n t the pattern has developed of
people arriving 15 m i n u t e s before the start of the game?
- A. Yes, sir.

Were you then referring solely again to the Xop? - A. Yes,
we were, sir, because on normal League games the away
supporters do not u s u a l l y arrive late.

And you say the trend m a y be due to the banning of alcohol
at sports grounds? - A. I think that could be correct,
sir, yes.

That is your view, is it, that the banning of alcohol has
 led to people staying in the public houses longer than
 they might otherwise have done before going to the ground?
 -A." That was something put forward by Mr. Stewart but I
 would totally agree that it does create a problem, sir.

 By early 1988 then had this trend become fairly pronounced
 as far as you were co nc e rn e d? -A. It is with home supporters,
 sir, but there again there is really no problem of them
 getting into the ground if they come a little bit late.
 They      know'-where-^they are going .•to.\£,It .„is ,m£.i.n±y on'.
                                                                    4:» ’***,■
 the Kop".‘' I do"think that this was referring to sn- evening ~ -
 match as well, if I recollect, and probably problems with
 traffic, people having to travel home from work, and it is
 a little bit of a rush for them to get to an evening match.
 I do think that that did refer to an evening match.

 It seems to be talking about a trend, something that was
 happening regularly f r o m time to time? -A. Yes. It is not
 a problem wit h the home supporters though, sir.

 Do you not think the sane thing could apply to either away
 supporters or to both sets of supporters in a semi-final?
 - A. It is a possibility, sir.         However, the away supporters
 normally come, the m a j o r i t y come, on coaches and trains
 which are due to arrive fairly early at the ground, sir.
                                        t
 Had you any experience of people coming late to the ground
 at the Leppings Lane end before the 1989 semi-final? - A.
 No, sir, there were no problems at the 1988 semi-final.

 No. I appreciate that.        But at any stage during the 1988
 or the 1989 season? - A. There had been no intelligence
 whatsoever to suggest that anybody was going to come
 late to the seni-rinal in 1989.        There was no information
 from the Football L i a i s o n Officer at Headquarters and the
 Divisional Intelligence Officer, Detective Sergeant
 Charlesworth, gave us no information at all regarding any
 suggestions that any Liverpool or Nottingham supporters
        1
                                                                                   S. SEWELL

                             were going to come late and Sergeant Charlesworth had been
                             in touch w i t h all the clubs involved and in fact produced
                             quite a lengthy document on the intelligence and there was
                             absolutely no intelligence cane to him which was passed to
                             us,and I have spoken to h i m since, about anybody suggested
                             coming late.

                    B        And you had had no experience of that either during the
                             -A. That is correct, sir.

                        Q. Yes, thank you.  Now again, before the 1988 semi-final,
                           one matter that was m e n t i o n e d in evidence some considerable
                           time ago, did you have a meeting with the Ambulance Service
                           before the 1988 semi-final? -A. Yes, I believe they came
                           to one of the meetings at Hammerton Road.

                        0. What was the purpose of this meeting so far as they were
                           concerned? -A. I do not think, there was any real need for
                           them to come but they did - it was to do with the Police
                           organisation and I do believe that somebody from the
                           Ambulance Service, p r o b a b l y Station Officer Easton, who a OQ     h
                           has been the normal contact that I have had with the
                    D      Ambulance Service did come.

                        Q. Was   that at your invitation? -A. More than likely but I
                        ' - v.jus tr could, not really x o n f i rn .that.a   \.5 -•*-         W   .:i,

                        0.  The same thing      did not occur this year, did it, in 1989?
                           -A.That is correct.      Whe n we had the initial meeting, I
                          , believe wh i ch was the 22nd of March, various people came
                         , to do with the Police oper a ti o n and there was nobody from
                            the Ambul a nc e requested to come or in fact the Fire
                           Brigade, but I spoke to the Chief Inspector from operations

                           Brigade informing them of the event which was done.

                        0.    You did not see any n e e d then to discuss any arrangements
                             with the Ambulance Service before the 1989 match? -A.
                             They were not invited to the meeting, sir.

  Did you see a n y need? A. I was aware that they would be
  coming to the m a t c h and I had contact with them later on,
  sir.

  But you saw no nead in the                  p reparatory stages?  A. Not in
  the a c t u a l p l a n n i n g of the      police operation, no.

  Can you turn on now, please, to page 449 in the core bundle.
  We see here a c o m m u n i c a t i o n from the club to, amongst other
  people, you. A. Tha t is correct, yes.

  This is w here       you w ere s ent         a copy of the match day i n s t r u c t ­
  ions, w hich I       t h i n k we w i l l    find at 451. A. That is correct.

  Was this sent for your a p p r o v a l ? A. That is right, sir.
  I d i s c u s s e d it wit h S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray and on page
  454 you will see that it is inserted "and the gates
  opened.         Tha t is in Mr. M u r r a y ' s own handwriting.         As a
  result of that I s p o k e w i t h Mrs. Sharon Lane at 1.30 on the
  9th Jun e a s k i n g her to a d v i s e it and that is my writing on
  the b o t t o m there.

  In that d o c u m e n t it is q u i t e clear, is it not, there is
  no r e f e r e n c e to any s t e w a r d i n g on the L e p pings Lane end?
  A. That is correct.

  was it to pack the c r o w d and so on on the Leppings Lane
  terraces? A. It is my v i e w that it is the club's r e s p o n s ­
  ibility for the a c t u a l p a c k i n g of people on there but
 -there are no s t e w a r d s a l l o c a t e d to that terrace.      I was aware
  that when I too k o v e r the job that there were no stewards
  to do it.

  Had the v iew that had p r e v i o u s l y been expressed by the
  police in 1981 a b o u t stewards duties been abrogated as
  far as you are a w a r e ? We see that on page 144, I think,
  of the bundle.             T h i s is a m e m o r a n d u m from Chief S u p e r ­
  int e n d e n t H e r a l d to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Smith and Inspector
  Calvert. A. Yes, sir.

  Which in the m i d d l e p a r a g r a p h , as you will see, "Stress to
  the s t e w a r d s the a d m i s s i o n of spectators on the bigger games
  on the t e r r a c i n g is p r i m a r i l y their function and not a police
  one". A. Yes, I see that.

  That   was a v i e w p l a i n l y e x p r e s s e d   in August, 1981,     was      it
  not?   A. That is c o r rect.

  Had that v i e w been a b r o g a t e d by the time you took office,
  as far as you k n e w ? A. Yes, sir.         I did not come to Ham m e r t o n
  Road until 1987.

I know. A. And as far as                I was aware on small league games
 if we kne w t here was an              a m o u n t of supporters that were
                                                               S. R. SEWELL

pr o bably l e s s than a t h o usand the awa y s up p o r t e r s were
pr o bably put in the two ce n t r e pens.     On the large games
they w e r e a l l o w e d to fill the pens on their own.

But you    see   that    that m e m o r a n d u m re f e r s   to the iig games
A. Yes.

P r e s u m a b l y t h e games w here it is e x p e c t e d     that the terraces
at the L e p p i n g s Lane end will be full. A.                 Correct, sir.

It r e f e r s to the police v i e w at that time that it is the
st e w a r d s job to pack those supporters. A. Yes, sir.              I still
think that it is to the stewards or to the club.                     However
there were n e w s t e w ards there so the police would monitor
the f i l l i n g of the t e r r a c e s from the c o n t r o l room and from
o f f icers on the track.

But you n e v e r t h e l e s s a p p r o v e d a d o c u m e n t w hich did not lay
any d u t i e s u p o n the s t e w a r d s at all so far as the terraces
were c o n c e r n e d . A. The senior offic e r s approved that, yes.
That is c o r r e c t .

You, as    l i a s o n officer, would have            to study     it closely?
A. Yes,    that is correct.

it and a p p r o v i n g it? A. No, Sir.

Are you s a y i n g that you did not not i c e that ommission?
A. I was a w a r e that it said that there were no stewards
on the t e r r a c e s but that seems to h ave been in the past and
that was the pos i t i o n .

     L O R D J U S T I C E TAYLOR: The police could have done one of
two t h i n g s a b o u t there b eing no s t e w a r d s there, could they
not.     They c o u l d ei ther hav e said: "Why are there no stewards
there, let us have s t e w a r d s there, that is where they are
supposed to be". A. Yes, Sir.

Or they c o u l d a c c e p t the fact that there were not going to
be s t e w a r d s th e r e . It looks as though it was the latter
that was a c c e p t e d . A. Yes, Sir. /

     MR. P H I L L I P S : Can I now take you, please.        A little
later on in 1988.           You were, of course, co n c e r n e d with the
m atch in A p r i l , 1988, and I think that you told us you
drew up the o p e r a t i o n a l order. A. Yes.

And we have t h a t as one of the d o c uments that has been
disclosed.      I am going to ask you a bout that order in a
little w h i l e w h e n I come on to the 1989 order. A. Yes.

                        the 9th August,         1988, at which you attended, along with
                        Mr. M u r r a y , Mr.   Mar s h a l l , and Chief I n spector Beale?
                        A. Yes.

                   Q.   You a l s o had there r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s of the a m bulance service
                        and r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s of the fire s e r v i c e ? A. Yes, sir.

               B Q.     This was a p r e - s e a s o n meeting,       was it not? A. That is
                        right, sir.

                   Q.   W ere you w e r e c o n c e r n e d with r e n d e z v o u s points for both
                        the e m e r g e n c y servi c e s in the event of any need for them?
                        A. T h a t is right, sir. I think that Mr. Murray as well
                        w a n t e d to m a k e cont a c t with the peo p l e from the ambulance
                        and the fir e service.

                        Did you c ome to, as you u n d e r s t o o d it, a clear agreement
                        a m o n g s t the three s e r v i c e s as a re s u l t of this meeting,
                        as to w h a t was to h a p p e n ? A. Yes, Sir.

                        Did you c l e a r l y u n d e r s t a n d where the am b u l a n c e people were
                        to go and the fire pe o p l e were to go? A. Yes.                          The ambulance
                        people, if they were going to put their major incident
               D        into a c t i o n w ould send their a m b ul a n c e to Herries Road
                        bus g a r a g e to re n d e z v o u s . The fire brig a d e were unable to

                        In o ther    w o r d s when the fire brig a d e were called in they
                        had to be told the p a r t i c u l a r part of the ground to go
                        to? A. T h a t is correct, yes, sir, the best possible
                        information.

                        That was s o m e t h i n g w i t h i n the k n o w l e d g e of Superintendent
                        Murray, was it? A. Tha t was s t r essed by the ambulance
                        officer, yes, and I see Mr. Murray has w r i t t e n on the bottom
                        of the report.

                   Q        LORD JUSTICE           TAYLOR: By the fire brigade? A. Yes,               I
                        beg your pardon.            By the fire officer.

                   Q.       MR. P H I L L I P S : We h a v e a note from Mr.          Murray at the end
                        of the d o c u m e n t . A. T h a t is right.

                   Q.   "The m e e t i n g was ca l l e d to e s t a b l i s h possible rendezvous

                        Mole and he has e n d o r s e d             it at the bottom, sir.

                        Yes.  Can we just m e n t i o n the a m b u l a n c e      service.  They were

                              casualties which           needed     c l e aring       they would be taken to
                              £he g y m n a s i u m .

                        Q.    Was it in fact ag r e e d that they would have an entry via
                              one gate nea r the g y m n a s i u m and an exit via,a second
                              gate? A. I c a n n o t h o n e s t l y r e m ember the entry by the
                              g y m n a s i u m gat e and the exit at gate ' o ’ . I -knew that
                    g        they were g o i n g to come to gate 'o'

                        Q.   Was it a g r e e d that they should             have a clear run through
                              to get their a m b u l a n c e s in and         out? A. Yes, obviously
                              t h r o u g h g ate 'o' but I c a n n o t recall them saying come in
                              t h r o u g h the g y m n a s i u m gate.  There are problems coming
                              in at that gate.              T here are v e h icles parked there by the
                              club and the d i s a b l e d pe o p l e that come to the match have
                              a u t ho r i t y by the club to park in that car park.             You can
                              still get r ound but it w ould be d i f f i c u l t becuae it goes
                              under the N o r t h Stand and round a hut which is the g r o u n d ­
                              sman, and it c e r t a i n l y is d i f f i c u l t to get with a vehicle
                              round there a l t h o u g h not impossible.             It is easier to get
                              in f rom gate 'o ' .                                                    °

                              It is easy if          the area is kept clear,                 is it not? A. That

We hea r on the day, you see, that there was congestion,
there were p a r k e d vans, P o l i c e vans and that sort of thing
that w e r e m a k i n g life a bit difficult for the A m b ulance
people.           A.*.    There w ere some round the gymnasium.
         Ho w e v e r , I do b e l i e v e that when Operations Support
was pu t int o being, w h i c h was shortly after 3 o ’clock
w h e r e O f f i c e r s w ould have come from all parts of the City
that it may well have been that it was an odd van that
they had c ome in that had been parked there.

We can look at that, p e r h a p s ---             A.   But plenty of
P o l i c e O f f i c e r s about w h e r e I think if somebody had just
said, "Can you move such a vehicle?" it would be moved
s t r a i g h t away.

Do you r e m e m b e r a d i s c u s s i o n , because Mr. Hopkins when he
gave his e v i d e n c e could not remember it, about the allocation
of t i c k e t s to A m b u l a n c e m e n ?  A.     That is correct, sir,
b e c a u s e they had got t heir tickets which were for the
South S tand and there was some talk about it - with then
h a v i n g to go to the g y m n a s i u m , it might be more convenient
for t h e m if they had their tickets in the North Stano.
I t hink it was p r o b a b l y S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray nay well
have s u g g e s t e d that.          However, I think that the Club did

-In c a s e a p l a y e r   got i n j u r e d ?   A. ..... Probably, .sir. __                 ....

At the end of this m e m o r a n d u m there is a reference to
s p e c i f i c i n s t r u c t i o n s b e i n g written in to the Tango
Serial's d u t i e s req u i r i n g them to assist the Fire Brigade
and the A m b u l a n c e peo p l e to get to the ground.                        A.    That
is corre c t , sir.                 It does not appear in the 1988/1989
order.           It was a c o m p l e t e oversight.                However, on all
the o r d e r s for the L e a g u e games for the whole of last
s e a s o n there was a s p e c i f i c mobile -- written on to the
bottom         of their i n s t r u c t i o n s , if     e v a c u a t i o n procedure
was in force, that they had to go to Herries Road Bus
Ga r a g e and another Tango m o b i l e had got to come back to
the g r o u n d for any a s s i s t a n c e they could give to the Fire
Brigade.

 I t h i n k if you look at Tab 15 in the South Yorkshire Police
 bundle, you will see this same m e m o r a n d u m but also a copy
 of two se r i a l orders - s pe c i m e n serial orders - such as you
 had in mind.       A.   Yes, that is correct, sir.

 This   is   T ango   1 and T ango         2?     A.     That's right,         sir.

 These are m o b i l e patrols, are they not?              A.   That's  right,
 sir.           It d e p e n d e d on the size of the League match.
 S o m e t i m e s we might just only have two, sometimes there
 might be four or w h a t - h a v e - y o u but on all the League
 m a t c h e s t h r o u g h the last s e a s o n that was on the orders.

 And if we look at the s p e c i m e n order we will see under
 " Em e r g e n c y E v a c u a t i o n P r o c e d u r e " a specific reference
                                                                  s.   R.   SEWELL


to the r en d e z v o u s p o i n t    for Ambulance vehicles.              A.   That
is correct, sir.

Na m e l y   Herr i e s Road G a r a g e .     A.   Yes,   sir.v.

And a r e q u i r e m e n t to l i a i s e   and assist the p e rsonnel          from
the A m b u l a n c e Service.         A.      That is correct, sir.

And, again, wit h the F i r e Brigade,               they have to give any
a s s i s t a n c e that is r e q u i r e d . A.      That's right, yes, sir.

So that o b v i o u s l y s h o u l d have been in the        1989      order,       should
it not?     A. • It s h o u l a , yes, sir.

And you agree that            it is    not     in there.     A.        That is correct
sir.                                                                       *

And,    of course, h a d t h e i n s tr u c t i o n been there, there would
have    been in each case a serial specifically detailed to
help    each of the e m e r g e n c y services.       A.   That is correct
sir.                                                              *

And    you cannot e x p l a i n it except asan o versight?                     A. It
was    an oversight, sir.            We didn't have it in the                1988 order
and    it was an o v e r s i g h t .  •                                          v_           .
        "                              ’*           I *                          .

But you see, Mr. Se we l l , the 1988 order had been written
up be f o r e this m e e t i n g of 9th August. A.- - I - a p p r e c i a t e
that fully, sir.

And if you are just g o i n g to slavishly copy the 1988 order
it is p e r h a p s not s u r p r i s i n g that you do not have it in.
A.     Yes, it was n ' t a c a s e of just copying that order,
sir.       The 1988 S e m i - F i n a l had been a successful operation
so o b v i o u s l y that o r d e r did serve a basis - a strong basis -
of the 1989 order but it was s crutinised very closely and
quite a few a m e n d m e n t s w e r e made where we made a lot better
use of cert a i n r e s o u r c e s w h i c h would have happened at
Phase 2 and Phase 3.               that was an omission, an oversight;
I can offer no other e x p l a n a t i o n for it, sir.

     LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR:       It was omitted from both 1988
and 1989?         A.   It wouldn.'t have been on the 1988 one,
sir, b e c a u s e we didn't h ave the meeting until after so it
was just the 1989, sir.

     MR. PHILLIPS:          The next thing I think you did was
to have a m e e t i n g wit h ste w a r d s ; is that right? A. That's
right, yes, sir.

We have been p r o v i d e d w i t h a copy of your briefing notes to
s t e w a r d s w hich appear to be two pages torn out of a notebook.
A.        That's right, sir, yes.

P.hotocopied.            A.     Yes,    sir.

Is this, in fact, b e c a u s e there is no heading to it, are
these the notes that you had for the briefing with the stewards
                                                                  11

                             b efore the start of the 1 9 8 8 / 8 9 season? A.   That is
                             correct, sir.    it had b e e n an occasion where Inspector
                             Calvert had been to b r i e f the stewards annually before.
                             I was asked i o go.   I s p o k e with him before I went, seeing
                             what sort of things he had spoken to them about, made
                             these notes and this fo r m e d the basis of a talk that I
                   B         gave to them.

                       Q.    You have     got a copy b e f o r e       you,   have you?          A.     Yes,
                             sir.

                       Q.    You start     off by i n t r o d u c i n g   yourself.        A.    Yes,   sir.

                       Q. And say that you have t aken over from Mr. Calvert and
                          it says, "Mr. Lock g ives s t e w a r d rules".        A.   Yes, Mr.
                          Lock gave - I don't kno w w h e t h e r it was exactly at that
                          stage in the talk but he gave the duties of the stewards                             i/
                          and went t h r o u g h them a c t u a l l y in full.  I think he had
                          a book l e t that he was r e f e r r i n g to and went through
                          e v e r y t h i n g in de t a i l about their duties: they had got
                          to wear their tabards, they must not leave their points
                          and a w hole list of i t e m s of stewards' duties which went
                   D      on for some minutes.

   ,.v~»               Q... Was--that---by.ixe ferenc.e-. to.- the,-document that-you Jncd*-eppEewed ....

                            that and p o s s i b l y some of his own notes as well, sir.

                       Q.    You then go on to e m e r g e n c y e vacuation procedure.      A.  Yes.
                            .1 spoke to them in de t a i l telling them about the coded
                             message.     I had o r i g i n a l l y asked how many stewards had
                             been there from the p r e v i o u s season because there weren't
                             many new ones, but I went through it in full giving them
                             the c oded m e s s a g e and t e l l i n g them, of course, that in the
                             event of that b eing o p e r a t i v e they must go to all their
                             exit points, c o v e r the g a n g w a y s and gates would be opened
                             and went thro u g h it in detail.

                       Q.    All these exit points, g a t e s and gangways referred, of
                             course, to the ones out of the ground entirely, did they
                             not?   A.   Yes, sir, t h a t ' s right.
                                                                   t
                       Q.    There was no s t e w a r d p r e s e n t at the p e r imeter gate on
                             to the pitch, was t h e r e ?            A.   No, sir, those are all
                             c o v e r e d by P o l i c e m e n on the Track Serial.

                       Q.    Then " P r o b l e m with Pol i c e Offi c e r through Mr. Lock to me"
                             that is p r e s u m a b l y if t here is any dispute between a
                             Police O f f i c e r and a s t e w a r d ?   A.   That's right, so that
                             we got the c hain of command.

                       Q.    The next item, "Pol i c e r e s p o n s i b l e for p r e v e n t i n g breach
                             of peace but  ground regulations                enforcing down to the
                             s t ewards."  A.   Th a t ' s right, yes, sir.
               H
                       Q.    And then a s m a l l e r note, and can I read it accurately,
                             " P roblems o u t s i d e Police, inside really down to stewards

                       A
                           Q.    What do you mean by t h a t ? How did you explain that?
                                A.       I was e m p h a s i s i n g that if there were any minor
                                p r o blems i n s i d e the g r o u n d where people wanted - poblems with
9
                                a ticket and so forth or to do with problems with cameras,
                                which were against the g r o u n d rules, this was down to the
                                stewards to deal w ith and if they had a problem that they
                       B        could not deal with, then they could go and refer it to
                                the Police Officer, but any minor p r o blems inside the
                                gr o u n d and c o n c e r n i n g the sa f e t y of the people inside is
                                really a m a t t e r for the s te w a r d s and the Club, and that
                                any d i s o r d e r is down to the Police in dealing with breaches
                                of the peace.

                           Q. When you say p r o b l e m s insi d e , you are really talking about
                       C      minor problems, not m a j o r m a t t e r s such as the packing of
                              pens?   A.   Th a t ' s right, yes, sir.

                           Q.    Because it is not t e r r i b l y  clear from the note but, of
                                course, these were just ver y b rief notes to remind you
                                what to say.    A.     T h a t ' s right, yes, sir.

                           Q. Did you then mak e it c l e a r to the stewards at this briefing
                       D      that they were not r e q u i r e d to control the movement of the
                              spec t a t o r s on the L e p p i n g s Lane terraces? A. I didn't
                           *  refer^that. they had got to, sir, no-              *^
                                                 T        ..       ^       t#           *
                           Q.   That is not the q u e s t i o n .         A.   I was aware that there were
                                no s t e w a r d s ofi the L e p p i n g s Lane t e r r a c e s , - s i r — .....

                           Q •■■I know, Mr. Sewell, you t o l d us that already.           What I
                       E        asked you is w h e t h e r you mad e it plain to the stewards
                                that they had no d u t i e s to perf o r m on those terraces.
                                A.   I don't t h i n k I a c t u a l l y said those words, sir,
                                but I didn't tell the m that they had any duty to do on
                                the terraces.

                           Q.   So it was left      in the    air    then?        A.   Yes.

                    Q. Then there is a reference made concerning tabards and other
                       matters which I don't think we need to go into. - A. That is
                       right.  I did then show a film which showed problems and the
                       Leeds-Coventry match, I believe, in 1985, problems at the
                       Heysell Stadium, the Bradford fire, and it goes through
                       those showing the duties of the stewards and the Police with
                       the evacuation, and this is a Metropolitan Police training
                B      film.

                    Q. At the very end of this note we see in capital letters:  "PLAN
                       FOR DISASTER” . - A. That is the title of the film, sir.

                    Q. I see. Was there any commentary by you relating that to
                       Sheffield Wednesday’s ground? - A. About the film, sir?

                    Q. Yes. - A. I said, "This is what has happened at these grounds
                       here.  Be very much aware.   If we get a problem here this is
                       what we have to do” , and I emphasised that. They seemed
                       quite interested in watching this film which went on for
                       about 25 minutes.

                    Q. Can we come now to 1989, and come to the first events we have
                       heard referred to which is the match on 14th January between
                D      Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday.  You organised that, did
                       you? -A. Yes, sir.

                        the very points that had been raised in August? - A. That is
                        right, yes, sir.
                         /
                    Q.        And it was some time in March, I think, when you had to get
                             your operational order put together for the 1989 match? - A.
                             Yes, sir.

                    Q. You had available, you told us already, intelligence from Mr.
                       Charlesworth and various other sources as well as the 1988
                       order? - A. Yes, sir.

                    Q. Had you visited the club in the run up to the preparation of
                       this order? - A. Yes, sir.  There was frequent contact with
                       them.

                    Q. I think you went with Superintendent Murray in the few days
                       before the match? - A. Yes, sir.

                    Q.       Was Mr. Mackrell there?   - A. Yes, sir.

                    Q.       And did you inspect the   ground? - A. We did,yes, sir.

                    Q.       Were you satisfied with what you saw? - A. Yes, sir.

                    Q.       Were you troubled with the entry arrangements at the Leppings
                             Lane terraces? - A. No, sir.

                H Q. Were you concerned at the absence of signs directing people
                             where to go? - A. At the time the signs seemed adequate.

 Did you give any thought to any possible problems of access to
 the terraces from those turnstiles? - A. No, sir. There had
 been no problem the previous year with the large match, and we
 did not envisage    any problem    this year.

 I understand that, Mr. Sewell. You did not. in fact look at
 the situation at all critically at the Leppings Lane end? - A.
 no, sir.

 You accept, do you, as I think Mr. Mackrell accepted
 yesterday, that the signs are very misleading? - A. In
 hindsight, yes, sir.

 But none of   that occurred to you at the time? - a . N o ,sir.
 If it had I   should have mentioned it to the club.

 When you drew up the 1989 match order what was your object,
 your intention? - A. To improve on the previous year which
 already had been a successful operation.

 In your statement you set out a number of ways in which you
 made alterations which are          not in fact relevant to   this
 Inquiry, I.think, because they concern other parts            of the
 ground and other serials.         I don't want to go into every
 detail, but I do want, if you will, to take up with vou one or
vt wot’mat terse-: «otildjyotv.;look.u please, _ atir.Tstc.
 Yorkshire Police bundle, which gives us the 1989 match           .. —
 order, and look at Serial 1, which is sub-sector 1? - A.
 Yes, sir.

 Do you also have a copy of the 1988 match order there? -A.
 Yes, sir.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      We   d o n ’t have that in the bundle.

      MR. PHILLIPS:   It is   not in the bundle, sir,   no, butit
 has been handed in separately some considerable time ago:

 Unfortunately, the pages are not numbered.   If we look to
 Serial 1 sub-sector 1, do you see there that at the end of the
 larger paragraph:  ’’NO-ONE IS TO BE ALLOWED ACCESS TO THE
 TERRACES WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF A SENIOR OFFICER EXCEPT TO
 RECEIVE MEDICAL ATTENTION” . - A. Yes, sir.

 That is in fact emphasised very much more strongly in the 1989
 order? - A. Yes, sir.

 Why did you do   that? - A. In actual fact it was Chief
 Inspector Beale’s idea to do it, but the reason behind it is
 that sometimes   if some fans have got in the wrong end of the
 ground or some   arrests have been made. Officershave taken
 fans out of the perimeter gates and round the edge of the
 track, and also taken prisoners round the edge of the track.
 This can create problems by the opposing fans jeering and
 possibly lead to some crowd problems. So this really is
 intended that no prisoners or people should be transferred
 round the track, and they would be taken out from the back of
                                                          S.R. SEWELL


the terraces and taken round to the correct end. That is what
that is really indicating.  I am fairly certain Mr. Murray
would have made some reference to that in his briefings, that
nobody would be taken out of the perimeter gates to another
section. That is really what that is to indicate.

It is not intended to prevent the gates being opened in the
event of overcrowding in the terraces? - A. No, sir. If there
is a problem of overcrowding it is common sense to the Police
Officers who are on there, and the majority of the Officers on
Serial 1 on the 1989 order are Community Constables who work
the same positions throughout the whole of the season, sir.

I am coming to that in a minute.   There seems to be some
conflict in the individual Officers’ eyes anyway between what
they understand their instructions to be with regard to the
gates and what their common sense required them to do on the
day? - A. It is the same Sergeant that works with them
throughout the whole season, Sergeant Chapman. Also,
Inspector Darling that was on there, the majority of this last
season has worked with that serial.   I would be fairly certain
they should know the details, sir.

 There is no provision, is there, for this serial to pay any
 attention to the question of crowd numbers in the terrace? -
■A/ ''I't^id©es_-nbt--say,i-t..-in;'i:he:rQrdfer^.'-but npt-^ash indiv4craai- -tJv:
Officer^ ge-cs a copy of the serial .order. - It is -only fcv-the
 Sergeant and the Inspector.              I d o n ’t think everything can be
 put down actually in the operational order, sir.

But this is a fairly important thing, is not it, Inspector, if
you have got a situation where you are expecting the
supporters themselves to sort themselves out into a
comfortable position? - A. Yes, but also it is expected if the
Officers on the track see any problems when monitoring the
crowd they would relate straight to control.

Without any specific instruction to that effect? - A. Yes,
sir.  They are regular Officers that work this with the
exception of the odd few.

We have already looked at the Tango provision.  You say in
your statement that the object was to get the same people
doing the same job as the previous year.  Is that right? -
A. Where possible, yes, sir.

That is why I must take up with you, that has been said by
other Officers as well, and I have prepared a little schedule
- I d o n ’t think you have got it in front of you? - A. Yes, I
have, sir.

Can I just explain it. This is just an analysis of the two
orders, and I hope to save time rather than go through each
individual one, we see that in Serial 1 this year only 11 out
of the 20 Officers - I am talking about Constables now - were
there in 1988? - A. That is right, sir. There were changes
with the Community Constables, and some of the other Community

                             Constables were on..

                                  MR. PHILLIPS:   This is just a note I made, sir, to save
                             going through all the details.  (Document produced);

                       Q. Eleven out of the 20 Constables in Serial 1? - A. Yes, sir.
                   B   Q. That means that very nearly half of them won't have had
                          experience of a Semi-Final on that serial? - a . That is
                          correct of a Semi-Final, sir, but a lot of the others do work
                          on the League matches and work on the track.

                       Q.    But on a League match things are very different, because you
                             don’t get a capacity crowd at the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes,
                             sir, but we have had several large matches, Manchester United
                             Derby, Liverpool.  We have had plenty of large matches this
                             last season.

                       Q. I have also analysed the numbers of Serials 1 3 - 1 9 which are
                          all concerned with the Leppings Lane end, are not they? - a
                          Yes, sir.

                       Q. Not one of the Officers who was working on those serials
                   D
                              this year was working in the 1988 Semi-Final? - a . Yes, sir
                              Perhaps I can explain.    Sergeant Crawford last year was on the
                            ‘- ■ W e s t a s •ppsteirs                    iTOJRHBamsiey .^’
                                                                                          ,
                              was -on-the. terracesrthis year-just underneathT*' Sergeant'-'"-"-
                              Higgins who was here in 1988 has now left. Then the other
                              four serials, 15, 16 and 17 - the ones that are outside the
                            ,turnstiles - last year they were C Division Officers that are
                              Officers from Rotherham.    Inspector Sykes, who was on their
                              last year, said that he was not particularly happy with how
                              the Officers from there had performed their duties last year,
                              and so he wished his own Officers, which are from Ecclesfield.
                              So I purposely put on Sergeants Whitlam, Morgan and Proctor
                              that are with Ecclesfield Officers who throughout this season,
                              the majority of them have worked on the turnstiles outside
                              Leppings Lane, and are fully aware of it. In fact, Sergeant
                              Proctor is the area Sergeant at Ecclesfield, and his serial
                             work almost without exception on the terraces. Sergeant Payne
                              is from Hackenthorpe, and he regularly with his men works at
                              the ground.

                       Q.   Perhaps I ought to explain the    schedule a bit more because it
                            is not necessarily immediately    apparent. We see the number of
                            Constables in the first column    who did the same duty in the
                            two years, and it comes out at    none at the Leppings Lane end
                            - A. Yes.

                       Q. The serial number and broadly where that serial was stationed
                          - A. Yes, sir.

                       Q. The Sergeant is given in the 1988 version there. Those with
                          the asterisk against them mean that they were in fact working
               H          at this ground at this match but in a different position in
                          1989: "    That is riSh t * bu* I think the ones that were
                          working in 1989 had a lot more experience of working outside

   the turnstiles, and that is specifically why I picked them
   and this was in consultation with Inspector Sykes who has
   worked that duty outside the turnstiles, I believe, most
   matches since 1980, so I would rely on his information.

Q. We see, for example, that Sergeant Morgan who was the Serial l
   Sergeant in 1988 was working on Serial 18 in 1989? - a . That
   is correct, sir.  Sergeant Morgan used to be the plain clothes
   Sergeant, and now Sergeant Chapman takes up his duty, and that
   is why he has gone on the track for all of this season.
   Sergeant Morgan throughout the past season and League matches
   more often than not has worked on coach reception outside
   Leppings Lane turnstiles, and is an experienced Sergeant and
   that is why he was picked for those duties.

Q. So we see that six of the Sergeants, if you look at the very
   end column, who were on duty this year, had also been on
   duty in different positions in 1988? - a . That is correct
   sir, and again Sergeant Burman was in the West Stand this*
   year, and is one of the regular Officers who works at the
   ground. He normally works on the Kop, and he works in the
   West Stand sometimes at the League matches. He is an
   experienced Officer.  That is why they were all picked.




                   /Q. It does seem to follow

  Q. It does seem to f o llow then, does it, that you were not
     really trying to get the same people in the same position
     as you had had last year? -A. Where possible but we were
     trying to improve.    I altered the ones on the turnstiles
     because of Inspector Sykes' ....

 Q.You have explained that. - A. Yes.

 Q. But the net result seems to be that so far as the part
    of the ground that we are concerned with is concerned
    you   did not have     any ofthe same people on this year as
    you   had in 1988?     -A. Well, the ones that were on in 1988
    do not regularly attend the ground and so the ones that
    were chosen for 1989 do regularly attend the ground
    and have experience of that particular end and that is
    why they were po si t iv e ly chosen. They are experienced
    officers who k n o w what they are doing.

  Q. You see, the reason I am asking you this, Mr. Sewell
        and    the reason I   looked at this is that inyour statement
        on page    4 you say, "The serials around the turnstiles
        at Leppings Lane and Penistone Road and in the enclosure
        to the same were the same as for 1988 which had proved
        adequate."    That is not right? - A. What I mean by that,
        .sir, is they were the same amount of men on it, that
■s.:-...there- were four serial's- rout side;, anti-: tvcr'd-vsi* ? . * - - ~ -

 Q. Oh, the same number of         people,    you mean?- A. Yes.       Mv
     mistake, sir, but that        is what    I was ___
    i
 Q.' They were not the same        serials? - A. No, sir.  No, sir.
      I am sure they were an       improvement on last year, sir,
     a vast improvement.                                    .    *

 Q.Do not you think the experience of the 1988 semi-final
    would nave been something that could have been carried
    forward in the w a y that has been put forward, it appears,
    until now? -A. Probably a lot of those Officers that
    were on it last year on those turnstiles, I am not sure
    but they probably were not all working the match this     *
    time any way.  They were not regular officers. The ones
    that were picked were the ones that have done it, bv and
    large, throughout the wh ol e of the season on the League
    matches which have involved large matches and large crowds
    at Leppings Lane and they were officers which Inspector
    Sykes would have chosen.

 Q. In fact then it is       experience during that season which
    you reckoned to be       more important than experience of the
    1988 semi-final? -       A. Yes, sir, for that particular catch,
    yes.  The officers       knew what they were doing.             *

 0. IIow, having gone into that then you did then, I think,
    attend on the day and took part in the briefings.   Is*
    that right? - A. That is correct, sir.   I also took part

                       Q. I do not think there is anything in it I particularly
                          want to ask you about.      You V7ere really concerned with
                          radios, were not you? - A. That is ri»*nt, sir.      I think
                          probably one relevant point is that with the radio
                          issues, that is serials 1 to 21, which were all the
                          serials w h i c h were in the ground, the Inspectors and
                          Sergeants were to have earpieces.

                       Q. Did they all get ea rpieces?- A. Yes, sir. There were
                          36 ordered.  That is the only amount we could get.
                          There were 36.

                          of the Police Officers on serial 1 would have a radio
                          with them, man y of them w o u l d have them because they were

                         /well, I did not issue the radios and it did not specifically
                         • say everybody should have got one but I assumed that they
                           would have but they are not far away from another officer
                           if they have got a problem.          There are 20 of them round the
                           track.  They could easily wal k to somebody that had got
                           one and the ma j or i ty w o u l d have had one.   There were°some
                           spare radios.    If a nybody had asked for one they would
                           have got one.

                       Q. On serial 1, you mean? -A. Yes, sir, definitely, yes.
                          The constables on other serials would not have got them
                          unless there was some specific duty but there was no
                          problem.  I ordered 16 dozen radios, I believe it was,
                          and there wer e some spare.

                       Q. Were those radios all tested before the event? -A. I
                          assume that they wo u ld have been tested by the
                          Communications Department.    I ordered them with the loud
                          hailers and base station and so forth before from the
                          Communications Department.    I am sure they would have
                          tested them.

                       0. With loud hailers, you say? - A. Yes.

               H       Q. How many loud hailers did you have at the ground? - A.

                                 I believe there were five.                    I believe.

                        Q.        Where were they? -A.               In the gymnasium.

                       Q.         All of them? - A. They             were in the gymnasium available
                                 ror any Senior Officer              that wanted to have one.
                   B   0.         You see, we heard that when a loud hailer was required
                                 at the Leppings Lane terraces Constable Buxton ran back
                                 to his Landrover, I think it was, to collect it from the
                                 Landrover because there did not seem to be one at the
                                 ground.   Were the Senior Officers told that there were
                                 loud hailers there? -A. I would have thought thev would
                                 have been aware, sir.      They were certainly in the gv~i-
                                 nasium w it h the radios.    P.C. Buxton usually takes one
                                 m the Landrover for if one of the Senior Officers wants
                                 a lift.   He is the driver, is P.C. Buxton, with the
                                 Landrover, so he is available for any of the Senior Officers
                                 outside who might want taking to anywhere round the around
                                 He quite o f t e n will take one in with him so that if “
                                 anybody wants to use it they can do.      He has also got
                                 the loud hailers on the Landrover, got a public address
               D                 system.   I k no w down to Mr. Mole this was updated, that
                                 system, certainly some months ago any wav.       He had it
                                 updated on the L^ndrover.

                          Mr. Murray..have known that there were five loud hailers
                          in the gym? - A. I do not know, sir.

                           A. He w a s , sir.  He was in the control box.  They were
                          there at the     beginning any way.  They were in the gym­
                          nasium because I can recall using one in the gymnasium
                          myself to ___

                       Q. Now, you have told us about the issue of radios.      It was
                          Sergeants and Inspectors who had earpieces then? - A On
                          the ground serials w h i c h is 1 to 21 and obviousiy any
                          Senior Officers as well, Mr. Greenwood and the Chief

That is your briefing then.    The issue of radios on the
day.  Did you participate in anything to do with the
stewards on that day? - A. No, sir.     I had arranged for
the four Inspectors in the stands to brief the slrials
in the respective stands at 11.15.     That was Inspector
Darling the South Stand, Inspector Calvert on the Kop,
Inspector Woodward on the N or t h Stand and Inspector White
on the West Stand.  This had all been arranged with Hr.
Lock and, I think, Sharon Lane at the club so that they
were all aware and in fact I v;rote on to the particular
Inspectors' orders for them to do that and I an aware
that they all did get briefed, the stewards.

Yes.  And of course that b r ie f in g to the stewards would
be in accordance with what you had previously said at the
beginning of the season? - A.That is right.       I would
imagine the main thing w o u l d be for the evacuation
procedure so that they k n e w it because obviously on the
large matches the club enlist a few extra stewards for
the semi-final and obviously to ensure they were aware
of the emergency evacuation.

Now, on the day itself you also received, did you not,
a report from M r .Charlesworth, Sergeant Charlesworth,*
on- intelligence? rA^ Yes, sir.   - , --      . tiws.

     MR. PHILLIPS:     I am m o vi n g now to the bottom of
page 7, sir.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.

      MR. PHILLIPS:    What did you learn from him? - A.
On   the day?

Yes.  Towards the bottom of page 7 of your statement
you see .... - A. Y e s .

.... you say in the paragraph about two-thirds of the way
down, “Detective Sergeant Charlesworth gives details of
intelligence"? - A. Yes.   That was the briefing.      Mr.
Duclcenfield was up first, then Mr. Murray, then Sergeant
Charlesworth and he prepared a full booklet on the °
intelligence and he went b r i ef l y through one or two
points on that which was condensed.

What did you hear from him?   Can you remember? - A. I
cannot specifically.  There were no problems about
anything that affected me pa rticuarly that day that
I did not already know about.

Nothing adverse? -A. Nothing at all.  I mean, I do not
think I particularly listened to what he was saying on
that briefing.  I knew it did not apply to me.  He°had
been talking to me several times that morning.  I had
 seen him probably about 7 or half-past-7 that mornin®.
 There were no problems and he was in contact, I am aware
 with Liverpool and Motts, people that day. He would k e e p ’
 letting us kn o w throughout the day that there were so
 many people on that train arriving at such-and-such a
 tune, so. m a n y people on that, and this was relaved to
 officers at the Midland Station.      That was the sort o-
 thing he was telling us but there was nothing that was
 out of the ordinary.

 Now, can we come to just before the match started?     Did
 you get a message - I think your position was r e a ^ y in
 the gymnasium, was not it? -A. I got a roving commission
 sir. but coming up to, sort of - if everything had gone ’
 to plan, at 3 o clock there would have been a number of
 officers coming into the g ymnasium to have a hot meal
 which had already been supplied from

 In the quarter-of-an-hour  before 3 o'clock vou were in
 the gymnasium? -A. In the vicinity of it, yes.

  Well now, did you get a message to get in touch with
  South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive? -A.. I
  do recall that they were wanting me to contact Bert"
-Middleton..who. is., the liaison.-thatr.I have-..^I .v;as..aware____

  Station or on his w a y from the Midland Station having -
  supervising.the .people getting on. buses, down, there a n d — ...
  I told the control that if they rang Herries Road bus
* garage     they would be able to get in touch with him
 because I was not in touch with him and they would get
 him on the radio from Herries Road bus garage.

 Were you told why they w a n t e d you to get in touch with
 Mr. Middleton? -A. I cannot recall, sir.       They wanted
 to contact h i m for some reason.

 Did they not tell you that Leppings Lane was to be c l o se d 9
 - A. I do not recall that specifically, sir, no.

 At all events, you did n ot get through to the Passenger
 Transport? -A. Ko.

You threw the ball back to control? - A. I told them how
they could contact him, yes.       When he comes to the "round
ne stands down by the N o rt h Stand and the Kop *or the
majority of the game and I regularly go and liaise with
him ror if there are any problems with the buses.       He
does not u sually get there until some time after the
kick-off but control p ro b ab l y thought I would have been
able to get hold of him straightaway.

Had you heard then m e s s a g e s about closing the Lane over
your radio? -A. Probably but it does not recollect anything
 with me,    sir.

 Did you k n o w anything that was going on outside the
 turnstiles m Leppings Lane? -A. No.            I an aware that
 in the - round about quarter-to-3 that there was some -
 there w er e obviously some problems at Leppings Lane and
 they were requesting ma n po w er to L e p p i n g s* L an e .

You r e sponded to that, did not you? - A. Yes.    I told
the control there     were a number of officers from West
Bar that had come up from the station, thev had~been
riding w it h the fans on the buses, and I went to *-he
gym. to depl oy them.

Did you receive a telephone call           from the control b o - ’
- A  Not a telephone call, sir.           There is not a telephone
link in the gymnasium.     There is       one in the Police room
wnich is adjacent but I did not           have a telephone c a n
no.  I he a rd them on the radio.                    *

I see.     There is just a telephone link between the Police
room and the control box to that side of the g r o u n d ’ - A
lhere are two telephones in the actual Police room w h i c h ’
is across the w a y from the gymnasium.           There is an outside

any way.                                                        °

*es   But any way you got the message and vou sent 'these
people off to Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, sir'

What instructions did you give them? -A. It was obvious
to^me that there was some problem at Leppings Lane but
I -<new not hi n g more than that and that thev were wantin'*
several serials.          Sergeant G o d d a r d ’s voice'was hav^n*   °
 like a w a r b l i n g effect on the radio and at first I “
thought there was some pro b le m with my own radio.
Spolce to another officer as I thought it was probably
the battery was faulty on m y own radio.                Spoke to
another officer.          They v/ere having the same problem.
- then assumed it was obviously a radio fault as opposed
to my ov/n radio.         They did say they wanted the*n to
various locations.           I realised by deplovin* a ia r°e
number of men from the gym. this was possibly somethin*
quite serious          so I got Sergeant Sewell who was on           =

Sergeants who I was deploying and where.

                           I just said to the s e r g e a n t —  I did not know what the problem
                           was other than L e p p i n g s Lane and so the only brief to the
                           sergeant was: T a k e your men to the locat i o n I am sending
                           you to, see the s e n i o r officer up there, and do what he wants

                            is Dowson.   I will k n o w them by sight but there were other
                            officers fro m W est Bar and all over the place.

                      Q.   Is not one of t hose S e r g e a n t in charge of Mr. Houson?
                            A. Yes, S e r g e a n t 2379 Swift, who was sent to the West

                      Q.   To the West Stand? A. Tha t is where I told them to go but
                            obv i o u s l y the y went up the track.         I heard the evidence of
              D             Police C o n s t a b l e H o u s t o n and they went up the side of the

                      Q. / T hank you v e r y much, that is helpful. A. That has been
                           recorded and has been m a d e an exhibit at the time.           I know
                           that I then r e - g r o u p e d anot h e r serial.  It says *E' Division,
                           Crime and V a n d a l Sqaud.      That was with Inspector Berrisford
                           and his S e r g e a n t and ten men.       They had been a reserve serial
                           who had gone out h e l p i n g on Penistone Road.        I re-grouped
                           those t o g e t h e r and set t hem out and it was three o'clock
                           when they went.

                      Q.   I think           you h eard s o m e t h i n g over the radio about gates.
                            Can you r e c a l l what you heard? A. I cannot h o n estly recall
                            what I h eard now a b o u t the gates.               There was some reference
                            to gates but the r a d i o rec e p t i o n was very bad.           I got the
                            i m p r e s s i o n t here had been a problem at the Leppi n g s Lane
                            end and there was s ome pitch invasion.                   That was the
                            impre s s i o n that I got.

                      Q.   Gates, when you h eard a b o u t gates on the radio, did you kno w
                           w hether that r e f e r r e d to gates on the perimeter fence or
                           gates at the t u r n s t i l e s ? A. I did not know, sir.  My main
                           object was they w ere w a n t i n g men up there.     I was deploying
                           men and I kne w who I was sending and seeing who I had got
                           left in the gym.        T h a t was my main object.

is that    right,     was the crowd noise a p r o b l e m on reception
on your    radio?     A. Not in the gymnasium.

Any p r o b l e m t h e r e was was actually to do with the
c o m m u n i c a t i o n s i t s e l f ? A. That is right, yes. We were not:

Someone has s u g g e s t e d that the c o n crete all round makes
d i f f i cu l t e s . Has that been your e x p e r i e n c e before or not?
A. Not really, sir, no.

     MR. P H I L L I P S : At o ther times you have been able to
rece i v e and t r a n s m i t from the g y m n a s i u m with o u t trouble?
A . Yes.

You had    s e n t these o f f i c e r s out and I think that you remained
in your    p o s i t i o n , did you? A. In that vicinity, yes.

Did you get to u n d e r s t a n d at some stage that there was a
dr e a d f u l d i s a s t e r h a p p e n i n g out on the terraces? A. I do
recall s e e i n g C h i e f S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesb i t t very shortly
after that.            I then w e n t down to the edge of the field,
to the N o r t h S t a n d and the Kop.                At that stage I could
see t h e r e was a very large amount of o f f icers up at the
Le p p i n g s L a n e end on the pitch.               At that stage I still
thoughts ^thena- had*-been a ptich iavaai&n-^i-,                                       ■:

What time is that? A. Some time, as I recall, round about
ten past t h r e e - o r just after-, but- that could -be a - l i t t l e          ■
vague.

Had the gam e s t o p p e d ? A. I think that it would have done,
yes.     I got the i m p r e s s i o n that there was a pitch invasion
and I t h o u g h t t here was going tobe some large scale public
disorder.         My c o n c e r n at that stage was to get back to
the p o l i c e r o o m bec a u e I k new that there was in the region
of t w e n t y to th i r t y p r i s o n e r s that were alre a d y in the cell
buses and in the p o l i c e r oom and I "thought we could have
some p r o b l e m if the fans got back there.             That is what hit
my mind at that stage.               I had no idea at that stage what
the d i s a s t e r was.

You h ad not hea          a n y t h i n g on your r adio to inform you
by th is tim e of         at was going on or what was required?
A. I had not » n            I t h o u g h t that th ere was a pitch
invas ion at tha          tage.

How soo n wer e you d i s a b u s e d of that idea? A. Shortly after
they wer e b r i n g i n g c a s u a l t i e s down on hoardings.

That is w h e n you r e a l i z e d ? A. Yes.    At that stage I still
t hought that it was a d i s o r d e r p r o b l e m and there were just
a few i n j u r e d people but then o b v i o u s l y things escalated
and I w e n t back to the g y m n a s i u m and things started to
flow f r o m there.

It is at this point, is it not, where your discussions
with the f ire b r i g a d e and the ambulance people in August
1988, come int o e f f e c t ? A. Yes.                          *

Did you r e a l i z e then that .this was just the situation that
had been c a t e r e d for in that meeting? A. I do not think that
it c r o s s e d my mind a c t u a l l y at that stage. *

Did you r e g a r d it as b eing your duty to ensure that there was
p roper a c c e s s to the ground, proper i nformation to the
e m e r g e n c y s e r v i c e s ? A. I had already seen Station Officer
Easton at the ground.                  I presume he was with Mr. Higgins
but I do not r e a l l y k n o w Mr. Higgins by name.         He was with
another ambulance o f f i c e r . I had seen them in the region of
2.15.         I was aware that they were at the ground.           I
just had a b r i e f chat w ith them and said: "If things are
all q u i e t and you go into the g y mnasium when the game has
started you w i l l be able to get a meal".               I did not see
them after that until I saw Station Officer Easton in the
region of A .30 w h e n I s p o k e to him again, somethin© like
that.                                                             °

point? A. I was a ware that the St. John's Ambulance
were a l r e a d y on the p i t c h when I went d o w n I have, a.........
vague r e c o l l e c t i o n of the other amb u l a n c e personnel
bewing a r o u n d at the same time and having gone up towards
L e p p i n g s L a n e end.

Did you t ake any steps to clear the access for these
e m e r g e n c y v e h i c l e s ? A. I do not think there was any
p r o b l e m at that stage of any a mbulances getting in the
region of g a t e 'o'.               T h e r e were a number of mounted officers
that w ere s t o o d by at the back of the Kop and there were
some dog h a n d l e r s as well that had been brought in but
there w o u l d h a v e been no prob l e m of getting a vehicle
through.

There w ere s till m o u n t e d officers in the yard behind the
North Stand and the Kop? A. They were actua l l y behind the
Kop near to the gate e nt r a n c e coming in from gate 'o’ .
T here were a nu m b e r in there, probably the ones, I assume,
that had been on P e n i s t o n e Road end.  If it was looking
as if there was a public order event I assumed that the
officer who was in c h a r g e of those may have thought that
he may well hav e been ha v i n g to go on to the pitch with
the horses.

You took     no s p e c i f i c   steps?   A.   No,   but there was no blockage.

That   is your     e v i d e n c e about   that? A.     Yes.

                          We h ave heard, however, that emergency vehicles that were
                          t rying to go to L e p p i n g s L a n e and, indeed, some of the fire
                          o f f i c e r s and a m b u la n c e p e o p l e who arrived, were met with
                          Pol i c e O f f i c e r s , C o n s t a b l e s and the like, who appeared
                          not to k n o w w h a t was g oing on.               Did you not detail anyone
                          to d i r e c t t h e s e e m e r g e n c y vehicles outside on Penistone
                          Road or at the en t r a n c e s to the ground? A. There were
                   B      plenty of         o f f i c e r s round the gate 'o' that were
                          see i n g to any p r o bl ems w i t h any traffic at all.            I did not
                          say s p e c i f i c a l l y to someo n e : "Go and do it", no.

                          How would they k now what the problem was, why the fire and
                          ambulance had been called in, unless you told them or saw
                          to it that the y were told? A. When the casualties were
                          b r o u g h t . o f f the field I t h i n k that it was fairly obvious,
                          and the a m b u l a n c e s were c o m i n g up on P e n istone Road. They
                          s eemed to be g e t t i n g up, there did not seem to be any
                          p r o b l e m w i t h g e t t i n g up so far as I was concerned.

                          It does a p p e a r to      be the c a s e that some of these officers
                          did not k n o w what        was g oing on and had not the faintest
                          idea why the fire brig a d e and the ambul a n c e s were turning
                          up. A. At the earl i e r s t a g e s I thought that there had been
                   D      a pitch i n v a s i o n .     I was not aware of what had happened
                          until I saw t hese          c a s u a l t i e s bring brought off the field
                          myself.   '               ‘                         • ' ' .cit.   ' '

                          You then k n e w that the a m b u l a n c e and the fire service were
                          being c a l l e d .' A’. I' assu m e d they h a d , yes, t h a r is why t h e y - ’--
                          were g e t t i n g there, yes.

                          Do you not think, look i n g back, you should have made it
                          clear to e v e r y o n e round about, at the entrances from
                          P e n i s t o n e Road, what they w e r e required to do with regard
                          to t h e s e e m e r g e n c y v e h i c l e s ? A. It would have been better
                          if I had s p e c i f i c a l l y said something to someone but I did
                          not.        I n e v e r saw any problem. If I had seen any problem
                          at all I w o u l d have seen to it.                  There was also an inspector
                          who was s p e c i f i c a l l y seeing to the loading of officers
                          that w ould h a v e been on coac h e s and in charge of the
                          T r a n s i t s . T h e r e was I n s p e c t o r Scarf in the vicinity of
                          P e n i s t o n e R a o d and he had a Sergeant working with him as
                          well.         I k n o w that he did a s s i s t ' w i t h emergency vehicles
                          shortly after.              Having s p o k e n to him he said that there
                          was no p r o blem.

                   G (>          LOR D J U S T I C E TAYLOR: But you never received any
                          me s s a g e f r o m  cont r o l as to what the situation was-
                          A. I did not          hear a n y t h i n g at all, Sir, no.

                          A l t h o u g h they could hav e been in touch with you by radio?

  It is s e g r e g a t i o n ?     A.      Yes,   sir.

 And we see that s y s t e m in ope r a t i o n if you look at Document
 21 in the South Y o r k s h i r e bundle in respect of the League
 game i n v o l v i n g L i v e r p o o l and Sheffield Wednesday prior to
 this Semi-Final.               W o u l d you look at Document 21 and the
 O p e r a t i o n a l Order for Serial 9.          A.   Yes, sir.

 If you look at Serial 9, in relation to Leppings Lane
 terrace you see a s p e c i f i c order directed to Police Officers
 to e n s u r e pens are filled in accordance with instructions
 from Control.          " O c c u p a n c y of pens by away fans will be
 given at b r i e f i n g . "       A.      Yes, sir.

 Do you see a simi l a r            order   in respect of Serial       10?
 A.Yes,sir.

 When you have     a large m a t c h where the whole of the terrace is
 to be used by those fans who you         wish to control, you are
 quite cont e n t that they use all of the pens.        A.   that is
 correct, yes, sir.'

 And beca u s e you are c o n t e n t that they use all of the pens,
 on this a p p r o a c h d i r e c t e d to crowd control, there is no
n e B d .fcacrKa.i^pecrif-i-c' s y s t e m .o f.-.-.packing*-tha»t?r-isR-ct3®T%ct-<ri 9
 it not?        A..           Yes, sir.                      v ,• _.;             ’

 No doubt 't h a t ' is t h e -r e a s o n why, when we        look- t v T'^b,>'1 — *' *
 which is the O p e r a t i o n a l Order for the Semi-Final - similar,
/no doubt, to the p r e v i o u s year but the Semi-Final of 1989 -
 you see, for example, at Serial 14 a complete omission of
 any w r i t t e n i n s t r u c t i o n s d i r ected to control of the packing
 of the pens;          that is right, is it not?               A.    Yes, sir.

 So it follows from that that over the years such system
 as has been employed, be it by the Police, be it by the
 Club, for the cont r o l of p a c k i n g on to the Leppings Lane
 terrace has only been for the purpose of crowd control;
 that is right, is it not ?        A.      I have to agree with you.
 sir.

 It has not been for the p u r p o s e of crowd safety.       It has
 not been for the s p e c i f i c purpose of ensuring that indi v i d u a l
 pens do not get o v e r c r o w d e d .  That has not been the purp o s e
 of those orders, has it?              A.  it has been for the control,
 sir.

 It has not been for o v e r c r o w d i n g purposes;       that is right,
 is it not?            A.   C o r r e c t , sir, but obviously people will
 be m o n i t o r i n g it.

And that is why it is right, is it not, that you gave
your evidence e a r l i e r that when you have a large match                     the
crowd is simply allowed, at the Leppings Lane terrace,                           to
filter on its own, by its own devices, to find its own
level?   A.   That is c o r rect, yes, sir.

                             there has n ever been in operation a system of packing the
                             pens d i r e c t e d to crowd safe t y ? There has never been such
                             a system in operation, has there?           A.   I would have to
                             agree wit h you, sir, but obviously things were m o nitored
                             from the C o n t r o l Box.

                B   Q.   They may have been m o n i t o r e d but it would have to be a rather
                         haphazard monitoring;         it wol d not be a specific system
                         d e s i g n e d to ensure that individual pens did not get overcrowded.
                         That is right, is it not?           A.   I would have to agree
                         with you on that point, sir, it is specific, yes.

                    Q. And this is the root of the problem,is it not, Inspector,
                       that w hen p a c k i n g has been considered over the years in
                       the w r i t t e n d o c u m e n t a t i o n , the mind of those who have
                       been c o n s i d e r i n g it has only been applied to crowd control
                       and not c r o w d safety.               That is the root of the problem,
                       is it not?           A.       I w o u l d n ^ t say that safety had not been
                       in p e o p l e ' s m inds but ---

                    Q. If saf e t y had b e e n ' i n p e o p l e ' s mind you would not remove
                        from a L e a g u e m a t c h order when you come to a Semi-Final
                D       order r e f e r e n c e s to e n s u r i n g pens are filled in a certain
                       way, w o u l d you?         A.      On the large matches ---       I am sorry,

                    Q.   Inspector, I am not            q u e r y i n g whether Policemen are there,
                         stewa r d s     are there, who is responsible for the system.
                         I am d i r e c t i n g my a t t e n t i o n and your attention to the
                         purpose of the syst e m s w h i c h have been employed.              A. Yes,                      sir.

                    Q. And it is          o b v i o u s when one looks at it that the only time
                       you have            a s p e c i f i c s y s t e m for packing of the terraces is
                       when you            have c rowd cont r o l in mind.            That is fair, is it
                       not?   A.              Yes.

                    Q.   In order that fans can meet their own devices, follow their
                         own devices, in order to go across the terrace they need
                         help, do they not, in o rder to follow their own devices?
                         They need some g u i dance as to where they can go.        A.   Yes.
                         By and large they don't seem to have any problems.            They
                         do o b v i o u s l y like to go be h i n d the goal first.

                    Q.   "By and la r g e " is a r e f e r e n c e to League matches;  it must
                         be, beca u s e there aren't any other 'by and large' o c casions
                         one can look to over the years at Hillsborough other than
                         very few i s o l a t e d large matches.        For the most part, you
                         are r e f e r r i n g to the small capacity, are you not?
                         A.    Yes, but there are a number of large matches that we
                         deal with at Hil l s o r o u g h .
                H
                    Q. But a large m a t c h            involving       a total capacity of the                 terrace.
                       A.   Yes, I agree                it is not       a total capacity.

 That is not      a   'by a n d large* situation you can refer to
 is it?   A.          I w o u l d have to agree with you, sir.    *

 So what help do you say was provided at the 1989 Semi-Final
 to fans a r r i v i n g at the Leppings Lane terrace to use their
 own d e v i c e s as to w h i c h pen to go into?           What help do
 you say was p r o v i d e d ?             A.   It would be down to the
 In s p e c t o r t hat is in ch a r g e of those serials, if he gave
 any s p e c i f i c i n s t r u c t i o n s to his men which way he wanted
 them to go, i.e. down the tunnel or round the sides.

 What help     do you    say was    pro v i d e d ?    A.       I am not aware
 of a n y .

 It comes dow n to this, does it not, Inspector:                         there was
 no system in 1989 as far as the packing of the terraces went
 to p r e v e n t o v e r c r o w d i n g ;  there was no system - that is the
 truth, is it not?                  A.      Other than being m o n i t o r e d from
 the Cont r o l Box.

Other than      the c a s u a l monito r i n g , there was no system
was there?        A.      Not s p e c i f i c system, sir.           *

 And there was no s p e c i f i c help         given to individual fans

■filtering-'acrtyssrrthe-. t e r r a c e ^     - that is t'ruv sls'o~ i s ’it " - "
 not?       A.    I think that w ould          be correct, sir.

                      Cross-examined       by MR.     MULLER:

Officer, a p r o b l e m a r i s e s in putting an Officer into the
p o s i t i o n on the t e r r a c e once the terrace becomes overcrowded,
does it not?          A.       That is correct, yes, sir.

But,   of course,        if you --        A.      Or when it is      full,    sir.

If what you do    is m ake sure, to take a figure, that you
only have 54 peo p l e per 10 square yards, then the packinc
is not that tight at all, is it?      A.    No, sir.

And in those c i r c u m s t a n c e s you can have an Officer there
and that O f f i c e r w ill not b e c o m e ’,swamped: that is rinht
is it not?       A.      If it is not full, yes, sir.

Not full in the sense            of not having as many people in it
as you can p h y s i c a l l y   get into it.   A.   Yes, sir.

Then, if you co m p l y w i t h that rule, you cannot put an Officer
there, but if you a p p l y the rule of 54 people, for example,
p e r _10 square yards you can have an Officer there because
it is not that crowded.          A.   Correct, sir.

Can I turn, please, to a n o t h e r matter. Would you look
please, at page 478, w h i c h is your second part of your *
memo.   This is   in the core bundle. A.      Yes,  sir.

It is a m e e t i n g    of the 9th    August,        1988. A.       That's
right, yes, sir.

 Q. E m e r g e n c y e v a c u a t i o n . You have already told us that
    the fire S e r v i c e w e r e c o n c e r n e d that they should be told
    p r e c i s e l y w h e r e they w ere wanted rather than having a
    r e n d e z v o u s point. - A.          Yes, sir, t h e y - s a i d it wouldn't
    work for the Fir e Brigade.

 Q. Which is o b v i o u s l y s e n s i b l e because it is a very big place
    H i l l s b o r o u g h , is it not?      A.   That is correct, sir.      *

Q. And it may be mor e s e n sible to come in from one side
   rather than a n o t h e r if there is an emergency.    A.  Yes
   and it d e p e n d s w here the appliances are coming from, sir.

Q.   Quite a part from that, what the Fire Service were saving
     was that t hey n e e d e d to know what the nature of the incident
     or the e m e r g e n c y was.    A.   Yes, sir.   It is like a
     Police O p e r a t i o n s Room, the better the information, the
     earlier t h e y can r eact to it.

Q. That is m e n t i o n e d in the second paragraph,              obliquely anvwav
   on page 478.          A. • Yes.

Q.  They w a n t e d to know w h e t h e r it was a road a c c ident or a
     fire or some o ther sort of emergency.            A.      Yes, I would
 *c».say .that is fairly . o b v i o u s ,-sir      ~                   x*,..*,-.

Q. Because t hey are often ca l l e d to a road accident.
   A.   That's T i g h t - a n d they w ould have d i f f e r e n f e q u i p m e n t ‘
   to go.    It is so obvious, sir.

Q. And they w o u l d need to know and need to be told that so
   that they w o u l d know w h e t h e r to send a tur n t a b l e ladder,
   an e m e r g e n c y t e n d e r or whatever. A.  Exactly, sir.

Q. And also      to k n o w   how m any     to send.   A.     That is correct
   sir.                                                               ’

Q. So you were c o n s c i o u s of that and it is pre t t y obvious
   anyway, is it not?           A.   It ought to be to a Police Officer
    sir, yes.                                                        ’

Q. Can you j ust help me about this.*; what was the arrangement?
   We can p e r h a p s apply it to the c i r c u m s t a n c e s as they arose!
   We know that just after 13 minutes past 3 the Fire Service*
   were called, at l east the call was i n i t i a t e d ----           A  Yes
   sir.                                                                *    ’

Q.   By a call from     the C o n t r o l   Box at Hillsborough.              A   Yes
     sir.                                                                 *        ’

Q.    Once that h a s h a p pened, it is obviously necessary, is it
     not, that s o m e b o d y is g oing to be there to meet the Fire
     Brigade and b r i e f the Fire Brigade as to what they are
     s u p posed to do?       A. Exactly,    sir, yes.

Q.   What is the a r r a n g e m e n t ? A.   Well, if the Control Room
     has a sked for the Fire B r i g a d e to attend to a specific
     location, t h e n I w o u l d exp e c t them to detail s o m ebody to

      go and assist.

Q.    Is there not a s y s t e m ?      A.   Well, somebody has got to
      know where they are g o i n g to and where they ha*e been
      r e q u e s t e d to and the n that person who has r e quested them
      can send s o m e b o d y there to assist them.

Q.    O b v i o u s l y that is w h a t can happen.           Is there not an
      i n s t r u c t i o n for a s s i s t a n c e if you call for an emerqency

                          Tango Unit w h a t he has t o l d the Fire Brigade.       A.       The

                                                Cross-examined              by MR.    KALLIPETIS:

                       Q. Mr. Sewell, w o u l d you be k i n d enough, please,                      to turn       to
                          Tab 15 in the P o l i c e bundle.     A.   Yes, sir.

                       Q.    The m e e t i n g a bout w h i c h you have told the Inquiry already.
                             At the very b e g i n n i n g of your evidence I have recorded you
                             saying this that there was a clear agreement among
                             the three S e r v i c e s and if SYMAS were going to put their
                             major inciqart pla n into e f f e c t they would send a m bulances
                   D         to the H e r r i e s Road Bus Garage.       Did I record t h a t ' c o r r e c t l y ?
                             A.    Yes, sir.
                                                                        i                  ■
                       Q. So at "tiaf-Tneeting ‘certainly- ttre Porce'Were aware 'that                     -*
                          SYMAS had d r a w n up a s p e c i f i c plan for H i l l s b o r o u g h in the
                          event *of a m a j o r d i s a s t e r at Hillsborough?-- -A.-                sir,- •
                          it has been made up o b v i o u s l y some time - years - prior
                          to that m e e t i n g , I think.

                       Q.     And do you r e c a l l S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray who was chairing
                             the m e e t i n g r e f e r r i n g to the fact that they had seen it
                             and it was on the file s o m e w h e r e - they thought Inspector
                             Calvert may have it?                 A.    He may have made some reference
                             to that, sir, I w o u l d n ' t disp u t e it, although I cannot
                             recall it, but he was a w a r e where the r e ndezvous point was.

                       Q.    Indeed and there was no doubt at all that in the event of
                             a m ajor d i s a s t e r o c c u r r i n g the senior A m bulance Officer in the
                             g round w o u l d make his way to the gymna s i u m ?           A.   That's
                             right, yes, sir.                               /,

                       Q. And you k new         t hat?       A.        Yes,    sir.

                       Q. Mr. M u r r a y    kne w that?      A.             I assume Mr.      Mu r r a y knew it,
                          yes, sir.           He w o u l d have.

                       Q.    He chai r e d   the     meeting.          A.      He would have,       yes,   sir.

                       Q. And you are          the    O f f i c e r d r a w i n g up the orders     for the
                          Semi-Final.           A.        Yes, sir.

               H       Q. And thus       the    Police     Control          would know that.         A.      Yes,
                          sir.                                                                                    *

 meet the F1 L i a i s o n I n s p e c t o r outside the Players'

 That bec a m e   you after     I n s p e c t o r Calvert?        A.    Yes,     sir.

And r e g u l a r l y you w o u l d m e e t the Ambulance Officers before
each home m a t c h and just, as it were, touch base.              A.   I
used to s e e            More o f t e n than not it would be Mr. Eason
that I w o u l d see.         He is the chap I had contact with.

The last p a r a g r a p h   on tha t page, which is a reference                  to
the North Stand.             A.   Yes, sir.

Hr. Jones w h o was at t hat m e e t i n g is quite definite that
n oth i n g like that was e ver discussed at that meeting.
Could it be this, Mr. Sewell, that you may have picked that
up p e r h a p s from c h a t t i n g to Mr. Eason or Mr. Higgins
p r e v i o u s l y on one of the vi s i t s where you had met at a
home m a t c h ?       A.    R e m o t e l y possible, sir, but I have
a feeling that when we d i s c u s s e d about the senior A m b ulance
Officer g o i n g to the g y m n a s i u m , I have a feeling that it
may have been Mr. M u r r a y who would have said, "Well, it
might be mor e c o n v e n i e n t if you are in the North Stand,
yoi- have not as far to^go.".                   I think that was probably

 You see, o t h e r O f f i c e r s have told us that the Ambulance
 Officers, if they are in the South Stand, they have visual
.contact with the Po l i c e C o n t r o l Box.    A.   That's right
 and I think also they are nea r to the players.' tunnel as well.

There was n o b o d y from the Clu b present at this meeting, was
there?       A.    No, sir.             I n i tially it was, I think, for
Mr. Mu r r a y to have some l i a i s o n with the senior Ambulance
and Fire B r i g a d e p e r s o n n e l .

Mr. Sewell, you were a s k e d about your briefing notes in which
you refer to a d i s a s t e r        p l a n and you said that was the title
of the film.          A.     That was the title of the film that        was
shown, yes, sir.
                                                  t
Was there a Police d i s a s t e r plan as there was a SYMAS
disas t e r p l a n for H i l l s b o r o u g h Football Ground?   A.   No, sir

Do you t hink     there      should     have   been?   A.         In hindsight,         yes,
sir.

It is a shame         there was not foresight,          is it not?          A.     I
have to agree         with you, sir.

     LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:           I am not quite sure what a
Police d i s a s t e r plan w o u l d    have had in it.

MR.   KALLIPETIS:         I am g o i n g   to suggest something,           if    I may.
                                                             S.   R.   SEWELL



         LORD JUST I C E      TAYLORs    You see, you had a plan                 for
 a m a j o r incident.          A.    That's right, yes, sir.

 And you had a plan             for s e e k i n g support.   A.    Correct,
 sir, which was put             into o peration, Ope r a t i o n s u p p o r t . ’

      LORD JUSTICE            TAYLOR:        Perhaps    you would go on from
 there.

       MR.   KA L L I P E T I S :    Certainly.

Would it not have been a goo d idea that you, for example,
being the Liai s o n O f f i c e r betw e e n the Police and the
em e r g e n c y s e r v i c e s w o u l d have a designated p o s i t i o n to go
to where the Police C o n t r o l Box would know where to
contact you and w here the e m e r g e n c y services would know
where to cont a c t you and vice versa?                  A.    That is
correct, sir.              H o w ever, I have got a radio;       certainly
the A m b u l a n c e p e o p l e k n e w my name, they had only got to
ask any Policeman, say, "Get in touch with Inspector
Sewell, I want to l i a i s e w i t h him straight away".
Similarly, I c o u l d have got in touch with them through
the A m b u l a n c e C o n t r o l a f t e r being asked that way if I
wanted.

But, ywj see, ’first of all it is tft Police who'hs*c ’c o n t r o l
of the s i t u a t i o n when it is an emergency. That is right
is it not?         A.     That is right, sir.                   ’

And it is the Po l i c e tha t are responsible                    for co-or d i n a t i n g
all the Services.       A.    Yes, sir.

So it w ould not be for the e m ergency services to ask where
you were;          they s h o u l d k n o w that. A.   That is correct,
sir.          However, I was in the immjediate vicinity of the         *
g y m n a s i u m for the i n i t i a l stages, the majority of the time
except a short space of t ime I went to the pitch and when
I went out with S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Bates round to Leppings Lane
end and I am not a ware o f any Ambulance Officer looking
for me.

Are you aware that P o l i c e Control wanted to speak to the
senior A m b u l a n c e O f f i c e r at one stage?  A. I didn't
get a m e s s a g e t h r o u g h it at all, sir, no.

Precisely, Mr. Sewell.                You see, if there was a Police
Control Plan for H i l l s b o r o u g h it may well be that rather
than going to Snig Hill, then Snig Hill to R o t h e r h a m and
then R o t h e r h a m t r y i n g to c o n t a c t an Officer in the ground,
Police Control m ight hav e thought of contacting you and
said, "Look, you are the L i a i s o n Officer, you know where
the Amb u l a n c e O f f i c e r s are.        We would like one up in the
Control Box, p l e a s e . "         That would have been quicker,
would it not?            A.       Yes, sir.         From listening to the

                       e v idence, I think both the Am b u l a n c e O f f i c e r s went to
                       d i f f e r e n t p o s i t i o n s in the ground.    I think, from
                       l i s t e n i n g to the e v i dence earlier on, I think the Ambulance
                       O f f i c e r s d i d n ' t come to the gym i n i t i a l l y where I was.

                     Q. Forgive me, Mr. Sewell, I d o n ’t think that is right                         - A    I
                        beg your pardon.

                     Q. We have heard from Mr. Higgins that the first thing he did
                        once he realised what was happening was to go to the gymnasium
                        and ask for it to be cleared to receive casualties. - A I be«»
                        your pardon on that.                               ’   ‘     °

                     Q. The other thing that Police control plan might have taken into
                        account, you were asked about the Tango units and what they
                        could have done.  We are all aware when an important person
                        has to be got to the airport quickly or Royalty to get to the
                        theatre through the rush hour, Tango units go to all the
                        intersections and are ready to block off the traffic so there
                        is a clear run through? - A. That is correct, yes, sir.

                     Q. That would have been a very simple and the Police are well
                        aware of that sort of procedure for these Tango units to have
                        done to designated hospitals? - a . Yes. I am not aware of
                        ambulances having problems getting through, and I think the
                        Tango units were engaged all at the ground assisting, sir.

                     Q. It is right to say that once everybody did get going after the
                        initial delays, ambulances did not have difficulty getting
                        through. - A. .1 d on’t think they had any, sir.

                    Q. The other is this, Mr. Sewell. You say that there was no
                       agreement as far as you could recall that ambulances would
                       come in one entrance and go out the other by the gymnasium? -
                       A. Yes.

                    Q. In fact the vehicles that were parked                      by the gymnasium, there
                       was a Police canteen vehicle, was not                      there? - a . Yes, but
                       there was room to get past that.

                    Q. There was also a Police prison van? —                     a   . There were two, sir.

                    Q. Parked adjacent to the gymnasium between it and the Police
                       room and the first-aid room? - A. That is correct, sir. They
                       were not blocking anything, those cell buses, because in fact
                       the St. John ’s ambulance initially parked outside the
                       ambulance room which is behind the Police room, and we always
                       leave room for that to get out, sir,

                     Q. We also know from the evidence that Mr. Mote and Mr. Garrett
                         who were the stand-by ambulance who went to Gate O, were
                    •• directed by-the Police t o reverse in adjacentrto^the~

                       ’’room? - A-.~ That may have been right.                        -r

                    Q. The other matter which caused a difficulty was that Operation
                         Support was called for, and in particular, dog handlers were
                    • - ^summoned-to the ground . Did you know that? - rA7~There were-a
                         number of dog handlers initially behind the Kop with the
                         horses, and I can only assume I think Chief Inspector Beale
                         got them removed at very early stages, because it looked as
                         though there was going to be a pitch invasion, and obviously

 the horses and dogs - as soon as he realised it was not I do
 recall him telling the dog handlers to put their dogs back
 in the v a n s .

 You do recall that, do you? -      a   . Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Who was that? — A. Chief Inspector
 Beale.  To the best of my recollection it was him, anyway.

      MR. KALLIPETIS:   And what about the vans themselves? -
 A. I think the vans would have been parked somewhere outside
 on Penistone Road. However, there were some large jumbo cones
 which had been placed on Penistone Road blocking the whole of
 the nearside lane off right along outside the Penistone Road
 entrances. so that would have assisted with any emergency
 vehicles getting in. So there was a lot of room on Penistone
 Road.

      At a later stage when I went out on to Penistone Road I
 recall there were Police vehicles parked on the central
 reservation, and. there was no problem with the roads.

 Mr. Sewell, page 11 of your statement you refer to a time of
 3.20 p.m. when Superintendent Bates arrived, the second line
 of page 11 of your statement? - a . Yes, sir.

 You then go on to describe how the gymnasium was cleared,           and
 then some injured people were being brought in. Police
 Officers were bewildered and then bodies were being
 placed on the floor, etc. - A. Yes, sir.

 And then do you find the sentence where you say: ”1 was
 asking control for a doctor to ensure that they were dead"? -
 A. For certification, yes, sir.

 In other words, to certify people were dead? - A. Yes, sir.

 Did you radio that through to control? - A. Yes, sir, several
 times, because I was concerned that we did not want to have a
 problem that people were being brought in, that there was no
 suggestion at all that anybody was other than dead, no
 suggestion whatsoever, but I wanted to be satisfied that
 nobody had forgotten to get a doctor there for the
 certification early doors, and that was my main
 concern.

    _LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Did you say you tried several
times? r Were ryou-having-difficulty then getting “through r t o y -       t
control? -A. I was not getting a reply back. They had
probably got my message;- but that is why I kept-repeating -rt~-

-They-probablyr-had-a let of other t h i n g s ? * A. .That-.is" cor rec ts-
 I am sure they did get it, because it was not long after -
 there were several doctors came to the gymn - but I recall a
 doctor with a beard coming, and I think that he was the first
 one there and we got him underway.
                                                    S.R. SEWELL


Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   In your statement you say he arrived
     about 30 minutes after that, you see. - A. Yes.

Q. The doctor with the beard arrived after about 30 minutes. -
   A. Time is very hazy, sir.  It could well have been then. It
   was not a ridiculous time we were waiting.

Q. There is no criticism, Mr. Sewell, so don't think that, but I
   want your help on something else. Did you eventually get a
   reply back from control to say they had put a Tannoy message
   out on the ground, and also they had asked Radio Hallam to put
   a special broadcast out? - A. I did not hear that, but
   certainly when you are in the gymnasium you would* not be able
   to hear the Tannoy inside the gymnasium.  I can only assume
   that is how the doctors got there, so some message must have
   got through, sir.

          MR. KALLIPETIS:     For your note, sir, the call from
     ground control to Snig  Hill asking them to put a message
     through to Radio Hallam was 15.29:

Q. Lastly this, Mr. Sewell.  You said that there was no
   information at all that fans were going to arrive late, and
   you had spoken to Sergeant Charlesworth and reaffirmed*that
   his calls round to various forces asking for there
   intelligence did not reveal this? - A. I did not specifically
   ask him if he had done it, but he did not give us any
   information about that all, and I am fully aware he is a very
   dedicated Officer and goes to a lot of trouble.

Q. Again, no criticism of    him.  I want to ask you about something
   else.  Is there a central computer which would record all the
   match reports from different Forces and thus make it available
   to any force who has to plan for a particular football match?
   - A. I am not personally aware of one. Somebody from the
   football liaison department at Headquarters probably would be
   able to answer that.   I am not personally aware of it myself.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think we were told there was
     not, but there are plans there should be.

          MR. KALLIPETIS:   Yes.   That is right, sir.   I had
     forgotten that:

Q. We have been served with details of match reports, Liverpool
    attending various matches prior to this match, and in
 - particular Liverpool -v- Hull on 18th February 1989rvand t h a t ~ ~
  ■ appears-to .indicate the_difficulties those Officers-"-.     -..-r.:
    controlling-thatrmatch encountered were these.' First, that 7^ ' ■
    fans;.had£ jumped over or-^crawled. under., the..turnstiles
    entered illegally.    Secondly, that two wire mesh gates between
    turnstiles and fans passing their retained part of their
    ticket to the fans outside-who tried to-gain entry'alleging^       ~
    they had lost the other part of the ticket or had it snatched
    from them by somebody else.     Thirdly, that crowds were
    physically pushed back from these gates at which point
    the fans inside crumpled up their retained part of

                                                                               S.R. SEWEI.I.
                    A
                           their ticket and threw them out of the ground for fans
                           outside to pick up. Fourthly, from conversation
                           overheard about 100 fans were gathering outside
                           without tickets, and the conversation led the Officers
                           to believe that those fans were of the opinion that
                           the Police would let them in the ground shortly after
                           kick-off. - A. Yes, I am aware of that report you are
                    B      reading from, sir.

                        Q. Was that report available to the Officers planning for this
                           match? - A. No, sir.  This has been found out in thelast few
                           weeks, since the Inquiry.  I am astounded that Sergeant
                           Charlesworth was not given this information when he was making
                           his enquiries.
                    C
                        Q. This is Inspector Jarvis from Humberside, for the mach that
                           took place between Hull City and Liverpool on 18th February
                           1989. - A. Perhaps Sergeant Charlesworth could answer the
                           question, sir.   I can t. He is the one that supplies us with
                           the information.

                        Q. I am told this morning he is not available.
                    D
                                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What is your point, that they
                           might have heard from the Hull Police?

                                 MR. KALLIPETIS:      Indeed.

                                THE WITNESS:   I am aware that he does not only just ring
                           to the host Force of the teams that are playing, he quite
                    E      often rings to places where they have been weeks before to see
                           about crowd behaviour and attendance and all the lot. I am
                           astounded that this was not forthcoming.

                                MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir, there are other matters which will
                           be the matter of submissions in relation to the yellow bundle
                           Thank you.

                    F                      Cross-Examined bv MR. GLASGOW:

                        Q. Inspector Sewell, when you had your meeting, and         you have Tab
                           15 in front of you, with the emergency services,         was the
                           purpose of that meeting to ensure that there was         some co­
                           ordination between them and that the Police knew         what the
                           plans were in the event of trouble? - A. That is         correct, yes
                           sir.                                                             ’

                        Q. They were'satisfied? - A. As far as I am aware. *          ^

                        Q. And they gave you no indication that the arrangements they had
                           come to with the club from their point of view were anything
                           other than idea? - A. I think there was comment that they

    would have liked to have had an ambulance at the club as
    opposed to St. J o h n ’s Ambulance. There was some comment about


 Q. But that was not a sufficiently serious matter for you to
    think of minuting? - A. No. We were only talking about the
    emergency evacuation procedure in here, but there was
    conversation to that effect.

 Q. Can I ask you secondly about the monitoring which you agreed
    was casual.  Did you hear Mr. Calvert’s evidence yesterdav? -
    A. Yes, sir.

Q. So far as you are aware was the system of liaison and
   particularly the monitoring of the pens you inherited the same
   as the one that he had been carrying out? - a . Yes, sir I
   cannot see there has been any change.

Q. Can I take you through the steps he told us about in the
   monitoring, that the situation in the pens would be looked at
   through the screens and through the windows of the.control
   box? - A. Yes.

Q. And that the people in the control box would be listening to
   messages passing between people in the ground? - A. That ic
   correct, yes, sir.

Q. That they would, in his words, be asking those in a position
   to answer, "What have you got outside?” , that would be
   normal? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. That the question would be asked of those in the West Stand,
    Go and have a look what the situation is below you". Would
   that normally be   asked? - A. More than likely, yes, sir.

Q. And that with that information an assessment and a final
   assessment would usually be made? - A. I would imagine that
   yes, sir.

Q. And in respect of the perimeter fence his answer was,
    Normally the Inspector would be told to go and have a look? -
   A. If there was thought to be a problem, yes, sir.

Q. And that is the system which ought to be followed? -     a   . That
   is the system which has been followed, sir.

   Forgive me, but-'if thalrusystem is followed" is there-anything    r
   at.all casual or    unsatisfactory about it? - A.. You can’t see • •
   :how many.-are ±n   the pens-vithout specifically knowing the- -
   numbers-coming ..through, can you?. .                 -

Q. No.  Is that the point you were accepting by the use of the
   word "casual"?*- A: Yes, I would say so. '     • ~        ■

Q. It sounds like a pretty organised system to me, Inspector.            Is
   that unfair? - A. It has worked in the past.
                                                           S.R. SEWELT.


Q. You say you need counting as well. The total numbers are
   being given regularly from the computer, are they not? They
   are certainly available at the touch of a button? - a They
   are available, yes, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The monitoring depends upon what
     over a long period people at football matches have come to
     accept as being the density is tolerable and tolerated? - A.
     That is correct, sir.

                   C r o ss-E x a m in ed bv MR.   woodward-

Q. Mr. Sewell, on the matter Mr. Glasgow has just asked you
   about, you identified the various points that Mr. Calvert was
   asked about.  The people in the control box, they would be
   looking around? - a . Yes, sir.

Q. They would be carrying out their other duties? - A. Yes, sir.

0. They would have to be looking not only at the terraces but
   they would be looking over the whole of the ground, would not
   they? - A. T h a t ‘is correct, and then dealing with any incident
   that came over the radio as well that might happen.

Q. No-one had the specific job of standing as it were and
   exercising .surveillance over the West terraces? — *. .Tha^ is
   totally correct, sir.

Q. So in the sense that I think you agree with Mr. King that it
   was casual, it would be a question of as one took a view,
   happening to notice something before any further steps would
   be taken? - A. Yes, something had to be brought to your
   attention.

Q. One would be looking around generally as one might look around
   this room and one might notice some people are more encumbered
   than others with paper? - A. yes, sir.

Q. But unless something drew that problem to your attention would
   the matter be taken any further, unless the eye or the mind of
   the Officer was tuned in to say, "There's a problem there".
   Would it go any further? - A. No, sir. It is down to the
   individual in the box.

Q. I think you agreed with Mr. Glasgow in answer to one of his
   questions, that these other steps, the communication with the
   outsider going; and-having a look,-sending an Officer down;-
   that-would depend on something having been noticed, would it?
   - A. Yes.                                      ' ... .-.

Q. Because you would not be sending runners down to all points of
   the ground to just check that everything was OK? - A. No, sir.

Q. May I ask you about the briefing of the stewards.  When you
   took over from Mr. Calvert you had some notes which you
   briefed from? - A. Correct, sir.
       f                                                      44

                        A
                            Q. And if we look at those notes there is written in capital
                               letters at the fourth entry:  "EMERGENCY EVACUATION
                               PROCEDURE"? - A. Yes, sir.

                            Q. Did the stewards have any particular role to perform in the
                               emergency evacuation procedure? - A. They were to go to the
I                              exits and cover the gangways and exits from the stands and the
                        B      exterior gates.

                            Q.    Would it be right to say that their role in the emergency
                                 evacuation procedure was crucial? - A. Yes, sir.

                            3. And u n l e s s t h e y u n d e r s t o o d what t h e y had t o do i n t h e
                               emergency evacuation procedure the thing would founder? - A.
                               That is correct, and we also had two tests, dummy runs,
                        C      throughout the season, sir.

                            3. When it came to discussing and briefing the stewards, what was
                               your attention intent on focusing their minds on? - A. The
                               main thing for me was the emergency evacuation.

                            3.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       They had to go to the gates?         - A.
                                 Yes.
                        D
                            3. What did they actually do there? - A. Assist with people going
                              .out and make sure that the gates open.-.       -             -

                            3.    That is the gates out of the stand? - A. Yes, and theexterior
                                 gates.

                            3.   And the exit gates? - A.Correct, sir.
                        E
                            3.    But beyond that.... - A.And generally just assist with people
                                 going out, and be there as a calming influence because they
                                 were obviously identifiable as stewards with the tabards on,
                                 sir.

                            3-         MR. WOODWARD:  You would want them to know exactly what
                        F        to do and for them not to leave and evacuate? - A. Exactly.
                                 They had got to be the calming effect with the Police
                                 Officers of getting people out, and this was impressed upon
                                 them.

                            3. And although some of the stewards were experienced individuals
                               would it be right to say you had no knowledge in detail of
                               their level of understanding? - A. That is correct.    I knew
                        G      one or-:two, but obviously I know the senior stewards.".:: l; " —

                            3. Arid did T:you spend”the time of -the briefing in-spelling the         \

                               wanted to hammer it home by showing them this very descriptive

                            3. Is it right in the course of that briefing of the stewards you
                    H          did not give your attention to telling them about supervising
                               and moving people around and dispersing them? - a . No, Mr.
                               Lock went through that in full detail.

 Stephen Robert Sewell

 5th Inspector 'FI'



 Since October 1987 I have been the 5th Inspector at 'FI' Sub

 Division and from that time I have had responsibility for the

 preparation of the 'FI' football orders at 'FI'.    I took over from

 Inspector Calvert who had been doing the football orders at

 Hammerton Road for a number of years and the systems of organising

 the manpower etc are largely based on systems he introduced.

Generally speaking officers who attend the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Ground on match duty all say that the policing of the

grounds at Hillsborough is more efficient than that at other grounds

in the county.   It may well be that as Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club is a First Division club - more money is available and as such

manpower is not reduced as it is at other grounds.



I was involved with the organisation of the 1988 Semi Final for

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.   This was done together with Chief

Inspector Beal and Inspector Calvert in consultation with

Superintendent Murray and Chief Superintendent Mole.



As the semi finals for 1989 were drawing near I was watching which

teams were likely to be in the semi finals.   During the week

commencing 13 March 1989 it looked as if a semi final could be

staged at Hillsborough and at that stage I started addressing my

mind to a possible semi final at Hillsborough.
On Saturday 18 March 1989 the FA Cup 6th rounds took place.      On 20

March 1989 the draws for the semi final took place and again

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest were drawn to play.    I believe it

was later on that day that Chief Superintendent Mole informed me

that the semi final between those two teams was due to be staged at

Hillsborough.   Easter Bank holiday weekend was due on 24, 25, 26 and

27 March 1989 and together with Chief Superintendent Mole a meeting

was arranged for Wednesday 22 March 1989 of ail persons involved

with the semi final.   Chief Superintendent Mole, Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, who was to be the divisional commander

from 27 March 1989, Superintendent Marshall, Superintendent Murray,

Chief Inspector Beal, Inspector Sewell, Police Sergeant Goddard

Control Room, Police Sergeant Fidler admin,     Chief Superintendent

Nesbit, Superintendent Brougham Traffic Inspector, Sayers Traffic,

Sergeant Sorsby mounted, Inspector Phoenix dogs, Police Sergeant 'D'

Divisions representative, Inspector Dews 'D2', Headquarters

catering, communications department, press    liaison, Police Sergeant

Walton motorcycle, Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson, South

Yorkshire Transport representative, British Transport Police and

British Rail, Sector Superintendent commanders and their Chief

Inspectors, South Yorkshire Highways Department, Headquarters

operations staff, football liaison officer.   Through Football

Liaison Department; liaison was made with Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club, Nottingham Forest Club, Liverpool Football Club,

Merseyside Police and Nottinghamshire Constabulary.    Through

operations room; liaison was kept with South Yorkshire Ambulance

Service and South Yorkshire Fire Service.
After the formal meeting on 22 March 1989, close liaison was kept

with all parties until the semi final on 15 April 1989. Close co­

operation was maintained throughout.



Together with Chief Inspector Beal, the previous match order for the

1988 semi final was studied and as this was a total successful

operation, it formed the basis of the 1989 semi final.    Briefs were

prepared with Chief Inspector Beal, these were all discussed in

detail with Superintendent Murray and approved by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield.



Basically, the serials were the same as for the 1988 semi final

with the following main changes.    I will deal with these briefly as

I am aware that Chief Inspector Beal will be dealing with the

changes in minute detail in his report.



Three Inspectors who acted as liaison officers to sector commanders

were dispensed with as they were under employed.   One reserve serial

stationed at South Stand/Spion kop was dispensed with as it was

superfluous to requirements. Supervision of mobile units was reduced

by two Inspectors as in practice they could only be with one unit at

a time.   Serials 1 and 2 were increased by two Police Constables and

one Police Sergeant respectively.



Serials 11 and 12 (North Stand) were decreased as their main task of

ensuring that supporters did not use the Penistone Road North egress

did not require the manning afforded in 1988.   Serial 15 was

decreased by one Sergeant, leaving one Sergeant supervising one
serial.
Further serials on the outskirts of the ground patrols were reduced

from one Sergeant and 10 Police Constables to one Sergeant and eight

Constables.   None of these serials were directly involved with

access or egress from the football stadium and it was considered by

all that these extra two Police Constables per serial were

additional to requirements.



Better use was made of resources and at Phase III,     four serials

from within the ground, that was serials 2,8,20 and 21 were to assist

the track serial to prevent any pitch invasion at the end of the
match.



Also, during the 1988 semi final, all serials deployed outside the

ground were on standby    for refreshments at Claywheels Lane

throughout the duration of the match.    They were some quarter      of a

mile away from the ground and were too far away to deploy in the

ground at short notice.   This year, following an idea put forward by

Superintendent Murray,from 2.45 pm on the day of the     1989 semi

final,   a Police coach   was stationed in Leppings Lane near to the

ground and a further Police coach was stationed in Penistone Road

near to gate 'O'.   Of the men who were due to meal at Claywheels

Lane Police Station throughout the match, five serials ie five

Sergeants and 40 Police Constables were detailed to get on each

coach at the two locations at 3 pm.    They would remain on standby

until 3.30 pm when the coach would drop them off at Claywheels Lane

Police Station for meal and then pick up five further serials on each

coach to return to the ground for deployment.
 This would make better use of 20 serials throughout Phase II of the

 game.    In actual fact, the five serials which were making their way

 to £gch of       two coaches for 3 pm brought them to the ground for

that time instead of the men being j of a mile away at Claywheels

Lane Police Station.     These 10 serials being in the vicinity of the

two coaches at 3 pm were all in addition to manpower resources to

the 1988 semi final as all these men would have been at Claywheels
Lane Police Station.



The serials around the turnstiles at Leppings Lane and Penistone

Road and in the enclosure to the same were the same as for 1988

which had proved adequate.     The intelligence supplied by Football

liaison and Detective Sergeant Charlesworth local intelligence     did

not throw up any different problems from the 1988 semi final which

proved to be a total success.     However, just because the 1988 semi

final had been a success earnest consideration was made when

preparing the 1989 semi final and every effort was made to improve

on an already successfull operation from the previous year.



The operational order was approved and circulated on 6 April 1989 to

all senior officers of Chief Inspector and above involved in the

operation.    A pre-briefing was arranged for sub sector Inspectors

and above on Friday 14 April 1989 in the North Stand of the

Wednesday ground.     All Inspectors involved in the operation attended

or a Sergeant deputising for the few Inspectors who were unable to

attend.   This Sergeant then liaised with the respective Inspectors
prior to the match.
 On that pre-brief, Inspectors were handed an operational order and

 details of serials under their command and their duties.    They were

 also givenserial orders for their respective Sergeants under their
 command.



At the pre-brief, these Officers were briefed by Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield on Policy,     by Superintendent Murray on

what was required at the match and by myself on admin procedures

which included reporting on and off duty, overtime claims, the issue

of radios including all ground serials to have an earpiece, the

issue of meals and the issue of vehicle keys for those on transits.

The individual sector commanders then briefed their men taking them

to all the relevant parts of the grounds to examine locations
pertinent to their duties.



A personal carrier was made available for Inspectors on out-lying

parts of the order to view their duties.    Whilst placing the

individual manpower on the operational order, every consideration

was made to using the best resources available and in particular

supervisory officers with extensive experience of the ground used in

locations familiar to them.   With this in mind, key Inspectors were
placed in the following locations:

Inspector Darling (FI) - South Stand and track

Inspector Calvert (late FI) — Spion kop

Inspector Woodward (F2 late FI) - North Stand

Leppings Lane Terraces - Inspector White (F), always works this duty
extremely experienced.
 Inspector Bullas (HQ) PSU - West Stand regular relief at F Division.

 Inspector Harvey (late Fl) - South Stand car park

 Inspector Sykes (F 2 ) - Leppings Lane Turnstiles, always works this

 duty extremely experienced at this location assisted by Inspector
 Purdy HQ, (relief at F l ).

The serials picked to work in the ground were mainly 'F' Division

Officers, all have good knowledge of the ground assisted by Spion

Kop,    'E' Division Officers, regularly work that area.   West Stand

 E     Division Officers under Sergeant Burman, worked that duty

before.     Leppings Lane terraces 'B' Division Officers worked at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club before on several occasions.

Leppings Lane turnstiles three serials 'F2' Officers and one 'E'

Division Officer all worked these duties before.     The Sergeants in

Par"ticular have extensive knowledge of this particular duty.



Other duties were considered when the manpower was placed on the

serials and great thought was used when identifying Officers to

Par"ticular duties so as to make the best use of resources.     Also, I

personally made arrangements for the stewards to be briefed in their

respective stands at 11.15 am on 15 April 1989.    This was arranged

in conjunction with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Mr Macrell

club secretary and Mr Lock, security officer Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club and ex-superintendent and football commander at

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.    Officers briefing were:   South

Stand Inspector Darling, kop Inspector Calvert, North- Stand

Inspector Woodward, West Stand Inspector White.    In addition I have

close liaison with the senior stewards on all match days and with Mr

Macrell secretary SWFC and Mr Lock security officer.
During August 1988, I had attended a stewards meeting at Sheffield

Wednesday Football Club and briefed all the stewards re emergency

evacuation and other problems and the gate men had been briefed by

my deputy, Police Sergeant Goddard during August 1988 whilst I was

on leave.   Liaison had been made with senior officers from the Fire

Service and the ambulance service and Superintendent Murray and

myself during this present season re any major disaster.



On 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at 'Fl' at 7 am.      At 7.30 am I

patrolled the ground area and surrounding roads with Police Sergeant

Hodkinson who was detailed as a driver for the day.      At 7.50 am that

morning, I located some rubble near to Parkside Section Station and

message was raised on the computer to have this removed, it was from

a gas board excavation the previous day.



At 8 am that morning, at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground, I

liaised with Inspector Bennett admin, and Police Sergeant Fidler,

checking all cones and barriers in position, radios collected and

ready for distribution.     Police Sergeant Colley was seen in the

Police room and all was in order.     Inspector Scarfe was liaised with

re cell buses arriving, articulated vehicle     from West Yorkshire

(food wagon) arriving, assisted with positioning.     I then saw Police

Sergeant Dent, dog section, liaison     then took place regarding

search for explosives.     I then liaised   with Civilian staff

regarding hot drinks to be served to approximately 700 officers

attending briefing.      Checked with Inspector Bennett, all in hand

assisting officers into North Stand for briefing in accordance with
seating plan.
 At 10 am that day, briefing takes place in North Stand, Chief

 Superintendent Duckenfield set the scene, Superintendent Murray

 gives the order of the day and what is required.    Detective Sergeant

 Charlesworth gives details of intelligence.    I gave details of

 reporting on and off duty, radio issue and collection, overtime,

transit keys allocation and meal allocation.



At approximately 10.30 am the briefing finished and everything was
going to plan.



At 10.45 am that day, with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and

Police Sergeant Hodkinson, we patrolled round area of ground and
coach routes in 'F' Division.



   11.15 am that day, Officers out on ground, general patrol of area

with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield on foot walked down Leppings

Lane,barriers in position.Near to Leppings Lane traffic island, a

minor road traffic accident had taken place. Officers under command
of Inspector Millett dealing.

        t
At 12.30 am approximately, liaising with Mr Lock security officer in

club video room and general patrol of ground with Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield — no problems, there were not alot of

fans about.     Fans spoken to in vicinity of the ground all in good

spirits, no problems, no evidence of alcohol at that stage.



At 1.30 pm with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield we went to the

gymnasium for a hot meal, outside CID officers and track serials
also mealing.
 At 1.45 pm approximately, to Control Room left Chief Superintendent

 Duckenfield, Superintendent Murray, Police Sergeant Goddard, Police

 Constable Ryan, Police Constable Bichard in control box.   I believe

Assistant Chief Constable Mr Jackson in civilian clothing also
present.



Between 1.50 pm and 2.30 pm, general patrol of North Stand and South

Stand area upper concourses checking on betting booths, no problems

noticed and that South Stand concourse were busy,quite a lot of

Nottingham Forest fans arriving early.   No evidence of alcohol in

South Stand.   Checking North Stand betting booths - not so busy in

Liverpool side, still no visible evidence of alcohol.



At 2.45 pm in the vicinity of the gymnasium and Police room area I

was aware that there were a number of prisoners on the cell buses

and that the Police room were busy but I spoke with Inspector Barker

who did not report any problems other than busy, but this was to be

expected.   Everything was still going to plan.   About this time I

was aware of a message from Control that there were problems at

Leppings Lane and that further manpower was required.   About this

time problems with radio reception.   I recall Police Sergeant

Goddard's (Control) voice was having a 'warbling' effect.   I thought

my radio battery was faulty, other officers were experiencing

difficulty, obvious a radio fault, not   my particular radio.    I got

the impression that Control were receiving calls, but officers

outside were having difficulty in receiving Control.
It was apparent by the tone of Police Sergeant Goddard's voice that

urgent assistance was required at Leppings Lane.     I returned to the

gymnasium and informed Control that there were a large number of 'D'

Division officers on standby who were available for deployment.       I

got from Control that Officers were required at the track, Leppings
Lane end, West Stand and 'A' gate.



I grouped the serials together and as the Sergeant in charge left

the gymnasium, I got Police Sergeant 467 Sewell on logistics in the

gymnasium to record who was beingdeployed     andwhere to.   The

following Sergeants and serials    ofapproximately eight men    in each

were deployed as follows:     (All 'D' Division)

Police Sergeant 2916 - Track

Police Sergeant 1055 - West Stand

Police Sergeant 915 - Track

Police Sergeant 2379 - West Stand

Police Sergeant 916 - 'A' Gate

Police Sergeant 993 - 'A' Gate



I radioed to Control where these officers were being deployed, but I

am unable to say if Control received my messages.    All the above

Officers were deployed at 2.50 pm.    It was obvious from Control that

they required further manpower to the Leppings Lane end.       I do

recall some radio message about the gates being opened and that

people were on the track.   At that stage I got the impression from

the gymnasium that there was a pitch invasion.     I then regrouped *E’

Divison Crime and Vandal from Penistone Road turnstiles, who were a

reserve serial and deployed them through Control to Leppings Lane
track at 3 pm.
Further serials from 'D' Division arrived in the region of 3 pm,
these were deployed as follows:

Police Sergeant 6 90    )     and serial to Leppings Lane track
                        )
Police Sergeant 628     )

Followed by Police Sergeant 1379,Police Sergeant       593, Police

Sergeant 7, Police Sergeant 1415       and a number of 'D'   Division Police

Constables to the track.       Some few minutes later, I saw Chief

Superintendent Nesbit, who I think came into the ground from

Penistone Road end.     I spoke to him and he went onto the track.       At

this stage which was now approximately 3.10pmas I recall, it just

still seemed as though there had       been trouble at the Leppings Lane

end and that there had been a pitch invasion.



I then went down onto the track between the North Stand and the kop.

There were a lot of Officers in front of the Leppings Lane terraces

and obviously a number of fans in front of them.        The Nottingham

Forest fans on the kop were chanting and I got the impression at

that stage that a large number of fans were going onto the pitch at

Leppings Lane end and that there was going to be severe public

disorder.   At that stage I feared that fans may get to the Police

room and attempt to release the prisoners.       At this stage also I

could hear over the radio that fans were trapped at the Leppings

Lane end and that medical care was required. Ambulancemen were

arriving and I assisted with getting medical care and ambulances

down on to the track.       The crowd was continually hostile and I was

aware of about 10 to 12 Police dogs and handlers being on standby

near to the rear of the kop/North Stand entrance.        Then a number of

injured and dead were brought from the track up to the kop/North

Stand exit on stretchers and hoarding boards.
                                                                                           (13)



 At first it seemed as if there were just a few, six or so, dead or

 injured and then people came running off the track with dozens.                             At

 this stage which was probably about 3.20 pm, Superintendent Bates,

 arrived, he came into the gymnasium with me, the tables and chairs

 for the meals were cleared and bodies were placed on the floor in the

 gymnasium.      Injured people were taken to the far end of the

 gymnasium.      Many Police officers were bewildered and some were

 crying.     As bodies were being placed on the floor, friends were

with some and they were hysterical.                  Two Liverpool males, one with a

dark moustache was drunk and shouting at the Police, he was

restrained by Detective Sergeant Smith and another CID officer.                              He

was wanting to fight and was obviously in drink and shock.                           The

bodies kept being brought in fast and I was asking Control for a

doctor to ensure that they were dead.                  There was nothing to suggest

t h a t any o f t h e b o d i e s w ere a l i v e , but I was c o n s c i o u s t h e y had not

been certified as dead.            The bodies were covered with the table

cloths     previously laid out for the meals.                 A doctor with a beard

attended after about 30 minutes and certified the dead.                          I recall

Detective Superintendent McKay being inthe gymnasium and arrangements

were getting in hand for the bodies to be numbered and an officer

allocated to each of them.                Outside the gymnasium there were

numerous bodies and injured people lying on the ground near to the

cell buses.       St John Ambulance personnel, Police Officers and

civilians were in attendance.              There were about six young St John's

personnel who were all under 14 or 15 years of age, who were very

distressed near to the Police room.                 I got these sat in the cab part

of a cell bus and a Policeman from 'B2' was detailed to look after
them.
I remained in the vicinity of the gymnasium for the next hour or so.

Inspector Charles was detailed to start making records of the bodies

and several CID officers came to assist.



About 4.30 pm I saw Chief Inspector Beal and together we grouped all

the remaining officers who were not involved with bodies or other

duties together in the North Stand.     A short de-brief took place

telling Sergeants to hand their de-brief sheets in at that location

before being stood down by Control from the ground.      Arrangements

were made via message switch for a message to be relayed to all

Police Stations and over local radio that no Police officers      had

been injured in the incident.



About 4.30 pm I saw Chief Superintendent Mole in uniform at the ground,

he then took control   of events.   Many officers throughout the next 12

hours or so expressed comment that it was reassuring to see Chief

Superintendent Mole.



About 6 pm I returned to the gymnasium and assisted with supervision
of the casualty bureau forms.



Throughout the evening I was involved with liaising with the

relatives and social workers and arrangements for extra telephones

to be placed in the gymnasium for the use of relatives.



General liaison of events re busing of relatives from Forbes Road,

Casualty Bureau duties were completed and seeing that the ancillary

admin staff and civilian staff were supervised and accounted for.
                                                                  (15)


 At 5.30 am on Sunday 16 April 1989 I left the gymnasium after

 the last body had been removed and returned to duty at 11 am
 the same day.



The Chief Constable, Colin Moynaham, the Minister for Sport,

Councillor Irvine Patnick, Detective Chief Superintendent

Addis, Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Chief Superintendent Mole,

Professor Usher, Docter Popper and numerous social workers and

clergy attended the gymnasium, this boosted the morale and

efforts of the 150 plus Police Officers involved in the

gymnasium.   Many Police Officers have been in deep shock since

the event and in particular six of my Area Officers who were in

the front line on the track in front of Leppings Lane terraces,

                                                             All
the Police Officers I saw involved in the event, acted in a

professional manner and are a total credit to the South
Yorkshire Police.



When Liverpool attended the semi-final at Hillsborough last

year' a          number of fans were the worse for drink and they

were even urinating on the upper concourse of the North Stand,

instead of bothering to use the toilets.     As such, urine was

running out of the upper concourse, onto the enclosure outside

the Police room and gymnasium.     Contingency plans were in hand

for this match, for Superintendent Murray from Control, to

deploy standby 'D' Division Officers from the gymnasium to deal
with this problem.



In the planning stages, up until the day of the event and up

until 2.45 pm approximately on 15 April 198^ everything was

going to plan and was showing to be a success in every way.
                                                                                              (16)



 Fans supporting Nottingham Forest were in position on the Spion kop

 and South Stand in good time.                 Due to the large number of Liverpool

 fans who were outside the ground at Leppings Lane at 2.45 pm and

 after, together with facts, that some public houses in the Wadsley

area sold more alcohol in two hours that Saturday lunchtime than on

New Years Eve, one can draw ones own conclusions as to whether

Liverpool fans were arriving late, the worse for drink or not.



As I was not at the Leppings Lane end prior to the build up of fans,

I am unable to comment on how or why the disaster happened.



Although I was involved in the supervision of many of the Officers

At     this      time       the     banging         against          g at e      C had       got       worse        and     it was

The      whole        situation             was    c ha o ti c ,     and      the      Police          inside         the       ground

were      completely              overwhelmed.                  it was h o r r i b l e            to   see     all        the    p eo o l e

It was          at    this     time         that     1 heard         someone             say, " O p e n          the       gates,." I

With        this,       everyone          wh o    had     run      through           the    gate       and      :i.nto     t he    ground

A fe w m i n u t e s          after       this     had       happened,           a Constables                outside          the        ground

said,        "The m a j o r i t y         ar e    in    now,       open        the    ga t e s    and      let     the      rest         in

opened         the      gates       this       second        time.         They were             only      opened          about         3 feet

after        two      Police        Officers           had    checked           their       tickets          outside.              I can't

really         describe           the    Officers            as    they        too    were       not     known       to me.              One

wa s     a Police            Constable            and     the       other       a Woman Constable                   who      appeared

After         a    co up l e        of m i n u t e s , a few                 people          walked          out     of     the    ce n t r a l

to     breathe.                I wouid             say      there          was    oruy        about        half      a dozen         wh o      had

come      out at             this        t:i.me a n d           I thought             it wa s         just    a    normal         case      of

barging            people           out       of     the        way    that       had       happened.




One      lad s a i d          to me           that        he     felt      as     if       his    chest       wa s      on fire.            These

people            went       and     sat       by        the     rear       w al l     of     the      Stand.           I d o n 't recall

A minute               or    two     later,              people        oegan          to    stream         out     of     the     tu n n e l     and

they were               s ay i ng ,       “Y o u         better        get       some       help       quick,        there's         a d ea d

body       in there,,"                   At    this         some       Police          Officers            ran     into      the     t un n e l      and

something               was     wrong          so        I opened           the       gate       so    that       the     emergency

At     t h is    the        P o 1 i ce    0 f f i ce r     took      h :i.s    P o 3. i c e    j a ck e t      off       a rsd    put      it    ove r

the     lad* s         head       the     Polireman           put      his         helmet       on      top.         I     c a n ’t     remember

what      the        Policeman            looked         like       but       he    was       very      upset,,




Th e    Fire         Brigade           then a r r iv e d and              I directed                t h em     to    the         West      Stand.

After      this         I ’d j u st           had     e no u gh .      There         were       Ambulancemen                     and Firemen

everywhere.                   I knew          I c o u l d n ’t do a n y t h i n g              m o re     so    I just            went      home,,




I think          that        what        happened          was      the       worst       thing         that        I h a ve       ever         seen

in all          my     life.           I c a n ’t h e l p        thinking            that       w h at       happened             could         have

those      who         h a d n ’t got          tickets        had      stayed            at    home,.          I did          notice        that

quite      a     lot        of    the     late        arrivals         had         been       drinking,             but       I can't           say

It was        the    only way          to    s a ve      life     in t h e r e       at    that       time,

A throng          moved     in,      1 was         pushed       to     the     left.           Then    I ordered              the    gate

cl osed,       although          they may           nave       already         been       closed,

I looked,           or   someone        did,        to    see     if    it wa s        clear      outside.               It was       and

I went        out.       The     horses        were       there.

It    riad a l l e v i a t e d    the       situation           but     people         were      still       trapped           on    that

side       bar,      I pul lea         them        under.        Those        withtickets             were        filed

through        by    horses       to    the        open       gat es,        It wa s       orderly,,              There       appeared

to    be    room     now,        I then        thought          it was         no    longe r      life        threatening             and

the    gates        were    s hut      agai n.

The    surges        were      in two        b urs ts,         the     f ir s t     larger,       the       second        short        but

a steady          f 1o w a n d    c o n t rolled,,

I saw       the     Suae r intendent               on    the     w all       a g a i n . The    people        in         the    fun nel

had    pulled        back      and     it a p p e a r e d        safe.

The    Superintendent                signalled            for     the     centre          gate    perimeter              to    be

oPened„           The    horsemen           di d    this.        It     Ihen       f i l l e d a gai n ,

i was       somewhere          down     the        side       near     the     river       now,

Then,       sometime        after       that,           the    gate     I was        facing       opened           and    i t just

emptied„            That    was      the     gate        on    the     left       when     approaching              the

turnstiles,,             I think        Inspector              Sennet        was     sat       above       it,,

It    seemed        to   empty       then,          I had       not     ordered           that    or       Knew why           it had

happened          but    I f e lt      initial           reli ef       for     those       people.

People       started           to      come        out     this        way,

1974 when I was promoted to the rank of Inspector.
For a period of two years I served as S ta ff O fficer to the then Chief
Constables and during that time had resp o n sib ility fo r the planning of major
events in the form of Royal v i s i t s , in liaison with the Lord Lieutenant o f the
County and had a pa rticu la r respon sibility fo r War Duties.
In 1976 I was promoted to Chief Inspector and posted as Deputy Sub Divisional
Commander to the Sheffield Central Division (D1 Sub D ivision) where I remained
in post until 1979.      During my time in the Sheffield Central Division, I was
responsible for the policin g of football matches at Sheffield United Football
Ground   and for   the    planning and arrangement      of   various marches and
demonstrations associated with normal City l i f e .
In 1979 I again transferred to the Research & Development Department with
particular re sp o n sib ility fo r planning public order training and policy.
In the October of that year I was promoted to Superintendent and appointed as
head o f the newly formed Operations Division.
Almost immediately upon appointment the Steel Strike commenced and I was
responsible for Police operations and planning in connection with that matter.
During that time I had particu lar involvement at the H atfields Steel Works,
which was the scene o f much disorder and heavy pickettin g.
In December 1981, I transferred from the Operations Division and returned to
the Sheffield Central Sub Division as Sub Divisional Commander and again had
some resp o n sib ility fo r football matches and marches and demonstrations in the
City Centre.

In the March of 1982, I took up the post of Detective Superintendent in charge
of the Criminal Investigation Department in the Sheffield North Division.
However, within 3 months I was appointed the Deputy Divisional Commander of
that Division.

I remained as the Deputy Divisional Commander until October 1985 when I was
promoted to      the rank of Chief Superintendent and appointed Divisional
Commander of the Division where I remained until the 27 March 1989, when I was
transferred as Divisional Commander to the Barnsley Division.
During my time in the Sheffield North Division, as Deputy Divisional Commander
and Divisional Commander, I was deeply involved in the planning and command of
operations associated with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and in fact in
1987 was the Officer commanding the       semi final between Coventry City and
Leeds United and in 1988 the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
In addition, in 1984 during the Miners dispute, I was involved in the policing
of picket lin e s in Nottinghamshire, Orgreave, Doncaster and Barnsley and at
times took control of the Force Control Room dealing with the deployment of
personnel to pick ettin g situations.

So far as both the 1987 and 1988 semi fin a ls are concerned, I was d ire c tly
responsible for the planning and liaison with the management of Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club and the Football Association.          On both occasions
negotiations were entered into concerning the allocation of seating areas to
opposing fans and the decision was taken that one team would be allocated the
South Side and the Kop and the other team the North Side and the West Side and
Leppings Lane Terraces.         This decision was based on the geographical location
of the Stadium and was in an effo rt                   to ensure complete segregation of
supporters to prevent confrontation and public disorder.                 Consideration was
given to other methods o f deployment, but on balance i t was f e l t that th is was
the most appropriate separation.
In connection with both the semi fin al in 1987 and 1988, th is policy was
followed and the operations were succesfful.
In 1989 during the week p rio r to Monday 20 March 1989, I was approached by Mr
Graham McKrell the Secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, who
indicated that once again he might be asked to stage the semi fin a l, possibly
between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                 He asked i f I would be able to
confirm that we could Police such an event and I indicated that we would
receive any proposal in a favourable manner should the situation arise.                     I
again indicated that i f we did stage that event, I would ask that the same
segregation procedures were u tilis e d as in previous years and that               Liverpool
would be allocated the North Stand, West Stand and Leppings Lane Terraces and
Nottingham Forest the Kop and South Stand as in the previous year.
On Monday 20 March 1989, I was again contacted by Mr McKrell who confirmed that
he had been asked by the Football Association to stage the semi fin a l between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.           He did say that the Football Association had
asked i f the allocation of seats could be reversed in that they would lik e more
f a c i l i t i e s for Liverpool fans.   I once again pointed out the reasons for the
decision     taken    the   previous      year   and    after   confirmation   of    the ACC
(Operations) Mr W W Jackson, I confirmed that there was no p o s s ib ility of
change and that that was the only manner in which I would be prepared to Police
such an event. Mr McKrell indicated that he would have to take the matter back
to the Football Association before the fin a l decision was reached
I believe i t was la te r that same day that Mr McKrell contacted me and said that
the Football Association had accepted the position and that we would be asked
to Police the semi fin al on the 15 April 1989 and that the tic k e t allocations
would be in accordance with our plans o f the previous year.
As a consequence of th is information I spoke to Superintendent Murray and

Inspector Sewell at Hammerton Road Police Station and at 3pm that day made
arrangements fo r a meeting to be called for Wednesday 22 March 1989 in order
that early planning discussions fo r the event could take place.
Conscious of the fact that I was scheduled to take command of a new Division
on the 27 March 1989, I called upon the proposed new Divisional Commander,
Chief Superintendent D C Duckenfield, to attend that meeting in order that
continuity might remain and he could continue with the planning which would be
in h is domain.      The meeting took place at lOam on 22 March 1989 at Hammerton
Road Police Station and involved a l l in terested p a rties,         including the heads
of Operations and Traffic Division, the Senior Officers who would be involved
in the operation, the Support S ta ff responsible for preparing the Operational
Order and representatives of             -                                  B ritish Rail,
Public Transport and the Highways Authority o f the County Council.
At that meeting i n i t i a l plans were made concerning action to be taken and in
particular consideration was given to the mode of travel of supporters and
representation was made by the B ritish Rail representatives fo r Liverpool to
be brought into the Midland Station in the City Centre and Nottinghamshire to
the Wadsley Bridge Station in the North of Sheffield. Such action would defeat
the segregation plans in that supporters would be crossing each other and I
indicated that th is would not be acceptable and asked the B ritish Rail to
reconsider the matter.           The reasons for th eir request were based upon
management d i f f i c u l t i e s in routing and time scheduling trains.   I t was further
agreed at that meeting that the Operations and Traffic Division would take
resp o n sib ility   for a ll   t r a f f i c matters affecting the   City and that     'D'
                                                                                                .   1

         Division, the Central Division, would be responsible for policing th eir own
         area leaving the match i t s e l f to be the respon sibility of the Divisional
         Commander of the Sheffield North Division.       The meeting closed at 11am and I
         took no further part in the planning meetings concerning th is matter.
         Following upon the meeting I spoke to Superintendent Murray and Inspector
         Sewell concerning the manpower le v e ls used at the previous year's event and
         asked them to examine the position for th is year and to determine i f any
         reductions or increases were appropriate, taking into account our findings the
         previous year.    The findings the previous year indicated that some Officers
^        were under employed and I was conscious of the need not to repeat such a
         situation i f that was the case and i f there were no other factors which might
         d icta te their need for th is future match.       The only other action I took
         concerning th is matter was to maintain lia iso n with Mr McKrell during the next
         few days and in particular to make reference to the need for clear indications
         of tic k e ts by colour coding and appropriate colour coded systems on turnstyles
         to ensure ea sily recognisable access to the Stadium.
         In the knowledge that Mr Duckenfield would be commanding th is event, I
         personally selected the Sector Commanders who would be working to him and as
         in the previous year u tilis e d the system o f using three sectors, those being
^        the Ground, the Liverpool supporters outside the ground and the Nottingham
         supporters outside the ground.     In th is connection I selected Superintendent
         Greenwood as the Ground C ontroller, Superintendent Marshall to be responsible
         for the Liverpool supporters and Superintendent Chapman to be responsible for
         the Nottingham supporters.       All three Officers had a wide experience in
         policing football matches and in fa c t had been Sector Commanders at the semi
         final the previous year.      The only difference was that Mr Marshall and Mr
         Greenwood reversed roles and th is was because Mr Marshall, having been my
         Deputy for some time, had a b e tte r knowledge of the v is itin g supporters end of




                                                - 5   -
the ground, i e Leppings Lane, than Mr Greenwood, who had been away from the
Division for some time a lb e it for many years he had policed matches at
Hillsborough.        In addition.   Superintendent Murray was id en tified as the
Officer in charge of the ground control communications and th is Officer was in
fact the man who regularly took up that position at F irst Division matches
throughout the season.

Prior to my departure from 'F' Division I met with Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield and discussed with him in general the problems on Division.
During that discussion the semi fin al was touched upon and I appraised him of
the s t a f f selected and the fa c t that Mr Murray was examining the manpower
situation.

On the day of the semi fin a l, Saturday 15 April 1989, I had no role to play in
the operation and was p o licin g my own Division a t Barnsley.
At approximately 3.30pm that day I was en route on the Ml motorway from
Barnsley to Sheffield when, on local radio, I heard of d i f f i c u lt ie s at
Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.             The reporter did not seem unduly
concerned and spoke of a delay in the match due to a pitch invasion.                 As my
journey progressed, i t became clear from the radio reports that the incident
was more serious and there was some indication of possible f a t a l i t i e s .     Calls
were being made for doctors to attend at the Stadium and a short time la te r I
heard an appeal for Police Officers to respond to Hammerton Road Police
Station.     I t was approximately 4pm at th is time and I immediately responded to
Hammerton Road Police Station, arriving at approximately 4.20pm.
On arrival, I saw numerous uniformed Police Officers in the Station area,
including Chief Inspector McRobbie.        I immediately went to the Control Room
and contacted Chief Superintendent Duckenfield in the Police Control Room at
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club via the internal telephone system.               I asked
Mr Duckenfield i f I could be o f any assistance to him and he asked i f I could




                                         - 6 -

     deploy uniformed O fficers into the Leppings Lane area on foot and in an e ffo rt
     to calm supporters leaving the ground and show compassion for th eir apparent
     feelings o f d is tr e s s .

     I immediately went to the Canteen at Hammerton Road Police Station with Chief
     Inspector McRobbie and organised units of men in s e r ia ls under the command of
     Sergeants and briefed them as to the information in my possession concerning
     the current situ ation .        I then deployed Units to locations in and around
     Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground and Chief Inspector McRobbie dealt with
     the notation of deployment.             At th is time also present was Superintendent
     Mordew and       a fte r   deployment     I        obtained   transport    and   together   with
     Superintendent       Mordew attended          at    Sheffield   Wednesday Football      Ground,
     approaching from Middlewood Road into Leppings Lane.                      On reaching Parkside
    Road I saw that Leppings Lane was heavily congested by football supporters and
    a large number of f i r e engines.             I alighted from the car and began on foot
    towards the Stadium and there met Chief Inspector Waring.                   The crowd was dense
    and I would generally describe the a ttitu d e of supporters as h o stile towards
    the Police.

    I spoke b r ie fly to Chief Inspector Waring and he confirmed that he had l i t t l e
    or no d i f f i c u lt y at that location and the crowds were gradually dispersing.


    Together with Superintendent Mordew, I then turned into the private road

    lead- ny t 0 the back o f the South Stand and on entering that area through the
    gates I saw an area of sheeted r a i l s adjacent to the riverside and noted a
    number of bodies laid out in that location.                    I was approached by Detective
    Inspector Webster who informed me in fact that there were eleven bodies at
    that location and he further informed me that there were a further 74 in the
    Gymnasium.

    Prior to th is point the magnitude o f the situation had not been known to me and




                                                   - 7 -
I immediately made my way through 'C' Gate into the West Stand enclosure and
into the Police Control Room where, on arrival, I found Assistant Chief
Constable    (Operations)    Mr   Jackson,     Chief   Superintendent   Duckenfield,
Superintendent Marshall, Superintendent Murray,           Police Sergeant Goddard,
Police Constable Ryan and Police Constale Bishard. At th is point I noted that
the ground was r e la tiv e ly empty, with the exception of a few supporters in and
around the Leppings Lane end. Press in the Press Box and o f f ic ia ls on the
playing area.

I noted that messages were being received on the radio and were being dealt
with by the Control Sergeant and PC and in general they related to outbreaks
of disorder and sporadic fighting in and around the Stadium. My attention was
p a rticu la rly drawn to Superintendent Marshall and Superintendent Murray, who
both seemed to be extremely d istr e sse d .     ACC Mr Jackson was attempting to
speak to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Marshall and at
seme point a telephone c a ll was received and was answered by Mr Jackson. From
the nature of the conversation, I formed the opinion that i t was a call from
the Chief Constable.        Mr Jackson was attempting to ask questions of Mr
Duckenfield and Mr Marshall and rela te them down the telephone.        I remained in
the Control Room and listen ed to what was taking place through the messages
and noted that the main communications handset was not being u tilise d , but
that personal radios were being used on talk-through f a c i l i t y . At about 5.15pm
Mr Jackson indicated he was to go to Headquarters with Mr Duckenfield and Mr
Marshall    and informed me that he had made arrangements for Det Chief
Superintendent Addis to deal with mortuary arrangements in the Gymnasium and
had given certain in stru ction s to Chief Superintendent Nesbit concerning the
welfare of Officers and th eir stand-down arrangements. He asked that I remain
at the Ground with a view to fin a lisin g any outstanding matters and to
eventually close down the operation.      Throughout th is time we were v is ite d by
Fire and Ambulance Senior Officers and I recall Mr Don Page, the Chief
Ambulance O fficer, and Mr Harry Wright the Chief Fire Officer, both calling at
the Control Box.

I noticed that a Fire Officer was in fa ct standing at the top of the steps
leading to the Control Room overseeing the Leppings Lane Terraces. Mr Jackson
and Mr Duckenfield and Mr Marshall                  then l e f t   the Control Room and I
immediately asked for an update from the Sector Commanders in the form of
Superintendent Chapman at the Nottingham side of the Stadium and Chief
Inspector Waring at the Leppings Lane area of the Stadium.                I t was clear that
there _was some disorder and no doubt as a consequence of the attitu de of
supporters and I instructed that a ll personnel remain on duty and that the
mobile units, named Tango Units, remain ready and available.
Responses were given to numerous incidents o f fighting, but in the fullness of
time calm was restored.

I recall that train s had l e f t the area, as had coaches which were released from
th e ir coach parks and whilst I have no real recollection o f time, I recall that
when the situ ation was calm I made my way to the Gymnasium, leaving Sergeant
Goddard in the Control Room and there examined the temporary Mortuary
f a c i l i t i e s accommodating some 85 bodies.      There was some natural confusion,
but in general things were in order and Detective Chief Superintendent Addis
was controlling the Mortuary aspect.         I spoke to a number o f Officers who were
clearly in shock and were distressed by events which they had experienced.                I
noted that the temporary Mortuary was located in the Gymnasium, which was
separated in to three sections, the f i r s t section containing the bodies, the
second section being a r e la tiv e s t e r i l e area where Police Officers were
accommodated and the third section had been set up for iden tifica tio n purposes
and statement taking by CID Officers.         A separate section had been created for
id e n tific a tio n purposes and th is was adjacent to a separate office where
r e la tiv e s could view bodies in r e la tiv e privacy.
I formed the opinion that arrangements were well organised and that temporary
Mortuary f a c i l i t i e s were well in hand.    During th is time I did meet Det
Superintendent McKay and noted that he too was in some way distressed by the
events.
Following the v i s i t to the Gymnasium, I checked the remainder o f the Stadium
and made my way to the Directors area of the Sheffield Wednesday Club situ ate
in the underside of the South Stand, and there saw Graham McKrell the Club
Secretary.        Some members of the s t a f f were clearly distressed and I advised Mr
McKrell regarding counselling f a c i l i t i e s fo r junior members and the need to
ensure that medical f a c i l i t i e s were available.
During these conversations Mr McKrell informed me that he had d e ta ils of the
computer prin t-ou ts regarding turn style figures at 3pm and that he had seized
them and placed them in h is safe (drawer).
Having s a tis f ie d myself that things were in order in the Stadium, I resumed
duty the Control Box and then sought security of the terrace subject o f the
d is a s te r .
Through Superintendent Mordew I arranged for Officers to be deployed to
security o f the centre pens with the intention o f 1) preserving evidence and
2) recovering property subject of those who had been injured or who were
deceased.
I noted that numerous Officers were assembling in the North Stand ready for
debrief and because of th e ir general condition authorised Superintendent
Mordew and Superintendent Brookfield, who had also attended the scene, to
debrief Officers and ensure that Serial Sergeants could confirm that a ll their
O fficers were accounted for and to note th e ir whereabouts during the events.
In addition, some Officers who had responded to Operation Support were in the
lo c a lity and having consulted with 'D' Division, the Central Division o f the
Force, I arranged for two Sergeants and 20 Constables to be organised for
deployment     to   'D' Division   who were suffering some potential disorder
scenes.

Once debrief f a c i l i t i e s had been dealt with, I instructed Superintendent
Mordew to stand down those Officers who were no longer required.
Having yet again assessed the situation in the v ic in ity of the ground, I
instructed that Tango Units, the mobile units on public order du ties, should
remain on patrol and also l i a i s e with Inspector Hand-Davis, the Mounted
Inspector, that h is Officers should remain on patrol in pa irs in an around the
Ground.

I was informed that r e la tiv e were in the v ic in ity of the Ground with a view to
id e n tific a tio n and was advised that accommodation and planning had been put
into being fo r id en tifica tio n o f the deceased.
Having experienced the s tr e s s placed upon Officers and fam ilies in and around
the temporary mortuary, I was conscious of the considerable s tr e s s placed upon
O fficers and arranged for the Force Welfare Officer, Mrs                      Ito be
called out fo r counselling reasons.

I was conscious of the fa c t that social workers and members of the Church and
Salvation Army had been requested to attend at the scene to a s s is t with the
counselling o f re la tiv e s.
I was of the opinion that there would be some considerable delay in the
id e n tific a tio n of bodies and in the retention on duty o f Officers who were
allocated to each body for iden tification purposes.      In view of th is, I caused
feeding arrangements to be put in hand for those O fficers who were to be
retained, pending id en tifica tio n of individual deceased persons.
At approximately 9.30pm the Chief Constable, Mr Peter Wright, attended at the
scene and I met him and toured the area of the d isa ste r with him.           I was
informed that at approximately 10.15pm that night Mr Colin Monaghan, the




                                       - 11 -
.. . €



         Minister of State for Sport, was scheduled to arrive by helicopter at the
         Stadium and arrangements were being made fo r him to be met.
         My recollection      is   that at approximately 10.30pm the Minister arrived,
         accompanied by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.              Together with the Chief
         Constable and other O fficers, I showed Mr Monaghan the scene and described to
         him the f a c i l i t i e s at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.
         Shortly a fte r th is, an impromptu press conference took place on the pitch with
         te le v isio n and other media representatives and Mr Moynaghan was then taken to
         the Gymnasium where he spoke to Officers           concerning th eir involvement in the
         day's events.     He la te r l e f t the scene.

         At approximately midnight the s t a f f of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
         departed from the Stadium and I arranged fo r security of the Gymnasium area to
         protect the temporary Mortuary f a c i l i t i e s .   Arrangements were made for the
         reception of re la tiv e s for id e n tifica tio n purposes and social workers and
         members of the Church were briefed to expect r e la tiv e s attending in distressed
         situ ation s.    These representatives were readily available throughout the
         night and in fa ct met numerous r e la tiv e s and remained with them throughout the
         id en tific a tio n procedures.
         I remained in the v ic in ity of the Gymnasium throughout the night and was
         present through many id en tific a tio n s of deceased persons and noted many
         extremely harrowing situ ation s regarding grieving re la tiv e s and the e ffe c ts
         upon Police involved.         Throughout these procedures Inspector John Charles,
         Detective Policewoman                      Police Constable Jean Shelton, maintained
         records of the deceased persons and lia ise d constantly with Superintendent
         Torr in charge of the casualty bureau arrangements.
         Throughout these events I noted that the Ambulance Liaison O fficer was present
         in the temporary Mortuary and at one stage I asked i f he could increase the
         number of mobile stretchers available to speed up the id en tifica tio n process.

      The Ambulance Liaison Officer was most helpful in th is connection and was
      extremely professional in h is d u ties . The process of id e n tific a tio n continued
      until approximately 5am, when arrangements were made fo r the remainder of the
      bodies to be removed to the City Mortuary where the process would be continued
      la te r in the day.

      During the course o f events during the evening, the Coroner, Mr Stefan Popper,
      attended the scene together with Professor Alan Usher,              who both viewed
      arrangements and confirmed the location of bodies at the Sheffield City
      Mortuary.

      At approximately 5.30am I l e f t the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and
      returned to Hammerton Road Police Station, where I confirmed that a ll Officers
      involved in the operation other than those connected with the deceased
      persons, had been stood down and were accounted for.
      I re tire d from duty at approximately 6am and resumed duty at 8am that same day
      at Police Headquarters.
      I wish to place on record my considerable appreciation o f the e ff o r ts of a ll
      individuals involved in th is matter, and in particu lar the e ffo r ts of the
      Officers involved in dealing with the traumatic events of dealing with
      iden tification of fam ilies of deceased persons, the Social Services and Church
      representatives       and   the   Ambulance Service   who maintained      a presence
      throughout the night.
      I am sa tis fie d that every effo rt was made to project the professionalism of
      a ll the Emergency Services and from my experiences have no reservation in
      confirming th e ir dedication to service to the Community.

      I recall In general terms, a discussion concerning those gates

      and can say that at no time did the police agree to steward the

      g a t e s or p er m a n en tly man them.
      The police accepted that they would exercise control and this

      referred to control for segregation purposes.

       In brief, because of the nature of the terraces, it was often

       necessary to only utilize certain areas for away and home

       supporters and to this end, some areas had to be sealed off to

       ensure segregation.                 In this connection, keys were in the

        possession of the police, who determined which pens were to be

        utilized and either locked or opened and fastened back gates to

        n e c e ss ita te segregation .
        At no time did we agree to permanently man those gates, our role

        being one of the maintainance of public order through

         o b s e r v a t i o n and s e g r e g a t i o n o f o p p o s in g f a n s .
Brian Leonard MOLE
Chief Superintendent
South Yorkshire Police



I am the divisional commander of the Barnsley Division of the
South Yorkshire Police.

In .1987 I was the divisional commander of the Sheffieldo
North Division,     Division and as such had responsibility for
policing the Sheffield Wednesday football ground.

On Sunday 12th April, 1987 I was in overall command of the
policing arrangements for the FA semi final between Leeds
United and Coventstyy City football clubs which was staged
at the Sheffield Wednesday ground.

I can say that whilst officers were briefed to be aware of the
possibility of none ticket holders attending the game and
that checks should be made to identify them and turn them away,
there were no specific plans to place cordons on Leppings
Lane in the form of barriers and I did not give any instruction
to that effect.  I have no knowledge of any such cordons
being introduced and in fact I would see difficulty in the
introductions of such cordons, even on the footpath, as
vehicular traffic is generally allowed to pass along Leppings
Lane and any attempt to filter pedestrians on the footpath
would be likely to cause danger in that they may step into
the roadway into the path of vehicular traffic.

To myknowledge the only barriers in Leppings Lane were those
that were situate at the various junctions along that road
and which were utilised to restrict access to residents only
in those roads. This is the normal practice and the only
time I would expect to have seen barriers across the footpath
would be when residents vehicles were being allowed to drive
from Leppings Lane into their respective roads.

Whilsat   I cannot account for individual initiative on the
part of   officers manning those barriers I can say that it
was not   my policy to filter supporters by utilising barriers
accross   the footpath.

              address        since       about        1 95 5     ( 0 0 0055).



              I h av e      been     employed          as a T u r n s t i l e        Operator           at S h e f f i e l d     W e d n e s d a y ’s

              Liverpool           and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.                 I was     engaged          on    turnstile           number

              which      was      for L i v e r p o o l        fans    to    go    into     t he    North Stand.                 The

              turnstile           is m a n u a l l y     operated and when                  a supporter              g oes     through a

              On     that    da y    I got       to    the      ground       at    about     10.13am           (1015)        a n d at     about

              •11.30am       (1130),          I opened          turnstile          number        10 to a l l o w         early arrivals

to    enter       the      ground.            During        the     t i me     I opened         the       turnstile           and     up to

about       2pm    (1400),         there        was      a steady            build      up of        supporters              entering

the    g ro u n d .        After     2pm       ('1400)       the      build       up    of    supporters              increased

dramatically               and    by 2 . 3 0 p m       (1430)         all      I could        see        was    a mass        of    bodies

outside,          pushing         and     shoving.             When       I first        got        to    the    turnstile            and

opened       it    up      there     were       two      policemen             by m y    turnstile              outside         the

ground,        and      two      inside        the     gr o u n d .       After        2.30pm        (1430)        I did        not      see

the    police         officers           as    it was        absolutely             chock-a-block.                    After        2.30pm

(1430)       it was         such     a    crush        outside           the    ground        that        the    Police         t o l d me

to    let    the      supporters              in for        both      the      N o r t h S t a n d an d         the    West        St and ,

and    that       they w o u l d         direct        t h e m as        they     came       t h r o u g h as      it was

impossible            to    send     them       back.



The    situation            got    completely               out     of    hand.         There        were       people        jumping

over    the       turnstile          without           tickets.              What      tickets           people       ha d    I t,ook

and    ga ve      them      part     back.             I would           say    that     a very           la rge      number        of

supporters            got     into       the    ground without                  tickets.             As    s o o n as        the P o l i c e

caught       one      in side,       another           at    least        got     away,       into        the    ground.            Some

of    them were            coming        through        the       turnstile            in two's.           1 was       unable         to

do a n y t h i n g      about      these        p eople,           a n d all        1 could         do was      knock         on    the

window       to    let      the    Police         know.            I have        never       seen        anything            like this

in over                           working         on     the      turnstiles.                People        were       getting

forced       into       the      turnstiles            and     they were            very      distressed              with      the

pushing,          through         people        trying         to     get      into     the     ground.            It s l o w e d        the

flow    of     supporters            who       ha d    tickets,           with      those       who did         not          h ave them,

trying       to    get      in.      T h e y w e r e n ’t          getting          t h r o u g h as fast as             they would

have    had       there       been       an    orderly         queue and            t h e y all          had    tickets.




Two    or    three         minutes        past        three       (1502)/(1503).                a    policeman           t o l d me        to

close       up.       I closed           up a n d      collected my               tickets,           and       left    by     the

             was    not      offered any         money    by a n y o n e     to    let    them    into    the    ground.          It

             was    pointless        anyw a y with what            ha d     happened       after    2.30       pm.    (1430).




             After        I walked     b ac k    towards       the S p i o n K o p       and along       the    front       of   the

             s ta n d ,    I could     see w h a t     wa s    happening          and    I walked    between          the    Spion

             K o p and. the S o u t h S t a n d        and went        to    the    office.        I left       the    g r o u n d at

              I live         at      the a b o v e      address        with my            parents.          I am      employed          by

              Sheffield City                 Council         as     a|                                   [h o w e v e r ,    for    the       last

                                     I have     worked         part-time            as     a Turnstile           Operator          at    the

              Sheffield              Wednesday          Football          stadium.




              On S a t u r d a y          13th April         1989        (130489),             I attended        at    the    s t a d i u m at

               10.20am          (1020).         I went         to     the       p lay ers ’ entrance             and    signed a

               ’S t e w a r d s      S h e e t , ’ to    indicate           that       I was      ready     to     start      work       at       a

              t u r n s tile.



               I stayed within                 the      ground and              I was      joined      by a n o t h e r      turnstile

              o pe rato r ,                                                 We    discussed         the      fact      that    both          of       us

              had        been a p p r o a c h e d       by a t i c k e t         tout      whilst      en    ro ute     to    the       ground.

              The        tout       was   a white        mal e ,     about        3 ’7 “ tall,         with      fairly       short          mousey
                                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                                   Q-1 P A "

brown       hair.         He    wore    b l ue        jeans?       a brown          leather       coat a n d           he    spoke

with     a l.iverpool            accent.          He     ha d a s k e d    if       I wanted          to    bu y      tickets          -for

the    game,        but    when       I told          him    I worked          at    the    stadium,             he    said,

Y o u ’re no good to me then".



Short ly after             that,       I returned             to    the    room w h e r e         we       are     allocated              our

turnstile,           and                    the       supervisor,          shouted          out       my    name       and       said       I

was    on      turnstile         number                at    the    Leppings             Lane    en d      of    the       ground.              I

was    given        a key       to    the    turnstile             and a sheet             of    p a per        with       the

turnstile           number       on    it.        I then went             to    turnstile             nine       which       I have

previously           indicated          on a m a p           of    the    ground.           I arrived              t h e r e at       about

•10. 4 5 a m    (1 045 ) .



About       five     to    ten mi nu t es             later,       the    turnstile             operator           arrived           at

turnstile           ten which          is    facing          mine.        X d o n ’t k n o w          his       name,       but      he     is

an    e l d e r l y man.         At    that       time       there       were       no    fans    waiting             to    enter         the

stadium        so    I d i d n ’t o p e n         the       turnstile.




The    operator           at    turnstile             te n a n d    I both          opened       the       g a t e s to      our

turnstile           at    about       11am       to    11.15am          (1100)       (1115).            It wa s m y              j o b to

take     tickets          for    the    North Stand                which       is    all        seating.           However, a

letter               is    screwed          to    the       outside       of    turnstile                  to    indicate            to

fans     that       that       turnstile          was       for    use    by    persons          entering             the    West

Stand.          I sent         a message          to                and    he       said    t h at                     the

supervisor           of    the       ground       staff,          had    overlooked             it.        In o t h e r      w or d s ,

the    lettering           should       h av e        been    changed.              Portable          barriers             were

erected         on the         inside       of    the       ground       outside          number        9 and         10 t u r n s t i l e s

to    channel        people          towards          the N o r t h      Stand.           This    omission             meant         that

at    first      people         with    tickets             for    the    West       Stand       were       trying          to     e nt e r

through        my    turnstile.              After          I had       pointed          it out,        the      Police          outside
                                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                                  S1287

were    used       to     direct       the       various        fans         to    the      correct          turnstiles.

Without         th i s    directing          by the         p o lice?         the      fa n s     would          still     believe          my

turnstile          wa s    for    the W e s t          Stand       because           the     le t t e r                remained        on

the w a l l      outside.



The    only      tickets         which       I should           have         been      taking          were       an    orange      in

colour       indicating           t h at     the       bearer       ha d      reserved            a s ea t        in the       North

Stand.          I should also              add     that      there         were        Stewards             at    the     portable

barriers         n e xt    to m y      turnstile           directing               people         to    the       North Stand.




We    were      very      quiet       u nt i l    about      2 . '15pm        ( "1415) .          By    that       time        I had

taken     only      120 t i c k e t s .           Up    unti l      that          t i me    four       or    five       people      had

approached          me a n d      o f f e r e d me        various            amounts         of m o n e y         up    to £10,        in

order     to     let      them    through          the     turnstile               without           a ticket.            I refused

each    time       saying,        "It      is m o r e       than      my      job's         worth".




All    t h is    time      I c o u l d se e        Police          officers,               both      inside        and     outside

of the       ground,        outside          my    turnstile.                 They         were      searching            fans    and

everything          wa s    generally             good     humoured.                 The     fans       were       laughing         with

the    Police       and with           us as       they      came        through            the      turnstiles.




T h e n at a b o u t       2.15pm        (1415),          the      big       rush      started.              It    seemed        that

from    virtually           no    one      seeking         admission,                a h ug e        crowd appeared.                   My

vision was           l im i t e d ,    but       I could        see      a    Police         Officer             being     pushed

hard against              the    turnstile             wa ll s ,



The    situation           seemed        out      of    control          at       t ha t    s t ag e    and       people       were

squeezing          in     twos    into       the       turnstiles.                  I had       to     let       them     through         by

operating          the     foot       pedal,       in o r d e r       to a l l o w          the      turnstile            to   revolve,

If    I hadn't           done    so,     I fear         that       people          would        have        been       c r u s h e d at
                                                                                                                                      PAGE           4

that     stage.



The     mood    of      the    crowd        had    c ha n g e d .            Quite       a fe w     coming           t h r o u g h my

turnstile          were       drunk        and most           were       abusive          to me,         to     the P o l i c e        and

to     themselves.




At     some    time,       I would          sa y at a b o u t            2.40pm          (1440),         a Liverpool               fa n     s a id

to me,        "You'd       better          get    this        Policewoman                inside,         s h e ’s g e t t i n g

squashed against                 the       wall".         On e       of       the    policeman            i n s i d e the        ground

obviously          heard       this,        because           he     l e a nt       over     my t u r n s t i l e a n d          pulled

her     into    the      ground.            She    looked            very          pale    and shocked.




The    s i t u a t i o n at      that       time       wa s    out       of    hand       and      dozens          of f a n s    were

just     jumping         over       turnstiles            9 and          10,       in o r d e r     to    get        in.      Also         once

anyone        entered         the     turnstile,              whether          or    not      he    had a ticket,                  t h er e

was     no w a y     for      him     to    go    o th e r     than          into     the     ground,           so    I let        them

in.    Th e    Police         were      s till     inside           the       ground         outside          my     turnstile,             but

they were          trying        to     c on t r o l    the        drunks          who    had      been a l l o w e d           in.




This     went      on    until, a b o u t         five        past       3    (1503),         when       I heard a            big      roar

from     the    crowd.           A Policeman              inside             the    ground         then       told      me    to      shut

t he    turnstile          do o r s .       There       were        o n l y a fe w           people       outside            trying         to

get     in,    but      I was       able     to    close           the       turnstile.




I started          to    c o unt      the    stubs        of th e            tickets         and    I c o u n t e d 532.               I

would     estimate            that      about      20     people             without         tickets          ha d a l s o       entered

t h r o u g h my     turnstile.




1 then waited              for      a steward           to     come          and    r ea d    the     number          on     the      counter

every          person        entering                through          the     turnstile.                At     that        stage        I was

unaware           of w h a t          was       happening             in the        ground.              Once       the     number        had      been

recorded,              I padlocked                   my    turnstile          and        l o c k e d m y door,



I could           see a n u m b e r              of L i v e r p o o l         supporters                sitting          against         the wall

of m y         t u rn s t i l e , but            inside          the    stadium,              they       looked          very     shocked,            I

then went              to    the       back          of    the N o r t h S t a n d a n d                then      o nt o    the     perimeter

of    the       pitch,            I    could           see      the    game       had     been          stopped          and a Steward

shouting            to me,            "Get       into        the m i d d l e        of    the       pitch and              help."         I d i d n ’t

know what              was    happening.                     All      I could          see w e r e        people           being        carried

on s t r e t c h e r s        and masses                   of    people        on the          pitch.




I put m y          bag       of       tickets             in m y      coat a n d         ran       onto       the    pitch.             I ran

towards           the       West       Stand           and      I saw a group                 of    fans       and Police               lift a       lad

in his          early 20*s                 o n to      a stretcher.                 He w o r e          jeans       and a        denim        jacket

and       he    ha d    longish             fair          hair.        Hi s    face       was       a    purple          c ol o u r .     I

helped          lift        him       onto       a     poster         board       that        had       been      ripped         down.         About

6    of    us     then       carried             him       on the       board,           to a n a r e a           just      outside           of   the

G ym.          I believe              he w a s         dead      from       the     look       of       him.        We     carried        him      from

a    point        in f r o n t         of       the       goalmouth,           but       at    the       e dg e     of     the    penalty          box.




I then          ran     back          onto       the       pitch and assi s t e d a                      lad w i t h        leg     injuries

until          firemen and ambulancemen                                helped          him.         I then went               down       the

p l a y e r s ’ tunnel                to     return          the      stubs       of     the       tickets          to R o g e r ,       the

supervisor.                  I told             hi m      that     people         ha d    jumped          the       turnstile.               He    told

me    not       to w o r r y a b o u t               it as       there        had      been a           lot    doing        it    that

afternoon.                  Then       as       I was        about      to     lea v e        Doug       LOC K ,     the      Chief       Security

dressing           room,          as       he w a s        having       problems,              mostly          from        the    press and

the       odd     supporters                who        got      into    the       foyer.            I later          returned            home,

                 after     attempting     to    comfort       Liverpool     supporters.        It w a s   about   5pm

                 (•1700)    when   I left      the   gr o u n d .

                 offered money       by L i v e r p o o l    supporters.      At   no   time    did   I accept      any.

                stationed            at       Woodseats.

                On Saturday               1 3t h A p r i l       1989     ( 1 5 04 8 9 ) ,      I commenced           d u t y at     Woodseats

                Police        S t a t i o n at        0845       hrs.      I then          travelled           to H i l l s b o r o u g h

                Football            Ground where             I wa s       posted        to      turnstiles          one    to    eight       at    the

                Leppings            Lane       end.        I was       in s e r i a l      11 a n d m y        duty was         to   supervise

                entry        of L i v e r p o o l      fa n s     to    the N o r t h S t a n d .            At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1300

                hrs        I heard        a    radio       message        directing             all     officers       onto      the

                 p i t c h at       the       Leppings       Lane       End.          I immediately went                   to    the    pitch       via

                t he   S outh Stand.                  There       were     no    players           on    the    pitch      but       I saw a

                number        of P o l i c e         Officers          against        the       fence       facing      the L e p p i n g s       Lane

                terrace.             I. ran o v e r         to    the w i r e      fencing            and    I saw     two      young       girls    on

                the        terrace        but    pressed          hard against               the      fence.        They were          in the

                centre        stand           part    of    the    terrace         between            gates     3 a n d 4.
                                                                                                                                     PAGE          ;
                                                                                                                                     S2390

The    girls       were        white         and       both about              19 or 20 y e a r s             of a g e .        Thats

all    I can        remember            about         them    but     I have           since      learned           their       names        are

Debbie       ROUTLEDGE              and Lisa RIDING.

I went       to     the       girls      and was            able     to    feel        th a t    they     both       had a       p ulse       in

their       carotid artery.

I climbed           up    the       fence        to     tr y a n d    pull       the      girls         out    and also          to    get

the    crowd around                 them      to m o v e      back.            I shouted          to     the     crowd      to m o v e

back       but    1 heard           cries        of     "Fu c k    o f f ” as a          r e su l t .     1 then        climbed             back

down and          tried        to      revive         the    girls        through         the     fence        by s l a p p i n g      their

fac e s .

As    I was       doing        that      someone            climbed        over        the      fence     from       the    terrace           in

order       to    escape         the     crush and            jumped           down     on to p    of me.            All    I        can

remember          was     a figure             falling            towards        me     and hitting             me    on    the head.

I cannot          describe             the     figure        but     I wa s       knocked          u n c o n s c i o u s a n d came

round       on    the      pitch        in     the       recovery         position.               I d o n ’t k n o w        who carried

me    on    to    the     pitch.

I got       up a n d          went      b ac k     to     the f e n c e    but the two g i r l s               were        no    lon g e r

against          the     fen c e .

I then went              to    gate      3    in the         fencing           which       I saw was           open.        This       gate

led    into       pen 3.            Also      at      the    gate was Chief                  Superintendent                John NESBIT

a n d a m i d d l e a g e d St J o h n s               Ambulance           man.

I saw a young                 white      man about             2 2 yr s of            ag e l y ing a c r o s s       the b o t t o m

of    the    gate        apparently              trapped          by his        legs.           I think        he w o r e       an

anorak,          I d o n ’t k n o w w h a t             colour.           Someone         wa s    l y ing      across       the       young

mans       legs     and       t h is    prevented anyone                   getting           through          the    gate.           I c a n ’t

the    gateway.               Together         with an            unknown Nottingham Police                           Officer           I

        so PC J A C K S O N          and      the    Nottingham             PC    took       hi m    to     the    gymnasium.

        I. t u r n e d    to    return         to    the       fence      and     I saw        some       Liverpool           lads     crowded

        round another                youth      lying          on the       ground.            I can        remember          nothing       about

        him    other          than    he w a s       white       and about             18 y e a r s       of age.        He      looked        dead

        and    I c o u l d n ’t f i n d a            pulse.          I grabbed              another         P.C.     I d o n ’t k n o w who

        it was,          and    together            with       two   Liverpool              f a n s we      carried       the       youth      on

        a    piece       of    hoarding,            to    the    gymnasium.                 I c a n ’t d e s c r i b e        the     hoarding

        or    the    two L i v e r p o o l          fans.       We   placed           the    body      on    the     flo o r ,      I c a n ’t

        I wa s      then       told     to     keep       unauthorised                people         out    of the     gymnasium          so     I

        did    not       return       onto      the       pitch.          At     that       t i m e I wa s        working with Police

        After       about       twenty minutes                  I began          to    feel      dizzy and           1 was       unsteady           on

                   On Saturday               15th April,            1989      (150489),        I commenced         d u t y at W o o d s e a t s

                   Police        Station          at   8.45       am    (0845).         1 then       travelled      to

                   Following             briefing        at    the      ground     in    company with          DC * s                  ________

                   Stand.             I was      in S e r i a l     11 a n d     regular       visits      were    made       by our      Serial

                   Sergeant            PSH279       EDWARDS         (El)     and also         1 Inspector         a n d S upt.

                   GREENWOOD.

                   The       f a ns     coming      through         the      turnstiles        were    good    humoured           at   this

                   point        and      obviously         looking           forward     to    the    match.       About       2.00     pm

                    (1400)       a steward             came    to      the    turnstiles        and    said    that      someone        had

                   put       the w r o n g       boards       above       the    turnstile       entrance         and    t ha t    fans      with

                   North Stand               tickets      were         going     into    the    enclosure         for    the W e s t      Stand.
                                                                                                                                           PAGE   S
                                                                                                                                           S2390A

He    then       opened         the       l a rg e    dividing          g at e      and moved             a small             barrier           so

that    there         were        two m o r e         turnstiles             for       the     North Stand                   now    I— 10 a n d

two    less       -for the           West        Stand.

Some    time         after        this       it w a s       obvious          that       there           was    a    l a rge        crowd        of

fans    building             up o u t s i d e         the       turnstiles.               Fans          were       coming          through           the

turnstiles            without             tickets.              I saw       one     fan who             wanted          to    pay     to    enter.

He w a s     told       to      go     back       out,      but wa s         unable           to    due       to    the       crush        of

people       behind          him.           He w a s       allowed          to    enter        after          paying          money        to    the

steward.             There       was        no    other         alternative             but        to a l l o w         this       youth        in.

It w o u l d      ha v e     been         impossible             to    eject        th i s     youth.              If    he    ha d      been

taken       to    the P o l i c e           room      it w o u l d      have        seriously             depleted             the m a n p o w e r

at    the    turnstiles                and       it w a s       also    impossible                 to    open Gate             A and        e j ec t

h i m as     the      crush          of     people         outside          would       have        rushed          i n side.

People       coming          in w e r e          very      distressed and                 saying          that          something           ha d      to

be    done       about       the       crush         outside.           Decent          middle           aged and             young        fans

were    screaming               at     me    sayings            " I t ’s f u c k i n g        murder          out       there".          "Open

them    fucking            gates          or y o u ' r e        going       to    be    held        responsible                for       their

deaths".          " I t ’s y o u r          fault       if a n y b o d y         d i es " .    "You're             killing          them        out

the re".

At    this       time      I saw          beer       cans a n d        empty        bottles             being       kicked          through

the    turnstiles               including             an    empty       bottle          of M o e t        &    Chandon.               Attempts

were    being made                to      open Gate             A from       the       outside.               People          were       climbing

These       fa n s    were       not        stopping            to    complain          of     the       crush          taut m e r e l y        to

get    into       the      ground.               It wa s        a very       tense        situation.                    Nothing          could        be

done    to       stop      the       fans        climbing            over    the       walls.            It a p p e a r e d         to me        that

the    only way            to    prevent             people          getting        crushed             outside          in L e p p i n g s          Lane

was    to    open       the       large          concertina            gates.

case    the       gates       were     either         opened         by     the P o l i c e          or    forced           open        by the

fans™        I did       not    see       the    gates        opened           but       saw    streams             of    fans      running

in.

Whilst       some       fans    were        s t ill     coming        in,        I heard a            rad i o m e s s a g e

directing          all       Officers        onto       the      p i t c h at        the L e p p i n g s            Lane       end.

Along       with       other    Officers           I ran a c r o s s             the      rear       of    the        enclosure           at

the    back       of    the    West       Stand.         I d id       not        see a n y          problems             in the         centre

entrance          to    the    terraces.              I entered             the      South          stand       through            the    gate

below       the    Police       control          room a n d          stepped             over       the wall             from      the    stand

onto    the       pitch.

I did       not    see a n y        players        on    the      pitch.             I    saw a number                   of O f f i c e r s    up

against       the       fence       at L e p p i n g s      Lane.           I ran o ve r             and       sa w      two y o u n g

girls who were at the front of the crush and pressed up against the

fen c e .     These          girls     were      in the C e n t r e              Stand         part       of    the       terraces

between       gates          3 and     4.       I immediately went                        to    these          girls        a n d was      able

to    feel    that       they       both     had a       p u lse      in t h e i r            carotid artery.                      I climbed

up    the    fence       to    try and          pul 1 the         girls          out a n d          get    the        crowd

to m o v e    back.           I heard        cri e s     of      " F uc k      off"       at    this.           1 went            back    down

and again          tried       to     revive       the      girls         through             the    fence          by    slapping

their       faces.

At    this    p o int        someone        climbed         o ve r    the        fence         to    escape           the      crush and

jumped       down       on t o p     of me.           I wa s      knocked            unconscious                and       came      r o u n d on

the    pitch       in the       recovery           position.                I immediately went                           b ac k    to    the

fence       but    could       not     see      the     two      girls         anywhere.

I went       to    gate       3 which        was      open and            saw a y o u n g            man       laid       on      the    ground

and    he a p p e a r e d      to    be     trapped         by his          legs         as    someone          e l se      w as    laid

across       his       legs.        It w a s     impossible               to     get      anyone          el s e      through           this

gate    without          first       removing           t h is    young          man.          Chief       Superintendent                  John

NESB IT and            I pulled        t hi s    man     from        the       gate.           With       a Notts           Policeman

I ran o n t o          the    pitch with           t hi s     man.          He    did         not    have       a     pulse        so we

immediately             started          mouth       to m o u t h a n d          cardiac           massage.            We    were

joined       by PC          Tommy JACKSON                (K 1 ) w h o      took       over     m o u t h to m o u t h .           We       kept

this    up for          quite        a     while         a n d the        young       man     started vomiting.                   Then           PC

JACKSON       and       the     Notts         PC    took, this            man     round       to    the    gymnasium.

With    another             Officer,          and    some          Liverpool          fans,        I c a r ried a fan who

appeared          to    be     dead,       round         to    the    gymnasium.               We    entered           the       gym

through       the       rear        door      and    placed          the       body    on     the    fl o o r .        The       other

officer       stayed with                   the     body. (Mo         description               remembered).                 I    then

made    my w a y        towards          the       door.

At    the    door       I was        told      to    keep          people       out    of     the    gym,       direct           Officers

with    dead and             injured          to    different             par t s     of    the     gym and          to     tell       a

Police       Officer           to    stay with            each       body.           I wa s    also       arranging

ambulances             to    carry       the       badly       injured          to H o s p i t a l s      at    the       request           of

an    unknown Doctor.

After       about       twenty minutes                   1 began          to    go    dizzy and           became          unsteady           on

my    feet.        I was        sat      down       by P S P e t e         GL05S0P          and     then       seen       by a d o c t o r

who    said       I appeared             to    be    concussed.                 He    o r d e r e d me     to     be      taken        to

Hospital.




                            Rather       than wait             to    be    returned           to H i l l s b o r o u g h         or

led    by    Inspector              YOUNG      (D1>.           I was       dealing          with     enquiries              by    the

Hospital          S ta f f ,    Social         Workers             and answering              telephone           c a l ls       from

members       of       the     public         trying          to    trace       relations.             I remained                at    the

Hospital          u n til      r e l i e v e d at 9 . 1 0 a m             (0910)       and     finished           d u t y at

Woodseats          at       10.00 am          (1000)          Sunday       morning.

There       had     been       breaks         in    r adio         transmissions              whilst       the       c r u s h was

             Some      days    after       the     incident         I saw    the   Daily Express           Newspaper        and       saw

             that      the    two    girls       I tried       to      help were     alive.       These       girls      were

             called Debbie               ROUTLEDGE        and Lisa         RIDING.       They    told    the    Newspaper            that

             the P o l i c e       had    not    helped      them       in a n y way.      I had       in f a ct   tried        to    get

             them      out    of    the    crowd.

             In my      opinion          the    s i t u a t i o n at    Leppings     L.ane was     very       dangerous         and

             the    only action            available         at     that    time   was    to    open    the    lar g e

             concertina            gates.

                I have       already           been    seen      by the      West     Midlands          Police       and    filled      in a

                I have       been asked             a specific         p o int     about        the    turnstiles          registering

               more        than    one       observation.

               From        time    to     time,       and     I d o n ’t r e m e m b e r     any      specific       incident,        but

             operators        do    report          faults.         These        ar e   either       A)        Turnstiles              jam a n d

             they     have    trouble          letting         in the       customers          or B)           Th e    turnstile           may

             run    f r ee   and    register          more       than     one,      when    in f a c t         only     one       person      has

             entered.         These       complaints             are      very    infrequent,             if    I was        to    quantify

             it m a y b e    twice a season.                  I am        certain       that      on o c c a s i o n s       these       faults

             rnay w e l l    be    due    to    the       fact    that      the     operator         keeps        his       foot       down   for

             t oo    long.

             The     normal       procedure          after       such a      report        would       be      for     me    to    let     the

             ground       staff     know       of    the    problem.             There     ar e    no w r i t t e n         records        kept

             of     these    faults       by me       but      I. am a w a r e      that    the      ground           staff       do    regular

             maintenance           work    on       the    s t i l e s.

As    I started             part      way       through         the       season,        I never             attended any               pre-

Leppings            Lane.           These       were     well        behaved.



I was       allocated               * C ’ tickets           on G a t e             on L e p p i n g s         Lane     and      my      uncle

was     on G a t e                   We    went       o v er    to     the      post     at a b o u t          12 m i d d a y      ( 1200

through            and    by a b o u t      2.15pm          (1415),          I had       only       taken about               45

tickets.                I know       this       as    I ’d s p e n t       the     time       counting             them    just         to     pass

the     time.            I wa s      quite       surprised,               as a l t h o u g h       I h a d n ’t b e e n         g iven any

However,            at a b o u t      2 . 1 5 pm      (1415)         or    so,     people          ju s t     appeared          from

nowhere            in d r o v e s ,       just       kept      coming        and       c o ming.         Before        that,         two

policemen were                  stood       on e i t h e r        side       of m y      gate       on the           outside,

from about             2.15pm       <1415)          I didn't           see     them.




During         this     rush       of    fans,       people         either          pushed          or w e r e      pushed         to    the

gate      by    the     sheer       weight          of    numbers         behind          them.           They weren't

disorderly             but    people         seemed         ’b e d r a g g l e d '     as      if    t h e y ’d b e e n        pushed,

shoved         e t c . , and       it    showed          in t h e i r     dishevelled                clothing            and     red

•Paces.



People         were     corning t h r o u g h w i t h             full       tickets,           half       tickets,            both      stu b s

and    the      larger        part       retained           by    the     fan.         Borne h a d         'A’ and            ’B ’ t i c k e t s

and some          had    none       at    all.           Prior      to 2 . 1 5 p m        (1413)          I was         refusing

everything,             apart       from       'C'       tickets,         but       after       2.15pm          <1415)         F. wa s     told

by a      policeman           inside         the     courtyard            area       to     let      ’A ’ a n d                tickets

in.       It wa s       about       t hi s     time       I started            to    get       what       we    call       'jumpers’,

that      is t h o s e       that       vault,       climb        or    stride         over         the    turnstile,             and

t h e n we      got     what       we    term       'doubling'            or    ’t r e b l i n g ’ up t h r o u g h              the     gate.

This      involves           the    first       fan       giving        me     a ticket             a n d as      I release             the

p e dal     to a l l o w      the       gate    to       revolve,         the       next       person<s>            in    line      rush        in

and. t h r o u g h      the    gate.           Some       threw        £.5 n o t e s      but a        lot      d i d n ’t.




The    money       that       came       through          the     counter           hole,       I put          into      my    coat

pocket         which     I was          wearing.            It w as       a lightweight                   denim         <blue)      jacket

and    I put       it    into       the      two     side        pockets.            During          my    time         on the      gate,

I wa s      only       offered money                for     entry        by one        person,             I n e v e r , at          any

time,       asked       for    money,          he    just        offered        and       I refused.               He     repeatedly

offered and             in the          end,    due       to     the a g i t a t i o n         of    the       f a ns    be h i n d ,    wh o

appeared          to    be    getting          crus h e d,        and     on    earlier             instruction               from a

police         officer,        when       my    gate        was     stuck       due       to    pressure,               I just       let      him

in.    He      left     a £5       note.        I put          that     in my        p o cket.

refused               ent r y .            Du e      to     the      pressure             behind         him,      he      c o u l d n ’t get         out

through                illegally.                    It m a y        be    that          there       were       more       but     I c a n ’t sa y          -for

At        about            2.40       pm     (1440)            I became             aware       of      the     sound       of     people           scaling

my        gate        wall        and       over          the       roof.           I c a n ’t put a n u m b e r                 to    them.




Suddenly,                   about          2„!::>5    pm       (1455),          the       crowd         had     gone.           They       just

disappeared,                      leaving             2 or 3 fans                   wandering            round       out        the    fro n t .      1

(1420)               they        stretched                r i ght      back         into       Leppings          L a ne,         Looking            through

the           front         opening           of my            turnstile,                I only         get a n a r r o w          view,        some

front               would        be    to     the         middle          of L e p p i n g s         La ne,       so m e    70 metres               away,

little,               due        to    the        frosted window,                        and     the     view      out      of    the       exit      only

o f t e n as       I wa s      too      busy.         In all,         I. b e l i e v e    I took           about      800/900

tickets,           the       vast    majority          after         2.15    pm     (1415).




At     no    time       did    I see a n y         drink       brought           in or       drunk         in s i d e ,    nor       di d       I

see     any       obstructive             behaviour           to a n y o n e ,     apart         from        I could        see       out

t he    front          on one       instance          when     two     mounted           policemen            came        into    my

view.            They    appeared          to    be    pushed         and    jostled            by the        vast        crowd.




I wa s       only       threatened          once       and     that        would       h a ve    been a r ou n d 2.40                 pm

(1440)           when a Liverpool                fan,       aged      late       20s,     5'10        tall,        average           build,

light        brown       curly       hair       just     over        his    ears,        and with a Liverpudlian

accent,           shouted          to me,       "Let     us     in or       I'll       give      thee       a bloody,"               and

raised           his    left       fist    as    if    to     carry        out    the     threat.             He    h ad    no    ticket

and     I. let         him    in as       I ’d b e e n      instructed            by     the PC.




Apart        from       the    illegal          entries,         I saw       no     other        criminal           offences.




At     about       3.05       pm    (1505)       the     checker           arrived        and      I closed           up,       after

counting           my    tickets,          which       I ’d     reached          500     pri o r      to    his     arrival.                My

uncle        said       that       there    wa s      some     trouble           taut I d o n ’t k n o w            where        he    got

that        from,       but    I ’d h e a r d      something           over       the Tannciy s y s t e m                 and    I

assumed           i t t o be        fight i n g .



My                 had a s s u m e d       the     same       a n d we w e n t         out      the     open Gate           C and

alongside              the    r i ver     and    into       g a t e m a n ’s o f f i c e .         On      leaving         through

Gate        C,    on rny left           I saw      three        people       who       were      l yi n g     flat        out    and        1

assumed           they were          dead.         One      lad w a s       very much            like       me,     aged        around              1-

18 y r s , 5 ’10 tall,                  slim     build,        shaved        hair,        long at           fr o n t ,     short        back

and     sides          and    the    front       pi ece       wa s    bleached           yellowy           blond      but       the     rest

was     l i ght        bro wn .      He w a s      wearing           denim       blue     shirt         (faded)           and    jeans.

                                                                                                                              S 1290

Another        was       older,       mid-20s,           pot-bellied            with a shock            of       curly    dark

hair,        and     his      tee    shirt       was     up   round       his    neck

                                                 The     other      I d o n ’t recall.




Nearby        wa s      an a m b u l a n c e     and     I s aw     two    ambulancemen             working,            trying        to

resuscitate              another          person       but    they      gave     up.       'Ihis    was      the       last     person

I described.                  I thought          they were          dead      due    to    their       pale       face s ,      eyes

w i d e o p e n , g l a z e d w i t,h n o r e a c t i o n .




We     handed        in our         tickets       and     I r e c e i v e d m y £.18 pay.               We       then    walked

out     to    the       corner       of    the    South Stand and                Kop,      where       we    viewed       the

pitch and            people         rushing       about,       etc.        I was       too      shocked          to m o v e

following            an f r o m w h a t        I ’d s e e n    earlier,          (the      deaths).              After    a wh i l e ,

around. 5 . 4 5          pm    (1745),         we w e n t     home      in h e a v y      traffic.




Around 5           pm     (1700)       I remembered            the m o n e y        in m y      pockets.            I felt

terrible           and     mentioned           it to my I                 i     I d o n ’t, t h i n k       he    took    it     in

b ut   he     said       that       h e ’d got m o n e y ,        about       £30.        I'd    got    about          £40.      I

n ever       c o u nt e d :it,.



When     I got          home    I mentioned              it   to m y m o m       and      she wa s      u p se t ,      asking        me

why     I didn't           hand      it    in.     1 told         her     I ’d f o r g o t t e n    it a n d       d i d n ’t

intend        to     have      it a n y w a y .        I assumed          they'd       set      up a f u n d       after

hearing        on T V         that     there      ha d    been      deaths.          I decided          to       put    the     money

to     that.



I threw         it      in a d r a w e r       in m y     c h est    of    drawers         in m y      bedroom          on the

Saturday           night.           Later      that      night      my m o m     took      the     money         out    and     put    it

in a n       envelope.              She    kept    it.

                                                                                                                                  SI 290

On    the M o n d a y ,           I told my        uncle      what        I was        doing     and       he a g r e e d        to    do

the    same.           He     then made          an a n onymous            telephone            call       to    the C l u b          and   I

gather          the    l ad y      said    it w o u l d      be a p p r e c i a t e d      if we          put    it    to      the     f unti.

I don't          k n o w whe n,          but                took     it    to    the      C i t y H al l        sometime          in    the

week       or,    at    least,           that's       what    I ’m      told.



In my       opinion           I couldn't           stop      the     illegal           entrants           due    to    the       s h ee r

numbers.              I don't           know what          happened        to    them.




I feel          that    if        the    Police       set    up a f i l t e r i n g        system          before          the    fans

reach       the       turnstiles,              then    trouble          could      possibly           be a v o i d e d .          Also

there       seemed          to     be a lack          of    comnutnication               between          inside       and       outside

and,       of    course,           the    late     arrival         of     such     numbers           of    f an s     prevented

th e i r a c cess.



Also       for    such        large       numbers,          there       are     to o     few    turnstiles,                in my

opinion,          as well           as    too    few       tickets        for    the      numbers          wishing          to attend,

With       regard       to a l c o h o l        I didn't        pay a n y a t t e n t i o n           to    the       f a ns     and

whether          they'd           been    drinking.           I didn't           see     any     drunken            fans.




At    no    time       di d       I ask    or    intend       to t a k e        money      from anyone.

and    ran     off       to m i n g l e     with       the     fans      who     h ad     produced         their        tickets.

On    this     occasion             the    Police         Officers         a n d S t e w a r d s had d i f f i c u l t y

closing        'C        Gate       because        the       crowd outside             the    ground           appeared        to    be

attempting           to     force        the   gate        open..



Just, a f t e r      the        kick-off.         I was        again       in the         area      between        the W e s t

Stand and           the     turnstiles            when       I saw        ’€"    g at e    shaking         and     I got       the

impression           that        the     crowd       outside        the     ground were               trying       to    force

them    open.            T h en the       g ate     was      o p ened a n d        I f o u n d m y s e 1 f irt the             path

of a    c r o w d who           surged      through          the    open        gate      and    ran t o w a r d s       the

tunnel       u n der      the      West     Stand        which allows              access        to P e n s      3 a n d 4.

I managed           to    get      out    of   the w a y a n d w e n t             to     stand       by   the     perimeter

wall    adjacent            to     ’C " Gate.



I was     unable           to     direct       the      supporters          either           towards       Pens       1 a n d S or

5,    6 and 7 because                  they    just        rushed        forward          ’en m a s s e * .        If    1 had

tried     to      direct         them     I would          h ave    been        trampled         under         foot.

that        the    fans       were       directed            towards        Pens       1 a n d 2,         and     the S t e w a r d s

were        on    hand     to    chec k         the    tickets,           but       I have        never        seen      the       gates

o p e n e d as         they     were       on     t ha t     day.



It was           not    u ntil     about          13 m i n u t e s       l a ter      that     I realised               t h at     a

traqedy           had    taken        place.           I received              no     communication               regarding                 the

incident           up to        t h at     point       over        the    personal            radio       that      I had w i t h me

I    first        became        aware       of      the      extent       of     the       disaster         when        I saw          two

P o 1 i ce 0 f f i ce r s        (I do          not    know        thei r i d ent i ty a n d              cannot         describe

the m),          carrying        a body           of w h a t       appeared           to    be a d e a d m a n           from          the

tu nn e l        under     the     West         S ta n d .




Whilst           this    wa s    going          on,    the       Liverpool            supporters            were        obviously

very        upset       by w h a t       had      occurred          and were           swearing           at     the     Police             and

the     Stewards           calling          them GESTAPO                 amongst           other     things         and       blaming             u

for     the       tragedy.



I began           to    busy     myself           helping          Liverpool           supporters.                One      youth            who

wa s    a white          m ale,       about        16 yrs          old,    about           14 s t o n e     and about              6

f eet       tall       with     blonde          hair,        was    lying        by    the     steps        leading           up       to    the

seating           area     in the          West       Stand.          I checked             his     pul se       and     discovered

it     to    be    shallow.           As    I was          doing      this       a woman          a p p r o a c h e d me         and

identified              herself          to me        as     a nurs e,         she     t ook      over.          S he    was       a

Liverpool              supporter,           white,           about       5 ”3"      tall      and    quite        plump.

I    then        directed        a y o uth who               was    about        IS y r s , w h i t e ,          male      with         bl a c k

hair,        wearing          denim        jacket          and     jea n s ,     who       appeared         to    have        a broken

arm,        towards       a First           Aider          who     took    h i m away.



I    was     then a pproached                   by a m a n wh o           was       white,        about        6*4"       tall,         about
                                                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                                                        S43S

17 stone,          who       was    c r yin g.        I asked           what       was      wrong          and     he    explained

that    he     h ad     seen       his    brother          lying        on    the       pitch         unattended,              so       I took

hi m ont o th e pit ch                t o s ee       h i s b ro t h e r .




All    this       time       I was       subjected          to    swearing              because            I was        identified                as

a Steward          by    the       bib    I was       wearing.                Eventually               I wa s       advised             to

remove       my    bib       by a P o l i c e        Officer          for     my    own        protection.




I saw       one    of    the       Stewards                                        come        o f f t h e p i t c h „ ha v i n g

b e e n he! p :irig w i t h t h e           injured,,          and a g ro u p o f Liverpool                             fans    grabbed

hold    of     him a n d        pushed         him    up a w all             calling           him a B A S T A R D .                1

believed          they were           going      to a s s a u l t        him,       so      I intervened and                    they           left

him a lo n e .           I then          advised                  Ito        remove         his       bi b    also.




During       these       events          I sa w w h a t        wa s     like       r ai n      failing            from    the       West

Stand.            This       was    in fact          u r ine     where        supporters               ware        too    lazy          to    go

to    the    to ile t.          They      were       urinating           at       the    back         of     the    stand and                it

was    falling          o nto      the    people        below..

1    could     see      somebody          or    persons          smashing           the        louvre         windows          to       the

toilets        in the W e s t            Stand.            Again        the       glass        wa s    falling           down       o nto

the    peop l e       bel ow.            There       was    no    one        trapped, at              this        location          and       the

damage       was      merely        vandalism.                 I did         not    see wh o           was        responsible                for

the    darnage        becauss         I wa s     outs ide .



Whilst       in the          West     Stand      I saw a s n a c k                bar    which         is     normally          staffed

                                                                                                                                      S438

          involved,           except        to    say     they were          all    white       arm    in t h e i r     mid      te e n s ) .

          I told a Police                  Officer        who       chased    them       off.         Then      the    officer          went

          and     the       youths      r e t u r n e d as      X was       tidying       up.         They      then    shouted

          after        me a n d      I feared         for      my    safety and          ran    off,     chased        for      a short

          distance           toy them.



          I had        spoken        to a L i v e r p o o l         Steward    w ho      had    come     to     the    match       to

          assist        us,     before       the      g ame     began and          he    said    he    thought         s om e    '* IDIOiS*

          might        come,      because         last      year      the    St Ledger' R a c e          wa s     run on        the     same

          day as        the     s ame      Semi-Final           was    played       between Nottingham                  i-orest an d

          Liverpool.              On    t h at    occasion           everything          had    gone     very      smoothly and

          we    were        ex pec t in g    t he     sam e     t h i s y e a r , but      the     Liverpool           Steward          (he

          is     one    of     two     brothers          called LLOYD)             believed        that       more     people         would

          come      because          the    St    Leger        w a s n vt bei ng        run,    whi ch s u b s e q u e n t l y

          appeared           correct        because         t h ere    were    a    lot m o r e       peo p l e   around         Lhis

                    SUBJECT:       FA CUP SEMI FINAL - 9 April 1988


                  I refer to the enclosed correspondence regarding the above event. I have
                  liaised with the officers concerned with the preparation, control and
                  supervision of the above event and we have noted locally the lessons that
                  were learned and the improvements that can be made for any similar future
                  event. Generally I was well satisfied with the event and I will confine this
                  report to matters which effect the Force Operations Room and Road Traffic
                  Department.

                  COMMUNICATIONS

                  On the day more use than normal was made of the radio link between ground
                 .con ol at Hillsborough and the Operations room in attempting to contact
                 those units equipped with both ground control and UHF radio/ This was
                 ent±rely ^ue     difficulties in personal radio transmissions which were
                 effected for most of the event by breakthrough from local radio. The
                 Superintendent (Communications) is aware of this and an immediate survey
                 of the equipment was made after the event, but the fault could not be traced.
                 TRAFFIC FLOW AND CONTROL

                 Transmissions in relation to problems with traffic, from mobile units and
                 the spotter plane were being received at Operations room and were not
                 monitored at ground control. It seens sensible to me that for future 'semis*
                 all matters relating to the control and movement of traffic should be
                 supervised ^by Operations room, with the exception of the local arranaements
                 made immediately outside the ground when the final whistle is blown. ~
                 FOOTBALL TRAFFIC SIGNS

                 Purpose made signs have been requested in the past, but for financial
                 reasons have not been approved. Such signs are extremely beneficial and
                     s pleasing to note that Superintendent Brougham is lookina into this
                 aspect.

                SEARCHING OF COACHES FOR ALCOHOL ABUSE ETC.

                The effect of alcohol on football supporters is well known and I would not
                wish to see any relaxation of enforcement, of the laws relating to the carriage
                of alcohol on coaches etc. It is appreciated that this can cause some traffic
                congestion, but surveys are being carried out on the major roads approaching
                the city to establish where this can be carried out to cause mini mum
                inconvenience to traffic flows.

                CLOSE CIRCUIT TV LINK WITH WADSLEY BRIDGE STATION

                A TV monitor was sited in the control roan giving pictures from Wadsley Bridge
                Railway Station. This monitor took up valuable room in the control area and
                was of little use and I would not wish such a system to be implemented in the
                future.                                 -

        Chief Superintendent HEROLD
                                                 DATE:    11th April 1988

         SUBJECT:
                    Items for de-briefing re F.A. Semi-final 9th April 1988

        On Saturday 9th April I was duty sergeant in the Operations
        Room and I would like to submit my observations concerning
        the football match.

        1• Operational Orders

           Traffic      - no problems with this order other than the
           fact that no call signs had been allocated to the three
           public order patrols at Woodall Services, Ml. It was not
           until they came on the air that we knew who was on this
           detail. It was necessary to then create a duty rota on the
           computer and allocate callsigns (X101,X102,X103). It would
           have been much better if this had been catered for in the
           order.

           'F' Division - no problems, other than the fact that Operations
           Room did not receive a copy of the order. One was obviously
           copied from another held at headquarters.

           ’D' Division - this order catered very well with 'D* Division
           involvement, the precise details of primary and secondary
           routes being useful. One problem encountered was that the
           traffic signals on the Ml exit slip roads at Catcliffe
           were not turned off; officers were working traffic against
           the lights. This matter was subsequently resolved but should
           be catered for in any similar operation.

           Dog Section - Operations Room did not receive a copy of any '
           order or duties in relation to duties at the match. It was
           a ffiirly lengthy task creating a duty rota on the computer
           for all the dog handlers involved and in future advance
           duties for such operations should be supplied in advance.
       2 • Use of spotter plane

          As you know we did have problems initially with air to
          ground communications, but once these problems had been
          resolved the assistance cf the spotter plane became
          invaluable. Prior to the match, Operations Room were given
          good accounts of traffic flow into Hillsborough and traffic
          hold ups were reported. It was then possible to give
          instructions to officers on point duty,via other match
          controls, to ease the hold ups.

          Ironically, there was a two mile tailback reported on the
          A616 at Oughtibridge - traffic building up through Warncliffe
          Side to Deepcar. The hold up was on Low Road,Oughtibridge
          where public order patrols manned by the Underwater Search
          Unit were stopping and searching vehicles travelling into
          city.
   After the match, the spotter plane was of great assistance
   in identifying why traffic could not leave the area of the
   ground.

   One major problem highlighted, and rectified by the air
   observer, was that officers on point duty were working
   against each other. One would have released traffic whilst
   the next officer in line would be stopping it. It was then
   possible to synchronise their instructions to traffic to
   keep the traffic flowing. One point that should be made to
    ®at °fficers ?n traffic points is that after the match they
   should give priority to football traffic leaving Sheffield,
   giving long runs through junctions. This was not the case
   on Saturday and I had to make repeated requests,via Match
   controls, for this to be done.

^ * ffadio Procedure and Transmissions

  ^n^?rtu”ately there was some confusion regarding which Force
   adio Channel was being used for the match. As far as Operations
  Room was concerned, Force Channel 1 was reserved for all
  mobiles engaged on the football duty. 'D' and *F' Division
  were expecting channel 2. This matter was rectified and channel
  one was used.

  Channel 1 monitored all motorway patrols and any vehicle with
  specific duties in relation to the match. A total of 87 mobiles
  were working on this channel and obviously at this level
  transmission time is at a premium. P.C. Ragg was the controller
  in Operations Room and I choose this point to state what an
  excellent job he did.

  As always some officers were suffering from 'verbal diarrohea'
  making life very difficult for the radio operator. Officers
  persisted in telling Operations Room every time they saw a
  coach or took up escort of it. In my view this type of
  transmission is unnecessary as it is virtually impossible for
  this type of information to be recorded and retransmitted
  w en coming in thick and fast. The only transmission of this
   ype required is where we"have a coach containing unruly
  supporters, etc. or where"specific instructions or enquiries
  are given. Perhaps this point should be made at future briefings
  and included in orers.

* Press Officer

 I am aware that Superintendent Pratt had been detailed to
  •fw « lth the media concerning the match, and we had speech
 with Mr. Pratt thoughout the day, but it would have been
 useful^if there had been a press officer on duty at Headquarters
 throughout the day to take care of all the press calls.

 The Operations Room Inspector and Sergeant act as press
 officers out of hours and like any other Saturday numerous
 press calls were being received. Some were in relation to the
 match, others were routine press calls about incidents that
  ad occurred Friday night - Saturday morning.
A press officer on duty at headquarters would have allowed
both the .Sergeant and Inspector to give total supervision
to -trhfTrurming of the Operations Room and football detail
instead of having to keep breaking off to answer press
enquiries.

Generally, the operation went well and was certainly an
improvement on last year's operation. This report is
respectfully submitted for your information.

 I have a few comments of m y own concerning the policing that day as follows

 You will appreciate this was my first semi 'outside the ground', with the
 responsibility for Operations L Traffic.  By and large it was okay but I think
 the management of traffic flow can be improved. Many of the officers deputed to

          MR. COLLINS:        Chief Superintendent D u c k i n f i e l d , please.

                     DAVID GODFREY DUCKINFIELD Called

                          Examined by MR. C O L L I N S :

Q. Mr. Duckinfield,       you are David Godfrey Duckinfield.              Is that
   right? - A. Yes,       sir.

Q. And you are Chief Superintendent in charge of F Division? - A.
   Yes, sir.

O. May I ask you a little bit about your Police history, please,
   first?  When did you first join the Police? - A. I joined the
   Folice as a Cadet in 1960.

Q. And which Force was that? - A. It was in the Sheffield City
   Folice at that time, and then I remained a Cadet for three
   years and became a Constable in the Force in 1963.

Q. And obviously you were promoted from time to time, but give us
   just a brief outline of your career in the Police until you
   took over on 27th March this year your present post? - A. Yes.
   I started as a uniformed Constable at Hamir.erton Road Folice
   station, which was the Division that I am now in.    I served
   there as a uniformed Constable, working beat patrol, for a
   period of two years.  Then I left there and went into the CID
   as an aide, and six months later I was posted as a Detective
   Constable.

         I remained in the CID in Sheffield City Police Force as
    it was then, and was promoted Detective Sergeant shortly
    afterwards, after six years, and then eventually spent time on
    the Regional Crime Squad and was promoted a uniform Inspector
    in 1974.

Q. Where was that? - A. At a Division to the south of the city,
   H a c k e n t h o r p e ’D i v i s i o n , and at that time I gained experience of
   football matches at Bramall Lane when Sheffield United were at
   that time in the First Division attracting large crowds.

Q. Wnat was tnen une capacity ox c.r,cz;-e„c -_..i e
   roughly? - A . To be honest it is difficult tq suggest, but I
   think about that time possibly 50,000, but th ere have been
   changes since that time.

             I remained as a uniform Inspector in th^t area for a
   year.        Following that I was transferred to the Headquarters
   Community Liaison Department and served there for a period as
   I n s p e c t o r , and latterly as Chief Inspector un1til 1979 when
   was transferred from the Headquarters Communiity Liaison
   Department as uniform patrol Chief Inspector at the
   Ecclesfield sub-Division.            I remained there for a year, and
   then shortly afterwards I was transferred to the No. 1 sub-
   Division working from Hammerton Road Police station.             At that
   particular location I policed the Sheffield Wednesday football
                                                          114

                                                                                  D.G.   DUCKINFIELD


                              ground for a period of 12 m o n t h s .

                         Q.   Your rank at this stage being? - A . Chief Inspector.     In that
                              period I think if I am correct which was between September
                              1979 and June 19S0, I had experience of policing a Semi-Final
                              tie between Liverpool and Arsenal, end also the major tie
                              between Sheffield Wednesday and S h e f field United on Ecxins
                     B        D a y . On both of those occa; ions they attracted capacity
                              crowds.

                         G. Which was your area of respons; h-          y within the ground;  we
                            know Chief Inspectc: ■s have the res possibility of a number of
                            serials? - A . At the t time the organisation was a little
                            d i f f e r e n t , and to : quite specific I cannot other than x say
                            I was on the perirr.e-•er track occupying a position very si®i' 1ar*
                     C      to the Sergeant who now occupies that position where the
                            players run out.

                         Q,   Near the p l a y e r s ’ tunnel? - A. That is right.  I had that
                              responsibility.         I remained there until June 1980.  In June
                              I960 X was transferred again as a Chief Inspector to the
                              Attercliffe sub-Division which deals with the industrial cart
                              of the city, and at that time did noi have a particular
                     D        involvement with football matches or public order.          I
                              remained there for a period until 1985, when at that time
                              after promotion, I moved to West Bar Police station as a
                              uniform Superintendent and Deputy Divisional C o mmander .

                                       From the transfer to Atterclif fe to West Bar then my
                              policing role changed consi d e r a b l y . As you can imagine in the
                              city centre X was regularly involved with the policing of
                              m a r c h e s , d e m o n s t r a t i o n s , on a regular basis, and also
                              responsible for the policing of Sheffield United football
                              g r o u n d . Duri ng the initial period I policed the ground on a
                              regular basis and took a regular interest in the game and also
                              the policing of the gro.und.

                         Q. When you say responsible for policing, were you the person who
   sT )’             F      drew up the o peratio nal plan? - A. No.         The structure is such
 1 )                        that the sub-Divisional C o m m a n d e r , that is the Superintendent
                            of the Central Division would with his planning team draw up
                            that plan, and as Deputy Divisional Commander would monitor
                            that situation and assist and supervise in the absence of that
                            Officer.           The Officer at that particular time was
                            Superintendent M a r s h a l l , who is now my Deputy Divisional
                            C o m m a n d e r . So he and I worked together for a considerable
                            period qu ite closely on public order m a t t e r s .

                         Q. That was from 1985 u n t i l ....? - A. Until I was promoted
                            r e c e n t l y . I may have got that particular date w r o n g , but
                            certainly for a period of three years with Mr. M a r s h a l l .

                         Q. So about three or four years before your promotion? - a. yes

                 H       Q . We know you went into post on 27th March, was it, this year?
                              A.   Yes,   sir.


H s rp h s fD Lie!

                                                            D.G.   DUCKINFIELD


 O. Froi~ whst you told us, si though you had had experience of"
    policing football matches and as a Chief Inspector had had
    experience at Hillsborough and perhaps as a Constable? -
    A. Yes, sir.

 Q.   You had not had experience of planning an overall
            1‘Sibi 1 ity for a big tie such as this? — a. In terms o^" a
      Serai-Final tie. you are quite correct, but I should cake the
      pom*, that during my period at West Bar I had an involvement
      not so much in the detailed planning but certainly supervision
      of the Billy Graham concerts that were held at Bramall lane
      fooi— .all g r o u n d , wnere there was a capacity crowd, and only
      last year during the summer Bruce Springsteen, a n 'American p o d
      artist, caine to Bramall Lane football ground for a weekend,
      and he held two concerts on a Saturday and Sunday e v e n i n g . ’and
      there was an expected attendance of 43,000 people on each of
      chose d a y s . It would be wrong to say I know that £8,000
      attended, but almost that number attended.          So I have
      experience at first hand only last year of policing a Bruce
      Springsteen concert and a large number of people attended.

Q. But your last direct contact with Hillsborough, if I have
   correctly followed what you told us, was some 10 years aso? -
   A. In terms of a Police Commander, yes, sir.

Q.    In terms of any sort of policing? - A. Yes, it was.

Q. So you were in need, were you not, of reconsidering or looking
   again at Hillsborough stadium itself? - a . There was,
   unaers c^nda'Diy, with a promotion o m y a snort period before
   tne event, I may not be so well acquainted with the finer
   detail as possibly Mr. Mole, but the point is I know the*area
   and hav e policed the area before.

Q. Yes, but things have changed since you had been there over the
   last 10 y e a r s . Most particularly in that period the radial
   pens hcd been erected, and that of course made a considerable
   d ifference? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Wnen was it you were first aware you were going to be landed
   with the policing of this game? - A. I would say, as Mr. Mole
   was >  think it would have been the Saturday or Sunday, the
   weekend wnere «_r»e fixtures xor tne ^ixtn Round were decided.

O. 2 0 ch M a r c h , I think, or thereabouts. Only about a week
   before. , - A. I think the announcement was made on the Monday
   morning when the draw would be made.

Q.    I c a n ’t immediately remember what date it was.

           LO R D JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Monday,   20th March.

           T H E WITNESS:   So I learned t h e n .

           MR- COLLINS:   You learned then, and you realised
      immediately this was going to land on your plate very shortly
      after you had taken over? - A. Yes, sir.

 O. We have heard you had a meeting with M r . Hole and the other
    Officers who were going to be concerned with the planning on
    the 22nd, the Wednesday?   A. Yes, sir.

 Q. You were given, I imagine, the operational o r d e r , cr the draft
    operational order as I suppose it then was? — A . X attended
    the meeting on that particular day prior to my pre-notion, and
        •      Mole had Caj._i.ed a meecing wxtn all interested oarties and
    b e m u s e ot the success or the previous operations and his
    knowl edge then matters were discussed and agreed on the oast
    fornist that had been successful.

O. bo you as it were were given the operational order,
   appreciated that it had been successful, and saw no reason to
   assume it would not be ecually successful this vear? - A         t
   g i g not accept it in total just like that.       I sat in at the
   meeting.    The provisional arrangements were made, and I think
   ir you look to the following Wednesday from my statement then
   I hsid a meeting with Superintendent M u r r a y . ...

Q. That is on_the^29th     March? - A. Yes, Chief Inspector Eeale and
   Inspector Sewell in     my office.   I went through the operation
   order page by page,       looking at the situation, examining it and
   specking with tnera,      asking for their advice and guidance,
   bearing in mind the     arrangements Mr. Mole had sug g e s t e d . I
   was m  no way being     critical but just examining for myself.

G. Of course. - A. And having been satisfied with the
   arra;igemencs aj<d w h o aovice j. acceptec tnat we should
   proceed on those lines.

Q. Had you been to the ground for yourself by then? - A. No. sir,
   I think'by then I policed the ground on possibly the following
   Saturday.

Q. Was tne meeting on 2Sth, was it at that meeting effectively
   this plan was given the go ahead? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Pr esumably it had to be agreed on some time in advance?  -a.
       y wuch so.  if you thxnK in terms 01 timescale, we were
   talking in terms of I think 2-and-a-half weeks.

Q.    Indeed. Easter was before that.   This   was already after
     Easter.     So effectively you had a fortnight after 29th March,
     or 16 days, to go, and therefore clearly agreement had to be
     reacned by 29th March? - A. I should make the point, I don't
     think agreement was reached in haste.

Q.    No, n o , I am not suggesting it was r I am agreeing with y o u ,
     really, it was necessary, because apart from anything else you
     had to get the manpower together? — a . Very much s o , yes

Q. And until you knew what the plan was you would not know what
   the ma npower was going to be? - A. Yes.

0. All I am asking you is whether it might not have been sensible

                                                      D.G.   DUCKINFIELD


      for you to have gon'e to look at the ground to see whether you
      could identify for your s e l f any possible problem aress berore
      you committed yourself to the final decision about the plan,
      the operation order? - A. I take your point, sir, but I was
      going to visit ths ground very shortly afterwards.          There was
      c-t •£]_! time to make adjustments and a m e n dments, and bearing m
      mind we always retain the right to adjust, bearing in mind the
      information and intelligence you tend to receive.

Q,    I follow that, but it is much better, is not it, to have a
      plan D r o p e r l y formulated rather than one that gets encngsd
      because of unforeseen circumstances? - A. I take your point,
      but I was being advised by Officers who had considerable
      experience and at that stage I relied upon that experience.

Q.    i n d e e d , but yours was the ultimate responsibility, end was
      going^to be the ultimate responsibility.        If anything went
      wrong it was your neck and not tr.eirs? - A. Yes. sxr.

Q.    when you did go to the ground did you make^an i n s p e c t i o n ^ !
      the cround to see whether yo u could identity any poic:n.ici
      trouble spots? - A. Yes, sir, I walked around and examined the
      ground.

Q.    You sootted, no doubt, the lack of directions within the             _
      turnstiles in Leppings Lane? - A. I cannot say categonc<=l_y         1
      locked from the turnstiles and saw the lack of signs.

Q     If you had locked from the turnstiles you could hardly have
      avoided   appreciating the lack of signs, coulu          .
      Bearing in mind that I know the location and I K n o w tne area,
      and I know there are signs there.

0      IS t M s not something that you appreciated could give rise to
       possible problems? - A . A t thax time, sir, no.

 Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    When was it you walked round the
       ground? - A.. On the Saturday following, sir.  That would
       b e .....
 Q_          MR. COLLINS:   That would be about lst-2nd A p r i l ,^I think.
       _ ^   ~       •?5 the da t e of the Millwall match, i.nat is
       correct.

 Q    Did you take operational control at that match, or did you
       simply watch to see how it went? - A. Effectively I was the
       Divisional Commander and in overall command, but on that
       particular occasion I left the running of the match very much
       in charge of the Superintendent, and walked the area and
       familiarised myself with the situation.

 Q     For example, you p r e s umably went to look at the turnstiles to
       see how people were g e t ting in, how the arrangements worKed. -
       A. Yes, sir.

 Q     What about the    pens?  Obv i o u s l y you spotted the existence of
       the pens.  Did    it occur to yo u then that there was a possible
        «                                                     118

                       A
                                problem if people came down that central tunnel into those
                                pens, a possible problem of overcrowding? - A. I was aware of
                                the r e s t r i c t i o n s , shall we say, but bearing in mind at the
                                Millwall match the crowd was such or the visitors were
                                such that it was not self-evident of the difficulties that
                                might be experienced.

                           Q. Ey which you mean there was a relatively small number of
                              supporters coming from Millwall? - A. Yes, sir.

                           Q. And presumably it was only necessary in these circumstances or
                              perhaps only n e cessary to use may be a couple of those pens?
                              I don't know. - A. I would say the central two p e n s , sir.

                           Q. Just the central two pens? - A. Yes.
                       c
                           0. Effectively, then, a tiny crowd? - A. Yes,           but I cannot be
                              specific as to how many.

                           G. No. obviously, but it would follow it was less than 2,200 if
                              only those two central pens were used.  You knew you were in
                              for a sell out, a capacity crowd at the Semi-Final? - A. Yes.

                           Q. Did you think at all of the possible effect of those radial
                              barriers, those pens, on a capacity crowd? - A. No, I examined
                              the situation, and I had been aware previously of sway in
                              football crowds and the need for penning people on occasions
                              to prevent lateral m o v e m e n t , and also of allowing crowds when
                              they are in small numbers of being able to run from one end to
                              the other and meet up wxtn opposing fans.

                           G. Those are problems which were simply irrelevant in relation to
                              the capacity crowd of one side supporters, were not they? - A.
                              Yes, sir.
   #                       Q. What you had to apply your mind to was the possible problem
                              that could a r i s e , s u r e l y , of people cramming into the central
                              pens, or indeed the outer pens for that matter, and not being
                              able to spread laterally? - A. Yes, sir.
  fe rJ tL .       *
                           G. Was that a problem which occurred to you as a possibility? -
                              A. In discussions with other Officers who had more experience
                              of tne ground than I had, and from ~y cvr. cbs=rv=ticr;s at that
                              t i m e , it did not look as though it would be a p r o b l e m .

                           Q. You could see there was the central tunnel?                Yes.

                           Q.   You knew that A-G turnstiles  which gave on to the part of the
                                concourse leading to that central tunnel were the turnstiles
                                that were to be used for the terraces? - A. Yes.

                           Q.   I assume you knew that? - A.        Yes.   We are talking about the
                                Semi-Final tie?

                   H       G.   Yes,   indeed.   - A.   Yes
                                                                            /Q. That being so,...

                      Q. Kell some of them? - A.    I take your point,

                      Q.   6,000 came in February we know? - A. Yes.

                      n    But Chief Superintendent, are you saying that you have had
                           no discussions at all because it simply did not occur to
                           you that it would create a problem about any plans to
                           ensure that there no overfilling of these central pens?
                           - A. My und erstanding sir of the situation is that the
                           crowd management control and the filling of pens is not
                           a Police responsibility.   The direction of fans and things
                           of that order are the responsibility of the Club and not
                           the Police Service.

                           Well did you ask about that?       I did not need to ask,
                           sir, I knew.

                      Q- Well did you ensure that there was liaison
                           so that there was some sort of control and direction
                           giving should that become necessary?-A. As far as I v.’as
                           concerned Superintendent Murray who was the Ground
                           Commander had liaised with the Club.   The Club end ou r­
                 D         selves accept our individual responsibilities and as far
                           as I am concerned it is clearly defined.   My understanding
           V*
                           is, as I have said earlier, crowd management, filling of
                           pens and monitoring of pens is a Club responsibility and
                           not that of the Police Service.

                     /c    That ma y be in theory but in practice the Police are very
                           concerned iz the situation arises which has    se capacity
    if'»         E         to lead to disorder or the capacity to lead to injury c-3
                           loss of life? - A. I take your point.


 #                         Nov/ overfilling of pens has that capacity,
                           - A.Yes.
                                                                         does it not?


                      Q. A nd therefore the Police must have an interest surely in
                         ensuring that pens such as this are not overfilled? - A.

                         it had been _________ought to

                         difficulties where injury was likely to occur from over­
                         filling and the Club were not monitoring the situation
                         and doing their job, and the information came from my
                         Officers that there w as difficulty, I would have responded.

                      Q. I follow that, bu t w h a t I am perhaps suggesting to you
                           is you ought to have taken initiative because you ought
                           as the O f f i c e r in overall control to have appreciated
                           the potential problem? - A. I would appreciate the problem
                           sir, I take your point, but the situation is that until
                           a problem develops and it is a problem that is developing

                                                                           D.G. DUCKIMFIELD



                                 p r o b l e m are not accepting that responsibility end dealing
                                 w i t h it effectively, then I think that problem should be
                                 left with them. If it gets out of hand and there is a
                                 likelihood of injury then I will step in and do my job.

                          Q. That sounds like a recipe for disaster, Chief Superintendent,
                             because w h a t you ere effectively saying is this, is it not,
                      B
                             that you let them get on with it and only if the worst comes
                             to the w o r s t do you take any steps. Wh a t I an suggesting
                             is you should foresee areas of problems such as this and
                             take or mak e contingency plans? - A. Can I take you back, sir?

                          Q. Yes.     - A.   jlf   I said that     I apologist           no:

                              clear wha t you are saying? - A. Taking it stage by st
                              the responsibility for crowd management and control     nd
                              the filling of pens is the responsibility of the Club
                              If the filling of pens gets to a situation where they are
                              overfilling and it becomes apparent to me that they a
                              o verfilling and difficulties are likely to occur, the
                              shall take some action.    Now I have not got to the si tuation
                  D           where there are major difficulties or a disaster like 1 v to
                              occur.

                          Q. But surely it must be good policing and good practice to
                             try and foresee situations which mi ght lead to the need
                             to take emergency steps so as to avoid them arising at all?
                             - A. Yes, I can accept your point that we should have
  &                          Police Officers in positions who can monitor the position.

                          Q. Did you take any steps to see if there were Police Officers
      (T*
                             as part of the plan w ho could monitor for example over­
                             crowding in those pens? - A. Yes sir, if you examine
                             Serial 1, the track serial, there are 20 Officers there who
                             are spaced equi-distance around the track and there were
                             Officers along the Leppings Lane side of the track behind
                             that goal and looking towards G a t ® 1-5 Police Officers were
                             in positi on there and they could monito r visually the filling
                             of the pens.

                          V: •       .  considered, did you, that Serial 1, looking at the
                                 Operational Order which is Document 14 if you wish before
                                 vou, it is Tab 14 on the document that looks like this.
                                 Have you got it? - A. Yes sir.

                          Q. It is Serial 1, perimeter track.  That part of Serial 1
                             because they are spread out, as I understand it, all round
                             the perimeter? - A. Yes.

                          Q. That part of Serial 1 which is in front of the Leppings
                             Lane terracing, it is part of their responsibility, is it,
                             or you consid ered it was part of their r e s p o n s i b i l i t y , to
                             m o n i t o r and report on the numbers in the pens and to check
                  H          on the possibil ity of overcrowding? - A. It is a responsi­
                             bility of theirs if the filling of the pens gets to the

point of ove rcrowding and furthermore if you examine the
brief for S e r i a l ~ 1 3 , there are six Officers on Serial 13
w ho have a responsibility for looking over the West Stand
into the West Stand terrace and in doing so whilst it
strictly speaking describes responsibilities ....

It is at ' D 1, isn't it, of Serial 13. "Six P.C.s will be
located at the front of the stand to prevent missiles
being thrown/stand tickets being cropped to the terraces
belo w or persons climbing in from the terraces to the
stand and to maintai n order". - A. Whilst it does not
specifically say it, I would expect that those Officers
in looking over from the Stand into the terrace for the
points raised there would also monitor any overcrowding
and report that back.

So are you telling us that it was your understanding of
this Operation Order that the relevant Officers in Serial 1
on the perime ter track and the six Officers at the front
of the West Stand in Serial 13 were the Officers who would
oversee, as it were, and report on the problems or any
problems that mi gh t be created by overfilling of Pens 3
and 4? - A. I don't want to leave those Officers with that
sole responsibility bearing in mind I was in the Control
Room at some stage which overlooks that particular area
and so were other Officers, so I would suggest that there
was .more than these Oflficers having a view of that
situation.

I appreciate there were plenty of Officers having a view,
but we are concerned or I am concerned at this stage
of mv questions with the advance planning and you are
telling us that it was your understanding of the Operational
Order, are you, that those Officers were the Officers who
wou ld have that responsibility? - A. Yes sir.

There is nothing in that Operational Order that gives them
that responsibility specifically, is there? - A. No sir,
but if we a're talking in terms of safety then if you refer
to my briefing notes of the Friday morning and the Saturday
morning, then I stress safety, crowd safety, evacuation
procedures and it is clearly stated in there.

In general terms, yes, but as far as you are aware was any
briefing given to those Officers in Serials 1 or 13 that
part of their responsibilities was to keep an eye on pens
specifically to radio up or to concern themselves with
potential ov ercrowding? - A. I personally did not but you
\^ould have to ask Superi nte nde nt Greenwood who was the
G ro und Comma nde r because the basis of the briefings was
that I gave the overall briefing on the Friday morning to
Supervisory Officers and then delegated the responsibility
for more specific briefings and a tour of specific areas
of r e s p o n s i b i l i t y to the Sector Superintendents and on the
Friday morning wh il st I gave the briefing, the Sector
Superintendents then took their Supervisory Officers around
locations in and around the ground so that their Supervisors

                 A
                        could walk the terraces, could walk the escape routes, etc.
                        So I personally did not give a specific instruction but
                        I think that S up er int end en t Greenwood would be able to
                        answer that specific point.

                     Q. Did you discuss for exaxnple with Superintendent Greenwood
                        or wh oe ver the responsible Officer was, the question of

Q.   It is a document headed "Pre-match Briefing".      I think it
     is dated the 17th April.     It is headed, "Pre-match Briefing
     FA Cup Semi-Final given 14.4.89" - it can't be the 17th.          I

            A. I have net got the copy that you've got.

Q.   I thin.< what I've got is your           ....       -   A. Is it a
     computerised print-out?

Q ....... final version put through a computer.  I chink it was
    put through by west Midlands.   -  A. There are minor
    inaccuracies on that one that don't differ greatly, but I
    have now the original.

Q.   I haven't I think got the            original of that. The statement
     I have seen ....

           DRQ JUSTICE TAYLOR:             Have you get a copy
     Woodward?

          MR. WOODWARD:   Sir I'm not sure what it is.   What has
     happened, the  West Midlands have put into neater form the
     documents which may have been original.  Sir there may be
     confusion as to what the witness is looking at.   If this
     can be identified sir ....

          LORD JUSTICE T A Y L O R :       "Pre-match Briefing FA Cup
     Semi-Final Given 14th April           '89".

          MR. WOODWARD:     Does it begin            "Gentlemen    the event
     today is the FA   ....

          .MR. COLLINS:  No, the event tomorrow is the FA Cup
     Semi-Final since it was given on the day before.

          THE W-ITNESS:           May I explain sir to iron out the
     difficulties?

Q.        MR.       COLLINS:    I'll just ask you this:   the statement
     I've get       is net or. the face of it a statement taken by the
     Police.        This was a statement was it, as it were volunteered
     by you?        - A. My statement as awitness?

Q.   Yes.       -   A. Yes sir.

Q. And passed through the Police solicitors to 'West Midlands,
   is that right? -  A. Yes sir.

Q.   And you annexed to it two appendices,               one of which was
     these briefing notes.   -  A. Yes.

Q. On the Friday, and I think, what happened was West Midlands

retyped it and put it through its computer and you say it
mads a few errors in doing so.   - A. Yes sir, but that is
no criticism of We s t Midlands.

No, I'm not su gg es tin g it was intended to be. As I
understand what you have told us the errors are immaterial
on the whole.   -    A. Yes.   Minor really.

Euc let us deal wi t h them if we come to them, or if there
is any bit of it.    The difficulty is ....

       MR. COLLINS:     I am sorry sir,    I'm afraid we've had a
or ea kd ow n.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Two more copies are coming for
us     in a moment.

     MR. COLLI-3:   Mr.  Duckinfield, actually locking
through the Friday Briefing it frankly doesn't dii;:er~I
chink virtually at all from the Saturday dees it?
Thera are paragraphs missed out sir.

I follow that,    but we can see that from the amendment.
A. Yes.

Essentially we can do this by looking at your Saturday
briefing because it is virtually identical.       -  A. More or
    • m e r e i. juSv.   ood wore* w n czr 3 tne tense c n a n g e c**

The only reason I suggest that is because I know Mr.
woodward has got lots of copies of the Saturday briefing,
and if we know that the Saturday one is really the one that
matters then we can look at that.  - A. Yes.

I don't want to be unfair to you but         I haven't spotted any
material dif ference between the two.         - A. I checked them"
y e s t e r d a y .'

Let us then co nc en tr ate on the Saturday briefing, which was
a briefing for wh o m ?    This was a pre-match briefing    for
all Otficers on ducy x u cne s cao i u t . ? — A. Tnac is right
sir.

I think somewhere there is a picture of them all sitting
there, but wh et her that is one that is actually before the
Inquiry or not I do n' t know, but they all sat in the North
Stand.  - A. Yes sir.

All 900 or wh atever    it was of them.      -    A. 801 I think.

     MR. WOODWARD:       Sir, do you have copies of this
documen t?

      LORD JUST ICE TAYLOR:       No.  I am about to get a cooy
ofthe one we ara now not        going to use so perhaps ws can
have the ones that we ace       going to use.

     MR. WOODWARD:       Can I give you a copy of the            real
document?

      LORD J US TIC E TAYLOR:     Thank you.     (P r o d u c e d )

         m.R. COLLINS:      We will use your original rather than
the one sent through the West Midlands comouter.                I think
what you are effectively saying is this, correct me if I arr.
w t o n g , that i l we I o o k at this w e w i l l see that Lhers a r °
certain paragraphs crossed out.            -    A.  Yes sir.

Those paragrapns which are crossed out           you gave to          the
Inspectors and above on the Friday.  -            A.Yes.

But you deleted for the general briefina on the Saturdav.
-  A. Yes sir.

So it we look at this we can see an amalgam of what you
gave both to the Inspectors and to the general body of men.
I suppose I should call them Officers on the one hand and
the men on the other, I don't know.  - a . Thev are all the
same.

Now eh6 sev.^nd Ccra^raou Wuico was oej.eceo was ocviously
something you had in mind and told the Inspectors was the
inevitability of a number of early arrivals.    - A. Yes
sir.

And you rerer to a certain number of gates caca’ ole of ’
                                                        oeinci
opened from 11 a.n and endeavour to get people into the
ground as quickly as possible.   In fact can you recall when
the gates at Leppings Lane end were opened?    - A.
Specifically I can't sir.   The general arrangements were,
as I have said tnere, for twelve noon, but because oeoole
sometimes do arrive early and we would like to get them off
the streets v;e ask Sheffield Wednesday for their c o ­
operation in opening one or      gates ir. all parts c: the
ground at 11 so if people want to go into the ground they
could do s o .

In fact very   few people would want to go in that early
would they?       A. I think that might be a fair assessment
sir.

Then you go on to stress that if supporters do not have a
ticket then wh ate ve r they say they will not be allowed into
the ground.  -   A. Yes sir.

      A
           Q. That is obviously something on which you placed consider­
              able importance, the keeping out of non ticket holders.
              A. Kell with a 54,000 capacity then there is no room for
              anyone si.se wnen all che cickecs have oeen sold.

          Q. That is absolutely right, but does it follow from that, and
      B      from your emphasis in this document, that you were aware of
             the prcoc.biliuy that people would come without tickets and
             try to ^ 2 -. in? — «. I would say possibility that oeoole
             may arrive, but at that time when I gave that briefing"
             there was no information whatsoever from the intelliaence
             sources that people would arrive in numbers or larcre
             numbers without tickets.

          Q.   Is this not something which you anticipated?   - A. Not
               necessarily because bearing in mind we'had ta*en the
               trouble to write to the respective clubs to ask them to
               print in their programme our advice.   we had also used
               extensive publicity from all sections of the media to
               advise people not to come if they did not have a ticket,
               ana we wo uld hope that people generally would acceot that
               advice and not arrive.
      D
          Q. Perhaps che difficulty is you did not have experience, but
             did not experience of policing football matches tell you
             that t’
                   n ac hope was frequently not fulfilled? - A. If we
             refer to previous experience of this particular tie, that
             is tne semi-final cie, involving the two clubs lasc year,
             then I didn't know of large numbers of people from what Mr.
             Mole told me arriving without tickets.
      E
          Q. Were you aware that there had been complaints from
( 9          Liverpool about the allocation of the part of the ground
             '-hat waa allocated to tnem? — A. I was aware of the media
             publicity that suggested that Liverpool supporters were not
             happy with their allocation.

      F   Q. Didn't Mr. Mole tell you specifically about those
             complaints?   -   A. He told me that there had been
             complaints   and that there had been considerations, so I was
             aware or cnac, but ncc cnac numcers ot tans were cececrulned
             to arrive without tickets.

          Q.   Didn't you foresee the possibility    of that when you knew
               that there    was an under-allocation of tickets to the
               Liverpool side?     — A. It is a possibility but I can only
               work on information received, knowledge, and to take a
               course of action based upon knowledge and past experience.

          Q.   Do you get intelligence from other Forces as well as from
               your own experience?  - A. Yes.

          Q. About the habits of the fans from a Particular club?

         A. We as* for all available   information.

Q.    Because fans of particular clubs do have particular
      reputatic-s cc they not?  - 2 . Yss 1 a- sure t’
                                                     - =v
      They acquire reputations over a period.

Q. And they may be unfounded but they do have certain
   reputations, and this is something presumably which *"he
   Police go into.  -  A. Yes.

Q. Had you for example learnt oE the Cup Final I think in 1986
   when I believe there were problems with non ticket h o i c k s
   from Liverpool trying to get into the match and causing
   difficulties.  —  A. X was not aware of that.

Q. That I cninic was a matter of common general knowledge.   -
   A. Ir was a matter of general knowlege it wasn't knowl^dc^
   to me and 1986, with respect, is three years ago. '    ~'~'_

Q.   I rollow that.  -  A. The Police Service have to work upon
     current information that is available at the time.

Q. Yes, but this is information surely which is available from
   for example the Metrcoolitan Police.          1  / ,

           w   WOODWARD:   Sir I hesitate to rise.   It is not
      clear from the course this questioning is taking whether or
      net as a result of the investigations   that have bee"
      carried out by the West Midlands Police there~is
      information that snould nave been in oossession 06
     Sheffield, West Yorkshire Police (sic*) concerning the
     particular propensity for local supporters to arrive late
     or without tickets.   That is not something that has been
     canvassed in the letters of the Salmon Document that has
     been put to us, nor has it been part of the evidence so
     far of the witnesses who gave evidence for the fans.      In
     facu it was specifically denied, at least I think by one
     witness that there was a propensity to turn up late or to
     turn up without tickets.   We appreciate the soeed with
     which this matter is progressing.   If this allegation is to
     be crushed ve require to have oarticulars of        S''- .
     importantly so that we can investigate it or go to the
     detail of what is being put, we wish to have the
     opportunity of knowing what is said, but it may be that
     information is already got.   If it has already been
     obtained if my learned friend, counsel for the Inouiry, is
     in possession of it may we see it.   That will save us then

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           That they more than anybody
D                did this?

                 MR. WOODWARD        Indeed sir.

                 MR.   COLLIN'S     Sir I won 't pursue    that certainly at


    Q.   All I am asking you Chief Superintendent is whether you
         expected or anticipated that there was likely to be an
         appreciable number of people arriving without tickets and
         you say no you didn't anticipate that.  Is that correct?
         A. The intelligence report that I received gave no
         indication whatsoever sir.

    Q.   But it was- obviously a problem which you were aware of and
         wa nted to cater for, hence your reference to it in the
         briefing note.   -  A. I catered for it because there is a
         need for a flexibility of thought and approach.

    Q. You say:

                       "The ground has a capacity of 54,000.
                       It is an all ticket match, and all
                       tickets have been sold so there is no
                       room for anyone who doesn't have a
                       ticket because we will break safety limits."

         -   A. Yes

    Q. Which of course is the obvious point.  Then you deal with
       segregation and the arrangements for segregation.  Then you
H

                                                                                            D.G. DUCKINFIELD




                                           deal with the sterile area along the back of the South
                                           Stand.  That refers does it to the barrier that was set up
                                           just to the east of the Leppings Lane entrance to the
                                           grey'd.  -     If you taka a ccir.t frcrr. the River ^c" a-d
                                           trace it along the River Don towards the South Stand, then
                                           in that area there we created a sterile area with barriers.

                                      Q.   And we have seen from the photographs one of the barriers
                                           was just to the south I suppose of gate C.  - A. I can't
                                           say specifically but it was"in that'area.

                                      Q.   Then you deal with the colour coding of tickets, and I
                                           think copies were provided as you indicated in the ha nd ­
                                           written note.     You dealt on Friday with the routing of
         m                     c           vehicles and spectators.     You explain that.  The need for
                                           au]Uiumenc for extra time, pointing out that both wore red
                                           an d so this would give some problem of identification, and
                                           then you have said to the Inspectors what colours thev wear
                                           on une fi e 1 c .

                                                    v_V."Attention that this match will take
                                                      place without any public disorder and we
                              D                       must ensure the safety of the public."

                                           And   then you had said to the Inspectors and above

                                                       "both inside and outside the ground and
                                                       secrecate the ccocsinc? f;pc 11

                                           but for some reason you deleted the "both inside and
                                           outs id e the ground".  -   A. That was only the following
                                           day.    I would have given the whole of that to the
                                           Inspectors.

                                      Q.   I r o 1low that entirely.     -     A. I take your point.

                                      Q.   I wondered why you deleted the reference to "ensuring
                                           safety of the public both inside and outside the ground"
                                           when you gave the briefing to the troops.            - A. I "can't

                                           out for the Friday as well as the Saturday?  - A. Yes sir.

                                      Q.              "This will mean control by Police
                                                      Officers and in addition to ensure

This of course was the public order side                                      of the policina
is that right?  - A. Yes that is right.

And you deal with turn out and professionalism, you want
the public to be treated properly, transgressors to be deal
firmly, and then you say this:

          "I cannot stress too highly the word
          'safety'.   This ground will be full to
          capacity today and seme cf you may never
          have experienced a football match"of this
          nature.   Our job is to ensure the safety
          of spectators and you must make sure you
          know the escape routes, the problem areas
          and that you are fully conversant with your
          responsibilities should a crisis arise."

Now you refer   there generally to the escape routes, the
problem areas anc your Gtcicers and jr.en beir.g fully
conversant with their responsibilities should a crisis
arise.   Now the escape routes, that is relatively straight­
forward isn't   it because they are limited and fairly
obvious.   -   A. Yes sir.

Ana those are   matters which I imagine you would have
expected what, the Inspectors to have pointed out to their
individual serials?   -  A. If we go back to the Friday
briefing, the purpose of the Friday briefing was so that
people who ware there could be briefed by their
Superintendent and the Inspectors could in turn, before
they saw their respective Sergeants and Constables, could
wal< to tneir respective areas cf respcr.sibi 1 i tv, hcth
inside and outside the ground, and the intention was that
they would wal.c the Spion K o p , the-North Stand, the South
Stand, the walcways, look at the gates.      Not only the
gates on the perimeter track but the gates on the stands,
the escape routes, so that if a crisis arose they knew
exactly what they had got to do and they could brief their
Officers accordingly on the Saturday.

Now the problem areas.    What in your view were the problem
areas that needed to be identified?    -  A. First of"all
there was' the problem in the Spion Kop because there has
been previously fans w h o have obtained tickets for the
                         138
                                           D.G. DUCKINFIELD




opposing fans' end and on this occasion if Liverpool fans
had obtained tickets for the No ttingham Forest, which in
turn they did, then we had got a segregation problem in
that the Liverpool cans were iti wic.fi c.he 21, CC C 'ictzs
Forest.




                    /And arrangements   I think
                                              D.G. DUCKINFIET.D


 And arrangements _I think were made to cater for that in that
 there was a saall area on the Kop which was to be set aside
 and specially policed to contain LiverDool supporters who
 found themselves at the wrong end? - a *. Yes. PP° rt8rS Wn°

So tnat is tna first prooxem area,    What others? - a . in
addition to that, moving into the North Stand there is a
section of tue North Stand for Liverpool suDporters that
should be a ster ile area.   That is tickets allocated to I
think the FA, anybody the FA saw fit to allow tickets to.
There was a problem there there would be non-Liverpool
supporters in the North Stand axong with Liverpool supDorters
That would need looking a t .

Incidentally, were those people, those who were to sit at wna:
I imagine would be the east end of the North Stand, were thoc-
let in through turnstiles 77 and 78, I think? - A. I c a n ’t
give you a specific answer to that, sir.  I would have to
enquire.

The reason I ask that is if one looks at the bundle     that was
put in by Mr. Glas gow this morning at the turnstile    figures,
at page 166, one sees a total of nearly 400 in fact     through
turnstiles 77 and 78, which are two turnstiles that     give °
access to the North Stand.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     77 to 88 were the 12 that were
closed.

     MR. COLLINS:   'res, indeed, but if you look, sir, at the
figures on page 166 you will see against turnstiles 77 and 7£
there are figures given of ISS and 195 respectively:

Whicn sugges l s the u those two turnstiles were used to give
access to the North Scand, and I suspect, and I am surmising
and I would like you to think about this, I suspect the
arrangement was that was for the FA's guests, as it were, whc
would not need to be segregated from the Nottingham Forest
fans?

     MR. COLLINS:   I see Mr. Glasgow nodding.  I don't know
whether he can help as to whether that is in fact the case.

     MR. GLASGOW:   We believe that is the position,     sir,    but
I have not been able to confirm it- yet.

     MR. COLLINS:   Do you know? - A.   I c a n ’t give you an
accurate answer, sir.

Because we know those 12 turnstiles which would normally have
given access to the North Stand were in fact closed to
Liverpool su ppo rt ers ? - A. There were some closed on that
side, yes, sir.

I think the al lo cat ion to the North Stand of FA supporters was
somewhere in the region of 400.     We have got the exact figures
somewhere.  Page 139.     It is exactly 400, because the Football
                                  140


                                                           D.G. DUCKINFIELD


     A s s o c i a t i o n ’s allocation is 200, and Sheffield W e d n es da y’s
     allocation is also 200, as we can se e from page 139, to the
     North Stand.             So that does suggest those two turnstiles were
     spe cifically used for that purpose. - A. As I say, sir, I
     shall have to accept that.             I don't know.

O.   I do not know.      You c a n ’t help? - A. The true answer is I
     don't know.

 Q. Very well.   That is the second problem area that has been
    identified.   I am sorry, I did interrupt you.   Were you going
    to develop anything else about that problem? - A. I mentioned
    the point of non-segregation, about the cross flow of fans
    there.  There is obviously the problems of people invading the
    pitch from the North Stand.    You have almost 10,000 supporters
    there with little control in front of there.    Moving around to
    the Leppings Lane terrace, there is a situation whereby fans,
    as is eviden ce d in the advice to Serial 13, tend or have done
    in the past, not specifically Liverpool but fans have in the
    past gained access to the terrace and climbed up into the
r—-
    seated area.

          Moving around the ground you also get the situation where
     on the corner of the Leppings Lane terrace, the south corner,
     you get a situation again where there are Liverpool fans
     alongside a rsixture of what could be FA and Nottingham Forest.
     Strictly spe aking it should.be an FA allocation of tickets,
     but it is a very fine dividing line there, and it should be
     looked at.   Of course, there is the South Stand there where
     there is no fencing on the front there and people could corr.e
     on to the pitch.   There is also the problem, I would suggest,
     of the South Stand, which is a stand which has been there for
     many, many years, and there could be difficulties down the
     stairs because they are old staircases and what have you on to
     a car park.

O. You are s ayi ng there were access difficulties? - A. No, not at
   all.  I am saying that was an older stand where people would
   have to move down stairways, and it is an old building and
   narrow in some areas.    But it complies with the safety limits.

Q. You have not mentioned either of the Leppings Lane turnstiles
   or the pens on the terraces as being one of the problem area-
   you identified in your mind in this briefing note? - A. I take
   your point.  It was just that I was thinking you meant other
   problem areas we had not discussed this afternoon.

Q.   I am sorry.   Did you regard the turnstiles at Leppings Lane
     and the pens as being included within problem areas that you
     referred to? - A. Not a major problem area, because from
     previous experience, other than the discussions I had with Mr.
     Greenwood about the area, that it was not a major problem area
     because recen t evi dence did not indicate it was a problem.

Q. You say in yo ur briefing to both the Officers and the men,
   "the problem areas", did anyone ask you, or did you have
   questions afterwards or not? - A. Yes, but from 800 men they
                                                       D.G. DUCKINFIELD


tended to ask the. questions fro® their supervisors.

I fo ll ow that.     - A. No,    they did not.   N o —one   asked me any
questions.

Did any of the Ofxicers          as.<you any questions      about wnicn    were
the problem areas? - A.          No, sir.

Then you deal with their attitude.-

      "There will be a          tremendous atmosphere within the ground
      but   you must not        be caught up in this or the events that
      are   taking place        on the field.  You must remain detached
      and   clear-headed        at all times to respond to events".
- £ m V0c 4

■ihen you say you would have overall command but you had
delegated certain areas of responsibility to particular
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t s , and presumably you had identified those areas
to tne Superxntencents concerned? — A. Yes                 s i 7'

Then you say that Mr. Murray would command the control room,
Mr. Gr een wo od within the stadium, Mr. Marshall outside and Mr.
chapu.cn to the Nottingham outside.    Then ycu deal with the end
of the briefing:

      "Any difficulties or decisions within those areas will be
      taken by those Officers or to the Sector
      Su p e r i n t e n d e n t s 1'.

Then you deal with CID matters and then with trains.  Clearly
by the Saturday you knew the times of the expected arrivals? —
- A. Yes.

Then wit h transport arrangements with Nottingham Forest;
transport arrangements for Liverpool from Midland to the
ground.   Then you end by saying:

     "The Order covers most eventualities, and I can't in this
     limited time cover everything, but there will be
     additional briefings by your Superintendents or
     s up erv is ing Oific<=rs. Your inspectors nave nau a copy of
     the operational order and are fully conversant with what
     our intentions are today.      Let me just say this.  Firm
     but fair policing will be the correct attitude.      Safety
     of supporters in this ground is paramount.      Nobody gets
     in without a ticket. Nobody takes drink or banners into
     the ground and nobody goes in who is drunk".

- A. Yes,     sir.

Then you passed it on to Mr. Murray to supplement the
briefing, and I will ask him about that aspect.   So that was a
fairly general sort of briefing, was it not? - A. Yes, sir.

      below them to fill out so far as detail was concerned? - A.
      Yes, sir.

 O.   Following that briefing,   which took place, and we have now
      come on to the Saturday,   I think at 10 o ’clock in the morning?
      - A. Yes, sir.

 Q. And took what, how long in all about? - A. In my case possibly
    10 minutes, but I think the briefing overall was over in about
    20 minutes.

Q.    Did you remain while Mr. Murray did his part of the briefing?
      -A. Yes, sir.

Q. Erfectively he dealt, did he, with the emergency evacuation
   procedure? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And the coded message we have heard about.         - A. Yes.

0. He dealt with television and video, cameras in the ground and
   the EEC coverage. - A. I c a n ’t specifically remember that,
   sir, but if that is in his statement.

Q. He dealt with travelling arrangements.          He dealt with
   prisoners and ejections. - A. Yes.

Q. He dealt with alcohol.             He dealt with dealing with
   i n f l a t a b l e s , which is something which is relatively new in
   soccer crowds, is not it? - A. It is, sir.

0.    Flags and so on.  Again, on the whole, relatively general
      matters.  He did not identify any specific problem area?  That
      was left, presumably, to the Inspectors of the individual
      serials? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And then that finishes-the briefing, and I think you then went
   to speak - I am sorry, you toured the area then.  Does that
   mean you went outside the ground? - A. Yes, sir.  I spoke with
   the men in the ground who were sat in the stadium shortly
   after briefing.  I left and went in a Police car, toured the
   area and assessed the situation, arriving back at the ground
   somewhere in the region of 1.1S.

Q.    Did you then go into the Police control box at about l0-tc-2?
      - A. Yes, sir.

Q. What had you done between quarter-past-1 and 10-to-2? - A. I
   spoke with various Officers.   I ate a hurried meal at 1.30.  I
   left there to meet with Superintendent Murray to go and see
   the referee to discuss .with him our respective
   responsibilities.  That is the referee and the Police service.

Q.    I think you made some arrangements about stopping the match
      should it be necessary to do so? - A. Yes.

Q.    And that should have involved informing one of the linesmen of
      the need to stop the match, who would then go and inform the
                              143

     referee? - A. Yes.

Q.   In fact as we know that arrangement did not work as it
     happened, but that was the arrangement? - A. Yes, the
     arrangement was that a Police Officer at the tunnel would
     communicate with the linesman nearest to tne players   tunne^.,
     who would then indicate to the referee.  Unfortunately, that
     was not prompt e n o u g h .

Q. Yes.  Did you discuss at     all at this stage, or had you
   considered at this stage     the circumstances under which you
   might postpone kick-off?     - A. I had earlier during the build
   up to the operation, but     not earlier that particular day.

          MR. COLLINS:   I d o n ’t know,   sir, whether you would like
     to go into that tomorrow?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think that might be dealt with
     tomorrow morning.   We will break off until 10 o clock.

As far ss you k n o w , had he had any i nput int o the
operational order?                 A.    I cannot c o m m e n t upo n any
d i s c u s s i o n s he h a d w i t h Mr. Mole, sir.

Of course, but I am only asking so far as you were aware
and as far ss y o u were concerned.              A.        I .would discuss
with him g e n e r a l l y no r m a l policing m a t t e r s and matters
for the S e m i - F i n a l c r o p p e d up.

I see, but in no mor e than general t e r m s ?                    A.      No,   I
can't say t h e r e w e r e s p e cific issues.

Did you ask h i m a b o u t any possible a r e a s of d i f f i c u l t y that
might arise or sn y th i n g s that you s h o u l d look out for?
A.   No , s i r .

Because, of c o u r s e , he would have been a w a r e that you were
not as f a m i l i a r w i t h the ground c e r t a i n l y as Mr. Mole and
o t h e r s who w e r e i n v o l v e d under you.  A.      Yes, he was
aware but his a d v i c e and assistance was a v a i l a b l e .

 Why was it t h a t Mr. Jack s o n was in the C o n t r o l Box then
 at 2 o ' c l o c k ?   W h a t was his role there w h e n you went into
 the Cont r o l B o x ?       A.   When I arrived in the Control Box
 he was there, he wa s o b v i o u s l y        a s s e s s i n g the s i t u a t i o n ,
 look i n g at w h a t wa s taking place and f a m i l i a r i s i n g hims e l f
 and we had a g e n e r a l d i s c u s s i o n about that.

 Can you r e m e m b e r what that general d i s c u s s i o n .covered at all,
 any p a r t i c u l a r s u b j e c t that cropped up?       A.    Not
 s p e c i f i c a l l y , sir.       It was an excha n g e of words.,, much the
 same as b e t w e e n two Police Commanders.

 Was it really a n y t h i n g more than, "All s e e m s to be going
 well so far", t y p e of c o n v e r s a t i o n ? A.   I think that
 was it, g e n e r a l l y speaking.      It was a .esse, of, ."JU1 i s __

 How ' l o n g , in fact ,'‘did you' have this d i s c u s s i o n with h i m for?
 How long was he in the Box?            A.   It is d i f f i c u l t to say,
 sir, possibly 10, 20 minutes.

 W h i c h would m e a n that he would have left som e time around                          -

Q. Now where is it that you sit in the control box, Chief
   Superintendent.  It may be if you look on in the photographs
   you can indicate or may be we don’t have a photograph that
   shows it precisely? - A. It is better to refer to this
   particular one.

Q. Sorry, w h i c h one, the on e w e are already looking at? - A.
   N u m b e r 48 sir. G e n e r a l l y sp e a k i n g I would not sit anywhere.
   T h e r e is no room. Y o u h a v e to stand. Hr. Mur r a y v/ould sit
   to the e x t reme left w h e r e that sandwich box is. S e r g e a n t
   G o d d a r d w o u l d sit o p p o s i t e the blue tulip mike in the centre.
   P.C. Ryan w o u l d sit to his immediate right under the v i d e o
   m o n i t o r s and P.C. B i s h a r d w o u l d stand at the back in this
   area.
Q. N o w that tulip one, the b l u e one that you have r e f e r r e d to,
   is that the m i k e w h i c h c a n be used to cut into the T a n n o y
   system? - A. No sir, that m i c r o p h o n e is on the e x t r e m e right
   wh e r e the papers are by the right-hand window.

Q. I see, the one s ort of s t i c k i n g out from that bi t of e q u i p ­
   m e n t ? - A. Yes sir.
Q. W h a t is the tulip m i k e then? - A. That is the pe r s o n a l radio
   mike.
Q. If we look at P h o t o g r a p h 4 9 that shows actually the e xtension
   of the b e n c h we are l o oking at in 48 down to the left,
   d o e s n ’t it? - A. Yes sir.

Q.' An d shows three m o r e consoles, little white ones in the desk
    top itself. Are these for the relevant cameras 1, 2 and 3
    r e s p e c t i v e l y and 4? - A. I d o n ' t know the technical details
    sir.
Q. A n d it is that en d y ou w e r e telling us that Mr. M u r r a y sits?
   ’ - A. Nd, Mr. -Murray sit-s,        if we are looking at P h o t o g r a p h 4   to
     u s u a l l y over by th e left-h an u window near the door. ... ...

Q. I see, yes.        I b e g y o u r pardon, in front of that desk? -
   A. Yes.
Q. By the s a ndwich bo x in the corner.    I take it that Cameras
   1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 are all showing on those screens during
   all the time that the p e o p l e are coming into the match,
   are they? - A. Yes sir.
Q. So you just have to look up to those screens to h ave a
   view of the s i t u a t i o n s h o w n b y those cameras and you can
   ask p r e s u m a b l y for the c a m eras to be moved to pan round
   if you w a n t to s h o w any p a r t i c u l a r part of the t e r r a c i n g
   or the turnstiles at e i t h e r end? - A. Yes, there are
   limitations on some bu t o v e r a l l you can get a v e r y good
   v i e w indeed.

A n d o b v i o u s l y w i t h i n the s c o p e of their range? - A. Yes.

          LORD    J U S TICE T A Y L O R : Have I got this right, that
the m a s t e r   screen flicks f r o m 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 but can
be m a d e to     stop on a n y o n e of them if you want to? - A. I
d o n ' t know    sir, I have n o t g o t that technical knowledge.

         LORD J U S TICE T A Y LOR:      V e r y well.

            MR. COLLINS: A n y w a y , the important point is that
y o u have the f a c i l i t y there at any time to look at the
s i t u a t i o n at the parts of the ground visible from those
five cameras? - A. Yes sir.

If we go on to P h o t o g r a p h 51       and 52, those show the view
d o they not from the c o n t r o l         b ox on to the W est S t a n d and
terraces? - A. Yes sir.

A n d m o s t p a r t i c u l a r l y p e r h a p s 52 which shows that you have
a reason a b l y clear v i e w o n to those terraces? - A. Yes sir.
P r e s u m a b l y you have a p a i r   of field glasses in the control
box, do you? - A. No sir.

You don't? I t h o ught w e h a d some evidence that there                was
a p a i r of field g l a s s e s ? - A. If there is it is not             within
m y knowledge.

It w o u l d be a sen s i b l e t h i n g to nave, wouldn't it? - A. It
co u l d be advantageous, sir.

N o w by the time that Mr. J a c k s o n left, which we have identified
as b e i n g some time after 2 o'clock? - A. Yes sir.

W h a t was the state of p l a y w i t h i n the ground, by w h i c h I
m e a n were you able to g et some idea as to how people were.:
co m i n g - i n -and- h ow full .things seemed to -be..and- so.on?.
A. I             'conscious--'that a p p r o a c h i n g 2.30 after -Mr. Jack son
ha d left we had a 'state o f what. ! would describe as - -
n o r m a l i t y in that the g r o u n d was filling,most of the.- - '
N o t t i n g h a m Fore s t fans in the Spion Kop appeared to be
in the ground. T h e o t h e r areas of the Nottingham fans were
filling up and the N o r t h S t a n d seemed about half full. There
w e r e people on the L e p p i n g s L ane terrace and Stand and
there was a cr o w d o u t s i d e the turnstiles at the Leppings
L ane end.

N o w I w ant to ask you a b i t about that crowd outside.           I
think we heard f rom Mr. M o l e that the Operational Order
d i d not really m a k e any p r o v i s i o n to cater for the late
arrivals of fans to the L e p p i n g s Lane end because it was
not a n t i c i p a t e d that there w o u l d be a sudden surge,
late arrival.^ Is that ri g h t as you understand it? - A. Yes.

•You you r s e l f had not a n t i c i p a t e d the possibility of the
late arrival? - A. No sir.

Q. Like Mr. Mole.  It was clear, was it not, before 2.30 that
   there was some problems out of the Leppings Lane end? -
   A. No sir.
Q. Well we know that at 2.17 there was a radio message front
   Superintendent Marshall asking that Leppings Lane be
   closed? - A. I would dispute that time, sir.

Q. Well it is actually on the log so it is not possible to
   dispute it, is it? - A. I think that will found to be a
   mistake sir.

Q. what time do you say that that m e s s a g e came from Superintendent
   Marshall? - A. I b e l i e v e the time was nearly 2.30.

Q. Is that somet h i n g t h a t yo u can recall looking back on the
   timing? - A. It is a f a c t o r in my m i n d that the 2.17 time,
   whi ch I an aware of, b u t I don't believe to be correct.

Q. You know it is in the log? - A. Oh yes.

Q. What makes you think the log is inaccurate? - A. My own
   perception of the situation.
Q. Well that m a y be, b u t one's own perception of times is
   often m i s t a k e n as one kn o w s and that is why one tries to go
   to i n d ependent e v i d e n c e of timing. You will accept that
   as a general propos i t i o n , I imagine? - A. I accept that
   general proposition.
Q. W ha t makes you think that your perception is right and the
   log is w r o n g on this o c c a s i o n ? - A. Because I remember
   looking at the s i t u a t i o n a nd being conscious at 2.30 of
   events wh i c h I will r e l a t e and knov/ing that a message had
   been passed for L e p p i n g s Lane to be closed.               I remember
   looking at the m o n i t o r a n d w o n d e r i n g why it had been
   closed' a n d :in p a r t i c u l a r there was a South Yorkshire           - :
   P a s s e n g e r -Transport-bus pa-ssing and I-have---since seen             ;
   on t h e " c o m p i l a t i o n :v i d e o that -if my recollections a re..
   correct from the video, that is 2.31.
Q. I am not s u g g e s t i n g that Leppings Lane was in fact closed
   at 2.17, w h a t the log shows is that Superintendent Marshall
   requested first t hat it should be closed at 2.17? - A. I
   w i l l accept that the log shows that.

Q. You say that you t h i n k that is inaccurate and the request
   came later? - A. M y p e r c e p t i o n is that the request came
   later.
 Q. Because as I think a lso you know from the records and
    indeed from S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M a r s h a l l ’s own recollection,
    the request wa s not c o m p l i e d with immediately? - A. Yes
    sir.

Q. A n d o n e of the reasons for that was yo u were not able to
  _ m a k e r a d i o com m u n i c a t i o n with the O f ficers at the other
    end of L e p p i n g s Lane, not the r o u n d a b o u t en d with Penistone
    R o a d b u t the other end of Leppings Lane? - A. I don't k now
    the r e a sons sir.
Q. Bu t in any e v e n t the request to close LeppiT.gs Lane to
   tr a f f i c at w h a t e v e r time it came, was an indication, was
   it not, of pro b l e m s arising in that area? - A. No sir,
   we are d e a l i n g w i t h a football m a t c h and crowds who
   arr i v e and I w o u l d say that a h a p p y crowd does not necessarily
   m e a n a problem, b ut I take your p o i n t on that.
Q. Well it was not part of the plan that Leppings Lane should
   be closed, was it? - A. No sir.
Q. A n d as far as you were aware it was not something that had
   had to be done on previous o c c a sions? - A. Bearing in m ine
   I h a d o nly three weeks* experience there and not of a s e m i ­
   final, so" I c a n ' t comment about previously.
Q. Well d i d n ' t you ask Mr. Murray w h o had had that experience
   w h e t h e r this was something w h i c h was usual the closing of
   L e p p i n g s Lane? - A. No sir.
Q<. Yo u w e r e no t aware then w h e t h e r this was a usual or an
    unusual request? - A. No sir.
Q. Bu t it did suggest, w h atever else, that there were a large
   n u m b e r of peo p l e in-Leppings Lane, did it not? - A. Yes s i r .

Q. Wh o w e r e n ot able to be contained on the pavements? - A. Yes
   sir.
 Q. An d it did s u g gest and perhaps c o n f i r m w h a t y ou could see on
    y o u r video m o n i t o r that there was a considerable crowd, of
    p e o p l e - o a t s i d e the.-entrances. at Leppings Lane.-.spil-ljjig -out- -
    on to t h e -roadway? •- A. There was a crowd of people,., .yes
    sir.                            .                   . ..
 Q. You c o u l d see that on your m o n i t o r certainly by half-past-2?
    - A. Yes sir.
 Q. A n d it was c l e a r w a s it not b y then at the latest that there
    was or there w ere some difficulties in people being put
    into prop e r o r d e r as it w ere to get smoothly through those
    tur n s t i l e s ? - A. It was not clear to me, sir.
 Q.   W e l l c o u l d n ' t you see the mass of people outside? - A. I
      c o u l d see the peo p l e bu t I was not aware of the difficulty.

 Q.   A l s o by h a l f - p a s t - 2 you were aware, were you not, of the
      p o s i t i o n in the West" terracing, the Liverpool terracing,
      that there v/as a c o n c e n t r a t i o n in the centre, that is in

                  Q. You say in your statement that you asked for a Tannoy
                     message to be relayed at this stage or at about this
                     stage? - A. Yes sir.

                  Q. Which was, you say, for fans to move forward and spread
    (f*              along the terraces? - A. Yes sir.
      0
              B   Q. First of all was that Tannoy message put out? - A. I believe
                     so sir.  I gave the instruction to P.C. Ryan.

                  Q.    You were in the box? - A. Yes, I told him to put the Tannoy
                       message out.

                  Q. Bu t you c o u l d hear w h e t h e r he did or not, couldn't you?
                     - A. No sir.

cm                Q. C o u l d n ' t yo u hear him talking? - A . T o be specific no, but
                     there is n o i s e going on all the time.         I gave the inst ruction
                     to P.C. R y a n to give the m e s s a g e and P.C. Ryan would give

Did p e o p l e m o v e forward and to the sides? - A. I asked them to

Surely, if you thought it important to m ake the request you
w o u l d h a v e c h e c k e d to see if the request was effective? - A.
Yes, but t h e r e were people coming in all the time.

I k n o w t h e r e were.         Why did you think it n e c e s s a r y to make

saw the c o n c e n t r a t i o n of people, and I asked him to give
out a T a n n o y m e s s a g e for people to move forwards and
sideways.

What was it you thought might happen if the m e ssage was not
put o ut? - a . I thought there might be a build upT

Did you think that a build up might be d a n g e r o u s ? - A. It
could cause difficulties.            — —

What d i f f i c u l t i e s ? -   a   . Because people were not moving
forward.

Did you think a build up in the centre pens might create
d a n g e r s ? - A. Not at that stage, sir.

But you w e r e c o n c e r n e d enou g h to put out a m e s sage to" try to
get p e o p l e to go to the sides and to move forward in the pens
t h e m s e l v e s ? - A. to me it was an obvious course of action
looking at the situation.

Did it occur to you if it was important one way of achieving
that w o u l d be to send a serial of Police Officers to the back
of th e terrace to. t a k e physical-control an d direct-people t-e -
the s i d e s ? - A ..-I ^oid .not send, any Officers , -.sir. it -did-not
cross my mind.

Again, did it cross your mind if this was s o m e t h i n g which was
important, as c l e a r l y you thought it was, you might send
O f f i c e r s to the back of the tunnel to give directions to
people to go round the sides when they came in through the
t u r n s t i l e s ? - A. There were Officers in that area, sir, and it
was not full at that time.

I know, but you could perceive from the                 front there was a
potential p r o b l e m in that the centre of           the terracing was
f i l ling up and the sides w e r e not? - A.           Yes, but I think you
are m a k i n g m ore of a problem than there           was.

Yes. but there was enough of a problem for you to take action
by a s k i n g for T a n n o y ? - A. Yes, but that was a situation w h e r e
as ground C o m m a n d e r I looked at the situation, asked for an
i n s t r u c t i o n to be given, and it was given.

  0. I follow that, but in order to achieve something did it not
     occur to you you might have to take further action, and one
     obvious action is to instruction the Officers behind the
     turnstiles, part of whose duty - this is 14 and 15 - part of
     whose duty was to keep order on the terraces, to do something
     about it? - A. I did not an instruction, sir.

  G. I know you d i d n ’t, but why d i d n ’t you? - A. Because the
     thought did not enter my mind because there were Officers
     there.

  Q. O fficers c a n ’t be e xpected to do anything if they d o n ’t know
     the problem on the other side. They can't see through the
     West Stand, ca n they? - A. There is an I n s p e c t o r there and
     s u p e r v i s o r y O f f i c e r s who know that detail v e r y well indeed.

  Q. But they c a n ’t see through the West Stand, ca n they? -              a   . They
     are s u p e r v i s i n g the situation, sir.   -

  Q. But I repeat, t hey c a n ’t see through the              West Stand. You
     perceived a problem.              Unless you tell them, and you have a
     radio; you can c o m m u n i c a t e with the Inspector - unless you
     tell them, "Look, there is a problem b u ilding up. We have got
     a c o n c e n t r a t i o n in the cen t r e of the terraces.   Would you take
     some action, please".              Unless you do that t h e y are not going
     to be able ^to ^do it, are they? - a . Police Off i c e r s act on
     their initiative, and on this occasion they would have been
     mo n i t o r i n g the situation, but I did not g i v e a specific
     instruction.

 O. I fully accept that Police Officers are e x p e c t e d to act on
    their initiative, but it is a bit hard to e x p e c t them to g o                  so
    when they c a n ' t see what is happening, is net it? - A. They
    are aware of th e si tua t i o n in that area and t hey would be -
    aware of any build up.

• -O. I am sorry to press, .you, .Chief.Superintendent r -but h ow -oan -•
      they be a w a r e _-&£ the problem if they c a n ’t .see t h e -,pr-o bi-eis- - .
      because they ar e behind the stand and you ar e looking at it
      and the p r o b l e m exists in front on the t e r r a c e s ? - A . They are
      in that area and they would be aware of the situation.

 Q. But it is h a r d l y fair to expect them to be a w a r e and to take
    action if t hey d o n ’t know what they are e x p e c t e d to take
    action about, is it? - A. It is possible that a personal radio
    m e s s a g e was g i v e n to acquaint them, but I am not aware of
    that.

 Q. An y t h i n g is possible, but did you cause s u c h a message to be
    given to th e m ? -A. I personally did not, sir, but bearing in
    mind there are other Off i c e r s in that control room who may
    have taken inde p e n d e n t action as a result of my Tannoy
    message.

 Q. But you are the one in charge, and it is you who perceived the
    problem.  It is you who asked for the Tannoy m e s sage to be put
    out? - A. Sir, I g a v e instructions and other Officers who are

                                                                       D.G. DUCKENFIELD


     well trained c a r r y out t h o s e instructions, and if there are
     s u p p l e m e n t a r y a c t i o n s they carry t h e m out.

Q.    Yes, I see.           In any event, you were going out of the
     t u r n s t i l e s now.   Incidentally, before I leave that, how did
     you expect t hem to be able to spread out over the terraces? -
     A. By m o v i n g along through the gates.

0.    W h i c h g a t e s ? - A. The gates that w ere open at the back of the
     terrace.

Q. You w e r e aware from the m o n i t o r by this stage, and we are
   still about half-past-2, of the i n c r easing number of
   s u p p o r t e r s in L e ppings L ane and the crowd outside the
   tu rn s t i l e s ? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   "Crowd" is a fair word, is not it, at that stage? -                          a   . Yes.

0.    Did you wonder at that st a g e whether you would be able to get
     e v e r y o n e in by 3 o ' c l o c k ? - A. Yes, I spoke with
     S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Hurray, and on looking at the
     sp ace a v a i l a b l e inside the ground and the crowd
     outside, I asked him what he thought about the
     situation, and his words w e r e some t h i n g to the
     effect, "We have h a l f - a n - h o u r yet. W e ’ll get all
     th ose i n " .

Q. "All t h o s e " ? Tell me, you presumably m ade a mental assessment
   as to how full the ground was, at the Liverpool end? - A.- Yes.

Q. W h e ther you had got in about half, about a quarter, about
   t h r e e - q u a r t e r s or whatever? - A. Yes.

Q. What was your mental assessment as to the approximate numbers
    looking round the stands and the terraces that you had got in
    of the L i v e r p o o l s u p p o r t e r s ? - A. L o o k i n g at the North Stand
    it -was a p p r o x i m a t e l y - h a l f , full ,, but b e a r i n g in:-roi«d :th«se fans

Q. I follow that all that. - A. And the Leppings Lane terrace was
   filling.  I can't be specific, possibly half full.

Q. You must have thought to yourself, "We have got about, half,
   third, quarter, in already.               We have got about half, third. '
   two-thirds, t h r e e - q u a r t e r s to come", some sort of mental
   process like t h a t ? - A. I d id not flag up in my mind, "Half,
   quarter".  I just looked at the s i t u a t i o n and thought.

0. You have been t a l k i n g in terms of about half full? - A. Yes.
Q. So that s u g g e s t s that is what at least crossed your mind at
   the time, that it was about half full? - a . The North Stand.
Q. And the t e r r a c e s ? - A. Yes.

0. And the West Sta n d ? - A. No, I c a n ’t say.

Q. If it was a b o u t half it m e a n t you had about 12,000 to get in?
   - A. No, I d o n ' t accept t h a t . I said I can*t work on f i g u r e s .

Q. If - if - if it was about h a l f , if that was a rough g u i d e . a
   rough a s s e s s m e n t , then as a mat t e r of t h e r e were about 12,000
   peo p l e to get in, because we know there w ere about 24,000
   Liverpool s u p p o r t e r s ? - A. I would not have thought the figure
   of 12.000 was accurate.            You are tying me to figures and I
   c a n ’t be specific.

Q. No, I am not tying you to any figures.       I am simply pointing
   out as a m a t t e r of I think logic.... - A. I know the point you
   are making.

Q         if it was about half full then there w ere as a matter of
    fact - I am not saying this went t h r o u g h your mind - but as a
    ma tter of fact there were about 12,000 peo p l e to get in? - A.
    To be honest, sir, you h ave to accept that I looked around the
    ground and I did an assessment, and a figure of 12,000 that
    you are s u g g e s t i n g did not flag u p in my mind, and I did not
    think there was anything like t h a t .

0. I am w o n d e r i n g whether you ought to have thought perhaps in
   t h o s e terms w h e n you w ere asses s i n g w h e t h e r you should take
   any p o sitive action to p o s s i b l y pos t p o n e kick-off? - A. Just
   let me c l a r i f y the position.         I was d i s c u s s i n g with
   S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray the position inside the ground and
   outside.            Our perception was that those o u t side Could be
   got inside by the appr o p r i a t e time.

Q. Yes. but was this on the a s s u mption that the crowd outside was
   everyone, and there were not going to be any more added to the
   crowd as m i n u t e s passed by? - A. We assessed the situation as
   we saw it at that time.                       -

Q. -But you d i d appreciate, did you, that ;■thaT.-.-crowd that you -v.--v
    could s e s -on' t h e video x m the monitor was.:;not .necessarily .xhe.’.
  ^ wh ole of - i t - b e c a u s e there would be people coming and joining
    that crowd as th e minutes went by? - A. The information was at
    that time the traffic routes were clear and those people who
    were to a r r i v e were there in the vicinity.

G. But was not i t vital to try to get info r m a t i o n to see whether
   there were a lot of people still to come, still arriving? -A.
   I was not r e c e i v i n g any i n f ormation that there were more
   people to come.

O. Did you not a s k for that infor m a t i o n ? - A. No.

Q. Was it not v i t a l that you should get it? - A. I had got Sector
   C o m m anders w h o could advi s e me of the situation.

Q. But the S e c t o r C o m m anders away from the ground would not know
   that there was this crush b u ilding up at Leppings Lane, would
   they? - A. No, but they would know that peo p l e were walking to
   the ground.

Q. Unless you ask them b e c a u s e it Is a material situation, there
   is no r e a s o n why they s h o u l d tell you? Why should they tell
   you, "We have got people w a l k i n g d o w n " ?           That is an
   u n n e c e s s a r y m e s s a g e which will c l o g up the air w a v e s . won *t
   it? - A. S i r , the Sector C o m m a n d e r s are responsible for their
   areas.          If they see s o m e t h i n g u n usual they would report it.

Q. But it would not be unusual.           If p e o p l e are coming down to the
   g r o u n d at about 25-to~3 t h e r e is n o t h i n g particularly unusual
   about that, is there? - A. No, sir.

Q. You k n e w you had a p r oblem a l r e a d y at the gates because you
   could se e that there was a l r e a d y a crowd outside the Leppings
   Lane t u r n s t i l e s ? - A. Sir, you us e the word "problem". At a
   game such as this there is a crowd.             That does not necessarily
   mean a problem.

0. When I say "problem", t h e r e was a crowd of a sufficient size
   to m a k e you ask Mr. Murray, b e c a u s e you were worried about it,
   w h e t h e r you could get them all in by 3 o ’clock? -A. I don't
   say I was worried.

Q. Why d i d you ask him? - A. I was a s s e s s i n g the situation as an
   o p e r a t i o n a l Commander.

Q. Eut at least you must have had rai s e d                in your    mind aslight
   q u e s t i o n mark as to w h e t h e r you w o u l d  be able  to get them in
   by 3 o ’clock, o therwise p r e s u m a b l y you would not have
   bothered to ask Mr. M u r r a y the ques t i o n ? - A. I make
   a s s e s s m e n t s as the game d e v e l o p s and I made an assessment on
   that crowd there.

G.         L O R D J U S T I C E TAYLOR; Mr. Duckenfield, you said the log
     was w r o n g about when the r e quest was made to close Leppings -
     Lane? - A. Yes, my lord.

Q.   And I t h i n k you said.it was not a t . 2.17, it'was a b o u t 2.30? -
     A . Y e s , my Lord

Q.   S u p p o s e you are right a b o u t that, suppose it was 2.30, aces
     not thst in d i c a t e that s o m e b o d y wh o was on the ground outside
     the L eppings Lane e n t r a n c e t h ought at any rate at 2.30 that
     there was a p r oblem? - A. Yes, t h e r e was a crowd that was
     s p i l l i n g on to the roadway.

O.        MR. COLLINS:            All I am wondering, Chief Superintendent,
     and I shall I hope leave this s u b ject after this question, and
     it is this.         You were a w a r e there were people certainly by
     2.30, s u f f i c i e n t to spill out over Leppings Lane and cause
     problems in the r o adway? -A. Yes.

Q. Thus there was the request, and you could see on the v i d eos?
   Right? So there was a b u i l d up of people? -A. Yes, sir.
Q. To use a fairly neutral term, a build up of people at the
   Leppings Lane e n t r a n c e s ? - A. Yes, sir.

G. That build up you had to clear by 3 o ’clock? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You asked S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Hur r a y whether he thought you would
   be a ble to cl e a r t hat build u p by 3 o ’clock? Right? - A. Yes.

Q.   And he said, " Y e s ” , he thought          it would be'all right? -A.   yes,
     sir.

Q. In t h o s e c i r c u m s t a n c e s surely it was vital for you to
   know w h e t h e r there w ere going to be a lot more people coming
   to add to that build up in the minutes following 2.30, b e c a u s e -
   that would g r a v e l y affect, would it not, the q uestion of
   w h e t h e r you would be able to get them all in by 3 o'clock, if
   there were a lot m o r e people to come to join in on this build
   up? -A. It would.

Q.   It is e l e m e n t a r y that,   is not    it? -A. Yes.

Q.    In th o s e c i r c u m s t a n c e s why di d you not ask the relevant Sector
     C o m m a n d e r s at a d i s t a n c e from the ground to repo r t to you
     w h e t h e r there was still a lot of people a p p r oaching Leppings
     L a n e to add to that build up, because only if you knew that
     would you know w h e t h e r it was necessary to postpone kick-off?
     - A. If we look at the crowd situation at Leppings Lane at
     that time, I can e s t i m a t e w hat the crowd might be, and if that
     crowd outside, for a r g u m e n t ’s sake, was 2,000,.-and others were
     to come, then th e r e is still plenty of time to cope with
     ot hers com i n g in.

Q. But are you s a y i n g that your assessment that there was time to
   get all the peo p l e in, took into account the fact that there
   was still peo p l e lik e l y to c o m e down and add themselves to
   this b u i l d - u p ? You took that into account, di d you? - A. We
   took into account the fact the people we r e - t h e r e and there was
   a p o s s i b i l i t y of others coming.

Q / Did yo u s eek to "assess how roany others -or g e t - s o m e idea of -how
    many others w e r e to come? - A. No, sir.                          -

Q. Why not? - A. I did not ask the q uestion at that time, sir.

Q. Why n ot? - A. B e c a u s e the traffic routes were clear and I
   t h ought the p e o p l e w e r e there, and there was no inform ation
   c omi n g in that p e o p l e were comi n g to the ground in large

Q. But w i t h respect, C h i e f Superintendent, you are not going to
   get that i n f o r m a t i o n unless you asked for it, are you? - A. I

Pr e s u m a b l y you a s k e d h i m that because you w e r e c o n c e r n e d
as to w h e t h e r you o u g h t possibly to delay the kick-off.
A. No s i r , not s p e c i f i c a l l y .
Wh y did you raise it then if it wasn't in your mind as
some t h i n g which was a possibility? - A. As a new
C o m m a n d e r , and t h i n k i n g through many of the develo p m e n t s
in a s e m i -final tie, I asked him to clarify w i t h me the
s i t u a t i o n for d e l a y i n g k i c k - o f f s , and it was a general
conversation.

Did you not know t hen w h a t was the contingency plan for
d e l a y i n g kick-off, b e c a u s e it was your r esponsibility and
no-o n e e l s e 1s , to d e c i d e on whether kick-off should be
d e l a y e d w a s n ' t it? -     A. Yes sir.
Bad you not clear in your mind before you started what
w ere the c i r c u m s t a n c e s under which you would delay kick-
of f ? - A. As I s a i d earlier I had had a discussion with
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y and during the d a y , as w i t h many
things to clari fy my t h o u g h t s , I asked him for advice
once more.
W hy did you need his advice because you surely had already
m a d e the dec i s i o n of the circumstances under which kick-
off w o u l d be p o s t poned.               A. I discussed with
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y many things, and I, just discuss-ed
w i t h hi m that point to refresh my memory.                               -

And you go on in your statement to identify what you have
a l r e a d y g i v e n us in evidence, namely that you had
p r e v i o u s l y agreed t h a t if there was an identifiable
pr-o’o lem, for e x a m p l e a serious incident, an accident on
the m o t o r w a y , fog or something like that which prevented
la'r-g-e n u m b e r s of :fans arriving on time, :y,ou should con- ; -
sider deiayin-g the .kick-off- . - A. Yes sir. .            • • .-r
Y ou go on to say:

               "As o p posed to those who had been brought
               to the a r e a within a reasonable time but
               had c h o s e n not to enter the ground as soon
               as p o s s i b l e . "

     A. Yes sir.

That su g g e s t s that y o u had taken a policy d e cision that if
pro b l e m s arose due to late arrival of fans because they
ch o s e to arrive late you wouldn't postpone the kick-off.
- A. Y ou have got to be very careful in a situation such a
this w i t h regard to del a y i n g kick-offs.  Now if there is a
m a j o r incident then yes I would seriously consider
d e l a y i n g a kick-off as I have said.

I appreciate that it is a big step to take and it is an
unpopular step with the teams and no doubt with those
responsible for staging the match, but it is a matter of
common experience w i t h policing football.matches is it
not that people will try, if there is a build-up, if
there are"any problems at the entrances, you get
difficulties if people are pressing in to get in by kick-
off? - A. Yes sir.

You have potential c rowd problems.           -   A. Yes sir.

If vou get a large number of people wh o are not in the
ground by kick-off.  - A. Not necessarily.
They get frustrated apart from anything else, they are
liable to push, they are liable to try to take other
m e a s u r e s to get in on time. - A. If we deal with crowds
gener a l l y and oeople wh o are late for events, one would
imagine that they queue and form orderly queues ana
behave normally.
Are you a Police Officer speaking or ....               -   A. No I'm
a pplying a ge n e r a l i s a t i o n .
You may hope that, or imagine it, but it doesn't happen
does it? C e r t a i n l y not with football crowds.   - A. Bur
football crowds s h o u l d n ' t be different to anybody else.

Maybe they shouldn't, but it is a recognisable phenomenon
that if you want to get to an event on time you do all you
can to get to the turnstiles on time , and if there is a
crush and a crowd of people you tend to get pushing.  It
may be stupid but it tends to happen.  - A. It can occur.

 And 1it is 'something you should foresee. - A. As, a Police .
Officer   I can foresee the difficulties.. - ... ..  . . ..... .
 So you could foresee the problem that if there was a crowa
 of people still trying to get in through the Leppings
 Lane turnstiles at three o ’clock, or just before three o ’cl
 you might have a c r o w d control problem. - A. I might.

 And m o r e impo r t a n t l y you might have a safety problem
 because people can get crushed in that situation.            - A.
 If these people ace frustrated and they are pushing to get
 in.
 And that is s o m e t h i n g w h i c h you foresaw.   -   A. Not on the
 semi-final day.
 You foresaw sur e l y as something which might happen if you
 had a large number of people trying to gt in or still out
 at or about k i c k - o f f . - A. I think the point is sir that
                                                 D.G. DUCKENFIELD




there was a crowd at 2.30, there was a crowd of people who
w e r e trying to g e t in, an d there is potential for
difficulties, but I didn ' t foresee at that time from the
information s upplied to roe, that there would be any
difficulty.
Let me put it this way - I know you didn't foresee any
d i f f iculty but let me ask you this: you asked your
question of S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray at about half past two
as to whether he thought you could get them all in on
time. - A. Yes sir.
He said he t h o ugh t you c o u l d .   -   A. Yes sir.
If he had said, "No, I'm afraid we have got a build-up
hers, I don't think we w i l l be able to get them in in time,
we are going to have problems." what would you have done?
-~ A. I w o u l d have s e r i o u s l y considered delaying kick-off.

Exactly.   And why w o u l d yo u have seriously considered
delaying k i c k - o f f ? - A. Because the advice I was being
given was that there was a difficulty.
But why w o u l d you de l a y kick-off in those circumstances?
W h a t difficulty did you foresee, or what problems did you
foresee or w hat dangers did you foresee if you d i d n o t
delay kick-off? - A. W o u l d you rephrase that again sir?
You say that it Mr. M u r r a y had said to you, I don •_ tnink
we will be able to get all this lot in by three o'clock."
    A. At that stage I w o u l d have considered delaying kick-
off.
Why? - A. B e c a u s e if you can't get the fans in, and there
v a S ‘‘a consider-aole n u m b e r outside that weren 't getting .. -,:-
 tfhef’ey I w on I'd- 'have d e l ayed-the >cick —off.. - ...
 But for w hat p urpose? To accommodate the fans or because
 y o u thought that" there might be otherwise crowd control
 problems and d i s o r d e r oroolems outs ice, or a comoination
 of the two? - A. No. We are taking the point that -
 what I am saying is this:           if there were perceived
 di f ficulties that c o u l d have caused a major problem at
 2.30 and the a d v i c e I wa s being given is we should delay,
 I would have c o n s i d e r e d delaying.
      LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:     We are skirmishing.      Can I try
 and clarify:
 All counsel is aski n g is if you had decided to delay the
 kick-off a g a i n s t w hat risks would you have m ade that
 decision? Wh y w o u l d yo u have thought it right to do it?
 - A. If there was a dang e r to life and injury.
                                                       D.G. DUCKENFIELD




         MR. COLLINS:  Because that m i g h t arise if you didn't
d e l a y because of people trying to get, right? - A, Yes.

N o w why d oes it matter then w h e t h e r people have chosen to
arrive late, or for whatever reason, the fact is if there
is a b uild-uo outside that is what must trigger off the
d e c i s i o n surely. - A. If it is a build-up and it is going
to cause a p r o b l e m and they can't get in.
        vou say, and looking b a c k to your statement, that you
h a d agreed that you would postpone kick-off if there was
an identifiable problem which yo u have talked about, as
o o o o s e d to those who had been brought to the area within a
r e a s o n a b l e time but had chosen not        to enter the ground as
soon as oossible. What you appear                 to be saying is that if
they w e r e late because it was their fault you were not
g o i n g to de l a y kick-off. -A. If you read it              in that
liaht oer se it seems to say that I am lacking in
c o n s i d e r a t i o n for latecomers. I d o n ' t mean that.

W h a t it a p pears to be saying is that you had made a
d e c i s i o n that you would not delay the kick-off if the on.y
reason for late coming was the fans' own decision. Is
that right or wrong because that is what the statement
says? - A.           I accept that is what the statement says.

 I simoly w a n t to give y o u the o p p o r t u n i t y of clarifying
 t h a t / - A. I retain the flexibility to delay the kick-
 off.
 Anyw a y yo u decided at half past two tnat it waon t
 necessary.      By twenty to three the crowd had continued to
 increase.     -    A. Yes sir.
 S o   t h e '   si tu ati on did not get any better , it got worse,.         -
 A. Yes s i r .                                                    •
 And it wa s plain was it not by twenty to three that you
 w o u l d not ge t them all in in time? - A. No sir. It was
 plain that we had a difficulty at twenty to three.
 Now was the time, was it not, to postpone kick-off? -                        A.
 It m a y h a v e been a consideration sir, but at twenty to
 three I was o v ercome by events.
 What e v e n t s were you overcome by?            -A. The radio
 d e v e l o p e d a fault.
  Let me ask yo u a bit about that. Which radio developed a
  fault? - A. The personal radio.
  W hich m e a n t that you couldn't c o m m u n i c a t e w i t h who?   -   A.
  The P o l i c e Of f i c e r s in the ope r a t i o n a l field.
                                              D.G.    DUCKENFIELD




Well you didn’t need to communicate with them to postpone
kick-off did you? - A. No I could make that decision,
but I would require advice of the developing situation
outside.

But you could see the build-up.       You could see that
through the camera.  - A. I can       see a build-upbut I
can't test the mood of the crowd.

Mood of the crowd is irrelevant surely to the build-up.
The fact is that there is a crowd outside which has not
improved since half past two, in the ten minutes since
half past two, it has got worse, right? - A. Yes sir.

You were worried at half past two that there might be
difficulties in getting them all in by three o'clock,
although Superintendent Murray had assuaged those worries.
   A. I wasn't worried.  I considered the option.

You at least had some concern about it, otherwise you
wouldn't have considered the option, is that fair?
A. I considered the position.

It had got worse by 2.40?   -    A.   Yes sir.           ‘   ,

Therefore you should presumably have consideredthe option
again.  - A. I didn't consider it at that stage.

     LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:       I am sorry?   -      A. I didn’t
consider it at 2.40, sir.

     MR. COLLINS:   You say that the reason you didn't
consider it was because you were overtaken by events.
A. Yes s i r.

And the events by which you were overtaken were- the
breakdown of the radio communication.  - . A. Yes sir. Can
I set the scene sir? The theme seems to be that from 2.30
to 2.40 I was solely engaged on watching camera 1.

I am not suggesting that at all.      -   A. Well if I can set
the scene.

Yes of course.  - A. There are five cameras.   There were
other events taking place in the ground and there was a
difficulty with the infiltration of Liverpool supporters
on the Spion Kop and on the Spion Kop on the extreme north
corner there is a spur where fans can be accommodated and
there were Liverpool fans who had bought tickets-for the
Nottingham Forest End and they were in the Kop and that
was causing some difficulty, so that my attention was not
solely devoted to the events at Leppings Lane, I was
                                                        D-G.   DUCKENFIELD




monitoring other situations as they developed, and in
particular that problem as wall.

I fully accept all that and one of the problems of being a
Commander is that you have to apply your mind to a number
of different things at the same time don   you?  - A.
Yes sir.
Can I go back to your statement because what you say is
this:
                     "Between 2.30 and 2.40 the crowd con­
                     tinued to increase and I monitored
                     Liverpool fans on the Spion Kop ....

    - the matter you have just been referring to.                -     A.       Yes
    sir .
                     "and actions taken by Officers there."

    -    A. Yes sir.

    You ao on
                     nj examined the situation at the Leppin—s
                     Lane end of the ground from the CCTV
                     monitor and saw the increasing crowd
                     situation."

    -     A. Yes     sir

    So it is oerfectly plain, assuming that is accurate as I
    am sure it is, that'by about 2.40 - I am not tying you
    down to the exact m inu te - you were aware that the
    situation had' "worsened.      I am not suggesting you were
    looking at that the whole time and seeing it w o r se ni ng oat
    y o u w e r e 'aware that it has worsened.  - A. Yes sir.

     And th°r°Cors you were aware, I imagine, that there was at
     least a possibility, and I would suggest now a
     o r o b a b i l i t y , that you w o u l d not be able to get all v .h o s _
     in Sj t h r e e o'clock.         -     A. No sir.   I saw the increasing
     crowd and I thought at that stage we may get them in,
     b-aring in mind if you look at the figures you can move
     something l U e 5, 6 ,000 people in twenty minutes.

. What         figures?     - A. The Green Guide.

.       you   mean   750 per t ur n sti le?   - A. Yes sir.

.. And you had what, 23 turns til es available to               you.        -    A.
        Yes

Q.     And you had twenty minutes left .... - A. The figure is
     that if you work on 750 you possibly can get seven ai\d a
     half thousand in in half an hour if my figures are
     correct.

Q. You had twenty minutes left, so putting it crudely ....
   A. So you've probably got 5,000.

q   ....... you've got 23 times 250 which you can get in on the
      Green Guide basis in twenty minutes, and someone will tel1
      me in a moment ....

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Six to seven thousand.

          THE WITNESS:   So at twenty to three, if I have got
     six to seven thousand outside, I can get them i n, but in
     addition to that Sheffield Wednesday claim that they can
     move one thousand a minute through a turnstile and bearing
     in mind that these people aren't paying money, they are
     just pushing tickets through.

         of th a t, is i t          not?      A..    K ell,     I would say t h e r e i s space,
         sir.         If you look at          the bottom, with the boy h o l d i n g                       the
         Sc o t t i s h flag, he h a s        got his arms o u t s t r e t c h e d .

         I am not s a y i n g t h e r e is     no space.    That is why I used
         the wor d " p r e t t y full".          I do not say it fs c o m p l e t e l y
         jam packed.         A.     I w o u l d say, sir, at q u a r t e r to three
         if there is that s o r t of space in it, there is plenty of
         space .

         You would say that                s h o w e d plenty of space, w o u l d you?
         A    Yes , bearing                in mind we are r e f e r r i n g to a phot o g r a p h
         and a camera angle                that I have not got the b e n e f i t of.

          I fully a p p r e c i a t e that and I do not want to be unfair
          at all about this and I a ppreciate the limits of this but
          did you come to a c o n s c i o u s decis i o n at a bout this
          that you t h o u g h t t h e r e was plenty of space s till in the
          centre pens on the Wes t terrace?             A.   Yes, sir, I came
          to a d e c i s i o n t h e r e was room.

    J. I think you said p l e n t y          of room a moment ago.                             A.     It is
       arguable.            Let me just say that 1was a s s e s s i n g                      the
       s i t u a t i o n and t h e r e was room.

Q.        But the major p r o b l e m that faced you                    at that stage was
          the L e p p i n g s Lane t u r n s t i l e s . A.             Yes, sir.

^                                p r ^ l e m , was it not, by new?                      A.      It was
          becoming         a p r o b l e m at quarter to three.

    Q.     By   quar t e r     to   three    it was clearly          a problem.                 A.        Yes,
           sir.

    Q.     And it was p l a i n by then              that     the b u i l d - u p was i n crea sing
           rather than d e c r e a s i n g .          A..                      Yes,, sir.    •. . •

    Q.     D e s p i t e the    fact       that people        were co m i n g        t h r o u g h the
           turnstiles.            A.         Yes, sir.

    Q.     And you were a n x i o u s , no doubt,                to d i s c o v e r      what       the
           positionwas?       A.       Yes.

    Q      I think you got a m e s s a g e , did you not, at round about this
           time from S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall outs i d e a s k i n g for the

           outside to r e l i e v e the p r e s s u r e upon the turnstiles.
           A.   Yes, sir.

     Q      And this was, no doubt, beca u s e you a p p r e c i a t e d that a

                                                          D.G. DUCKE'rJFIELD


                  Q. But you did not know that at the time, did you, that is to
                     say you did not know that individual Officers were telling
                     people that the kick-off had been delayed? - A. It was
                     becoming apparent that people were not responding to
                     Mr. Marshall or other Police Officers' directives because
                     that situation would not have arisen.

                  Q. Did it not occur to you that one of the reasons why they
                     were not responding might be because of their anxiety to
                     get in to the ground before 3 o'clock because we are now
                     approaching close to 3 o'clock and it is perfectly plain
                     to anyone stuck in that crowd outside that there might
                     be problems in getting in? - A. I can understand it if
                     someone arrives at that situation at that time, at that
                     late hour, that they may believe they won't get in.

                  Q.   In those circunstances surely it must have occurred to you
                       that to delay kick-off might well be to take one way of
                       taking the anxiety out of the situation for those wanting
                       to get in and thus making them hold back, have some reason
                       to hold back? - A. Sir, at that time the crisis situation
                       that there was took all my concentration.
              D
                  Q. But you were trying to resolve that crisis? - A. I was.

                  Q. And all   I am suggesting is that your best weapon to
                     resolve   it was delay the kick-off? - A. I aid not consider
                     that my   best weapon at that time was delaying the kick-
                     off.  I   was trying to assist Superintendent Marshall.

              E   Q.   'What did you think was your best weapon? You must ha*vre
                        had some idea as to what you might do to try and alleviate
                        that situation? - A. It was the Tannoy messages; it was
                        the public address system and sending extra Officers to
                        assist to calm the crowd and to get them to move back.

                  Q. You felt I imagine, or did you feel that this situation
                     had been created because people had not arrived on time?
              F      - A. Yes, there was a large crowd that had obviously
                     arrived very late.

                  Q. So you thought effectively:  "It is their own fault they
                     are stuck in this trouble" did you? - A. Sir, in a
                     situation such as that you never think things of that
                     order.
              G   Q . You see you have referred yet again to   there being "no
                      major incident", no reason.  That must   have had some
                      effect on your thinking? - A. No, as a   Police Officer I
                      was responding to that crowd situation   then and very
                      concerned about it.

                  Q. Anyway 2.47, I think it is, we have the first request
                     from Superintendent Marshall to open the gate. Right?
                     - A. Yes sir.

And you are still considering the question of postponement
of kick-off, among other options? - A. It is an option sir,
but when he asked   me to open the gate that certainly was
not going through my mind.

Now when he made that request what was your-immediate
reaction? - A. To be honest I did not want to open the gate.

Why not? - A. To open a gate at a footballground it would
have defeated the   objectives of our Operation Order in
that drunken fans may get in? people who had got drink;
people who had got missiles and people who were without
tickets would get access.

Were you aware by now that there was a problem with a number
of people outside without tickets? - A. I was aware that
during the day there had been people without tickets.

But were you aware that there were a considerable number
of fans at the Leppings Lane entrance who did not have
tickets? - A. I was not aware sir.

Because I think a lot of statements, or a lot of evidence
we have heard and certainly a lot of statements that I have
read, refer to considerable numbers of people without
tickets and asking for tickets.  Is that something that
had not been drawn to your attention? - A. Hot at that
stage sir.

Because that was rather an important factor, wasn't it,
because if there were a lot of people milling around
without tickets that was something which would have added
to the disorder- or the problems rather outside? - A. In
what respect?

Well if you have a lot of people milling around in a
s n a i l area -who are without tickets coupled -with people .
coming along trying to get into the ground., you acd to
the problems don't you, because you have cot more people
there? - A. I would suggest that there are people there,
there are probably people without tickets.

I see. - A. But the crowd difficulties are there whatever.

Anyway you were reluctant to agree to the gate being
opened because of the factors you have identified? - A. Yes
sir.

Were you able to make direct contact with Superintendent
Marshall or not? - A. I remember receiving a radio message
but having received the radio message from him, or it
came into the Control Box to open the gate, I immediately
looked at the monitor for the Leppings Lane turnstiles and
as I did so I would describe it as the gate burst open.
I have since found looking at the compilation that might

                                                             D.G. DUCKENFIELD


         A
                  not be correct, but my perception of the situation when the
                  first request was made and whilst I was considering it,
                  was that "the gates burst open anyway, why am I being asked?"

             Q.   The gate w as in fact o p e n e d on that occasion, as         w e now know
                  to ej ect so me one ? - A. Yes.
         B   Q..I can u n d e r s t a n d how you m a y have made a mistake, b ut it
                  was not o p e n then for more than a few s e c o n d s , was it? -
                  A. No, it wa s momentary.             The mou n ted Offi cer came along
                  and r e c o v e r e d the si tu a tio n and the gate was close d once
                  more.

             Q. So it was clear, indeed it was obvious to you that that was
         C      no thing to do w it h you, you had made no decision? - A. I
                had made no dec is io n sir.

             Q.    Indeed am I right     that no gate wo uld have been ope ned unless
                  you mace the de ci sion and instructed? - A . Yes sir.
     ¥
             Q.    Is that some t h i n g      that was in the briefi ng or is that some­
                  thing w h i c h w o u 1d have bee n known to all? - A. It would have
     K   D        bee n k now n to all s i r .

             Q.   So if b ut on l y if you gave the in struction could    a gate be
                  opened? - A. In an em er g e n c y situation that is right, sir.
     U
             Q.    And this w a s   of course an emergency situation bec a use as you
                  quite -rightly po int out, one of the problems- of opening a
                  gate is y o u let in a who le lot of people unsupervised? -
         E        A. Yes sir.

             Q.    But the ga te was opened, as you say         for a few seconds
                  momen ta ri ly , and then shut again? -       A. Yes sir.
€•
             Q . This is 2.48 I think on the timing that we have or thereabouts.
                 'You then g'et '"anothi&r -message from Su pe rint end ent ~«arsh£l/l-5 -^-.' .
         F        - A. Yes sir.

             Q.   A g a i n he asks for the gates to be opened, but he goes does
                  he rath er fu rther on that occasion? - A. Yes the situation
                  was d i f f e r e n t then s i r . The first mes sa ge I w o u l d describe
                  as a request.          The s e c o n d mess ag e was a rather ur ge nt message
                  and more of a demand and he asked for the gates to be opened
                  and c o u pled it wi th the wor ds similar to the words:              "If you
         G        d o n ’t open these gates so meb od y is going to be seriously
                  injured or killed".

             Q. Now you had had that fir st me ssage at 2.47.   You had seen
                the gate o p e n and close again? - A. Yes sir.

             Q.   S u r e l y the fir st thing yo u wo uld do in those ci rc umstances
                  is to try to con ta ct S u p erin ten dent Marshall and speak to
                  him d irec t if you could to ask him wha t actual ly v/as the
                  situa ti on ? - A. Sir, if I can set the scene, a v e r y tense
                  situa ti on in a Police Con trol Box.       A message came across
                                   38

                                                D.G. DUCKENFIELD


     to ope n the gates w h i c h is contrary to w ha t you w oul d n ormal ly
     do and w h e n the situ at io n was recovered and retrieved I was
     still c o n s i d e r i n g the situation intently and the second
     messa ge came p r i o r to me being able to ask him w h a t the
     sit uati on was.

Q. Does it f o l low from that that the second me ssag e from
   Mr. Mar sha ll came w i t h i n seconds of the gate b eing closed
   again? - A. I can't be specific about times sir and I am
   not b e i n g unhelpful.

Q. No, no, I w o u l d not e xpec t you to be precise. - A. The fact
   is that the ten sion of the situation at that m om ent in that
   Control Box and the situa tio n that I was facing was such
   that the first sit uat io n develop ed and I was then into the
   second situation.

Q. But it was a dra stic m e a sure to take to open the gates? - A.
   Yes sir.

Q.   It was so me t hin g v?hich was, as you appreciated,          likely to
     cause pot en tia l pr oblems inside? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Reall y to tra ns fe r the out side problems inside if you we r e
   not car ef ul ? - A. You have got to be very careful indeed.

Q. Exactly.            In those circumstan ce s all I am asking you is this:
   didn't you c onsid er it vital, if you could, to contact
   S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall over the radio and say to him or
   ask him quickly:               "What the hell this was all about?" - A.
   At that time sir I did not contact him because there w asn 't
   time.

Q.    47 is the first time that he rings in or radioes in.
      We kn ow the gate is not ac tu ally open on your instruction
      until five m i n u t e s later, 52.         5 min ut es is quite a long
      time, -1'sn't - i t ? A . -'Sir you c a n ’t tie the -time's, down in         .
      a si tu at io n such as this.       I appreciate what, i t says.t.oere. ,
      in terms o f times -and logs, I am talking about a situ at io n
      that on l v I was there and can relate to and the situation
      that d e v e l o p e d was such that Hr. Marshall came w it h his
      first recuest, I looked at it.                It was a decision that^
      to be h o n e s t I did not p a r t i c u l a r l y want .t o make and^ the ^
      cate b u r s t open and it wa s retrieved.             I was still th inxing
      through the situa ti on w h e n the next request came.

 Q. All I am w o n d e r i n g is that one woul d possibly have thought,
    and I m a y be speaking p u r e l y as a layman and I app reciate
    I was not there and I do not know the situation that you
    were in precisely, but one mi g h t have thougnt that your
    fix"st re act i on on recei vi ng the mes sage j.rom Superintendent-
    Marshall was to e n dea vou r to cont ac t him to ask him w h a t
    on ear th this was all about, why he was making this request,
    what the situa ti on was? — A. Sir, in this situation it is
    easy to analyse.          All I am saying to you is I did not have
    the time bec ause of the situation.
                                             D.G. DUCKENFIELD


Now we know in feet you had five minutes? -               A.   I disagree.

I am sorry, Superintendent, but there is no way you can
disagree b e c a u s e we have the timings, that the original message
came at 47, your decision was not implemented till 52 and
it was implemented pretty well immediately you made it,
wasn't it? - A. Forgive me,my Lord, I don't-wish to appear
di sc ourt eou s or disbelieve the timings.    I have a sequence
of events in my mind that is clear and that is accurate and
when I say to you I d o n ’t believe the timings of five
minutes, that is not m y perception of the situation. The
situation w as a developing one, fast moving one and I have
no perception of the times.

      LORD J U S T I C E T A Y L O R : You mean you are not ch a l l e n g i n g
the times b u t it did not s ee m that long? - A. Yes m y Lord.

Is that w h a t you mean? - A.       Yes, my Lord.

       MR. COLLINS:      That I can well understand and sympat hi se
with.    T h a t is not an issue.    All I am pointing out is that
as a m a t t e r of fact you did have five minutes or up to five
minutes w h i c h is ac tu al ly time enough? - A. Sir, it did not
seem like five minutes to me.

But in any ev e n t part of you r thinking m us t have involved
surely:    "If we do open the gates w h a t is going to happen,
v/hat is g o i n g to happen inside?" - A. Yes sir.   I think more
of that cam e w he n the s eco nd req ue st came.

Certainly.   I fully un d e r s t a n d that. Nov/ you knew, d id n't
you, that if Gate C was opened, and that was the gate I
think that this was all ab o u t at that stage? - A. Yes, my
viev; of the situation was p ur ely on Gate C from the vid eo
camera.

But t!iat v a s the gate, as you un derst an d it, that the request.^
related to,- o r both re quests related to"?     A.',Yes, and that
was b e c ause that was the on l y pne I could see and -I was
looking at that.     He asked for the gates to be openec.      That
was the one I was c o n c e n t r a t i n g on.

For w h a t e v e r reason you tho ug ht that Gate C was the one wh i c h
was going to be opened, if any? - A. Yes sir.

You must ther ef or e have ap p r e c i a t e d that if people came in
through Gat e C they w o u l d have to go somewhere? - A. Yes
sir.

The only p l a c e that they w o u l d be likely to go was down
that central tunnel? - A. T h a t is a po ss ib il it y altho ug h
they cou ld have gone in other areas of the ground.

 I know it co uld have h a p p e n e d bu t looking at it se nsi bl y
 that is the on ly reas ona bl e w a y that m o s t of them w o u l d
 go having rega rd to the lack of d i rect ion in signing?

A. Sir, a t that tine I d i d n ot give that a consideration.
I was looking at G a t e C and con sidering ....

You mu st ha v e thought:       “W h a t is going to happen w h e n they
get in if we open the gates?" because you did n ot w a n t to
transfer the d a n g e r o u s sit uat ion from outside to inside,
did you? - A. No sir.

       LOPvD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:  Sorry, did you say that you did
not c onsid er wh e r e these peopl e would go when the gate was
opened? - A. N o sir, at that stage when the gate was opened
I was just looking.          If I can take this matter a stage
further I can give a more informed reply about the second
consideration.         Are we on to the second gates ....

       M R . COLLINS:     Well you had the first request? - A. Yes.

You had the m o m e n t a r y opening, burst in, shutting.       It is
quite clear to you f ro m that quite a large nu mb er of people
came in.   You co ul d see them disappearing towards the
central t u n n e l , c o u l d n 't you? - A . I could see them d i s ­
appearing .

The dir ect ion they w e r e dis appea ri ng in was towards the
central tunnel.     Off the right of the video w ha t they were
not doing was go ing round to their right, that is to say
round the top of the W e s t Stand, your Control Box side”
of the we s t Stand, they wer e not going round that w ay
on the whole, w e r e they? - A. I can't give you. an accurate
answer sir.    I am not be ing difficult, I just ca n' t recall.

If you we r e looking at the vid eo when they came in that
is what y ou w o u l d have seen? - A. When I was looking at
the video I was lo oking at the gate and more concer ne d
about the s i t u a t i o n there and the gate o p e n i n g .

But w h e t h e r o r not you fully a p p r e cia ted it you .presumably
gave some’ t h o u g h t ‘t o wh a t w o u l d happen to them whe n you
opened the gate, w h a t wou ld be the result of open in g the
gate inside? - A. No, let me just stop the situation,                   '.’hen
the first request w as made for the first gate to open,
it was o p e n e d and c l o s e d and having closed the gate and
recovered the sit uati on the thought proce ss es abo ut that
p ar tic ul ar gate and the fans stopped because then I was
into the n ex t s itu ati on and this is where I dev elo ped
the thought process.

Let's take it from there.            This is ve ry shortly after
you have had the first in rush, if I m a y call it that.
You have a r e p e a t e d requ es t in more u rgen t terms from
S u p e r i nt ende nt Mar shal l to open the gate? - A. Yes sir.

And you hav e then to corae to a decision, and a qui ck
decision, as to w h e t h e r or not you sho ul d comply wi t h
that reque st ? - A. Yes sir.
                                        D.G. DUCKHNFIELD




Now the way it is put, that is going to be a gate opening
which probably is going to lead to quite a lot of people
coming through? - A. Yes sir.

By quite a lot I mean up to 1,000? - A. Yes sir.

How they have got to go somewhere and you mus t have applied
your m i n d to wh er e they w o u l d go when they got through^ that
gate? - A. W h e n that seco nd request came, that is when I *
started to thinr. v ery serious ly about where they wou ld c o .

Exactly.   Wh at did you do to cater for that possibility,
the gate had to be o pe ned and there would be an in rush
of 1,000 or so peopl e to go somewhere? - A. Let me take
you back to the tho ught processes prior to the crowd
rushing in so that you can understa nd w hy I cave the
decision b e c au se I think that is important.

Yes, of course. — A, VJhen the next mess ag e came in, as I
said itjwas an ur ge nt re quest from Super in te nd ent Marshall,
a demand, and he said:        “Ope n the gates or someone is coinc
uO oe s e r ious ly injured or killed".     No w v/hen that came in

and I looked at the sit uat ion and outside the turnstiles at
Leppings Lane there was a large crush of fans.           There was
people bein g crushed a g a ins t the walls and they were not
responding to Police advice, for wha tev er reason.          The
message I was r ec ei vi ng wos if I did not open the gates,
as I have said, death and serious injury.           Being an
ex pe ri en ce d Officer, even wit h limited experience of Sheffield
Wednesday, the co nse quen ces of opening the gates cross your
mind.     if you open the gates then as pe ople'burst through
those gaues th ey can j.all, they can stumble, there can be
crushing endin j u r y .

         -Or looking at the situation there is a large'concourse
area on the inside of those gates that can accommodate I
c o n 't k no w how m a n y but let us say 1,000 or 2,000 people,
m ad di tio n I could see obvious space at either end of the
Leppings Lane terrace and I took the viev/ that Su per in te nd en t
r.arsnal 1 WcS tel ling me that unless j. open ed the gates there
would be serious injury and possible de at h and I thought well
whils t I wo u l d not w i s h to comply there is only a p oss ibil ity
,
-hai- people may, I say m a y be crushed or seriously injured
and as a result of that X considered that X had no option
and I said that if life is at stake, if there is likely
to be serious injury or de ath outside X have no opt io n bu t
to open the gates.

Q. Now, I think that ce rt ain ly so far as I an concerned I d o n ’t
   seek to c r i t i c i s e you for d eci d i n g that the gate should be
   opened, that y o u should c omp ly wi th Superintendent M a r s h a l l ’s
   r e q ue st b e c au se of the si tu a tio n outside, but what I do
   su g g est is you sho uld have tak en steps to have a reception
   c o m m i t t e e for the inrush.        That is to say, you should hav e
   taken some steps to ensure that when they came in they went to
   the r i g h t place. - A. In a perfect w o r l d , sir, I accept, but
   p i c t u r e the scene.          A request being made of a Chief
   S u p e r i n t e n d e n t , a request the likes of which has probably
   never been m a d e b e f o r e , and the consequences of that are qu i t e
   serious.

Q. Of c o u r s e . - A. And bearing in mind we had had radio
   d i f f i c u l t i e s , and for me to implement those steps that you
   suggest, I would hav e to d e l a y . I would have to identify
   serials, I wo ul d h a v e to pass radio messages, to get an
   a c k n o w l e d g m e n t , to get the serials to move from their location
   to the loc ati on I was directing, and if I was to take the rime
   to d o that I could lose life and there would be serious injury
   on the o u t s i d e .

Q. C h i e f S uperin te nde nt , how long did you delay in thinking about
   w h e t h e r you should open the ga te ?   Can you help us? - A . On
   the s e c o n d o c c a s i o n , sir?

Q. Yes. - A. The time it takes to think through the options that
   I h a v e just d e s c r i b e d . 3 0 s e c o n d s .

•Q. As s h o r t as that? - A. It is diff ic ul t to s ay .             You d o n 't time
    y o u r s e l f in situ ati ons such as t h a t .

Q.     B e c a u s e was not S upe r i n t e n d e n t Murray moved to ask you whe th er
       you w e r e g o i n g to permit the gate to be opened? - A. Yes, the
       r e q ue st came in, a n d Su pe rint end ent Murray was holding a
       p e r s o n a l radi o at that t i m e , and it was on talk-through, wh ic h
     . to r e m i n d you. mea ns that e v ery body can bear, it,            .Everybody can
       hear the radio, transmission. . I suppose to hist it was obvious
       I was d e l a y i n g , not de lay in g u n n e c e s s a r i l y . — - -           ;

Q.    It w a s a d i f f i c u l t d e c i s i o n . - A. But a decision of that
      magnitude, and I r eme mber he held the radio and s a i d . "Mr.
      D u c k e n f i e l d , are you going to mak e that d e c i s i o n ? ” , and there
      was a d e l a y , but to be h o n e s t , s i r , in a crisis situation such
      as th a t you are thin kin g of the decision as opposed to the
      next action.

O. Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d , I t h i n k , spea ki ng for m y s e l f , there will be
   en or m o u s sym p a t h y for the di le mm a in which you were p l a c e d ,
   but you had as the O f f i cer in charge to think of the
   c o n s e q u e n c e s and to try as best you could to cater for the
   co ns eq ue nc es , did not you? - A. Y e s , s i r .

Q. You d i d not tell or c a u s e , for e x a m p l e . the club chief
   st e w a r d to be told that the d ecisi on might be made to open
   the g a t e s , did you ? - A. I t ak e you up on that p o i n t , s i r .
   M r . M u r r a y tr ie d t o con ta ct Mr. Locke on the c l u b ’s pers on al
                                                        &A-..DUCKENFIELD

radio system.

And d i d not get through? -     A.    And did not get through.

Did you ask Mr. Murray to tr y to contact? -A. No, sir.        As I
have sai d e a r l i e r there are actions that individuals rake of
their o wn accord.

So you kn e w the n that wh e n you decided the gate should be
opened the club did not know that that decision had been made?
- A. No, sir.

So they we r e una w are of w ha t was going to happen? - A. Yes.
sir.

So far as the Foli ce were concerned, that is the Police at and
about the Lepp in gs Lane concourse, they were not informed in
advance,             we re they, that the gate was going to be     opened? -A.
No, sir,             but we may be abl e to presume, and as I say I     have
not s ee n oth er O f f i c e r s ’ statements, that bearing in mind the
radio is on ta lk -thr oug h so that everybody can hear i t , and
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall had made the request for the gates to
be o p e n e d , and we in t u r n , that is the control room, gave
pe r m i s s i o n for them to be o p e n e d , I can only assume that the
Of fi c e r s who we r e in that location who had personal radios
were bec omin g aw a re of the dev eloping situation and would
respond, to i t , but I did not give a direct i n s t r u c t i o n .

What on ea rt h could they be expected to do?             Even assuming
they heard the mes sa ge from Mr. M a r s h a l l , how could they be
e xp e c t e d to antic ipa te yo ur response to it or to know what
they mi gh t be able to do to cater for it? - A. It is
dif f i c u l t . If they saw p e o ple coming in they could direct:
t h e m , but I c a n ’t ant i c i p a t e their actions.

You s e e ,     you knew by n o w , did you n o t , that there were spaces
at the. ends of the terr a c i n g but that it was pretty crowded in
the m i d d l e s e ct ions ? -A. Yes, sir.        -             ~-  ■

You knew that the tunnel, the central tunnel,               gave on to those
two m i d d l e sec t i o n s ? - A. Yes, sir.

You knew by new that it was          1 0 - t o , after 10-to? -
A. A p p r o a c h i n g kick-off.

You knew when p eop le got in they were likely to get to their
po sitio ns in or der to w a t c h the match as quickly as p o s s i b l e ,
becau se you we re g e t ti ng c l o s e to kick-off? - a . Yes, sir.

You knew, therefore, that they were likely to take the most
ob vio us route to the t e r r a c i n g ? Right? - A. They would take
the eas ies t route, sir, yes.

And you kn ew that the e a s i e s t route was that central tunnel? -
A. Sir, at that time you m a y suggest it was a consideration.
At that time my mind was filled w it h the other events that
were taking place.

By all m e a n s , please. - A. The situation is that whilst I am
considering, w h i l s t I am in the situation of saying, "Opens
the gates", about that time, and I can't put it either before
or after be cause m a n y things are happening at one time, but I
remember hea ring a r a d i o mes sage from someone saying, "If you
d o n ’t open this g a t e it is going in anyway", and I was advised
that was A gate.

Can you remember who advised you? - A. Well, it is only I have
learned since, but I un derst an d there was a Sergeant Higgins
on Serial 20 who was behind A gate, which is the gate nearest
the shops on Ve r e R o a d .

That gate right on the corner there? - A. Yes. that is right,
there.  That leads to the back of the North Stand.

Indeed. - A. Ab o u t that time when you suggest I should have
thought of p u t tin g m e n t h e r e , that urgent message came i n , "it
matters not w h e t h e r you open this gate, it is going in
anyway", which again, not realising they had not opened all
the gates, cau se d me at that stage to question what that gate
was, what the s i t u a t i o n was and what it would lead to.

But who told you it was Gate A that was in question there?
Sergeant Hi ggi ns aske d for the gate to be opened? - A. Yes. he
did.  I d o n ’t know. sir.  Somebody in the control room must
have shouted to me, "That's gate A".

The op ening of that gat e would channel everyone along that
passageway round to the side of the North Stand? - a . Yes.
sir.

And there would be an access way to the ends of the terraces
from that end, woul d t h e r e not? - A. No. sir.

It is entir el y into the North Stand, is it? ~A. The reason I
q ue st io n what I h a v e just said to you is this.     Under normal
ci rc um st an ce s th e r e i s no access from A gate into' the •fto-rth
Stand, and un~til p o s s i b l y 24 hours, ^8 hours ago. T did not
know and you m ay be abl e to advise me,_ someone suggested that
Sheffield W e d n e s d a y had opened the fencing there to add
another two t u r n s t i l e s on.   Is that right?

No.  Normally it is tu rn stiles 1-8 feed into the North Stand.
They had i n cre ased that to 1-10 feed in, but it does not
affect gate A.     G a t e A gives into the passageway, if I can
call it that, or the g a n g w a y which leads round to the North
Stand.  There is a fence. - A. That is right.        I know the
fence and I k no w the area.      As far as I am concerned in
general terms g a t e A leads straight into the back of the North
Stand.

That is right.    - A. A n d the landings,    the upper and lower
landing.

That is a b s o l u t e l y right, and someone will tell me if I am
wrong about this, I think also there is an access at that

         point to the en ds of the terracing for those who wish to go on
         there? - A. Not that I am aware of, sir.

Q.       Am I wrong abo ut th at ? I ain wrong. If you go through gate A
         and go along that passageway, although it leads di rec tly to
         the North Sta nd you can also get through into the terracing.

               MR. COLLINS:     Am I wrong about that?

              MR.   GLASGOW:    Yes, it depends whe ther the    gate is open
         or not.    Ther e is a gate in that fence.

q               . COLLINS:
               mr           Do you know whether the g at e in that fence
         was open? - A. No, sir.

Q.        You don't know w h e t h e r it was open or not? - A. No.  My
          perception of the sit uat ion on the op ening of that gate would
          be that p eop le w o u l d flow in on those landings and not get
          into the terraces.

Q.        I follow.     C e r t a i n l y the opening of gate A in those
          circum st an ce s wou ld have no effect upon the terraces? ~ A.
          Yes, sir.

 O.       It was only gate C that would have that immediate effect? - A.
          And B.

 O.       B was not opened, was it? - A. I d o n ’t know.     I said, "Open
          the g a t e s " . I on ly saw gate C, and I knew specific al ly Oi
          gate A as a fur the r request.

    0         LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR: I want to understand. Are you
          saying that whe n you said, "Open the gate", in answer to Mr.
          Marshall's s eco nd request, you believed that all the gates
          were going to be ope ne d? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. A, B and C? - A. Yes, and I w a s surprised then when I heard
       the further requ est for, "If you d o n ’t open this gate it is
             ^I-} a n y w a y , which I found to be gate A .

    q            m r . COLLINS:        I follow.  I had not appreciated
          Your initial p e r m i s s i o n to open the gate was not    gate ^but
          "gates"? - A. Yes.           The request from M r . Marshall was, "Open
          the gates".         Mr. M u rray said, "Are you going to open the
          g a t e s ? ” , and I said, "Open the gates", plural, me aning the
          gates to a l l o w the pressure, and then i was surprised to find
          that gate A had not been opened.

    G.      Do you now kn ow or did you discover at any   time whether in
           fact gate B had ever been opened? - A. No, sir, I don't know.

     O.     It is fair to say I think there is sense c on fu si on in the
           evidence as to w h e the r it ever was or not. but the evidence we
           have heard so far suggests it was not. - A. I can t comment,
           sir.

        O. Once the d e c i s i o n and the order had been made to open those

                       gates, what action if any did you take to try to contain the
                       situation inside as a result of a lot of people coming in.
                       some of whom may be should not have been in at all? - a . Yes
                       I gave instructions that every available Officer should attend
                       in two different locations.  In the North Stand to patrol the
                       landings and to ensure those who were going into the North
                       Stand area who did not have tickets would not flood through
              B        the exit/access entrances on to the pitch.  In addition. I
                       asked for increased Officers around the perimeter track to
                       assist.

                  O. To assist where? - A. On the perimeter track in observing the
                     s itu at io n in the North Stand, and perimeter generally.

                  Q    But your concern was l a r gely in relation to the North Stand
                       and the c o n se que nces of o p e n ing gate A, is that right? - A.
                       Yes.

                  G    What about the con seq u e n c e s of C and the terraces?    Did you
                       take any steps in r elat ion to that? - A. No, sir, other than
                       the Offi c e r s in the co nt ro l box were watching that situation
                       as with other si tua tio ns in the g r o u n d , knowing what had
                       developed.
              D
                  Q. If I may go back to your statement, page 10, you say this,
                       having dealt with the man pow er request at the top of page 10.
                       the matt er s you have just covered in your e v i d e n c e :

                             "I watched the Leppings Lane terrace intently for any
       f a r                 d ev elopm en ts as a res ul t of the gates o p e n i n g ” .

                       - A . Yes., s i r .

                  Q. What de ve lo pm ent s di d you anticipate or what possible
        f a
                       de velo p m e n t s did you a n t icip ate as a result of the gates
                       o pen i ng on the Lep pi ng s Lane terraces? - A. I was concerned to
       &               see what the ef fects of op en in g the gates and allowing people
                       into the ground would have.                •
              F
                  Q.   What e ff ec ts did you a nti ci pa te? - A. I thought that there
                       could be pushing, and I wanted to observe the situation across
       &               the t e r r a c e .

                  Q.   We know th e gate was in fact opened at 2.52.        That is the
                       video moni tor t i m e . It may be we are talking of a range
                       w i th in a m i nut e or so either side.   We know that the teams
                       came out at about 2.54, in fact.         I think 2.54, just after.
                       You do say, if I may go back in your statement that you did
                       cons id er again the q ues t i o n of delaying the kick-off, and this
                       as I under st an d it was before the decision was made to open
                       the gates.       A m I right in that? - A. Yes, sir.

                  O,   Before you could ma ke a final decision on that you realised
                       that the teams were about to come out on to the pitch? - A .
              H        Wit h the events, sir, and that particular timing, in the
                       sta te me nt it may be out of sequence.     My perception is when I
                       was c o n s i deri ng the teams coming - when I was considerinE

     delaying the kick-off because of a request from elsewhere, I
     looked to my right and I thought the teams were about to run
     on to the pitch because of the photographers. I thought that
     the teams were coming ou t . It appears my time sequence is
     incorrect there.

Q-        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am sorry.  "A request from
     elsewhere"? A request from where? - A. There was a
     suggestion over the radio almost at kick-off time
     for the kick-off to be delayed.

Q. From? - A. From a P.C. Buxton, I believe, my Lord.




                             /Q.   M R . COLLINS:   Are you saying.
                                                               D.G. DUCKENFIELD




Q»             MR COLLINS:    Are you saying that this request came
     af tec the gates had been opened?        - A. Sir with the
     p a s s a g e of time and the even ts as they ware
     si multa ne ou sl y, my only pe rcep tio n was then and is now
     that there was a h a l £ circle of photographers outside the
     players' tunnel and I tho ught at that stage that that was
     w h e n the players were coming o u t .

Q.   That    isn't, with r e s p e c t , an answer to my q u e s t i o n .   -   A.
     I'm sorry.

Q. My q uesti on was did the request from Hr. Buxton, which you
   have been telling Lord Just ic e Taylor a b o u t , come after
   the gates had been opened or before?               - A. In the time
   s e q u e n c e of e v e n t s , sir, I am told it came after the gates
   w e r e opened.

Q.   I am asking you your memory.       -  A. I believed that it
     came    shortly   before the gates were opened.

Q. Wh e n did you make this statement, can you remember? It
   m a y be dated.  - A. It is not, sir, but it was something
   liice three weeks after the e v e n t .

Q.   B e e 3 use it you go back to page 6 the way you recollected
     it then is thus - I look at the penultimate paragraph on
     oage 6, have you got that?      -  A* Yes.

Q-               "The ccowd sit uat ion was changing
                  rapidly.   it had increased in numbers.
                  Superintendent Ma rs h a l l had asked for
                  a vehicle with a PA facility.         Tannoy

               • si tuation on the Le ppi n gs Lane terrace
                 and saw there was room for supporters
                 and considered because of the deteriorating
                 situation wh eth er or not to delay the
                 kick-off to ease the difficulties."

        A.    Yes si r .

0-                "I looked through the Control Box window
                   to my right and saw a half circle of
                  press ph ot ograp her s on the pitch at the
                  players' tunnel, o bvi ou sl y waiting for
                   the teams to ap pear, and at that point,
                  whilst c ons id er ing the position, the
                   first team ran out on to the pitch."

    A. Yes sir.

              "I con sid er ed    this option had been
              r e m o v e d ."

    A. Yes sir.

Well now what you are there saying, and is this an
accurate p i c t u r e , that b e f o r e you could come to a final
de cis io n to postpone, or to ask for a po stp on em en t of the
kick-off, that teams came out on to the pitch an d th e r e ­
fore you considered that that option had* been removed?
A. Yes s i r , once the teams ran out on to the p i t c h .

The fact that the teams are out on the pi tch do esn't
itself preclude still po st p one ment of kick-off does it?
A. That is correct, sir.

It makes it, I accept,           m o r e difficult but it do esn't
actua ll y preclude it.          -       A. That is right sir.

If the situation        in your       view merits it.        - A.   Yes sir.

But that apart, we know that             the teams came out at 2.54 or
thereabouts.  -  A. Yes sir.

But they did come out e a r lie r than            that for their p r e ­
match warm-up as I u n d e r s t a n d it.         -  A. Yes sir.

And then went back in.              Are you referring to that p r e ­
ma tch wa rm-up or are y o u referring to the 2.54, 2.55?
A. I don't <now sir.           My       sequence of events,        asI can
hon est ly recollect them,              and bearing in mi nd       the d e v e l o p ­
me nts of the day, I was of the opinion that when I made my
-statement t h a t A n c o n s i d e r i n g the developi ng -si tuat ion at -
2.-47 , and -the..act ions at the-Leppings .Lane 'end, .that is- ■
when -I., ser iously .considered delaying the kick-off, and,--; -
whilst considering that I looked to my right through the
Co ntrol Box window and saw a half circle of press
pho tog ra ph er s waiting for the teams to come out, and
something occurred that m ad e roe think the teams were
 running out on to the pitch.                Having said that, since that
 time my orception at that time was that the teams were
running out to start the game.                 I have since been advised,
because I hadn't access to the material, that that
co uldn't have occurred, that was at 2.54.                 Sow my
percept io n is that I was thinking through that option
before I open the gates.               Now I cannot be any mor e
ac curate than that, to say that I don't know w ho came out
or what made me think that, other than to say there was a
half circle of ph oto g r a p h e r s and something hap pe ned and I
chought I saw the teams run out.                 It could have been for
 the kick-off but o b v i o u s l y now it isn't, and I consi de red
                                                    D.G. DUCKENFIELD




that at that stage the developing situation within the
g ro und had gone to a situation when I had lost the option.

So what you are sayi ng is that what you bel ie ved at the
time you made your statement, and presumably at the time
you made your dec is i o n , was the teams coming out may in
hindsight not have been. - A. No, it may have been coming
out for a kick -a bo ut as you say.

And therefore you may in fact have been earlier, or it may
have been at a time earlier than 2.54.     It mus t hav^ been
at a time earlier than 2.54.  - A. Y e s .

Coming back to page     10   ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           If that was right and the
teams had their ki c k - a b o u t and went back off aaain, the
option would have reappeared.          - a . To delay the kick-off
sir, yes.

     MR. COLLINS:       But by then, having regard to the
evidence you gave e a r l ier this m o r n i n g , the events you
told us about e f f e c t i v e l y made it impossible for you       to
come to that decision you are s a y i n g .       -  a . Yes."


That is the breakdown of communications ....       -   a . My
perception is bre ak do wn in communications, w o rsen ing
situation, 2.47-ish d eci de to take some action, think
about delaying the kick-off, players out, straight into
the crisis of 2.47.

Now you then you tell us watch the Leppings Lane terrace
intently for d e v e l o p m e n t s resulting from the gates
opening.  - A. Yes sir.

When you watch ed that .were you ‘aware of a surge 'into those-
central pens?       A. No sir. -                 .

I think that there c l e a r l y was such asurge.      You didn't
see it though.  -  A. No.

Was it not clear fro m what you could see, be caus e        the
video was still running presumably.     - A. Yes.

And you were keeping one eye on that I imagine from time to
time.   You could see peop le pouring in s t i l l , and you
could see them goin g tow a rds that central tunnel cou ld n't
you?  -   A. I can on ly refer to the compi la ti on video I
have just seen, and the compilation video d o e s n ’t indicate
they were pouring towards the central t u n n e l .

With respect Chief Super intendent, to anyone w h o knows the
geogr ap hy it is clear b e y o n d any peradventure that that

                                                                                     D.G. DUCKENFIELD
              A

                         was where they w e r e flowing isn't it?          And you did know
                         the geography.        -     A. When I saw the c o m p i l a t i o n I saw
                         people wal king in, orderly, not rushing, not charging
                         towards a p a r t i c u l a r point, and that was my perception of
                         the situation.
              B
                   Q.    But they w e r e all flowing, if you look at the video, in a
                         dire ct io n w h i c h to anyone who knows the g rou nd is in tne
                         di re ct io n of the tunnel w e r e n ’t they? Of course there
                         were one or two w h o were peeling off in other directions
                         but the vast b ul k was going in the dir action of the tunnel
                         w a s n ' t it.       A. I didn 't perceive that si tuation s i r .
              C    Q.    But if you w e r e a w a r e of the geography of the ground you
  «                      roust have p r c e i v e d it.  — A. I looked at the compilation
                         and I was s u r p r i s e d to sea that people were walking, and
                         the directions they were going.

                   Q.    D o n 't believe ev e r y t h i n g you read in the papers 1 But the
                         direc ti on they w e r e going was clearly in the direction of
              D          that tunnel w a s n ' t it?        - A.   That is not my belief sir.

                   Q. Wh er e did yo u th ink they were going?        -   A. My concern was
                      that they w e r e c o m i n g into the ground and I saw them
                      w a K i n g in w h a t I thought was the g e n er al directions, and
                      some were g o i n g th rough that gateway in tne wall.

                   Q.     Let me put at least this:    you were aware that because a
              E           large number of people had come in in a short space of
                          time that there mi gh t be a problem if they went down into
                          those cent re pens.   —  A. There is a oro o lem in any pen
                          when a large nu mb er of people come in.

                   Q.     But p a r t i c u l a r l y   those centre pens.   -     A. There could be a
                          dif f i c u l t y .                                            - -
      ...     F     Q.    And that is why y<Ju were keeping, as you say., art intent -
                          eye watching the Le ppings Lane terrace intently was it?
                          A. I w asn 't look in g specifically at the central pens. I
                          was looking at the terrace and the rest of the ground as a
                          whole.

                    Q.    It must have o c c u r r e d to you that one p ossi b i l i t y was
                          over crow din g in the central pens resulting from chis. — A.
              G           There was a p o s s i b i l i t y of overcrowding eve rywh ere s i r .

                    Q.    Pa rt ic ul arl y in the central pens.  -   A. It was a
                          poss ib il it y but it was a possibility of overcrow di ng               every­
                          where.

                    Q.    You then see a gate, which you think                   was either gate 3 or
              H           gate 4, being o p e n e d and some people              c o m ing out on to the
                          perimeter track.      -   A. Yes sir.

              A

                  Q.   It p r e s u m a b l y m us t have occurred to you to ask yourself
                       why tha t was ha pp ening.          - A. I was surpr is ed in one
                       respect.

                  Q. This was a PC a c ting contrary to i n s t r u c t i o n s . - A. Well
              B      not so muc h t h a t . He was n' t acting contra ry to
                     in s t ruc tion s if there was in jury or there was difficulty.

                  Q.   I am o b l i g e d . So it occurred to you that if the Police
                       Off i cer was d o i n g that it was likely to be because it was
                       injur ie s or dif fi cu lt ie s.   -  A. Tne Order says that he
                       s ho uld ask for an instruction from a senior Officer.         I
                       w a n t e d to kn o w wh y he had opened it because he had not
                       asked for pe rmis sio n.

                  Q.   E x a c t l y , so t her e muse have been some sort of emergency to
                       ma ke h im do it m u s tn 't there?     - A. Sot necessar ily at
                       that s t a g e . It mig ht have been someone who just wanted to
                       get out of there for whatever r e a s o n .

              D   Q.   But som eo ne just wa nt in g to get out was one reason, or one
                       thing which a con sc ie nt io us Officer should not have opened
                       a g a t e for w a s n ' t it?  A. I think the reversal of that,
                       sir, is that a conscient io us Officer woul d speak to a member
                       of the c r o w d and determine what the situat io n was and if
                       need be open the gate.

                  Q.   But sho rt ly t h e r eaft er you have an increased traffic of
              E        pe op le c omin g out of those pens, and people beginning to
                       c l i m b over the sides and over the front.     -  A. Yes sir.

                  Q. What did you think was causing that?          A. I thought it
 &                   was a pitch i nvasi on because the gate had been opened and
                     p eop le w e r e taking advantage of the situation.

                  Q. Clim bin g t o the Sides couldn't have been an yt hing to do-
              F      wi th a p i t c h in vasion could it?     -  A. My perception is ;
                     that the ga t e was opened first of all and there were one or
                     two fans c o min g on to the perimeter track, and I looked
                     and I c o u l d n ' t see a reason for it, and the situation
                     d e v e l o p e d wit h one or two more people coming on to the
                     peri mete r track, and at that stage I thought individuals
                     w e r e taking adva n t a g e of the gate being ope ned to come out
                     on to the p e rime ter track.

                  Q.             LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:   Were there also people climbing
                       the fences b e t w e e n the pens at that time?       -  A. Not at
                       first my Lord.             The gate was opened and people started
                       w a l < i n g out initially.

                  Q.             MR. C OLLIN S:     The situation qui ckly developed, as I
              H        u n d e r s t a n d it, from what I have seen and from your s t a t e ­
                       ment, fairly q u i ck ly developed from the gates being opened

and a few peopl e coming ou t to people b egi n n i n g to climb
over the side fences of pens 3 and 4 into 1 and 2 and into
6 and 7, right ?  -  A. Yes, climbing over the radial
fences.

Climbing ove r the radial fences, that began, and equally
people began to cl i m b over the front fence, right ov*r the
perimeter fence.   -    A. Yes.

And that d e v e l o p e d   fairly quickly.   -   a   . It developed in
due cours e sir.

Well by very shor tl y after kick-off that was starting to
happen w a s n ' t it?    Can I ask you to look, for example at
ph otogr ap h D p 17 in a l b u m 2?  Sorry, DB1714.   That is at
three o cl oc k precisely.         Well three o *clock within a
minute.     It is any th ing between 2.59 and 30 seconds and
tnree o clo ck and 30 seconds I t h i n k , to be precise.
    A. Yes sir.

And you can see there someone climbing over the perimeter
fence can 't you? -  A. Yes sir.

       LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:      And the side    fence on 17.

      MR. COLLIN S:          Y e s , DB1717:

And indeed on DB1717, whi ch is at one m i n u t e oast three,
we can see q u i t e a number of people by now who have got
out on to the p er im et er by one means or another, and you
can see p eo ple stan din g up clearly trying to get out and
over the peri m e t e r fop.cs.  I mean by three o'clock
e fr ecti vel y pe op le had started to try to get themselves
out of those pens h adn 't they?      - A. Yes^sir.

And people'were' trying to get out of the side as well.              -       -
A. Yes.  T h a t is not an unusual p h e n o meno n tho ug h y o aoole
going over pen s at times.                                     *' “

I follow that, but pe op le coming over the front, you
Knew that y ou had people still flowing in at three o'clock.
Not ad m i t t e d l y in large numbers by that but there were
still p e op le coining into the ground w e r e n ’t there? -
A. I d o n ’t recall that sp ecifically sir.

If you had looked at the video at three o'c lo ck you would
nave seen p e o p l e still coming into the ground.   I'm not
sure w h e t her by then through gate C but certainly through
the turn stil es they w er e still coming in.   -   A. That may
have been so sir.

You knew y ou had taken no steps at all to block off that
tunnel or to s to p peo pl e going down the central tunnel.

                  Q. C a n I p l ease go back a bit.             We have est ablished that before
                       the ca me wa s st op ped you appre cia te d that in all probability
                       y o u h a d a sit u a t i o n ar is in g from overcrowding, right, people
                       b e i n g injured? - A. Ko, I did not say that.

                       I t h o u g h t you had a gre ed wit h me that you had spotted som e­
                       one injured an c you had reali se d ....        A. That was after
                       the game was stopped.
              B
                       You are s a yi ng when we looked at those pr.otographs, even
                       by then you had not ap p r e c i a t e d this v;as not a pitch invasion?
                       27c, I think that what I was saying is this:           that I saw the
                       ga t e opened, I sav; people coning on to the pitch.

                  v . Pause        there.       Whi le the game was still being played people
                       c id r.Gt cone on to the pitch, did they.                   Thev did not cone
                       on t o tr.c          slavinc a:   ' —                ma.ce a point/  icu are
                       r e l a t i n g to the playing of the game.              I just can't remember
                       the game b e i n g played.          I w a t c h e d the gate opened and I
                       c o n c e n t r a t e d upc n that and then I get tc the situation where
                       I suppose, I should clar if y it, I don't remember kick-off
                       b u t then I note d the events and then responded to those.

              D                Chii :f Sup erintendent, wh ate ver you may or na y not now
                       rc^.e;:.     •, let us look at the factual situation that we have
                       all seen and know and it is this:                 that you have a number of
                       p e o p l e clim b i n g cut w h e t h e r over the top or getting through
                       the p e r i m e t e r gate so that they get o r the track beside the
                       p i t c h and on to the grass out si de the actual playing area?


                  C;. O ne thing they do not do while the game is still being played
                      is :o spill on to the p l a yin g area. Right? - A. Yet

                  o,   A l s o there are in fact people               who are clearly in distress
                       an d are col l a p s i n g on the gro un d and being attended to.
                       W h e t h e r or n o t you s pec if i c a l l y spotted those there are,
                       as we can see from that ph o t o g r a p h I have asked you tc loo;:
                       at, PR2/2, qui te a sub stantial number of people who are
                       o b v i o u s l y in a di s t r e s s e d condition? - A. Yes.

                  Q.   T h o s e two facts added to geth er must have made anyone looking,
                       ar.c anyo ne in that Control Eox looking, appreciate that
                       the like li ho od was that you did not have a pitch invasion,
                       y ou had p e o ple trying to escape from overcrov/ding? - A. Yes
                       sir.

                       Y ou w o u l d a c c e p t that? - A. F r o m looking at the photographs,
                       yes sir.

                  0.   I a p p r ecia te yo u m ay n ow have difficulties in recalling and
                       that is so me thin g w it h w h i c h we would all sympathise, but
                       v/e are trying to see w h a t yo ur reactions were- at the time.

              H                   W h a t I a m p u t t i n g to you, wha t I am suggesting is
                       in that si t u a t i o n wh e r e you m u s t have thought in terms of

       a sses s the situation.

Q. D id vou give any instruct io ns to anyone to do anything
   a p a r t from that? - A. N o t at zaat s i c c e .

Q. At an y stage?     I am talking now about doing something to
   alle viat e cru sh i n g in those pens? - A. The 0:;icers at
   that location were remo vi ng people iro.i cnose pens.

Q.         I k n o w they were, but d id yo u do a n y t h i n g , to give any
           in str uc ti on s fr o m your po sit io n in the Control xocn for

Q. Mr. Ducken-field, d.id y ou not, had it not o c c u r r e d to you.,
   that o ne thing and one obvious thing tc do was to send
   peopl e round the bach, t h r o ugh that tunnel and get by any

   th r o ugh the tunn el ? - A. I did not do that sir, no.

    0. V*hy did you n ot do that? - A. Because my attenti on was
       drawn solely to the si tu ati on at the fence.

    (-)#    Yes, bu t the w a v to all evi ate t;ie situation at tne fence
           was tc try to re leas e the crowds in the pens.           You knew

                      Q           The sad fact is that he did not ac hieve very much, did he, Mr.

                      Q           Yes       I se°.    Now. what about use of the Tannoy? - A. Use was ^
                                  made of the T ann oy by P.O. Ryan to ask people to move back          m

                      Q.           What m e s s a g e was sent over? - A.        I d o n ’t know.    sir.

                                  s i t u a t i o n I was issuing instructions for ail manner of twings
                                  to be done, and that was one instruction w h i c h I e xpe cted to

                          G. Yes. but what was your instruction? - A. My instruction was to
                             give Tanno y mess age s for peop le to esse back.
        fa
                          G        To e a s e back where ? - A.          Towards the tunnel.^ I did not say

                                   I   can't be specific.             There were many instructions gi ven very

                        Yes .

                   Q.   To warn hospitals, etc. whic h of course was at a fair ly ear ly
                        s t a g e that you did this. You reacted quickly, you told us.
               B        and you sent these mes sage s out.   You say this:

                              "Whilst all this was taking place I asked Po li ce
                              Co nstab le Ryan to c o n t i n u e broadc ast in g for calm among
                              the supporters and for them to clear the p i t c h so we
                              could det er mine what people were injured and wher e

                              view".

                        - A. Yes.   sir.

                   Q.   Sc it appears you did g iv e instructions for a broa dc as t to
                        cl ear the pitch? - A. I m i s u nde rsto od what you said.            The
                        si t u a t i o n was one of the dif ficu lti es in the si t u a t i o n ycu
                        d es c r i b e is that with so many people coming on the pitch, and
                        this could link in with the sug gestion you h av e raised that
               D        p eop le did not know what they were doing, th er e were fans on
                        the pitch who were h a m p e r i n g rescue attempts be cau se you just
                        c o u l d n ’t see who was in jured or who was not in j ured who might
                        wa n t attention, because the pitch was filling up, and we
                        wan ted people to move aw ay so we could see who req ui re d
                        attention. #

                   Q.   Wh e re were they supposed to move tc? - A .        To the sides.

                   Q.   Which sides and where? - A.       Either side,     the No r t h Stand si de
                        and the South Stand side.


  #                G.   Th er e was a public or d e r pr ob lem if they moved to the South
                        Stand side, was not there, because they wo uld be br ought up
                        against Notti ngh am Forest fans in that stand ? - A. Sir, in a
                        si tuati on such as that I would have hoped that a public order
                        pr obl em may not have developed, although it is a possibility.
                        My c o n c e r n . ...

                   G.   Well, it did develop. - A. Yes.         My concern was for the
                        injured and for those wh o required attention, and I could not
                        and I don't think a n y b o d y els e could, deal w i t h the injured,
                        wh ich was of prime importance, until people who could walk
                        co uld walk away from the situation.

                   Q.   It did not occur to you th er e might be anumbe r in           shock?       -A
                        Very much so.

                   G.   And they would not be l i kely to respond, would they, to
                        requests to clear the p i t c h ? - A. No, but t h e r e were a number
                        of Police Offic er s in a s t a t e of shock also.
               H
                   G.   I know.     Were you aware of that at the time?        - A. No,      I was

              B   G.   Did not you hear it? - A. No, I c a n ’t comm en t o n that.           I was

                       at the ot he r end of the ground.

                  u . 3ut you were aware, w e r e not you told by anyone, that there
                      w e r e problems with the N o t t i n g h a m Forest end b e c a u s e they
                      beli ev ed that the L i v e r p o o l fans wer e d i s r u p t i n g the game? -
                      A. I was not told that. sir.

                  G.   Was not it obvious that m igh t arise? - A. The o b v ious problems
                       befor e my eyes, sir, was d e a l i n g with the s i t u a t i o n as I saw
                       it.

                  G.   I am not su ggest in g this is so me thin g you s h o u l d have
                       neces sari ly do ne immediately, but did there n ot ccme a time
                       whe n you should have used the Tannoy to appeal for calm, to

                       e x p la in to people?

                  U.   E xpl ai n that there w e r e injuries, people had b e e n hurt, and
                       that that was what it was all about, and wo u l d p e o p l e please
                       rema in calm and e n a b l e the injured to be t r e a t e d and be

                       we said nothing.      We w o u l d use the Tannoy to t r y and clear the

                  Q.   Sayi ng not hin g did c a u s e a reaction, did it no t ?         It caused
                       the Not tin gh am Forest fans to shout and yell a nd taunt

                       Li verpo ol ? - A. I disa gr ee , sir.      That might h a v e been the
                       initial- r eacti on from your perception.         My v i e w is -that my
                       de cis i o n to tell n o - o n e was the correct d e c i s i o n to ens ur e
                       that the em er genc y s e r v i c e s could get in and out. that the
                       routes we re clear, and that was a correct o p e r a t i o n a l decision
                       on the day.

                  Q.   Well, when was it y o u we r e first aware you m i g h t have some

                 Q.   But you decided that the a n n o u n c e m e n t should not be made that
                      th e r e had been postponement, and the re as on as I un d ers tan d it
                      was you did not want pe op le l e a vin g until all the ambulances
                      had been able to get there and get away and ferry the injured
                      ou t? - A. There are two aspects to it, sir.            The first one, as
                      you suggest, was that to a n n o u n c e that to the fans it was
            B         g oi ng to be postponed, some of them, even if we requested them
                      to stay, might leave immediately, and that could ca u s e a
                      problem.     Furthermore, if the 5 4, 000 fans or thereab ou ts in
                      the stadium dec id ed to c r e a t e a public order si tuati on because
                      of the po st po ne me nt of the game, because of their anger, then
                      I had not got the resources to deal with it, and I was playing
                      for time.

                 G.   Event ual ly we know that Kenny Dal g l i s h made an appeal for
                      calm, and this was, I think, if I remember rightly, at 3.45? -
 m                    A. I am not sure of the time, sir.        I had re turned from the
                      board room, and Mr. Clo ugh and Mr. Dalglish came to the Police
                      c ont ro l box. They asked what th e y could do to assist, and Mr.
                      Dalgl is h very kindly off er ed to pass a m e s sa ge to the
                      Liverp oo l fans, appe a ling for assi stan ce and calm, and that
                      was appreciated.
            D
                 G.   The effect of your d e c i s i o n - I am not now sayi ng whether it
                      was right or wrong - the e ffe ct of your d e c i s i o n on giving no
                      info rmation was that for 40 mi nut es or thereabouts, between
                      about 5-Dast-3 and about 3.45, no-one in that stadium, none of
                      the fans knew what was happening?             :es. s i r .

                 G. Ap ar t from what they could see happe ni ng on the pitch? - A.
                    Yes. sir.       I co rr ec t you. . I have an i mpress ion that I asked
                    for medical attention, and all doc tors who were in the stadium
                    or medical st a f f to go to the Lepp in gs Lane goal to assist.
                    Now. I made a dec i s i o n not to tell the crowd about the kick-
<m                  off being postponed, but those who were wat chin g and those who
                    were, pe rc ep ti ve must have r ealis ed there was a difficult-
                    sit uati on because I_haa asked for medical staff and doctors.

                 G.   But there was still noi se and shouting goi ng on. cert a i n l y in
                      the earlier stages of the d i s a s t e r after the ga me was stopped,
                      was not there? - A. I do n' t know, sir.       The reaso n I say that
                      is the control box is to some extent sound proof, and the
                      No tting ha m fans are at the furt he st end of the ground.

                 Q. Anyway, you say you think the de ci sio n not to tell was on
                    balance a bet te r d e c i s i o n than one to tell? - A . I d o n 't
                    think, sir.   I know.

                 G.   Very well.  In fact, when you did make the a n n o u n c e m e n t in due
                      course, some time around s h o rtl y after 4, the r e a c t i o n of the
                      fans was wholl y co- op er at iv e, was not it? - A. It was
                      excellent, sir.   They applauded.

             H   G. On ce they wer e told the full circumstances, not on l y as you
                    say did they ap pla ud but they sat quietly or stood qui e tly for

                             A. I can t r eca ll e xa ct ly what they did.   I was relieved that

                                               Thursday,          25th May,   1589

                                           Cross- exa mine d bv MR. HYTtfER:

                           Mr. Duckinf ield, I appear for the bereaved and the
                           injured, an d as you can appreciate they are anxious to
                           <now where r e sp ons ibil ity lies for the tragedy. You have
                 B         now had qui ta a long time to think about this incidenc.
                           You has/a al so had the uncomfortable experience of being
                           asked a loc of pertinent and detailed questions by
                           Mr. Collins     Looking back on it now, with the benefit of
                           hindsight i f you will, do you consider that you made any
                           errors of j udgme.nt during the course of this*semi-final?
                              A. Sir, I am not in the situation of hindsight.      On th~
                           day in ques ticn I can only deal with the facts as t h e y
                           appeared be fore me, and on the day in question, with the
                           facts as th ey appeared before me, I mads the righc
                           decis i o n .

                     Q.    So you made no errors.        -        A. On the day in question.

                     O'.   Wall that is all we are concerned with, whether you made
                           the right or wrong decisions on the day in question.    I-
                 D         is your consid er ed view that you did not make any wrong
                           decisions on that day?    -  A,  Based on the information
                           available, no sir.

                     Q.    Now that you have had again the benefit of seeing what
                           ocher people did, is it your considered view that any.
                           errors were made by any of.the Police Officers under.your
                           command?  - A. It is my view,.sir, that I am not in the
                           position of hindsight.  With hindsight anyone can have a
                           different view.  My view is thac. on the day in question
                           looking at the situation as I did, that I and the other

#                          Officers made the correct decisions.

                     Q.- I .ask. .you-.abo.ut .the .other .-Officers, because. I cwan t :..to-_ give
                      - you-an.:opportujni by of reconsidering that, answ.er...because..-
                         from.-time• to time when you.were being questioned about
                         your own actions by Mr. Collins you referred to the
                         failure of other Officers to pass on information to you,
                         and you referred to other Officers who ought to have taken
                         initiatives.       Now again, so that you are under no m i s ­
                         apprehension , are you saying that having considered all
                         the information that is now in your possession, that no
                         Police Officers under your command, so far as you are
                         aware, made any wrong decisions?            - A. Yes sir.

                     Q. So that so far as the policing of the semi-final is
                        coi
                        th:
                        wrong ----                  __                      , .
                        the day in question, with the information available, ii
                        my view the c o r rec t decisions were made.

By all the Police Officers present?  - A. Those that I
was aware of and their immediate decisions, yes sir.

So if tor example you were now to be asked by anybody -
let us say the Chief Constable - "Chief Superintendent do
you think anybody made a mess of things?  Do you think
anybody made a mistake?" your answer would be "No, nobody
maae a mista<e."  so far as the policing was concerned.   -
A. As far as I am concerned, sir, everybody acted in the
best traditions of the Police Service and acted to the
best oc their abilities and correct.

Let us go to the other people who might be responsible.
Do you think, Knowing what you know, and being" there on
the day, that anything went wrong with the stewarding of
tne crowd?  - A. It is my view, sir, that it is not a role
of mine to critici se others because I don't know the work
they were engaged in completely.

Well now Mr. Du c*enfield that may not be quite a straiaht-
forward a n s w e r . You see we are seeking to know whac went
wrong.     There was crowd trouble.    There was overcrowding
in two pens which nas caused death on an unprecedented
scale.     Now are you saying since the policing was in
order that you can't say whether or not somebody else was
responsible for the overcrowding in that pen?        -  a .I
d o n 'c thin:< it is my position to comment upon other
agenc ies .                                    ‘ _ .

You were in control overall of crowd control weren't you,
crowd order?  - A. I was responsible for..the Police
operation yes sir.

Doesn't the Police Operation involve liaison with other
agencies involved, -in controlling the crowd?---- ,..A; •/Kho'iare
you suggesting sir?                          ; - ■■■•.     •<=. r ;

^ell for example the Club.      -   A. Yes sir.

Aren't the Police also to work with the Club, not only in
relation to crowd con trol on the day, but in relation to
the premises themselves and the state of the premises?
A. Yes sir.

If you on your tour of inspection had seen a gate that was
clearly unstable it would have been something'within your
responsibility to take it uo with the Club.    -  a . And
other people of cou rse who have a~ responsibility for the
ground.

Yes, and with other people.  You wouldn't simply say,         "It
is not my business".  -  A. If I saw things that I
considered to be a danger I would point them out.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I'm sorry I didn't catch the
last words.      - A. If I saw matters that were a danger I
w o u l d point them out.

     MR. HYTNER:   Well then on the day we know that there
was undoubtedly overcrowding in pens 3 and 4. You would
accept that wouldn't you?  — A. I will accept your advice
on that sir.

You d o n 'c have to accept my advice.     Are you in any doubt


     LORD JUSTICE TnYLOR:   It wasn'c advice, it was being
put to you as a question of established fact I chink.

     MR. HYT\!ER:     Ic may not be,   sir,   I had better ask
the witness.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Is something troubling vou
Mr. Woodward?

      MR. W O O D W A R D : Sir I have not risen so far, and at
your invitation, is something troubling me, sir something
begins to trouble me.         It is put to the witness,  "Is it
not a fact there was overcrowding in the pens?"         Iz may be
 3 ir to put to the witness what time is particular!'/ being
spoken ^o f . I hesitate to interrupt at all at what
happening here, but I have in mind your observations at
the beginning, sir, that the function of this Inquiry.is
not to apportion olame, it is to find out what haopened.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       And what caused it.

     MR. WOODWARD:      ~And what caused it, and why, but not
to apportion blame.                 .

    - LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think Mr. Woodward I     . .
certa in ly did say that, but I also pointed out that if
criticisms were raised, and they seemed relevant to the
cause of this disaster, then I would have to make the
necessary bindings.    I think those are practically the
exact words I used.

      MR. WOODWARD:          Indeed sir, that was made quite plain
and you made provision for the procedure by which that
cou ld be a c h i e v e d . Sir, it is the questioning of this
witness that if I appeared perplexed is correct.          I
appeared slightly perplexed and I apologise for that, but
this wi tness is being asked, or invited, to blame other
people.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   He was being asked as the
Officer in charge of the Police Operation and the crowd
                                 76

                                                        D.G. DUCKENFIET.D




      control whether he saw anything or any decisions made or
      things done by other people who we re involved in the
      op er at io n which were wrong.

           MR. WOODWARD:   Sir if I appeared troubled then there
      was some perplexion, some trouble perhaps crossing my
      brow, but not to the extent that necessitated an
      interruption.

           LORO JU STICE TAYLOR:  I'M sorry if I invited one
      unnecessarily but I thought that you were containing
      yourself with difficulty and I thought I would therefore
      help you out a bit.

           MR. HYTNER:   I will not be asking the witness to
      apportion iiaoility as oetween one oarty ana another sir:

Q. Do you accept as a fact that shortly before ninety five
   people were crushed to death there was overcrowding in
   pens 3 and 4?  -  A. Yes sir.

Q. Whose res po nsibility do you consider it to have been on
   the day with you in charge of the operation to have ensured
   that there was no overcrowding of that nature in pens 3 and
   4?  -  A. My understanding of the situation is, from the
   Graen Guide, that crowd management and control is a
   responsibility of the Club.

Q.     In ad di tio n to it being in the Green C o d e , was it your
       understanding on the day, having had discussions with the.
       Club, and having drawn up a plan, or having inherited a
       plan whicn you accepted, t.nat the responsibility for o v e r ­
       crowding in the pens was that of Sheffield Wednesday
       Football Club?         -     A. I didn't have discussions with
       snerfi el d W e d n e s d a y ,• but as far.-as I am concerned, from the •
     ’ Green Gu id e -tlie -responsibili tv •for pens and pack-ing of'.'--      ^
       pens rests with the Club.                                " -

Q.    So this was an assumption made by you but no liaison was
      made with the Club as to what arrangements they would make
      to ensure no ove rcrowding in the pens? - A. I can't
      spea< of that because the arrangements were made by Chief
      Superintendent Mole prior to my arrival and any further
      aiscusssions were with Superintendent Murray.

Q.    But Mr. Du ck en f iel d the plan may have been drawn up by
     Mr. Mole but you w o u l d want to know what had been arranged.
      Here are you in charge of the Police operation.       You are
     assuming that a very important part of the operation
     within the ground is going to be performed by the Club.
     Was it of no interest to you to know what arrangements the
     Club had made for supervising crowd control and o v e r ­
     crowding in pens?        -  A.  That arrangement was made
     between Mr. Mole and Mr. Murray.

                                                                               D.    G.    DUCKENFIELD



                      Q. And you did not take it upon y o u r s e l f to                   find out what
                         it was?   A.   No, sir.

                      Q.   How w ould you be able, as the Officer in charge, to know
                           w h e t h e r the Club were fulfi l l i n g their duties if you did
                           not even know what their duties were to be?                      A.   Because
                 B         I had advisers, S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray, Inspector Sewell,
                           C h i e f I n s p e c t o r Beale, O f f i c e r s who had been there previously
                           Officers            who had got an excellent liaison, and the
                           a r r a n g e m e n t s were, of course, that P.C. Guest, who was
                           in the office at S h e f f i e l d Wednesday and moni t o r i n g
                           w ould advise me when the crowd levels reached a certain
                           level.

                     Q . - Y o u were aware, were you, that although the Green Code
                           asks for m o n i t o r i n g of the crowd in each section, there
                           was no means w h e r e b y S h e f f i e l d Wednesday could monitor by
                           m eans of the computer, the turnstile computer, how many
                           p e o p l e were in each i n d i v i d u a l pen?   A.   Yes, sir.

                     Q.    The only m eans of m o n i t o r i n g was those in the terrace
                           as a whole.    A.  By visual inspection, sir.

                     Q.    No,    by the c o m p u t e r   -----     A.    I am sorry,       sir,   yes.   Yes.

                     Q.    So for this p u r p o s e the c o m p u t e r was useless, was it not?
                           A.   The c o mputer, as I u n d e r s t a n d it, will only tell you
                           the total number.

                     Q.    So    for   this   purpose      it is useless.           A.     Yes,   sir.

                           You were aware that the only means of s p r eading from the
                           two central pens to the outer wings were through very
                           n a r r o w gates w h i c h were i n v i s i b l e to those coming through
                           the tunnel. . .-A.          I was- aware that the spread was through
                           the gates.        .1 .am .aot so sure that was invisible; if. they __
                           t u r n e d right or left they c ould see them. ,,... •             ... .... . .

                           They would have to turn             right      and backwards       or left and
                           b a c k w a r d s to see them.       A.        Yes, sir.

                     Q.    And, of course, if there was already a crowd in the pens
                           those gates w o u l d in d e e d be invisible, would they not?
                           A.  Yes, sir.

                     Q. Did you ask y o u r s e l f at any time how the S h e ffield Wednesday
                        stewards, or. o ther s e r v a n t s of the Club* were going to
                        s p r e a d the c r o w d thro u g h the pens into the wings if there
                        wss o v e r c r o w d i n g in the cent r a l pen§? A.      I presumed
                        that they w o u l d be in the c r o w d and a d v i s i n g people to
                        move along.

                     Q.    So you a s s u m e d there w ould        be stewards          in the crowd?
                           A.   At the e n t rance.

                            A.   Y e s , sir.

                      Q.    Next, you a p p r e c i a t e d , I think, at all times that               there
                            is a tendency a mong fans to pick the spot behind                         the
                            goal?   A.       Yes, sir.
                 B
                     Q.     Did it occur to you t h e r e f o r e that there might well
                            come a time w h e n the two central pens would be full?
                            A.   Yes, sir.

                     Q      Did you ask y o u r s e l f at all how the Sheffi&ld W e dnesday
                            Club would then p r e v e n t people - more people - going
                            into the p ens?       A.     I w ould anticipate they w ould take
                            ac t i o n around the tunnel.

                            So you would have            anticipated      stewards      at the   tunnel?
                            A.   Yes, sir.

                                    LORD J U S T I C E   TAYLOR:       I am sorry, w h e r e a b o u t s   at the
                            t unn e l ?  A.        At    the far     end, in the concourse.

                 D                 MR. HYTNER:            The   entrance,     where     there are    gates?
                            A.     Yes.

                          , So if, in fact, there were no stewards at the front of
                            of the tunnel and no s t e w a r d s a n y where on the terrace,
                            you w o u l d lay that r e s p o n s i b i l i t y at the door of the
                            S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y C lub? A.    It is my view they should
                            p r o v i d e them there.

                     Q.    There should have been s o m e b o d y at the entrance to the
                           tunnel even before an e m e r g e n c y arose to ensure that once
                           the pens were u n c o m f o r t a b l y crowded no further spect a t o r s
I                          got in through the t u n n e l ?         A.   Yes, sir.

                     Q.    And by " u n c o m f o r t a b l y c r o w d e d " does not mean, ; does itV-? • •
                           Mr. D u c k e n f i & r d , in r eal i t y and practice, that -every single
                           spot is filled?              A.    No, sir.

                     Q.    B e c a u s e it is well known on terraces that you can get the
                           odd pocket w h e r e a s e v e r y w h e r e else there is o v e r c r o w d i n g
                           and discomfort.         That is right, is it not?              A.      Yes,
                           sir.

                     Q.    Can I go back.        I am s orry I came on to the pens because
                           of your answer about r e s p o n s i b i l i t y .    Can I now come
                           right back to the b eginning.            Before you get to the ground
                           itself, you e i t h e r have to care do w n _Leppings Lane or
                           you have to come over the bridge.                  A.   Yes, sir.

                     Q.    You k new Hillsborough before you vere put in charge                       of this

 neck, that is that*a c r o w d funnels along two routes and
 then funnels into the railing concourse and then in front
 of the turnstiles.     That is right, is it not ?     A.    It
 is narrow at that loc a t i o n , sir.

 It is not just n a r r o w but the crowd funnel into it.    A
 inuch larger ares l eads into a smaller area.      A.   Yes
 sir.                                                   ’

 In the o r d i n a r y way, there is no potential for danger
 beca u s e there is an e s c a p e valve, an escape route down                   the
 road that goes a l o n g the river.       A.   Yes, sir.

 Once that is blocked, there is a potential for danger,
 is there not, if a c r o w d funnels down those two routes
 and into that r e s t r i c t e d area? A. That road was not
 blocked, sir.

Well now, Hr. D u c k e n f i e l d , we may be getting to an area
of d i s puted fact.          Thus far in this Inquiry it has been
a c c e p t e d - the e v i d e n c e has been given and never challenged
that that road was b l o c k e d by a barrier to prev e n t crowd
integration.          It was to prevent the Notts Forest fans
and the L i v e r p o o l fans getting together.         I am told by
Hr. Collins it is a c t u a l l y in a photograph.

          MR. COLLINS:      C o m p o s i t e Album 1, P h o t o g r a p h MWL 15/6A
shows that b a r r i e r m os t clearly and if you marry that up
with the very last p h o t o g r a p h in that album you will see
p r e c i s e l y where the b a r r i e r is positioned, namely             just
b elow Gate C .

       MR.HYTNER:          I am    very grateful.

Can   you   find   that,   Mr.    Duckenfield?

      MR.   COLLINS:       'About      half wa y' through ‘13/6'A.

       THE WITNESS:         Document        1, is that?      " '

      THE WITNESS:           Thank y o u .

      MR.   HYTNER:        Do    you   see that?      Al     Yes,    sir.

Were you, as the O f f i c e r in charge of this operation,
unaw a r e that that s a f e t y route or safety valve had been
b l o c k e d on the day of the Semi-F i n a l ? A.  I was, sir.

You were unaw a r e of it?             A.    No,   I was aware      there   was
a safety barr i e r there.

Q.    I thought you sai-d to me before you looked at the photoqraphs
      that that road was not blocked.         A.  The word "blocked"
      sir, I would take i ssue with.        If there is a s i t u a t i o n then
      that barrier can be r e m o v e d and people can move down that
      road.

Q.    So long as the b a r r i e r is in place, there is a potential
      danger from the b o t t l e - n e c k of people c r u s h i n g into that
      r e s t r i c t e d area. A.    The restr i c t e d area is forward of
      that, sir, and the fans could spread into Leppings Lane.

Q.   They could not s p r e a d forward.     You u n d e r s t a n d what I mean
     by a p o t ential d a n g e r ? A.   I agree that that situation
     is narrow but p r e v i o u s history has not indicated that there
     is any trouble at that point.

Q.   Mr. Duckenfield, I have not got to thatyet.                    I am looking
     at the potential.          Once you have a b o t t l e - n e c k and you
     block up the only s a f e t y valve, if crowds come down
     L e p pings Lane and over the bridge there is a potential for
     danger because there is no escape forward.                 A.     If fans
     come down L e p p i n g s Lane and approach that s i t u a t i o n where
     it is crowded, they can flow along L e p p i n g s Lane to Penistone
     Road.

3.   There are people c o m i n g over the bridge in the opposite
     direction, all tr y i n g to get into S h e ffield W e d n e s d a y ’s
     turnstile area.          If that happens, there is a potential
     for d a n g e r , i s there not ?   A.   There is a pot e n t i a l
     for danger in that small area, sir.

 . There is.      I think p e r h a p s you ought to let Mr. Collins
   have his p h o t o g r a p h s back, otherwise he may be at a
   dis advantage.

           MR.COLLINS:       T hank   you.

          t!Rv HY T N E R : It is t h e refore essential',' is 'it not, in
     forward p l a n n i n g to -ensure that too many fans do not       * ’        ••
     reach that area at the same time?           A.   Yes, sir.

. Furthermore, once they have reached the r a i lings and oone
  betw e e n the r a i l i n g s and the turnstiles, it is going to be
  too late for Police O f f i c e r s to indulge in s o p h i s t i c a t e d
  crowd control, b e c a u s e there will not be any room for the
  Police O f f icers to m a n o e u v r e . A.   There is little room
  to m a n o e u v r e in that area, sir.

. Well, you agree w i t h me that it would then be too late
  for Police O f f i c e r s to cont r o l the -crowd? Once thi area
  is full of people, the Police are helpless, are they not?
  A.   They can c o n t r o l the crowd outside to p r e v e n t them
  moving in.

. Correct.     So the      e s s e n t i a l thing is to prevent    too many
  peop le gett i n g to    the c o n c o u r s e in front o f the   railings?
  A.    Yes, sir.

Q.    In addition, you have the problem at all games where
      it is a l l - t i c k e t that pe o p l e turn up w i t h o u t tickets
      in the hope of bu y i n g them from what are now I think
      euphemistically called ticket-brokers.                    A.     On
      o c c a s i o n s , sir, for m a j o r games, there are ticket       touts.

Q.    And people     turn   up to buy      them.   A.        Yes,    sir.

Q.   It is t h e r e f o r e nece s s a r y , is it not, in any sensible
     plan of act i o n to ensure that there are Police Officers
     further away from the Club up Leppings Lane filtering
     the crowd down and indeed on the bridge filtering the
     crowd through there?               A. That, sir,            is a difficult task.
     The s i t u a t i o n is that the normal state of society is to
     allow people to pass and re-pass and to adopt a filter
     o p e r a t i o n the likes of w hich you            a e Scribe in Leppinas
     Lane is a c o n s i d e r a b l e o p e r a t i o n and not one that fits
     in w ith normal p o l i c i n g a r r a n gements for a sporting event
     where d i f f i c u l t i e s are not anticipated.

Q.   Is that quite       right, Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d ? You arranged for
     Pol ice horses       to help in this o p eration?          A.  Yes, sir.

Q.   Do you agree that the last place that the Police horses
     should have been o p e r a t i n g was the arsa between the railinqs
     and the t u r n s t i l e ? A.    Are you s u o g e s t i n g the outer
     railings, sir?

'• 1 am saying that the last place they s h o u l d have been
   opera zing was the area between the r a i lings                  and the
   tu r n s t i l e s - b e t w e e n the perimeter r a i l i n g s and the
   turnstiles.            A.        It is a difficult area for them to
   operate, sir.

 . You never quite come up to the question I am putting to
   you.    It w ould a c t u a l l y be the last place   you would put
   them, -would it n o t ? ;• A.-.      I am not an expert cn h o r s e m a n s h i p ,-
     sir ■                                               - •.


.     If they are not i n t e n d e d for that area, itis plain'that
     they were i n t e n d e d for the area beyond the railings -
     L e p p i n g s Lane.       That is right, is it not?              A. They were
     i n t e n d e d to as s i s t in c rowd control in L e p p i n g s    Lane, sir.

. Yes, and they as s i s t by c o n t r o l l i n g the crowd by filtering
  the n u m b e r s g e t t i n g t h r o u g h to the concourse. A.  They
  and other O f f i c e r s w o u l d assist, sir, in asking people to
  c o - o p e r a t e wit h the P o l i c e Service and form orderly queues.

. That is what s h o u l d h ave happened, .-is it not?              A.  Yes
  sir.  We ex p e c t the g e n e r a l public to c o - o p e r a t e with the
  Police and fo l l o w our g u i d a n c e and to form orderly queues.'

                          3. So to deal w i t h the prob lem of people arriving end packing
                             that concourse, you woul d have expected the Police and the
                             horses in he lpi ng   then to form people into queues? - A.
                             Under normal circumstances sir, yes.

                               . Kow the no n- ti ck et holders. As I un de rstand your answers
                                 there is v er y little you can do to step somebody without
                      B          a tick et going to the turnstiles.    Is that ‘./hat your view
                                 of y o u r duties is? - A. Mo, our role is to speak with
                                  people and if possible ensure that ticket holders join
                                 the c u e u e s .

                          o.    Yes, now no pro bl em about ascertaining who has get tickets
                                because all ycu need is a man v/ith a megaphone near the

                                don't you? - A. Ycu can ask someone to do that and ycu
                                can believe that that would take place, but that is tctall-


                          O. You see, Mr. Duckenfield, at other grounds and other places
                             the Police do use public address systems a distance from
                             the grou nd to communicate v/ith fans.  Do ycu say that that
                  D          is not a possibi li ty in Sheffield? - A. Are you suggesting
                             that a mar. stand at the corner of Leppings Lane with a
                             megapho ne and ,can you repeat the latter part?

                                Yes, you don't get into Leppings Lane unless ycu have =
                                t i c k e t . You don't walk down Leppings Lane without a

                                Lane you can d o it hal fw ay down if you like? - A. Can ;

                                If as you suggest..we put a ma n with a megaphone at the.

                        p r o b l e m because v/here do the people go that you stop at
                        that cordon?           V.'here do the non-ticket holders go?  In t he
                        location I have described it is ray understanding we are
                B       b e t w e e n somewhere in the region of Vere Road and Bicker ten
                        Road, private housing, shops, commercial premises.              The r-0
                        has to be- an understanding an d consideration for those local
                        residents abo ut the build up of a crowd at that Ic-caticr
                        and wh e r e they are going to go.          Those roads have fcesn
                        b a r r i e r e d off for very good reasons in the past and man: •.ed
                        ar.d I wc ul d say it causes an other problem if there is a
                        buil d U72 at that location by rjut-hinc the cro-.?d further round

                                  ;            j. am not sure that I follow the problem.
                        Th ose wi t h tickets simply wa l k on, they just hole them up.
                        Those not li ddi ng tickets are told to"go back, you are net
                        co m i n g through, push off." ivhat is wrong with that? - A.
                        In the or y that is acceptable.     In practice cur experience
                        has not been that this is necessary.

                D   Q. I am ha pp y tc say "in t h e o r y ” it is practical because one
                       an sw er given earlier in the Inquiry was that the Police
                       w o u l d have no power tc stop a non-ticket holder going to
                       the gro un d as a sightseer.        The fact is that if the Police
                       were having difficulty co nt ro ll in g a crov/d, a ncn-tickei
                       h ol der would be interfering with the operation of the Police
                       in cr owd control and there w o u l d be no problem about telling
                       him to push off back up towards the roundabout, would there?
                       - A. There wou ld if he did net wa nt to go.         He has a right
                       to pass and repass.

                        If he is obs tructing the Police in ;ne execution or -cneir
                                                                  I
                        duties he can be told to "Push off" can't    he? - A. Me can
                        if he insists on brea ki ng th rough the cordon when you have
                        giv en a directive.                               ....

                    0 . Certainly, so looking at the matt er from beyond the turn­
                        stiles, ycu accept that a p ro per Police operation could
                        have c o n t r oll ed the flow of people before it crushed
                        into that concourse before the turnstiles? - A. The Police
                        o p er ati on as envisaged had w ork ed previously with fans
                        a rr iv in g ov er a period of time and obeying instructions
                        in the programmes and the Press and it was never envisaged
                        that a situation would arise on this occasion whereby we
                        wou ld have to change our operational plans.

                    o   By 2.30 - of course it is said it rs much earlier but ycu
                        have insisted on 2.30 so I a c ce pt it - by 2.30 this small
                        concour se bet ween the ra ilings and the turnstiles was
                        jammed full of people, wasn'     it? - /i. • v view was rrom -.ne
                        camera and yes, there w er e ; lot of people there.

                    Q. And there we re still p eopl e coming down Leppings Lane?
                       A. Yes sir.

                        Q.   If the Police operat io n in Leppings Lane had been an
                             eff icie nt one there never would have come an occasion when
                             the w h o l e cf that narrow little concourse was jaroined full
                             of spectators or potential spectators, would there, there
                             w o u l d have been queues at the turnstiles? - A. I disacree
                             sir.       Vie police by con sent in this country and you are
                             laying the blaae at the door of the Police Service.              The
                    B        general public v;hc were approaching that location can
                             see the situation and our operation was designed for co­
                             op e r a t i o n and one w o u l d nope ii they saw a crowd thev
                             w o u l d wait and fcr:a a cueue.

                             Le t 's just e:;e."ine that answer for the reality of
                             Muncreds of ticket holders arriving half-an-hour b
                             the kick-off, a reasonable tine, co~e down Lepping s Lane
                             and they see there is a jani which the Police have failed
                             to disperse within the concourse between the raili ncs and
                             the turnstile.      Is it your view as a Police Office r cf
                             gr e a t experience the- at that stage all these fans would
                             turn, rounc .0 eac,: otner a.nc say:      ""alt,- we go no further,
                             Ue n u s t noi approach the turnstile railings until the
                             cr owd within has disoersed.       ?Je will all star.c. on Leppings
                             Lane and wait".      Is that w ha t you really think peo pie do? -
                    D
                             VJell generally speaking people who approach a cine :na queue
                             who see a queue as they approach it along a street stand
                             and wait .

                             A cir.e.na queue is a queue.      This was not a queue.  V,‘e have
                             seen it on the video and you have seen it.        At 2.30, long
                             be fo re you can talk about late-comers, there was a ja.~
                             which- had beer, p erm it te d to forn in that concourse.: Is it
                             your considered vie w that Policemen can reasonably anticipate
                             that people cosine down Lecpincs Lane wculd then of their
                             ow n volition halt and qc no further until they saw tne 3 an
                             disperse? - A. I d o n ’t see why football supporters should
                             have a different approach and mentality to queueing than
                             anybody- else and I woul d have thoucht as they arrived, or. ....
                             j_»eppings ^ans ana saw a situation and -a crueue•thev-weuld
                             halt and for..i a queue

                        Q. Can you tell us in those circumstances, if that is what
                           is reasonably tc be ex pe ct ed of football supporters, why
                           there is any need for Police presence at all at a football
                           ground? - A. Because there is a minority of football
                           supporters who d o n ’t behave themselves.

                        Q. And that is the only reason for having a Police presence,
                           that is to deal with the mi nor it y who are hooligans? - A.
                           There is an obvious po lic in g presence for safety and public
                           order, but I would suggest that we- have to deal with the
                           hoo li g an element in football.

                        Q. I-Iobody has disputed that.         Are ycu saying other than
                           h o o l i g anis m and publi c ord er there is no need for a Police
                H          pr es e n c e at a football match? - A. There is the matter of
                           safetv.

     0.    I d o n ’t know to what extent you have heard the evidence given
           so tar or read it. but are you aware that spectators who were
           in the ground at 2.4u felt uncomfortably oacked and were
           so mew ha t ap pr eh ens ive? - A. no, sir.

 0. 2.45? - A.          I was not aware of that.

 G. 2 .4i?         a.   I have not seen any statements from witnesses.

 0. On your un ders tan ding today, from what you have been tcic
    whe.n^do you think was the first time that oeooie besan to be

 G. Welx. beiore.         I d o n ’t mean since a fortnight   ago.  Since the
    incident at _H il lsbo rou gh? - A. No.       Since the   incident at
    H m s b o r o u g n I have played no part whatsoever      in making any
    enquiries c t e l l .      I   have remained completely   detached.

          If      i-urns out that people were indeed being crushed fc^'ore
          gate C was opened, it would rather look as though your own
          as ses sm en t oi the terrace was in error? - A. Is that the
          accurate situation, sir?

G. We d o n ’t know what facts the Tribunal will find. we'only know
   =t tne moment what people say, although indeed I have to say
   tneir evidence has not been generally challenged. -‘A. I can
   oniy relate to what I saw. and as far as I am concerned,
   -uOKing through the control box window at the crowd Drior to
   the gates opening on the perimeter track there-did-not aooear
   to be a d i f f i c u l t y .                             ''

G. So if I n iact p eop le were being crushed and were fe ar fu l’,
   before the gates were opened, it looks as though your own
   ass es sm en t may have been in error? - a . Y o u have got to accept
   my pos it io n and wher e I was standing.   My assessment, I would
   sussss l , is correct, because I did not see it. and that is mv
   perc ep ti on of the situation.

G. On e yo un g lady who was standing on the Spion Kop looking
   d i r e c t l y at the terraces, said that at 2.45 the pens 3 and 4
   were overcrowded. - A. May I suggest, sir, that from possibly
   150 yards away that is a very good_assessraent if it is
   accurate.

G.        So what it comes to is this, is it, that by 2.49, 2._v .
          was littl e d ou bt in your mind that even though the two pens
          were not overcrowded they were getting on to~being nearly
          full-  Is that co rr ec t? - A . I would anticipate that, sir,
          leading up to the kick-off.

                                 You agree with th a t ?    It must, therefore, have been very

                                                        D.G. PUCKENFTFT.n


       respect of the changers of doing that, namely that peoDle would
       come in wi th missiles and drink? - a . Yes. sir.

 Q. Just st opp in g   there for a moment, what concerns me is this.
    We have heard      a lot of evidence from people who entered the
    ground early,      2 o'clock, 1.30, 1.45.    Tnev were all searched
    and of c our se    sea rch ing is a time consuming exercise  is n o t ’
    it? - A. Y e s .   sir.

 0. You are not suggesting, are you. that at from 2.*5 onwards
    with a ma ss iv e crowd outside waiting to get in. it was
    con templated that every bo dy coining into the ground would b®
    searched for missiles or alcohol? - A. The situation at
    s<_age, Sj.r, was such that it would not c-e possible.

 0.   Exactly.   to wnether tne gate was opened or whether the sate
      was not opened, the same problem would arise in relation"to
      arinK ana m iss il es? - A. no, sir. If ceoole were g-'ir-
      through the turnstiles they would be passing Police Officers
      wno, whilst they may not stop them and search them directly,
      would have a visual view, or a view of them going through the
      turnstiles, and they would not if the gate was opened.

 Q. Mr. Duckenfield, with great respect, people don't usually
    carry oi fe n siv e weapons into a football ground in their hand
    in full view of a Police officer, do they? - a . N o , but you
    can see if they have anything sticking out of their Docket
    like a billiard bail or a beer can.

O. Yes. all right.   Let us accept that for a moment. In addition
   to the problems you have just outlined and which you properly
   took into account, in favour of opening the gate was the
   danger to the crowd outside of being killed? - A. Yes. sir.

Ci. Which you had b e e n _warned about.   Did you or did you not have
    ac the forefront of your mind in addition to missiles and beer
    tnac che incoming fans if the gates were opened" would” c-r "mishit
    get on to the terrace that was already nearly full? - a". It =
    did not s p e cif ical ly cross my mind.  I knew thev were going to
    enter the terrace as a whole.

Q. Since you knew from your own inspection that there were no
   warning signs and no directional signs leading to the two wing
   Pens, and sinc e you knew that the tunnel was directly in front
   of the gate, did it not occur to you that the one thing that
   was essential if the gates were to be opened was to have
   people di r e c t i n g fans to the wing pens? — A. Yes, sir, but I
   made the po in t that other agencies who have a responsibility
   for the gr ou nd and had not seen the lack of signing or
   foreseen dif f icu ltie s of this nature, and I had to acceDt the
   ground as it was.

G.    Yes, that is quite right.  You could not rush and put signs up
      yourself, but when you police an operation you take a ground
      as you find it? - A. Yes. sir.

G-    There were no signs.    Therefore if as you say it was in your

     sir.                                                 48’

 G. The stewards, of course, the Sheffield Wednesday Football
    Club, would not have anticipated that gate C would be opened
    10 minu tes before the kick-off. would they? - a . N c , sir.*but
    the st ewards in that locality would be aware of the deveiooing
    situation.

G. Well, that is what I had better ask you about.    Unless they
   were told how would they know? - A. I presume anyone in the
   concou rs e area at that time would be aware of the situat'-on
   outside.

G. Why would some bo dy in the concourse area be aware that
   som ebo dy ou ts ide might be crushed to death against the outer
   wall? - a . Those coming through the turnstiles may have a view
   and express that view.

G. Thai, is a fair answer.  How would those in the concourse know
   that one of the options being considered by the Police was the
   op ening of gate C? - A. Who in p a r t i c u l a r s i r ? Do you mean
   the stew ar ds ?

G. The stewards.     The chief steward, the man in charge of the
   stewards from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club? - a .

     when? - A. Ab ou t that time, my Lord.    I can't be accurate.     I
     know he spoke.

   him?    That "We are going to open the gate", or "We are

                                  to have forgotten to give an instruction to close off the

                                  have said I did not give an instruction.    There are many
                                  occasions as a Commander you give instructions and you
                                  expect others to take a course of action.    I am not
                  H               movi ng that res po nsibility whatsoever. All I am saying
                                  is I did not issue an instruction.

  I ought: I tnink to follow it up by asking you about
  Oft leers on the g r oun d in fairness to them. You, hav<na
  i-orgotten to give that instruction, are you saving that
  either an Inspector in the concourse or individual
  Ott icers with their personal radios should havp r=alis=d
  what was Happening ana raced to the tunnel’     - A      Y ~ T
  would have expected that they would take a c o u r s e ’of  '
  action.

. We know that there was one steward in the concourse        w=
  see m m on the video, but he was near gate C.       Ar=>~you~
  saying that you wo uld have expected the infor ma ti on 'thas-
  tne gate was being ope ned to have been relaved
  sufficiently to the stewards that they w o u l d ’.<now to ao to
  tne tunnel?   - A. Because we couldn't contact Mr. Locke
  the only .ueans oc contact would have been verbal con'-a-"-
  'oetween the Police Officers and the steward.

 This wab an appalling breakdown in communication wasn'^
 it, that the Police coul dn' t get hold of the chief steward
 a t .a , c “ fcl<:al   Oo you know why the Police couldn't
 get nold ot Mr. Locke?   -   A. I don't sir.

 The whole point of having the, I think he is called the
 chief security officer, and the Police on the ground is
 that they liaise together don't they?  -  a . Yes s i r . ”

 H°w > w u l d those        in   the    concourse       have    known      the   state   of

Were the    Officers in the stand, who I accept should have
oeen the    Suate or overcrowding, were they under any orders
to pass on by pe rsonal radio their assessment of crowding
m the pens?     - A. Sir specific instructions would have
been given to chose people by Superintendent Greenwood,
an d I would expect them, as trained Police Officers, and
trained in crowd control, to assess the situation and if
they saw a difficu lt y relay that back.-

                               You see a pitch invasion is a term of art, we all ,<now
                               what it means.         is fans dslioerately g e t t i n g -out of the
                               terraces and invading the pitch for a purpose, either to
                               spoil the game, or to abuse the referee, or to go for an
                               opposing player with who m they     are displeased, or

  cm                           occasionally to invade properly to get to the other end to
                               get at the oppo si ng fans. "That is a pitch invasion isn't
                               it?  - A . Yes s i r .

                          Q.   You are we ll-aware of    that.       A. Yes   si r

                          Q. This was the beginning of the game.         There was no incident
                               on the field tnat cou ld have provoked anger among the fans
                               and above all the fans never got on to the pitch.        How
                               — ould i i_ possioly have been interpreted as a oitc’  n
                               invasion?    -  A. Sir my view from"the Control"Box was such
                               that i_hei.e was no a bnor mal ity and I questioned in my mind
                               why the gate was opened.

                               Well that is a separate thing.          You are now going back to
                               the very b e g i n n i n g . What I have to ask you about that is
                               this.       uhac Knowing full well that you had just given
                               o r d e r 3 to open the gate, and they could be called the
                               floodgates, and knowing full well that the tunnel was very
                               much, in line wiuh tne gate, anti knowing that the pens we r e
                               nearly full, again it only would take a child of less than
                  H            average intelligence to say, "Well if that has all

      happened ana people are spilling out of the front of the
      crowd it is because people have crowded into the oens at
      the r e a r . There is overcrowding in the pens."   That is"
      n c h t isn't it?   -  A. That is your suggestion sir.   Ic
      wasn c my perception.     I didn't see any pushing.   I saw a
      state of normality and the gate opened.

 Q.   But it must be obvious mustn't: it that if the gate was
      opened and then people were climbing over th* f=nc*s
      what has happened is that there has been no stoooing the"
      -ans getting m c o the back of the pens.  - A. There Ha-j
      been no stopping, yes sir.         *              ~     3

Q. And when the fans d o n ’t go on the pitch but stand
   docilely on tne track and wait around in a dazed fashion
   tne one thing it plainly wasn't was a oitch invasion   -
   A. No it wasn't at that stage sir.

Q.    It clearly wasn't was       it?   -   a   . N o sir.

G.    You see today youjiave said rather frankly that at some
      stage you realised it wasn't a pitch invasion, but in vour
      statement at page 12 you said this:

                  “The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)
                  .Mr. Jackson, joined me in the Control 3cx
                  and asxed for an appraisal of the situation.
                  I was unable co give an accurate account of
                  w h a ^ tne situation was other than a possible
                  pitch invasion which had resulted in us
                  stopping the game."

      Now <_hat is after <_ne match had been abandoned, or at
      least after the game had been stopped.          You still thought,
      and. so told your-Ass istant Chief C o n s t a b l e , t h a t ’it" was •a'
      possible; pitch -invasion.     a . In fairness ,"-sir,'the ta'ra ’
      1 pitch- invasion 1 was used to describe a crowd :comina out' of
      the gate on to the perimeter track.

Q.    And iu still had not dawned on you that they had soilled
      on to tne track and climbed the fence because of oossible
      overcrowding as a result of opening the gate.   -  a . It
      was a poss ibility sir, but at that stage I was waiting for
      in f o r m a t i o n .

Q. And^ las<_ly, can you explain a mysterious message, of which
   we have only heard so far from M r C o l l i n s in his ooening
   speech, but no doubt we will hear-more in due course, at
   fourteen minutes past three the Police told the Firs
   Brigade tnat fans had oro<en down or broken through a gate
   and that was the cause of a major incident.        I have to
   speak from memory but I think those are broadly the words.
   - A. Can you tell me where that came from?

Q. Well that is what I am asking vou.          -   a   . Kell I have
   never heard of that.

Q.    Who called the Fire Brigade?    - A. I recall a reou-st
      for oolc croppers or wire cutters and following on "from
      that I understand the Fire Brigade attended, but as ►o who
      mane tne calls, and from what Control Room, I don't Know.

Q. You^didn't yourself specifically ask foe the Fire Brigade?
      A. N o . I was in the situation then by implementina a
   major incident plan and others in support were"...?

Q.     So^ you can 11 help us as to the genesis of the belief of ?
      Police Officer that there had been the breaking     down of a
      gace by che tans?     - A. No sir.

Q. May I take the bull by the horns?  Am I right in sayina
   that the man in charge thought there was a great deal of
   similarity oetwen 24,000 Liverpool supporters anxious to
   beat Notts Forest again, and the oeooie queueing for
   13ambi ’ at the local Odeon? - A. Queues, sir, are queues.

   you don >_ mean tnat, it has never been the case and i^ is
   completely different.   -  a.  Why should a crowd of
   tootball supporters wish to behave differently to a crowd
   of cinema-goers?

   do, and to suggest that you d i d n ’t ___   -  a . I am not

 responsibility       on-the p e r i m e t e r   track.

I am not talking about the p e r i m e t e r track, I am talking
a bout the radial fences and the gates in the radial fences
Do you follow me?

        LORD   JUSTICE    TAYLOR:          Betw e e n pen and pen.

        THE WITNESS:         Yes,    sir.

        MR. MULLER:   Yes.             A.        I understand it.   They
wer e   opened by a Police           O f f i c e r and locked back.
                                       v         '


But you have just said a moment ago that there would be
s o m e b o d y there to either open or close them.       A.   I
am sorry, sir, I m i s u n d e r s t o o d you.  I thought you were
t a l k i n g about the p e r i m e t e r track.

Does it make a d i f f e r e n c e if you are in control of a gate?
Are there d i fferent ways in w hcih you control different
gates?        A.      I am in some difficulty, sir.    It is not
w i t h i n my k n o wledge about those specific lateral gates
in the radial fences.

Just accept for the moment that that is the case, if they
are in your control, can you think of any c i r c umstance in
w h i c h it would be more i m p o r t a n t to have those aates
m a n n e d than on a c a p acity crowd situation?       A . ” Those
gates, sir, I believe are locked in the open p o s ition in
a c a p a c i t y crowd.

But they still have to be manned, do they not?
A.   I fail to see the p u r p o s e if they are already                      locked
in the open position.

Let me just assist you. " You have already indicated that
if p e o p l e came down the tunnel and they found 2, 3 a n d ' 4 - *
were full, they coulcf do one of two things.           The first
one you now regard as i m p r a c t i c a l or probably impractical,
to go back along the tunnel.               Kight?  A.   Yes, sir.

The other thing you s u g g e s t e d to us yesterday was to go
a l o n g the back wall and go through the gates.       A.  Yes,
sir.

Well, in that case the f u n c t i o n the Police Officer could
p e r f o r m is to make sure that that gangway is kept clear
so that pe o p l e can get t h r o u g h those gates;     is that not
right?         A.   It is, but I c o n s i d e r that to be a s t e w a r d ' s
responsibility.                                 .7

That w o u l d be so or may be so unless there was a s p e c i f i c
r e q u i r e m e n t that they s h o u l d be in the control of the
Poli ce.            A.   Well, I don't know about that, sir.

If it were     in the    control     of     the Police,     would you not

             e gate is kept open and locked open, and that is an

     there were any s t e w a r d s on duty in the terrace                           at Pens   3 and

But would it not alarm you if you found that there were no
stewards there, saw no yellow tabards? - A. I can understand.
I am thinking the situ ation through and all I can say to
you is I d o n ’t recall seeing stewards there but t h e s may
nave been.

Just think for one moment, Mr. Duckenfield.       There you have
got a pen w h i c h is filling up anc as you are looking at it
you obviously wou ld think to yourself:     "VJell when that
fills up people have got to filter through into the next
pen, 1 and 2"? - A. Yes sir.

would it not obviously strike you:      "Vie 11 there is nobody
there to control it.     I have not put a Policeman there.
I c a n ’t ses any stewards"? - A. Viell I did not look
specifically for any.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Do you accept the view I
think Mr. J'ole expressed to us, that so far as the terraces
are concerned it is a matter for the fans to level themselves
out? - A. Yes, ray Lord.

You do? - A.   Yes, my Lord.

      MR. MULLER:    I see, perhaps I need not pursue that
any more.

      Do you think you in any way we re handicapped in your
assessment of the situation by the absence of a Police
Officer at the back of the terrace in    Pens 3 and 4? - A.
There were Police Officers sir in the West Stand whc were
overlooking the back of the pens in 3 and 4.

VJell I ask the question again:   do you think you were
handicapped in any w ay by not having Police Officers
stationed, I suggest, in the immediate vicinity of the
gates, the radial gates? - A . .Mo sir. .                         • %...

The reason I ask that question is because at one stage
when you ’..’ere talking about the density of the crowds as
you perceived the;.’    , outside in Leppings Lane, you said:
"I was not p r e p a r e d to act on that information because I
wanted to know what the position was in the ground and I
•wanted to make radio contact with the people who were
actually there in the crowd"? - A. Yes sir.

Mo w applying the same principle, wouldn't it have been an
advantage to be able to enquire of an Officer who was
actually in the crowd, as to how crowded or how full it
actually was? - A. It would sir, but my view is that the
Officers in the West Stand could give me that same
information.

But as far as you know, from what you said yesterday, they
had not s p ecifically been told to look out, had they?

                               A. Sir, I think my reply to that was that these are trainee
                               Police Officers, they know the situation and it is my view
                               they wo uld report to me if there v/as a difficulty.

                        Q. Your assessment of w h e t h e r there was crowding in that parti­
                           cular stand depended on your standard of people being chest
                           to back and shoulder to shoulder. Is that right? - A. Yes
                      B    sir.

                           . You pr e sumably know wha t is laid down in the Green Guide
                             as to the maximum number of people that one should hava in
                             ten square yards? - A. I am aware there is a formula in
                             the Green Guide.    When I v/as asked for the information I
                             v/as not being specific about the Green Guide.    I v/as civinc
                             a personal visual view.
  (fa
                           . Just let me ask you this question:  according to the Green
                             Guide the maximum number of people in ten square yards,
                             it is paragraph 222:  "The maximum number of people should
                             bs 54 persons per ten square metres"? - A. Yes sir.

                          O.    You are not seriously suggesting, are you, that if you put
                               54 people in ten square metres they will be chest to chest
                      D        and shoulder to shoulder? - A. To be honest, sir, I can't
                               visualise that at the moment.

                          Q. Well just try and visualise, let's divide it by ten, cne
                             square yard.  Do you follow me? - A. Yes sir.

                          0.    One square metre. Five people in   one square metre.  They
                               are not going to be chest to back   and shoulder to shoulder
                               are they? - A. Uo sir.

                          O.   And that is the maximum? - A. Well there are   a lot of football
                               grounds sir where that is not the case.

                          Q. Would you--now look please at Composite Album .No. 2,and,
                             Photograph PR1/12A? - A. Yes sir.      .....           • .....

                          Q.   If you look at that photograph, which is a view of the
                               position as I say at 2-minutes-past-3, it is quite apparent,
                               isn't it, that t h e s i s much greater density at the front
                               than at the back? - A. Yes sir.

                          Q.   Is that something that you took into account when you were
                               looking down over this area, the degree of density in
                               d ifferent parts of the terrace? - A. No sir, it was not
                               obvious to me.

                          Q.   But is it something you were looking for? - A. It would be
                               something I would be looking for but it v/asnot immediately
                               obvious to me.

                          Q. Is the fact of the matter, I think you indicated yesterday,
                  H          the possibilit y of crushing was no t a danger which was in
                             the forefront of your mind.   Is that right? - A. Yes sir,
                             that may be correct.

Do you think the possibility m a y be that when you were
looking over the West terrace you were not really        thinking
about the possibility of crushing? - A. iio sir, I was
looking for mov ement in the crowd and difficulties in the
crowd as a result of the gates opening and fro:?, where I v/as
I did not appreciate there was a density.

But wer e you looking specifically to see whether or net
crushing v/as taking place? - A. If you say "crushing"
specifically, no, I was looking for indications.

If you no w look over the page in those photographs which is
at 4-mir.utes-past-3, that is a tine I think when you agree
that you realised there was serious problems and it was no
longer a pitch invasion? - A. Excuse me sir, are you talking

It is PR2/1 and that is actually at 4-minutes-past-3.      Get
that? - A. Y e s .

I think you will accept, because it has been drawn to your
a ttention already by Mr. Collins, people lying on the ground
and sc on and so forth? - A. Yes sir.

At that time it m ust have been apparent to you that people
were trying to get out of that pen? - A. Yes sir.

And they were having difficulty in doing so by getting
through the gate? - A. Yes sir.

I am not necessarily suggesting this would be the solution,
but one of the possibilities that wo u l d arise would be tc
cut some of the fence down? - A. Yes sir.

That w o u l d be a pretty obvious thought that would go through
anybody's mind, isn't it? - A. Yes sir.

Did it -go through-your mind? - A. N ot immediately sir. -

Do v g u know how long it took before anybody asked for the
Fire Brigade to come with their cutting equipment after
that photograph was taken? - A. I don't sir.

Ten minutes.   Does that strike you as a very long tine? -
A. Yes sir.

Well are you saying then even though you knew there was
crushing up against the front and you knew there was
difficulty in people getting out, it never crossed your
m i n d to get somebody to bring some_cutters to release the
people? - A. Sir, there v/as a request for cutters very
early on.     At the m o ment the call was put cut for other
assistance and a request was made then for cutters and I
believe that because none were readily.available from the
Poli ce Service the Fire Brigade were called.

Th a t is not the \ia.y you told us about it before, nor is it
quite the w a y it appears in your statement.    You seem to be
in yo u r statement in the same breath talking about the calling
of the Fire Erigade and also the request for cutters,      When
are you now telling us that you first heard somebody ashing
for cutters? - A. I can't specifically say.      When I realised
there was a disaster situation I gave instructions as to
essential services to be called and implemented and I gave
a list of instructions.      The comment in my statement is that
I called for assistance generally.      I gave a list of instruc­
tions and I was aware at that tine in that moment of crisis
that somebody w a nted some wire cutters.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, what I am suggesting tc
you is that somebody in your situation faced with people
not being able to escape from the front ox the pen and been
climbing over the top, somebody would think*.  "well he needs
some cutters", not general assistance, specifically c ut t e r s ? - A .
And that request was made.

Wha t I a.m asking you about then is this:    at 14-minutes-past-3
some b o d y actually summoned the Fire Brigade? - A. Yes sir.

A s k i n g for cutting equipment.  Can you help us   as to hov;
long before       that you realised that the Police   had r;ot no
cuttin g equipment? - A. From the information I       have got to
hand at this moment, sir, I cannot give you an        answer.

Can you remember? - A. Mo sir, I can't.  There must be a
message somewhere but I have not got the inforsvtaticn.

Wh e r e did you expect the Police to be having the cutting
equipment? - A. I have a recollection that someone asked
for cutting equipment from the Police garage at Clayvheels
Lane.

Was a message sent to Clayv/heels Lane?. - A. Yes... X a a s.orry,
Clayvheels L a n e -i-s -nearby and it is a Police .transport         ,.
garace.                                       .

You are familiar with the facilities which can be offered
by the Fire Brigade on their emergency tenders, are you?
- A. Yes sir.

A n d they have on those tenders equipment, cold cutting
equipment wh i c h can cut through without causing any fire
or injury to anybody in terms of direct injury, very thick
pieces of metal.      Are you aware of that? - A. Yes sir,
I kno w they have got equipment to cut metal sir.

B ut they could have gone through the stanchions without
a ny problem if that was thought appropriate immediately.
Did you know that? - A. Ho sir.

So you were not aware of w h a t facilities the Fire Brigade
co u l d offer? - A. I was not aware that they had got equipment
that could do that sir.

                             Q. Your best thought -was to go to a garage, Police garage.  Is
                                that right? - A. Yes, the request was made for cutting
                                equip ment and of course that message was passed to the Police
                                garage.

                             Q. But as far as you are concerned that was not your decision
                                to go to the Police garage, it was somebody else's? - A.
                           B    It was implemented sir.  I don't know who passed the rr.essace
                                through.

                             Q. Did you hear the m e s sag e being sent      tc the garace? - A.I;o sir.

                             Q.   Go you v/eren't aware of it? - A. No sir.

                             Q. were you aware of the massage being          passed on tc the Fire

                                - A. 2io, let me set the scene.     The Police Control Bo:-: I
                                gave a list of directives in respect of implementing             the
                                Major Disaster Plan such as am bulances, Casualty Bureau,
                       D        things of that order, and I fired a list of tasks off in
                                quick succession.   T h e y were not tasks that we the Police
                                Control Room could deal with in their entirety and these
                                were no doubt passed back to the H e a d q u a r t e r 's Operations
                                Room who implemented some of them.

                            Q. VJhat I want co know in the simplest terms is did you yourself
                               ever ask for cutting equipaent specifically?    A."Personally

                   C r o s s - E x a m i n e d by MR. M A X W E L L :

Mr. Duckenfield, I w o u l d like to ask you about directional
signs in the conc ourse behind the West Stand.

      The layout of the Leppings Lane terraces allows the
Police and the Club to segregate fans where that is considered
necessary.  That is right, isn't it? - A. Do you mean by
using the radial pens sir?

Yes.   - A. Yes.

Or to create sterile areas? - A. Yes sir.

Or where n ecessary to confine fans within particular pens,
the mid dle pens 3 and 4 especially? - A. Yes sir.

And that is w h a t h a p p e n e d when you were in charge of policing
the Millwall match, isn't it? - A. Yes sir.

Do you agree that it might well be helpful to put up signs
to spectators going across the concourse to indicate where
the terraces were? - A. Yes sir.

Would there be though a probleaif you put up permanent signs
indicating something to the effect:     "This way to the
terraces"? - A. At wh a t location sir?

Would there be a p r o b l e m in that you may find that spectators
go to precisely the areas you don't want them to go to. Do you
envisage that as bei ng a possible problem? - A. It could be
a difficulty sir.

Could it be overcome by providing temporary signs that were
put up to suit the pa rticular occasion of the match? - A.
Ye s s ir .

Would you look p l ease at your Police Bundle of documents,
Tab 11 at page 4C.    I am dealing how with the matter 'of
stewarding.  Page 40 is part of Appendix >i and it is
towards the end. - A. I have got it sir.

These are the Stan d i n g Instructions? - A. Yes sir.

Did you say earlier that you were not aware of the Standing
Instructions in relation to the policing of football matches?
- A. Ho sir, I think in answer to the question yesterday I

 Q. Look, please,          at page AO towards the bottom of the page at
    item 3:                  '

                 Stewards shou ld be distributed throughout the ground
                in a c c ordance with a detailed prearranged schedule
                agreed b e t ween the Police and m a n a g e m e n t ” .

          Were you aware of an y such schedule having been agreed for the
          purposes of this Semi-Fin al? - a . N o , sir.

 0. The club at 376 stewards available apparently,                   according to
    the backgrouna m a t e r i a l .

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           363?

               MR. MAXWELLL:        376;

 G   ,
         The s afety C e r t u i c a t e . r e q u i r e d 66 stewards. Did anvone from
         che club approa ch you to say, "What do we do with all the-e
         stewards'.'*”? - A. On the particular day, sir, and I was not
         involved m     the bri efing of them, and Mr. Murrav may b- able
         to answer that more specifically, Police Inspectors briefed
         the stewards who wer e on duty at the Semi-Final event.

0,       Then I will take it up with Mr. Murray.   Finally, can i ask
         you a little about, your decision to open gate C.  Your
         objection, initial objection to opening gate C was that it
         would defeat what you regarded as the proper purpose of
         ensuring fans go ing through the turnstiles so that thev could
         then be surveyed by -the Police and so that the introduction of
         Oitensive weapons, drink and so on, could be stopDed^ - A
         yes, sir.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            Ana only ticket holders? - A         And
         any non-ticket holders.

Q-               MAXWELL:     Serial 14 was achieving that purpose on.the
         ground side of.. the..turnstiles? — A. I _am .sorr.y, sir? .

         Serial 14 were po sitioned on the ground side of the turnstiles
         seeing the fans and seeing to them and stopping peoDle coming
         in with drink and so on? - A. Yes, sir.

0. Once you had d e c i d e d _to open gate C there was really no point
   in Serial 14 a t t empting to carry out that objective, was
   there? - A. No, sir.

Q. Were they then free for deployment elsewhere? - A. They could
   theoretically be seen to be free, but because of the incoming
   crowd then my view is they should remain there for overall
   policing.

Q*        There  being where? - A.         In the area of the concourse at the
         back of the turnstiles.

              MR. MAXWELL:       Thank you.

                      Cross-Examined bv MR.   DYSON:

Q. Mr. Duckenfield,   I would like to take you back, please to
   the control room at about 3.15 or thereabouts.   Do you
   remember that amongst the visitors you received at about that
   time there were Mr. Graham Kelly and Mr. Glen Curtain of the
   FA.  Do you remember them coming? - A. I certainly remember
      I will
      i W i n accept th
                     t h atyOU
                          t.   Say there was snother gentleman with him

0. And togetner with Mr. Mackrell, the secretary of Sheffield
   Weanesaay Club.   Do you remember him coming as w e ’i'*."A * r
   remember Mr. Ke lly and Mr. Mackrell.

Q. And they were anxious to know what was going on, and in
   particular what you were proposing to do about it and wh--p.er
   you were proposing to abandon the game.  Do you remain b e r t h a t~
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And I think you told them, did not you, it was going to be
   necessary to abandon the game but you did not want that
   decision to be dissem inated just yet for the reasons you have
   explained this morning? - a . Yes, sir.

Q. Do you remember also telling those gentlemen that the problem
   haa been created by a gate, the gate beins forced ooen* by the
   fans? - A. I may have said that, sir, referring to the first
   gate, because I thought there was a gate that had oD^ned at
   first.

O.    By the first gate,   you mean gate C? - A. Yes.

1.   A re you r e ferrin g to the first time gate C opened? - A. Let me
     take you back to the conversation.

          LORD JUSTI CE TAYLOR:    Where is the conversation? - A. In
     the Police control box.

          MR. DYSON:     _ In the Police control room, about 3.15.- -.A.
     Mr. Kelly came in,- and I was asked what had happened.        The
     specific con ver s a t i o n I cannot remember, but I may have been
     loath to tell him exactly what the situation was at that
     point.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What aspect of it?   What had
     happened, or causation? - A. What had   happened, my Lord.  The
     blunt truth that we had been asked to open a gate and that we
     had opened a gate.   I was not being deceitful.   It was just a
     case of at that situation we were all still in a state of
     shock, one might say.

          MR. DYSON:   So you accept you did not tell him the truth
     at that stage, that the gate had been opened as a result of
     your instr uction? - A. Yes, sir.

     You accept that, and you accept that you may have' said that
     the gate had been forc ed open by the fans? - A. I may have
                               113
                                                     D.G.   DUCKENFIELD


      referred to the first one, sir, yes.

 Q. When you say "the first one", what do you mean? - a . The first
    gate I believed at that time had been forced open, gate C.
    If you look at my statement my interpretation was when the
    first request for the gates to be opened I said in my said
    "Why do you want the gate open because it is burst oDen
    already?".

G. You are referring to the first request? - A. Yes.

G.   But that gate was shut very smartly,    was not it? - A    Yes
     sir.

Q. Anu you knew perfe ctly well that it was not the influx of fans
   as a result of chat opening which had caused the problem, did
   not you? - A. Yes. that was not the major opening*

G. And you knew the real cause of the problem and the casualties
   was the sec ond opening? - A. yes, sir, that was the
   possibility.

Q. Y ou see, I put these questions to you because Mr. Curtain and
   Mr.       Kelly are quite clear    that they were told. Mr. Curtain is
   clear that it was you who          said it, and Mr. Kelly isnot
   certain whether it was you or one of your colleagues.          At all
   e v e n t s , they are both quite certain they were told by the
   Police in the control room that the casualties had been caused
   by the gate being forced open by the fans?. - A. I would ?f£ ■as
   far       as to say that.   I am   trying to be helpful in recalJinf
   the       events at a moment of    crisis. W £ T . ^

G. Why were you being so coy about telling them what had
    happened? - A. The reality of the situation is that shortly
    after the events had occurred many people were in a state of
    shock, and I thought it-correct to collect my thoughts and to
  ,.assess..the situation, .1 did not exactly, information,-and -.1 am .
    not being disrespectful to Hr. Kelly or the other’ gentlemanv- I-
  . just thought at that stage that I should not communicate fully
    the situation until possibly a senior Officer of mine knew the
   situation.

G.   Did you know that subsequently and as a result of what you had
     said to Mr. Kelly that Mr. Kelly when he gave interviews to
     the media, of which he gave a number later that day, he told
     the media there were in fact two theories circulating as to
     the ca use of the disaster, the fans' theory and the Policy
     theory, the f a n s ’ the ory having been that the gate was opened
     by the Police and the Police theory, as Mr. Kelly told the
     media and the world, the Police theory being that the fans had
     forced the gate open.       Do you know"he had said that? - A. I
     had no idea, sir.

Q. Thank you very much.

                                      Cross-Examined bv MR. KALLIPETIS:

                Q. Mr. Duckenfield, following on from that, as I understand it at
                   about quarter-past-3 ;you say you may have given the
                   impression to Mr. Kelly that the cause of what had
                   hap pened was a gate being forced open? - A. Yes,
                   sir.
            B
                Q. Am I also right that at that time you knew that was not true?
                   - A. In the overall picture a gate had been forced open.  Let
                   me say this, my initial perception that was accurate, but I
                   did not say I had been asked for authority to open gates and I
                   had given it.

                G.   If you had given the impression that the cause of what had
                     happened was of a gate being forced open at 3.15, you would
m                    know that was not true? - A. I was asked for a quick
                     assessment of the situation.

                          LORD JUSTICn TAYLOR:    I wonder, Officer, if you would
                     just answer the question. - A. I may have misled Mr. Kelly.
         fH ^
                Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:         What you said was not true? - A. In       the
            d        final assumption that       I had opened the gate. no.

          / /   O.   What you said was not       true? - A.   If I said it. no, sir.   it   was
                     not.

                O.   In your statement at the bottom of page 7 you refer to C gate
                     being burst open, and at the top of page 8 you say:

                                  but at that  point a Mounted Officer retrieved            ;the
                            situation and closed the gate".

                     That is right,       is not it? - A. Yes,   sir.
m
                G.   Did you speak to M r , Kelly before or after you declared a.
                     major incident? - A.- I think it was after, s    i   r  ■7.            C .

                Q. Would     you turn to page     12 in your statement,    please:’

                            ’’The Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Mr. Jackson
                            joined me in the Control Box and asked for an
                            appraisal

                     Is that right? - A. Yes,       sir.

                Q.   You told him at that stage.-

                            "I was unable to give an accurate account of what the
                            situation was other than a possible pitch invasion...." -

                     - A.   Yes,   sir.

                Q. You then go on to say that Mr. Jackson went to the pitch:
           H
                               115
                                                      D.G.   DUCKENFIELD



            "Superintendent M u rray was asked to return to the pitch
            and try and get it cleared so that from the Control Box
            we could assess the situation".

      Is that right? - A. Yes,   sir.

 Q. You then say:

            "An^ambulance was requested but I was unaware of any
            radio message asking for this and was still relying"on my
            visual assessment of the situation".

      - A. Yes,   sir.

     Do I take that to mean that no call for ambulance services
     went out at that stage from the control box? - A. I c a n ’t b*
     specific, sir.  A request was made for an ambulance.

G.   Did     you cause that request to be made? - A. I personally end
     not,   sir.

Q.   At any stage did you cause a request to be made for
     ambulances to be called? - A. Yes, sir.

G.   Wh en? - a . About 7 or S isinutes-past-3,I think, when the
     ma jor disaster plan was implemented because the implementation
     started ^because of Superintendent Murray saying to me, "We
     want a fleet of a m b u l a n c e s " .

G.   Was that before or after Mr. Murray was asked to return to the
     pitch to try to get it clear, "so from the control box we
     could assess the situation"? - A. Mr. Murray went back to the
     pitch to clear it and then I think that is when the message
     came, "We d o n ’t want an ambulance. We want a fleet of
     ambulances".

G. How did; that message come to you, Mr. -Duckenfield? =•- ’a .'T j   ^—
   believe it was by radio, sir.     _

Q.   Is there a log, kept in the Police control box of all messages
     tha<_ Pass in and out^ — A. There was a log, sir, but it
     finished at 2.17.

Q.   Why was not it kept on after 2.17? - a . Because of the other
     activities in the control box.

G.   What other activities? - A. The Officers were busy doing their
     normal work.

Q.   Is this a manual log? - A. It is. ' This is the first time this
     log has been kept, but there is another log that indicates on
     the command and control system at what time the ambulances
     were requested.

                                     /Q. This is a log.

                         you that activated that call, is that right?  - a.               Yes
                            sir.

                      >.    You personally^ did it?  - A.   No I scood in the Control

                      ). To whom did you give the instruction?   - a . To the
                         Officers in the Control Room when I was giving instructions
                         ana tney were being c arried out by pc Bichard and th*

                           Can you recall to which Officer you gave the instruction to
                           call a sia}or incident? - A. I think it was PC Bichard
                           sir.

                           And when PC Bichard received that instruction from you he

                           A. I would think it might be before but I can't be
                           accurate sir.

                           And PC Bichard would relay to Force Control would he not
                           the report re.c.eived .from you? - A. Yes sir.       •

                           the Amoulance Headquarters in Rotherham?  - A. Yes sir.

                           And any information coming from Snig Kill could only have
                           come from your Control Box, isn't that right?  - A. Yes

            to continue segregation and further
            assistance was requested to help with
            the increasing injuries I could'see in

             "I called   for   'Operation Support'"

    A. Yes sir.

What does that mean?   -        a   . 'Operation Suooort'     is a t-rm
for increased manpower.

It is an emergency call        is it not?     -   a   . Yes sir.

And it is not an emergency call to deal with casualties,
it is an emergency call to deal with a ootential riot
situation, isn't that right?   - a . lt‘ is an increase in
manpower sir, a global increase in manpower.   We reouest
manpower to be sent to a particular location.

Was that the call that resulted in a veritable flood of
Police Octicers emerging,on to the pitch, forming a centre
line a na driving fans back, towards Leooinas L a n e 9 - A - I
think, the .ca.1.1 went out ..before that sir.-and -resources c a m e ,

I thought that I said was that the call which resulted in
Oi-Licers flooding on to the pitch, formina a line and
driving fans towards Leppings Lane.   - a " That would
cause extra Officers to be brought to the ground, although
I asked for the rendezvous point for 'Ooeration Suoport'
to be Sammerton Road Police Station.

Well something caused an enormous number oc Policp
Officers to come on to^the pitch, form a line across the
pitch   I think three deep in some places - and drive
Liverpool fans who were running towards the Nottingham
Forest end of the ground back towards Lepoings Lane.   -
A. Yes sir.

Was that a command from you?           -   A. No sir.     I think it
was taken by another Officer.

                                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think there is evidence too
                             v.nat apart from the cordon that went across the oitch and
                             moved towards Leppings Lane, were there also Officers who
  (m
                             lined up facing the North Stand?   - a . Yes my Lord.

                              The object of that was to stop Liverpool supporters              from
                              that stand coming on the pitch?  - a . Yes my Lord.

                         Q   Was that also from Mr. Nesbitt, you, or what?   - a . No .
                             I  I ^can take you bacK in time when gate A was ooen I
                     D       asked for additional Otticers co coma into the ground,

                             Orricers came on to the North Stand landings and also
                             extra Officers were brought on to the perimeter track then
                             my Lord.

                                    MR. KALLIPETIS:    Over the page at oage 13, after
                             you describe 'Operation Support     being called for, and vou
                     E       describe^there was a movement of supporters towards the*
                             centre line, if that is the run across the ground that
                             happened at 15.37 according to the video.     - A. I'm sorry
                             I d i d n 'c hear that. Would you mind repeating it please?

                                       .."I then began to give instructions to

                             You place that in sequence after your call for 'Operation
                             Support' and that call for 'Operation Support' after you
                             describe a mo vement towards the centre line.  If that
                             m ovement towards the centre line is the rush of followers
                             which we all saw on the video towards the far end, that
                             is 15.37.   —  A. No, that is not the situation sir.

                     Q       May I i_a*e ii_ then that you instituted a major        incident
                             plan?  -   A. Yes sir.

                     Q       You then become the Site Commander,       isn't that right? -
                             A. Yes sir.

                                  LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR: Can I just understand that.
                           No do ub t there will be some evidence about it, but ycu
                           say “by c ourte sy cf the Police they were there".      What
                           does that mean, that the Police had available some tickets
                           or sat them somewhere where there v;as not ....

                                 MR. KALLIPETIS:     Ey a private arrangement between
                  B        the Ambul an ce Officers and Inspector Sev/ell they met
                           Mr. Sev/ell at the gro un d who let them in with the Police
                           at the Penis tone R oa d end.  I should say with the knowlecg
                           and consent of the Club, of course.

                           I think, Hr. Ducke nf ie ld you would accept, would you net.
                           cna *- as we have heard from other witnesses, t; .az s c a n c m c
                           on the touchline even at the Leppings Lane end would

Cl                         a pac ke d pen? - A. Yes sir.

                           Over the page of that particular memo, Hr. Duckenfield,
                           as you have it in front of you, the last sentence, sir
                           the last p a ragr aph refers to Serial Orders to assist the
                           Fire and Ambu la nce Services in any maj or disaster.      "Two
                           Police Tar.go Units will be specifically detailed to assist          /
                  D        one wi t h the Am bu l anc e Service and the ether with the Fire

                           is pr oba bl y because my copy is so bad, can you in fact
                           find that in the Serial Order for the Cup Final of 1SG9?
                           - A. i can't at this itage sir.        It is the first time I
                           have seen that and x w ould have to look through it
                           sp eci fi ca ll y in detail sir.

                      Q. If you turn over the page there is the sample order that
                         was att ac he d I believe to that memorandum? - A. Yes sir.

                      O.   I don't     kno w w h e t h e r or- not it is in the Serial Order
                           because     as -I say my copy is -quite ba d and. I w o n 11 detain .
                           you nov/    bu t perhaps some time somebody will, tell-me          .
                           wh et her   or not it exists? — ;A; 'Yes' sir.                 ‘•

                      Q. Again after you had declared a major incident, Mr. Duckenf ield,
                         and you are aware of course that the gymnasium was going to
                         be the area wher e the Ambulance Services would congregate
                         and receive the casualties, what instructions did you .give for
                         the cleari ng of the area around the gymnasium of Police
                         vehicles, the Police canteen and I think the Police horses
                         - A. I did not give any specific instructions sir.

                      O. A 'phone call alerting the Ambulance Services directed the
                         ambulances to Leppings Lane? - A. y e s sir.

                      Q. Did you give any ins truction to alert the Officers outside
                         the ground at Leppings Lane to expect ambulances, to assis
                         their access to the ground    and clear barriers in their
                  H      way? - A. Sir, I gave the instructions from the Control
                         Bo:c for these actions to be implemented.

Q. To w h o m did you give that instruction? - A. Ivhen I gave
   the instructions f o r the ambulances to be called.

Q. To whom? - A. P.C. B i c har d when I was giving out the
   instructions, but I am talking about the initial request
   fcr ambulances.

Q. T h a t initial request, as v/e have seen, if that is the one
   that SYMAS received, w o u l d appear to be the notification
   o n l y and not aski ng for ambulances to attend but merely
   put ting then on notice that they night be required to
   attend? - A. But there is a subsequent message asking for
   ambulances.

Q. A s k i n g for a fleet of ambulances? - A. Yes.

Q. Are you saying that is the message that you put through?
   - A. Yes.

Q. T h i n k about that, Hr. Duckenfield. Have a lock at the
   transcript? - A. I pers onal ly put through?

Q. llo, a message that you caused to be put through.    This
   is a fleet of ambulances message that contains the lie
   ab out the calls, does n't it? - A. Can you tell me which
   pa ge we are referring to and which paragraph?

Q. Yes, page 3. - A. Th at ma y be a misunderstanding by the
   pe rson concerned.     I woul d have to investigate that beec.us
   1 do n ' t know wh at their understanding of the message, was
   or their un d erst and ing of the incident when they passed
   the message.

Q. H ow I want to be clear that I have covered this.     You did
   give an instruction did you to Hr. Bichard to inform the
   Of fic e rs ou tside the Leppings Lane entrance to expect
   ambulances? - A. No, I did not.

Q. You did not-give that instruction? - A. l-io.

 . D o n ' t you think that instruction might have been given?
   - A. I was giving instructions on many things at that time
   It was a m o m e n t of crisis and a very tense situation and I
   was trying to run an operati on and as has been evidenced
   I w as being inter ru pt ed and pressed by various people who
   w e r e posing q ue st io ns and wanting answers and I was trying
   my b e s t to deal with that situation as best as I could.
   H av ing requested the ambulances I expected others to deal
   w i t h the situation.

Q. D id you give any instructions having perceived there were
   injuries; having p e rcei ved that there was a need to call
   a m a j o r incident and having perceived there was a need to
   call for a fleet of ambulances, to anyone to evacuate
   casualties to ou tside Gate C at Leppings Lane? - A. Ho,
   I d i d not.

C o u l d you please turn to the Club bundle which is the black
volmrse, page 61. * T hat is an article I think in 'Police
R e v i e w ' ? - A. Yes sir.
By Mr. Locke who was a Secu ri ty Consultant for Sheffield
W ed nesd ay Fcctbc.ll Club? - A. Yes sir.

We saw yesterday that Mr. fioore sent a memorandum describing
the monit or in g facilities at this ground as "the finest
in the c o u n t r y ” I thin); from memory? - A. Yes.

If you wou ld be kind eno ug h to look at the third column in
the bott om left-hand c o rne r and the paragraph that starts
in the middle of that colu mn underneath the double lines
of Football, it says this:

        "Inside the ground he         talking about the
        operator         as Senior Officer car. watch
        crov/d behaviour and identify offenders through
        the zoom facility".

A.   I am sorry,     sir, m y   copy is not very good.

Do please have a clean          copy.

      MR. COLLIKS:  It is not a question of cleanness,               I
think, it is a question of si~e.

      LORD. JUSTICE TAYLOR: well if somebody actually reads
it and you have got it in front of you I should think you
can make it cut, can't you?  Even I can.

        MR.            Does it not say this:
              KALLIPETIS:                                talking about
closed circuit cameras as his eyes.

        "He is able to anticipa te problems, see
        incidents as they build and deploy necessary          .
        resources to abate them".              ... ..             ... ,

A.   Sorry,   sir,   can you direct me?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Look at the bottom left of the
w h o l e page under the w o r d "Football" first complete p a r a ­
graph halfway down that column, that is the one. - A. Thank
you, m y Lord.

Q.         MR. KALLIPETIS:   The sentence starts 4-and-a-half lines
      down from the tcfp of the column:  "Today at Hillsborough a
      senior Officer can follow      "

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Now you have gone. I am sorrv
You are in the first bit.  About five lines d o w n 'from t*e t o D
of that column.

          MR. KALLIPETIS:   My Lord, perhaps to put it in context
     may I go back to "Today at Hillsborough....".

             THE WITNESS:      I have got that.

Q.           MR. KALLIPETIS:      It says:

              A Senior Oiticer can follow crowd movement outside the
             stadium by using the closea-circuit cameras as his'eyes .
                   able to ant ici pa te p r o b l e m s . see incidents as they
             build and employ necess ar y resources to abate them.
             Inside the ground he can watch crowd behaviour and
             identify 01 fenders through the zoom facility".

     — A . ^e s .

j.   Did you use or was the zoom facility          used at all to have a
     closer look at the situa ti on in pens        3 and 4 once it was
     apparent somebody was climb in g over         the fence? - A. Not that I
     am aware of, sir. That may have been          the case, but I looked
     through the window.

). I think I am right in saying that on the composite video for
   all its length I don't recall any zoom pictures in that video.
   - A. I can't recall, sir.

 . Doubtless if I amwrong I can be corrected.

               LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR: That would really serve the         same
     p u r p o s e .as the suggested field g l a s s e s , would .not it?   a . '
     Yes, my Lor-d.

             MR. KALLIPETIS:     Thank you,    sir.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You are bound to take a little
     time.    I think.  Who is next?

          MR. GLASGOW:   My Lord, I am.    I d o n ’t think I will take
     much time, but I will be even shorter if I can start in the
     morning.  I have alre ad y told my friend, Mr. Woodward.

          LORD JUSTICE TAILOR:           Very well,   10 o'clock tomorrow.
     We will break off now:

                        (MORNING S E S S I O N )



      MR. KALLIPETIS:   Sir there are two farther calls on
 tne transcript that I handed in yesterday.  In fairness
 to this Officer perhaps I should put these to him as well.


      LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:        That will only take you a
 moment will it?

      MR. KALLIPETIS:      Yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Perhaps you would like to do
tnat now because I am going to interruot the flow of
evidence by something else which I will mention in -
moment.

             DAVID GODFREY DUCKEDFIELD recalled

         Further cross-examined by MR. K A L L I P E T I S :

Mr. Duckenfield you recall that yesterday I handed you a
transcript of the tracks of the taoes at SYMAS Head ­
quarters.  - A. Yes sir.

And we went through the first call that came            through from
Force Control.  -   a . Yes.


Do you still have    that in front ofyou?            -A. I   havp just
got a copy.

You will see that    on the fourth page there is a second
call at 15.08.13.   -  A. Yes sir.

Also from Force Control     - you will see the abbreviation
'F/C'.  - A. Yes.

And that was asking for ambulance to Leooings Lane end,
an-d then it says:

           A big fleet of ambulances,          immediately
          as many as y o u ’ve g o t . "

He is told there is one on its way:

          "We want mor e   than one."
             "Just hold on while we get the

            ambulance up there, w e ’ve got officers
            in the vicinity that can assess it
            for ...

 and toen the tape is either indecioherable or cuts out
 A. Y e s .

 There is a third call over the page at 15.10.

       LORD JUSriCb TAYLOR:      What page are you on now?

      MR. KALLIPETIS:      It is track 11.      It is the sacond
 transcript sir:

You see at 15.10.25:      Force Control:

            "Leppings Lane."

           “Hello love is Superintendent Clark
           there olease."
            •I * -
               Hold the line."

and it you turn over the page please you will see that th
call is transferred to Superintendent Clark at 15.10.35.
The legend is 'Control':

           "Hello can    I help you?"

Do you see that Mr. Duckenfield?   - A. I have got "Just
to let you Know ...... operation.." Is that the paragraoh?

Yes:

           "Just to let you know ...."

and then it is indecipherable I am told:

                operation .... all the manpower
           from all over South Y o r k s h i r e * _
           Leppings Lane.".

           ”0 K - Right we'll respond then thank
           you for your help."

           "Much obliged to y o u . ”

and that finishes at 15.11.       -   A. Yes sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you help about this
Mr. Kallipetis.  I noticed in a report which I have seen
                         3




from the Ambulance Service that there were two ambulances
there before the match began.  Is that right?

     MR. KALLIPETIS:         No sir, one was there.

     LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:         And one within a mile.

     MR.   KALLIPETIS:       And one was on standby.

     LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:    We saw on the film that the
St. John's Ambulance single ambulance comes on first and
it seems to be quite a long time before one sees any other
ambulance.  What happened to the SYMAS ambulance that was
actually at the ground?   What happened to that, do you
know, in the early stages?

     MR. KALLIPETIS:     That stayed in situ   according to
the  plan to act as the base cor communications.   Tne
Officers from that ambulance went to the Leppings Lane
end to find out what was happening because they couldn't
see from where they were.    There was tnen a call throug.i
to'Headquarters at 15.13 declaring that there was a major
incident, and by that time, 15.13, alreaay ambulances haa
arrived at Leppings Lane end in response to the earlier
call from the Police.

     LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Am I understanding correctly
that the ambulance that was on at the ground a.-j the SY^AS
ambulance on duty so to speak was not an operational
ambulance, it was a communications ambulance was it?

     MR. KALLIPETIS:    It is an operational ambulance sir
but as you will see from the plan the first amoulance on
site does not rush straight into t h e s c e n e . _ There has got
to be an assessment of exactly what is required.          There
are several reasons for this, sir, which will become
apparent.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I d o n ’t want to anticipate. I
just wanted to know why we had not seen it at an early
stage on the grou nd but I think you have explained it, and
we will hear the evidence later.

      MR. KALLIPETIS:   You will hear why it is not a good
 idBa for the ambulances to go right on to the pitch.

      LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:        J^ery well, thank you.

      Now, Mr. Collins I understand that - of course tne
 video that was shown last Friday as a compilation of
 about two and a bit hours out of many, many hours o^
 video.
      MR.   COLLINS:   Sir,   that is right.

      L.OSD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  And I understand that there
 are parts of the remainder which have been looked at and
 which may be relevant, and it may be better that thos*
 who are still going to cross-examine look at it before
 tney proceed.

      MR. COLLINS:    I think so sir because bits may be
 relevant to the Chief Superintendent's evidence because
 they show the scene after the disaster had started!

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      In that case it seems to be
           th,at; .we should do that now.  I understand there
 a«.= uiree dircerent sections, is that riant?     One which i
 pnotograpned from the west Stand lockinc d~wn *ov=--<= ►h®
 Pitch ....                                 "      ~

 . , M R .^ COLLIN'S:    Sir may I explain?   The first is
inaeea tnat.      It. is actually the unedited BBC film from
<-.*a-. camera which is situated as I understand it in or
Un^ a r ^the Rest s ^arld looking out towards the goal from
benina.     Parts oS; that ace in the comoilation^but not all
Tne second is _a compilation made after hours of difficult
work of a Police video camera from last year of the
Leppings L a n e _turnstiles showing the flows last year, and
indeed also ot the state of the pens last year, and the
tnira, waxen I have not myself yet seen, I understand to
oe six ana a half minutes or so showing th = zoom b^ing
used on the opening of gate A, and the ooening, I think
-he first opening, of gate C.       That is my understanding.
I have not personally yet seen those two.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We know where the camera is
that shows gate C - that is the one on the extreme tip of
West Stand there.  Is that the same camera that can focus
on to gate A?

     MR. COLLINS:    I think so.  Clearly the BBC contains
an hour's worth but I don't suggest that we look at the
whole of that period.   It is the period from three to four
I would suggest that about the first fifteen to twenty
minutes is what we should see of that.   The last year
compilation is a total I think of about twenty five
minutes.  Again I don't suggest that it is necessary to
 ook at the whole of that, and we can look at the eariler
bit from the middle and a bit of the end perhaps to give u
a clear idea of what it is about.    The other as I say is
six and a half minutes and I think we can watch the whole
of that.

     LORD JUS TIC E TAYLOR: We will do that as soon as
that can be set up, and of course anybody who wants to see

              A


                  more of it arrangements can be made.    I think it will take
                  about ten minutes to set this up but I think there is no
                  i-'Oiriu in proceeding at the iTicment.

              B         MR. COLLINS:   X tnin.< prooably it would be desirable
                  to see it first because it may be there are matters which
                  will oe clarified and which will obviate the need for
                  cues t i o n i n g .

                         S i r , X was just wondering what you were intending
                  about personnel.       It would seem desirable that anyone who
                  wishes to, who is here, if there is room should come and
              c   par ti cu la rl y perhaps the witness and any Police Officers
   #              w.no are about to give evidence.

                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   All these who are involved in
                  tne Inquiry who are here may see it and as many of the
                  public as there is room for as well.  It will be in the
                  handsla Room and it is being set up as soon as possiole.
              D        .MR. COLLINS:  Certainly I have seen two of them and
                  I know Mr. Glasgow has seen at least two of them.  We can
                  probably get some agreement as to which bits we can omit
                  and which bits we can show.

                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Does anybody else want to say
                  anything about this?
              E
                       MR. RYTi\ER:    Yes sir.  Just to fill the ten minutes
                  that we are waiting I want to make two points.    The first
                  is, which dire ctl y bears on this, my clients have
                  requested a view of the uncut videos, and obviously
                  relating to Leppings ....
  #
                       LORD JU STICE TAYLOR:      All sixty nine hours?
              F
                       MR. HYTNER:   Not quite.  Only those relating to the
                  Leppings Lane terraces, and I think I ought to say that
                  the west Midlands Police and Mr. Collins have agreed in
                  principal that that will be done, so those who wish, and
                  those who take medical advice as to whether they should,
                  will no douot in due course see that.

                                            D.G.    DUCKENFIELD


                C r o s s - E x a m i n e d b y MR. GLASGOW:

Mr. Duckenfield, as you know I appear on behalf of the Club.
I ^ain concerned net to add to your embarrassment, but in view
of the admissions you made yesterday, I w o u l d like to see
what you now say about the Club's responsibility for what
you called "crowd management".    Do you understand? - A. Yes.

You will remember that on Wednesday afternoon you said very
firmly to Mr. Co llins in chief that you regarded the Club
as being responsible for crowd management within the ground
incluaina the filling of the cens? - A. Yes.

Would you now accent that the ODening of the gates, and I
will put them^in the plural if I may for the moment, that
the opening of the cates without -warninq anybodv on the
ins i c e , wnci_her or not that was tactically a correct decision,
its effect was to deprive anybody on the ins c.e from their
ability to manage the crowd that came in? - A. My under­
standing is that the Stewards should have been in the
location of the enclosure with in addition Police Officers
in that location ivho were on public order duties and thev
should have accepted some responsibility in that area for
tneir duties or crowd management and direction.

Did you expect either your men or the Club's Stewards to
be able to control or manage that crowd when it came through
the gates if they wer en't told they were coming through the
gates? - A. I woul d have expected that as the crowds came
through the gates that the Stewards in the area would have
assisted in direc ti on of the fans away from that tunnel.

Can I then take the two entries through the gates separately.
The first as you now know was at 2.47? - A. Yes s i r /

A nd that as you no w know was an unintentional, may I call
it a bursting through because nobody intended that the
crowd should come in, did they? - a ". Yes sir.

You saw that as it happened on the video? - A. Yes sir.

A nd you were concerned at the time as to w h a t the con­
sequences of that mi g h t be? - A. Yes sir.

Because you recognised that the whole object of the
policing operation had been to control the crowd outside.
You'noa? - A. Yes sir.

A nd to allow them to be filtered through the turnstile
system at a rate that the ground could safel y consume? -
A. Yes sir.

A n d you recognised that any breach of that system either
deliberate or accidental would potentially cause a very
a very serious' p r o ble m inside? - A. It could, yes sir.
                                                      11
                                                                    D.G.   DUCKENFIELD


                 Q.    Was not one of t h e aspects of that pro bl em that you foresaw
                      the pr obability that those on the inside would be unable
                      to control the crowd when it came in through the gates? -
                      A. It was a possibility, sir.

                 Q. A n d since that possibility was in your mine, it was also
                    vital that as m u c h warning as possible be given to those
                    w h o were to receive that crowd whether Officers or Stewards?
                    - A. Yes sir.

                 Q.    Why   did you   at tempt to contact Mr.Locke? - A. I personally
                      did not try and contact Mr. Locke, Superintendent Murray
                      took that responsibility on himself.

                 Q. A-T; I right then in thinking that had Superintendent Murray
                    not tried to do it, you would not personally have foreseen
                    x.u c r.ssc to contact anybody? — A. In it.” experisnce there,
                    ar.c it is d if ficu lt because it is with hindsight ....

                 Q. Fcrcive me bein g ruce, could I ask for the answer first
                    anc then tell us what, the reason for it is, if that does
                    net sound rude? — A. On the day in question I did not
                    t m n k of co ntact in g Mr. Locke but Mr. Murray did.

                 Q. Would you n ow like to explain why?   Why did vou not think
                        it? - A. Bec ause I was dealing with the incident as I
                    s aw i t .

                 Q. It was simply an oversight on your part? - A. It was an
                    oversight.
         E       Q. That is very kind.      Who is the Chief Steward? - A. Mr. Locke.
                    I am sorry, as I understand it it is Mr. Locke at Sheffield
                    W edn es da y who we liaise with.
(•   .

                 Q. You thought that Douglas Locke, the retired Superintendent
                    of Police, was the Chief Steward at this ground? - A. I
                    understan d that he is our contact and I thought he was
                    a Chief Steward.
         F
                 Q. Who was responsible for the disposition of Stewards at
                    the Wes t End of this ground, who is actually in charge of
                    them? — A. I cannot answer that question specifically.
                    Do you mean from the Club's point- of view?

             i Q.      U n s p e c i f i c a l l y . You always use that wo r d and I d o n ’t know
                      w h a t_ it means in the context in which you use it. Give
         G            me any answer you like whether specific or general as to
                      who was in charge of the Stewards at the ve st p.nd of t-.hr?
                      ground or p u t tin g it bluntly ....             A. A representative
             ,         of Sheffield W e d nesd ay Football Club.

                 Q.   W h a t was his name? - A. I don't know.

                 Q. Pu tt in g it again bluntly. Chief Superintendent, you should
                    have known, shou ld n' t you, who was actually in charge of

       : eiS           It was an oversight on your part not to have tried

   s u p e r i n t e n d e n t . the gates were being o p e n e d , and more
   importantly, the decision or the consideration to the opening
   of tn os e gates was going on without you believing that anybody
   on the inside was being warned? - a . N o , sir, only if they
   picked up the information on the talk-through system.

0.    Yes.       The whole reason for the club providing you with their
      own radios was so that you in the Police control box could
      d i r e c ^ Stew5rds lf necessary as well as Police Officers, was
      it not.       a. S i r , you will have to ask Mr. Mole for the
      reasons.       I am aware that we had a radio.     I d o n ’t know that
      we direc te d stewards with that.

Q- Well., c ^ i ef Superintendent, I am sorry, you are the man who
        ln charge on this day, and my questioning would be wholly
   dif fere nt if you were even at this stage prepared frankly to
   conce de that the Police made a muck up of this operation, but
   you will not concede that, and thelrefore I am putting to you
   as the senior Commanding Officer of this Police operation that
   your attempts to pass responsibility to the club are
   di sre p u t a b l e and unfair. Do I make that plain? - A. I have

Chi ef Superintendent Mole, that the club has co-operated to
the extent of vast expense in providing every single facility
that the Police has asked of it, is not it? - a . Mr. Mole
agrees with the co-operation, sir.

It is right they have provided probably the best and most
ex pensi ve surveillance system in the country in the ground
for the Police use? - A. It is an excellent system.

Ex clu sive ly at their expense? - A.   I d o n ’t know about that,
sir.

It is right that they provide not only the radio link within
the ground but that they provide you with the equipment so
that you can break into that radio link and contact their own
stewards directly?  That is right? - A. I didn't know that,
sir, but I will accept it if it iscorrect.

You didn't even know t hat the Police control box had the
co.iity to override an ^   c — rs.  v.r.w ciub s racio system? —
A . No , sir.

You at least knew they handed over exclusive control of the
Tannoy .system, did you not? - A. Yes, sir, for emergency
purposes.

A nc you knew tnat that Tannoy system was checked every single
gams to the satisiaction of the Police? — A. Yes. sir.

And despite the understandable criticisms which have been made
   it in this crisis that occurred, would you agree with me it
is in fact probably one of the best Tannoy systems in any
football ground in the country? - A. I can only speak of two,
Sir, at the moment, and it is a very good system.

it is a very good system.   Can you think of anything else that
the club could have done,   whether by way of manpower or
financial, expense which would have better co-operated with the
Pol ice than what they did do? - A. No, sir.

On top of that, lest there be any misconception in a n y b o d y ’s
minds as to the extent to which the club simply exploited or
took advantage of Police Officers to do their jobs, they
ac tual ly paid something like £50-, 000 to the Police to actually
provi de the men every time they came to a match as big as
this, did not they? - A. You are talking about payment for the
r eso ur ce ?

Yes, the actual paying for the Police? - A. Yes,       they would
pay for them, yes, sir.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     That is something that has been
estab lis hed they have to do.

     MR. GLASGOW:    Oh, yes.   I w o n ’t press that further:

       advantage of all those facilities that had been made
       available to you but you deprived the club of the

             MR. GLASGOW:         It is probably mine,          sir:
 Q     There are two parts to it, Chief Sup er i n t e n d e n t . I will put
       tnem separately.   If you decide simply to open a gate and let
       tne crowd in en bloc you are overriding all the control
        ysterns that have been seu up and agreed upon? - a. Yes, sir.

 C. And if you do that without givin- anybody w * r ^ n 2
    the teiepnone, on the radio or by word of mout h. “you are also
                      -Lf norir*=   the communication systems which
       Y c besa set up? - A. I think the point he is makir.H, sir. is
    t m s . I UcS c.uenptir.g     save life and serious injury, an"
    in my consideration of saving life and serious im'u’-y i'
    aeciaea to open those gates.      The other .conseauences at that
    time, w m l s t they were there, were not the prime
    consideration.

 Q‘            m- t e it absol ut el y plain that I accept you acted in
       h   k"S       °2 tne spur of the moment and that the mistake
      whic h you made was a bona fide and perfectly honourable one,
           yee accept tnat it was a r.istake, co '-cu net" - ^
      are you saying was a mistake?              ’    ^

0. Not to tell people what you were doing? - a . Attempts were
   made to tell people what we were doing.  In the crisis of the
   moment the prime consideration was the saving of life and
   serious injury, and that was a prime consideration.

G.    Chief Superintendent, I have accepted up to that stage all
      your bona fides, despite what I am respectfully putting to you
      was a mistake.       What I am challenging you on is your
      dis re pu ta bl e attempt to make the club responsible for that
      mis           Don t you understand that? - a . I can understand
      your line of Questioning, sir.

G.    Yes.   lou have accepted that it was a mistake very candidly
      whe n my learned friend, Mr. Hytner, on my right asked you a
      questi on yesterday. - a . Can you just clarify that? What did
      I accept was a mistake?

Q. Openin g the gate without warning anybody on the inside that
   you were going to do so? - A. I think with hindsight....

Q.   I see   - a . With hindsight I would say that that was a
     mistake.    The point is that at the time I had other
     considerations.

                     G . Would it surprise you to know that one of the Officers under
                         your lmmeaiate command in the control box was sufficiently
                         concerned to zoom in on gate A, or did you not know that the

                              x a n f y something.    I think you have agreed with counsel that
                             when gate A was op ened; without any ins truction from you there
                             we ~® two serials had been put in position to receive thcm' -p
                             my Lord, I am aware of one, Serial 20.

                    G. Yes   but I understood yesterday that you did say that when
                       somebody in the control room said that gate A was going to go
                       in anyway unless it was opened, Sergeant Higgins I think you
                       Said.' - A. Yes, my Lord.

                    G.        You instructed that every available      Of ficer should attend in
                             two places. One of them was in the        North Stand to control the
                               an ings there for these people that     were coming in, and the
                             other was on the perimeter? - A. Yes,     my Lord.

                    Q.        Well, what I      was w on de ri ng is this-;Why you thought it
                             necessary to give an instruction to         warn people to control the
                             crowd coming through gate A into the Nor th Stand, but not the

     wondering this.    In the North Stand there are individual
     seats? - A. Yes,   my Lord.

Q.    And I suppose if a lot of people cone in there who are not the
     s=a^ hCiCcrs inere can be trouble? — A. Very much sc.

. But am I to understand that so far as the gate C and the
  terraces are concerned your view was simcly as ■?t had
  always been, that it was up to the fans to'level~
  themselves out because nobody had a particular place?
     A. Yes my Lord.    But behind gate C there is a safety
  area.    Behind gate C there is an area of safety orior to
  tne t a t r a c e .

 You would not expect people wanting to go to the match        to
 remain there would you?  - a . No my Lord.

         MR. G L A S G O W : Ir I may just ask you the next
 question that I was going to ask about that s-’nai» oo^nt
 with respect to what my Lord has put to ycu.          Was it net
 e-.-'ii more important to have what my learned friend
 Mr. Collins called a 1ceception committee' at cat® C than
 at gate A?       - A. Yes sir.                        '

 Because in cate A, as we can see from the plan, these
 coming tnrc-ugn^vere already channelled in one direction       in
 a relatively tight corridor.   - A. Yes.


 vsne re as at gate C they were simply going to scill into the
 concour se and unless controlled go straiaht down ther=
      A. Yes sir.

v.hen the first - again I use the word "illicit", the
bursting through entry at 2.47 occurred, you have already
told the Inquiry that y ou were concerned as to what the
consequ en ce s of that might be. - A. Yes.sir.

You^had two means of checking your concern.  One was to
loo^ at the video which was showing the entry through that
gate, would you agree?  -  a . Yes sir.


The second was to do the rather more old fashioned and
less sophisticated thing of looking out of the window into
tne stand.  -   A. Yes.

Did you do neither?     -   A.   I looked at both sir.

/ind when you looked out of the window, down into the stand
a-s we see in the last photograph of the bundle, did you
                    that that small, relatively small, crowd
had on peno 3 and 4 whan it came through the tunnel just
after 2.47?   - a . N o sir. I don't recall any impact.

You didn't notice any effect on the crowd of the men
comi ng througn the tunnel at 2.47? — a . My soecific
recollection is that I didn't notice a distinct
difference.

       MR. HYTNER:^ I wonder, sir, before Mr. Woodward cross-
 examines, may I just put two more questions really arising
 out of matters that I had no knowledge of when I cross-examined

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes, Mr. Hytner.

           HYTNER:  M r . Duckenfield, now we knov; what you
said later to the Eoard and to your Assistant Chief Constable,
you have given y our explanation as to w h y you did not wish
to tell the truth and I am not going to pursue that.      What
I want to ask you is w h y in deciding to suppress the truth
you also decided to tell a lie about the supporters, about
the Liverpool fans.    V.ny couldn't you have simply said you
did not know what had happened? - A. In the crisis of the
moment, sir, with all those pressures that are so evident,
I can't give an h onest answer ether than the stress of the
situation.

If-'U i C C l'ts=    you, that that lie fcr which you cannot cive
an    explanation,has
— — A_ _ _ ■>-_ V •*     caused
                         _   . widespread

                                           slandering of the fans
   :t cr.lv here hut a is       Europe? - A. My intention in nv
action sir was not tc cause any distress.

vsell m that case, this is my last question, since that was
not your intention, wc u l d ycu r.otf take the opportunity of
publicly exonerating the fans? - A. Publicly"exonerating
the Liverpool supporters sir?

Yes? - A. For wha t exactly?

    the overcrowding beni nd the goal at the Leppings Lane
end which caused 95 deaths? - A. I am in some difficulty
with that answer, sir.  I would apologise for anv inference
with Liverpool supporters as a whole.

Mr. Duckenfield, let me make it plain, I am sorry I have
overrun my two questions, that I am not asking you to
exonerate the beh a v i o u r of isolated fans who caused dis­
orders outside the g round either through drink or for
other reasons before the match.        I am asking you publicly
to exonerate the fans for the overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4
which caused 95 deaths? - A. Yes, I publicly apologise sir
for the inference that people caused those deaths.

      MR. HYTNER:   Thank you.

     _MR. JACKSON:   Sir, we indicated at the outset that
my learned friend Mr. Eytn er and I would not ask the same
questions but it is qu ite apparent that those questions
asked by Mr. Hytner in fact covered the virtual entire
remit of matters I w o u l d have put to the Police Officers
in this case.

      May I associate myself with the questions and parti­
cularly accept the a p o logy and observations made by the
Chief Superintendent.

                                C r o s s - E x a m i n e d b y MR. WOODWARD:

              Q. Mr. Duckenfield, is this right, that insofar as you have been
                 responsible for any misunderstanding or misleading, you
                 unreservedly withd r a w and apologise? - A. I cc sir.

              Q. What time did you get home after these events on the 15th
          B      of April 1989? - A. About half-past-1 in the morning sir.

              Q. And is it right that the time came when the investigation
                 and consideration of what happened at Hillsborough was
                 passed to the Wes t Midlands Constabulary? - A. Yes sir.

              Q. Alt hough Sheffield or the South Yorkshire Police have been
                 relieved of the burden of that, have you been considering
 #        c      this matter and had it on your mind at all since it happened?
                 - A. It has been on my mind daily and a Ime si ii U — J1. vr c -

              Q. Mr. Duckenfield, plainly many many people will have been
                 g r i e v o u s l y affected by what happened that cay.  We cc net
                 seek to diminish our sympathy for them in that tracecy,
                 but what has been the effect on you -'             - A. Quite a
                 traumatic effect, sir, very sad and on some occasions
          D      difficulty recalling accurately times and sequence of events,
                 although they are accurate from my recollection.

                 And insofar as ycu are able to join with those, do you
                 extend your sympathies and heartfelt feelings to those
                 vhc have been involved? - A. Sir, my deepest sympatny
                 gees out to them.  I cannot say enough on that matter.

              Q. You have given evidence before the Inquiry according to
                 your recollections? - A. Yes sir.

              Q. Thinking about the matters, hearing and understanding from
                 other people their recollections and their understandings
                 of time, have you experienced any surprise or perplexity?
                 - A. Yes sir.

                 In what and how in general has that been? - A. I have a
                 clear picture in m y mind of events of the day but I have
                 found with video tape and information since that my
                 sequence on occasions is incorrect.

                 Nevertheless do you still have that clear sequence in your
                 mind? - A. The sequence and the events of the day will
                 never leave me.

                 However, that recollection that you have in a number of
                 respects do you understand t h a t “it is out of synchronisation
                 wit h what others recall? - A. Yes sir.

                 A n d is inconsistent in some respects w i t h what others
                 state? - A. Yes sir.

                     Q. For example you Jiave told the Inquiry that you recall a
                        message to the supporters in the West End terrace to move
                        forward to allow others to come in? - A. Yes sir.

                    Q. Do you remember at what time that was civen? - A. No sir.

                    Q. Does it surprise you that there is evidence that that
                       indication was given some time between 2 o'clock and 2.15?
                       - A. I am surprised sir.

                    Q. Wha t was your impression of when that happened.  What is your
                       impression of when that was given?   Not what others tell
                       you, but what is your persisting impression of when that
                       happened? - A. I would have thought that micht be later,
                       sir.

                    Q. According to evidence, another example, there is indication
                       that a request came from Mr. Marshall tc close Leppings
                       Lcr.e^. Dc^ ycu have a clear impression, your own impression
                       of wnen tr.at occurred? - A. Yes sir, my perception was that
                       •   ^   ». ? •«   a »*   ^   i   n      — •   .   <   .   .   .

                       it closed.    I related that to 2.30.
                D
                    Q. Are you aware in fact that there is evidence tha  .
                                                                         •isiC•.

                       was given or will be evidence that thaz request occurred
                       at about 2.17? - A. Yes sir.

                    Q. How^does tnat information and the knowledge cf that other
                       evidence equate with your recollection.  What is your
                       response to tha~? - A. I am surprised sir.

                    Q. A n o ther example, I don't intend to co throuch them all
                       because the evidence will in due course be put before
                       the Inquiry.     You will recall an endeavour by Mr. Murray
 m                     who was in the Control Box to communicate with Mr. Locke?
                       - A. Yes sir.

                    Q. What is your recollection of what it was that Mr. Murray
                       was trying to say? — A. I c a n ’tremember sir what he was
                       trying to say.

                    Q. Yesterday an impression may have been received from your
                       evidence that Mr. Murray was trying tc tell Mr. Locke
                       that the gates were going to be opened? - A. Yes sir.

                    Q. Would you just like to think about it for a moment and
                       doing the best you can please try and help us what your
                       recollection is, or what it was   that Mr. Murray was saying,
                       if you heard it? - A. I did not   hear it, sir.

                    Q. So when you gave your understanding yesterday of what it
                       was, what were you drawing upon in or der to answer those
                       questions? - A. An impression based on five weeks ago, sir.

You see Mr. Murray did indeed endeavour to contact Mr. Locke
b ut it was not concerning the words: "The gates are going
to be opened" or any warning to that effect.  Do you follow?
- A. Yes sir.

If that is the case and that turns out to be the evidence,
how does that accord with your impression of what was
happening at the time? - A. It would appear that I was
confused on the occasion, sir.

May I ask you about the Control Room in which you were? -
A. Yes sir.

We have seen the photographs of it, at the back of West
Midlands 2.  In that Control Room can one see a number
cf telephones? - A. Yes sir.

Various other items of and for communication? —      Yes sir.

                          Q. You are looking at people in and around that area, and even at
                             the same people? - A. Yes, sir.

                          G. Are those photographs in any way surprising to you, as

                          G.   Was it your view that there was room for people to come into
                               those terraces in addition to those that were already there

                               job or not? - A. No, sir, I can't say that.

                          G.   There was, of course, as we know, considerable room on the
                               north and south wings of that terrace? - A. Yes, sir.

                          G.   Were you able to see any impediment or reason why that room

                          G.   Did you have any understanding of any expectation by anybody

an open airwave where all conversations can be heard.

And that is the Police radio? - A. Yes, sir.

However, whilst all conversations can be heard does that mean
that everybody can speak? - A. There are difficulties, sir.

What are the difficulties as you understand them? Whether
rightly or wrongly, what is your understanding of them? - A.
More than one person can try and-communicate at once, and if
they do so difficulties occur with the messages becoming
scrambled.

                      FRIDAY    26 TH MAY,      19 89

                         (Afternoon S e s s i o n )

            Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD              (cont.)


Mr. Duckenfield before I go to the major incident I am
asked to correct -something that was put to you this
morning in relation to tal^-through, do you follow?  -                 -
A. Yes sir.

Talk-through is not a particular channel, it is a                  .   :
particular facility that is available for different
channels.  - A. Yes sir.

And one can switch to it’, and then while you are operating
on   that channel it exists for all who possess radios who
are listening .and using them.   The major incident I was.
going to ask you about, do you have with you volume 2 o£
the South Yorkshire documents?     - A. Yes sir.

I am going to ask you simply about the procedure, the
major incident manual is found after tab 24, and if we
look .ac section -4 there it says 'The Alert' do-you have                  .
it?  - A. Yes.

             "If notification is received, the
             information must be passed immediately
             to the Force Operations Room who will
             alert the other emergency services that
             a major incident may have occurred and .
•          " trrat.the Police are implementing the                  za*-
 '    •      major incident plan.1'

So according to that, once the alert has been raised then
Force Operations have a-role to fulfil.  - A. Yes sir.

AtidT if,-.TMre goes rto -section 7, page 1. of r.that, '.a ;.few;pages -
f urther orr, 'enti tled "Force Operations Room*’; does a t           :- ..
there identify, amongst the responsibilities of the
Operations Room, at B, the function and task of alerting
the emergency services and other authorities and depart­
ments whose facilities and expertise will be needed.                - A
Yes sir.

So once this procedure is set in train, for example by
communication from someone such as yourself, what
responsibility or role do you then have in calling for
those services?  - A. I don't have any, sir, they are all
with Force Operations Room.
                                      D. G. DUCKENFIELD




A point was put to you concerning the number of Police
Off icers who appeared on the pitch to form the cordon,
yesterday, and in relation to those Officers who appeared
on the pitch to form the cordon right across it after the
•incident had become apparent is it your understanding
that those Officers will have come from within the ground,
from the Force already on site as it were?   - A. I can't
be accurate in that reply sir.

 It is unlikely i s n 't it that they have come from
 'Operation Support'?    - A. I would think so.

Now may I ask you, not in great detail, but a little about
the events of that day.  The build-up of people outside
tne turnstiles in the numbers and throng that we see op .
the tapes, was that something that you had anticipated
occurr ing? - A. I had anticipated a football crowd
gathering, yes sir.

Had you anticipated the sort oc difficulties that the
Officers there experienced?  - A. No sir.

Did there .come a .time when you asked for..assistance to come
from reserve within the stadium?    - A. Yes sir.

Do you remember what time that was or not?              -    A. No sir.

That was to get reserves to go to gate. A, Serial 20 I
th.ink was one .of .'the serials that turned up. . - .A. Yes
sir.

Are you aware that that serial was          unable     immediately to
get out of gate A?  - A. Yes sir.

Were you .aware <at the time?     -    A-   No :sir^    ? v-..> v

Are- you -aware .-.that in fact the gate was. locked-and; i t ;was i
a little while before the gate was undone to enable those’
serials to get out?       - A. No sir, I wasn't aware of that.

Because:-it. has rbeen .put.to you that:,thers-: were ,lines, of •' :
-CXf£ icers. inside;:gate- A waiting to receive ^people>who-were -
going to be let in, do you follow?        - A. Yes"sir.

Was that something you had arranged for or not?                 -   A. No
sir.

Was that serial, or some of those men that were there, men
that you had intended to go outside through the gate?  Do
you recall or not?  - A. I don't recall sir.

While in the Control Room viewing the scene, viewing the
material that was coming through to you, did you
                                                      45
                                                                 D. G. DUCKENFIELD




                             appreciate that an emergency had developed, or was in the
                             mak ing outside the turnstiles? - A. Not initially sir.

                        Q.    But then it was appreciated?       -   A. Yes sir.

                   B    Q.   Now gate      C I think was indeed opened on the two occasions
                             that our      attention has been drawn to on the videos.  -    A.
                             Yes s i r .

                        Q.   Thau first opening of the gate, was that something you had
                             intended   to happen or not? - A. No sir.

                        Q. And when it did -happen a number of people came in through-
                           i t . - A . Y e s sir.

                       Q.    Is it right Officer that that opening was not as a result
                             cf any direction-.that you gave at that time? - A. Yes
                             sir.

                       Q.    The ingress of people on that occasion, did it appear to
                             you where you stood and where you viewed matters to have
                   D         any impact or serious effect upon people in the stadium?
                                A. No s i r .

                       Q.    In the s>ii_uation in which you were, for whatever reason,
                             d i d you foresee that people coming in through that gate'at
                             that;time. might •have a s e r i o u s ,imoact on/.oeool** •fen' tb*
                             terraces?     - a . No sir.

                       Q.    In fact did .you give any thought at that time, when c o n ­
                             templating or considering the question of the-gates being •
                             opened, making any provision within the enclosure, that is
                             between the turnstiles and the terraces?: - A. No sir.

                       C'. • K a y w a s
                                     tha t?      -'A. There were Off icersyin -.fchat-iafes -
                             already sir.                               ^      v-:: -

                       Q.    And what did you expect that they would do?  - A. I
                             expected them to monitor the situation, and it they saw                ■
                             difficulties to take action.

                       Q.    But-did you .expect them actually, to form-a: cordon fer- -;       .
                             anything at that stage or not?    -    A. No sir.

                       Q. When gate C was opened the second time did you anticipate,
                          rightly or wrongly, that there would be any need to do a n y ­
                          thing within the enclosure?  - A. No sir.

                       Q.    Had you been looking at all at the situation on the
                             terraces?  - A. Yes.

                       Q.    And what is your recollection now of the scene of the
                             people that were there?  -  A. A state of normality sir.

 from what has been said today I did sir.                r«jy concerns ware
that 54,000 people co uld cause massive disorder if they
were angry about my, or the Police Service, actions, and
Uiii5'bortxug.h Stadium .-.is near :a*..park, ev shopping -centra-'.and
orivat-a. housing.,, an d I ..needed not only the-.escaoe-.roates
to be opened - I say'"escape routes” , for ambulances and

true story initially I could have a major public disorder,
not so much in the g r ound but around it.

I follow that thinking but what I am concerned about is
that you appear to have conveyed the impression as part
of not telling what actually had happened, that it was
the breaking down of a gate by the fans that had actually
caused the trouble. That is what the media picked up and
that is what the media broadcast? - A. When I was in that
Control Room, very difficult, very tense situation, and
you have seen the size of the Control Room and from the
pitch you have seen the difficulties that we were facing.

Chief Superintendent, I don't want to interrupt you but
that is not an answer to the question? - A. I know, I am
coming to the point. There were many people asking
questions of me. There were many people wanting decisions
a n d :the 'opening ana the closing of that door.. Hr. Kelly
came in with Mr. Mackrell, another person wanting an
immediate 'answer 'to -a difficulty and I was in the midst of
other things.      I tried as best I could to deal with my
own -situation satisfying my policing needs with the crowd
and ‘-'in- s6me ways, this may seem unusual,-being polite tc
Mr. Kelly and saying:      "Look, this is the .situation", in.
whatever words I said it and hoping he would leave me
very quickly so that I could get on with the matter in hand..

The only reason I am asking you this is .that in the light
cf your answer to Mr. Woodward, I am wondering why you
thought it would be less likely to lead to disorder to
tell the true position than to imply that it was the fault
of 'the’f&ns-r -Some might say o r :m igh t;think tha-t that-would^,:
be iaore -likely •tb_*create disorder? - A- Sir,, with hindsight;.-:
today -we can -all look differently at that situation. .I. acted
as I believed to be correct in a crisis moment.

       MR. COLLINS:    Yes, very well.

      MR. HYTNER: May I just correct something Mr. Collins
has^pdt '^eeause it/may not be absolutely/.accura±^e^0..^ e*

      ; --T*he impression- I have from the vast.number; ofr,«tate- -
ments that I have read and from the evidence that has been
 given, is that the hostility of the fans after the.match
 towards the Police was in large part, certainly in_ large
'part rarid-may-^have"been in sole part, due ..to their, perception
 of what- the Police-we re doing on -the pi-tch.         the track i.

      MR. COLLINS: Yes, I am obliged.   I think that may
well be right and although I think it was a combination
of the two and actually those who listened to that video
a little later will hear, I think we all heard on the
television, fans with tickets complaining that the Police
had opened the gate and let them in to the overcrowded
pen, so I think it is fair to say it is a combination of
both.

                  Bv LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

Hr. Duckenfield, you were saying there was a risk if you
gave the full truth it might get out to the media and
cause disorder? - A. Yes.

That prevented you from giving the full truth? - A. Yes, my
Lord.
There is nothing to stop you telling the Assistant Cnie^.
Constable what had happened, was there, when he came in«_o
the Control Room? - A. No sir.

Did vou tell him? - A. Ho, I think he asked me questions sir
and 1 related to the incident on the pitch.  I did not give
him the full picture at that time.

Did you mention that      the gate had been opened; tnau i3ns
 had got in through an open gate? - A. I can't be specific,
my Lord.   I must have mentioned about the situation on^the
 pitch and briefly what had occurred, I mean about the first
 cate opening, but the full details including the actions
 by Superintendent Marshall and what had fully developed,
‘I aid not give him the full picture.

You did not tell him that you had given authority for the
gate to be opened? - A. No, my Lord.

Well whv jiot? -Apart fr-on anything else; it might,have been
helpful" to have his advice or discuss with him. what-,it was.
best to say at that--stage with a -view.,to tel ling the Cl.nb
and -so on? - A. Yes, my Lord, but I didn't.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes. thank you.

      ME, ISAACS:   Sir, before Mr* D uckenfield comes to
 the witness chair, 1 should say after he is sworn there
 is one matter I wish to mention you.

       THE COEONERs       Yes.

               DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD Sworn

          MR. ISAACS:         Sir, the matter is this:
ir, Duckenfield will do M s very best to assist both            you
and the Jury in relation to the events that took place
before and on the 15th April, 1989.              You know, sir, lie
gave evidence before Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry,
That was a time of great stress, both for him and no
doubt for the others.              It is now almost two years ago.
His evidence to that Inquiry covers over 200 pages of
transcript;             many aspects of this case were asked about
time and time again.              His evidence lasted for some three
days, often, as 1 have mentioned earlier, giving evidence
for some three hours at a time w i t h o u t a break#        I say
this now so it will be of no surprise if it happens, but'
on my advice - and I stress this - if he is asked about
any matter relating to the evidence h e gave before Lord
J u s t i c e T a y l o r he will exercise his privilege,   I make
that point very clearly at this stage.

       MR. KING:   Sir, in the light of that, and I make no
c o mplaint that I had no notice of i t , it is helpful
because I will not even attempt n o w in the light of that.

       THE CORONER:       Thank you

                         By THE C O R O N E R :

I ought to establish who you are.                 It is David Godfrey
D uckenfield? - A. Yes.

You are a Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire
Police? - A. Yes.

You, of course, have heard all about these warnings
b eca u s e I kno w you have been in Court.                 Mr. Isaacs
c lea r l y has d i scussed it with you, but I think it is only
pr o p e r that I should remind you of the situation right
from the outset because a s ubstantial number of questions
w h i c h you may be asked may well be of a nature w h i c h may
tend to incriminate you.                Under the Coroner *s Rules, and
indeed other rules as well, but we ar e only concerned
w ith the C o r o n e r ’s R u l e s , you have the right and the
p r i v i l e g e not to answer any q u e s t i o n w h i c h may tend to
i ncriminate you.          If you were to be a s k e d such a
question, strictl y speaking I should tell you e a c h and
e very time.          However, there are two problems w i t h that;
one, that I may not notice that the q u e s t i o n is of this
                                                             33

                                            D. G. DUCKENFIELD


   nature and secondly, of course it does tend to slow down
   proceedings.

         THE CORONER:   Can I just turn to Mr. Isaacs and
   check?    Are you happy if we do what we did with
   Mr. Murray, which is to give the reminder intermittently,
   just to keep it in the forefront of Mr. Duckenfield's
   mind?

        MR. ISAACS:    Sir, I am.   If you would say, for
   example, when thetime came when you felt it was
   important, "You are not obliged to answer that*', that
   would be sufficient for my purposes.

        THE CORONER:   As I say, we don't want to have
   needless repetition of words, in effect:

Q. The point is, Mr. Duckenfield, that merely because I have
   not warned you does not necessarily mean that the
   question is not incriminating.   If you perceive it to be
   so, indeed if Mr. Isaacs feels it is and he feels it is
   unwise for you to answer, he will no doubt rise and say
   something. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. It is a privilege which you are entitled to exercise and
   you must do so if you think it is appropriate.

        MR. ISAACS:   Sir, I only wish to stress again what
   I think my friend Mr. Manning said yesterday.   The fact
   that a question may have a tendency to incriminate does
   not meant that the answer does.

        THE CORONER:   Indeed, I quite understand that.
   This has always been one of the problems with the rule:

Q. Now we have established who you are and that you are in
   the South Yorkshire Police.   I think you will be able to
   confirm for me that you were appointed Chief
   Superintendent in March 1989? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. Was it the 27th as far as I remember? -A. As far as I can      '
   recollect it was Easter Monday and I think that was the
   27th of March, 1989.

Q. You were in fact taking over Mr. Mole's job? -A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. One of Mr. Mole's tasks had been and, indeed, whoever was
   in that seat, was Hillsborough Football Stadium and the
   running of matches there? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Of course by the 27th of March it had already been
   decided that the semi-final between Liverpool and
                                            D. G. DPCKENFIELD


    Nottingham Forest was going to take place at Hillsborough
    on the 15th of April? - A. Yes, sir.

 Q. You knew that because I think you had been invited to
    attend a planning meeting on the 22nd of March? - A. Yes,
    sir.   Mr. Mole, as you have previously heard, already
                arrangements and called a planning aeeting on
    the 22nd, which he chaired, and I attended as an
    observer.

Q. You had policed at Hillsborough previously but it was
   quite a few years ago, would that be right? - A. That is
   perfectly true, sir.   If my memory serves me correctly I
   was there in the latter part of 1979 and the early part
   of 1980.   I was then a Chief Inspector at the Hammerton
   Road Sub-Division, which is the Sub-Division formerly
   commanded by Mr. Murray, which actually covers the
   ground.   However, at that stage I was merely a Chief
   Inspector and my role in football was limited.

Q. Just so we can get this right, you weren't there in
   1981,were you? - A. No, sir.  In 1981 I think I was at
   Attercliffe Police Station.

Q. In the interim between 1980 and 1989, I think you had
   done some football policing at the other stadium in
   Sheffield, is that right? - A. Yes.   Perhaps I can
   explain it a little more accurately.   Whilst Commander
   of the Attercliffe Sub-Division it was not my direct
   responsibility.   Then I left there and went to West Bar
   Police Station as the Deputy Divisional Commander and so
   whilst the Sheffield United Football Ground was in the
   Central Division and commanded by the Central Division
   Superintendent, I had an indirect overall responsibility
   because I was the Deputy Divisional Commander.   On
   occasions I would go to the football ground at Bramall
   Lane, but I think it is fair to say that at that stage
   Sheffield United were in the Third Division.

Q. If we add all that together, you have had some experience
   of football matches, but it was relatively limited?
   Would that be a fair summary? - A. I think that is fair
   to say, sir, yes.

Q. In any event you were appointed to your appointment not
   because of your football experience but because the Chief
   Constable decided you were the right man to run that
   particular Division? - A. If I can expand a little on
   that, sir.  The role of a Chief Superintendent in the
   South Yorkshire Police, in general terms they are, shall
   we say, generally - an over use of the word - they are
   generalist roles, as opposed to specialist.   If I define
   specialist as being the Head of CID or the Head of
   Traffic, then they are the specialist roles.   However,
                                                                  35

                                                 D. G. DUCKENFIELD


    in my particular case, I think that looking at the role
    of the Commander of a Division, which is Hammerton Road,
    then there are many and varied talents that are required.
    I am not wishing to promote my own image, far from it,
    but in describing the job situation it is one of
    commanding in the region of 300 Police Officers, managing
    the public order situation overall - I mean the Saturday
    night rowdiness, the crime situation, the traffic
    problems - and being something of a diplomat liaising
    with the community and committees.

   Now the football policing role is only one facet of a
   vast array of duties and responsibilities and it is my
   view that the Chief Constable promoted me probably for my
   generalist qualities as opposed to my specific ability
   with regard to football.

Q. You have told me you went to the meeting with Mr. Mole
   and various other people on the 22nd of March as an
   observer.   Indeed, Mr. Mole invited you because he knew
   you would very soon be in his chair? - A. Yes.

Q. At that meeting were the general principles of what was
   going to happen discussed?   Can you remember that? - A.
   In fairness, sir, my memory is a little vague.   I can
   probably give you an outline as to my recollection.
   Mr. Mole had invited all those agencies he considered
   necessary to draw together in the form of a partnership
   to draft the Order for a successful operation.   It was
   just not confined to members of the Police Service.    My
   recollection was the people from the Transport Department
   were there.   I think probably someone from the British
   Rail Police, and people of that order, people you might
   consider in the normal course of events were peripheral
   organisations, but vitally important to ensure that
   everybody who had an input knew exactly what was going to
   take place on the day.

Q. I am not too interested in the precise detail of that
   meeting, but at that meeting, or subsequently before you
   took over, were you given any - I use the word
   " b r i e f i n g ', I don't like it, actually - but did you have
   any discussions with Mr. Mole about the sort of problems
   you might have to face in your command role at
   Hillsborough?            I realise it wasn't the only thing in
   life, but it was an important event. - A. We had the
   meeting on that day and I think it fair to say he set the
   scene and drew up the plans.            After that time we had
   another meeting, but on that particular meeting as far as
   I can recollect, we discussed many matters.            I am sorry,
   I cannot bring to mind specific conversations about
   specific problems at Hillsborough.            I was given to
   understand that the plan was well laid, that the team
   doing it knew what they were doing, it was a tried and
                                           D. G. DUCKENFIELD


 - trusted plan and that I would be well served by the
   individuals who would be making the necessary
   arrangements.   Nothing was drawn to my attention at that
   time that caused me to think there were to be any
   difficulties.

Q. In fact we know that Mr. Murray and various other people
   set about working on the Operational Order for 1989? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. Did you have any reason to assume that it was in any way
   different - substantially - I do not mean in detail, but
   substantially, from the previous Orders which had been
   drawn? - A. No, sir.   I think on the Wednesday following
   my appointment I called a meeting with Mr. Murray, Chief
   Inspector Beale and Inspector Sewell.   We had a meeting
   in my office, the fine detail of which I cannot remember
   other than to say that being the new man I asked
   questions about the Order, I discussed matters with them
   generally and as to progress, and they gave me, in the
   light of my limited experience of that Hillsborough
   Order, they assured me that matters were progressing
   satisfactorily and that there would be no substantial
   differences.

Q. In due course the Order was put in front of you and you
   eventually signed it? - A. Yes. I think probably I made
   a couple of adjustments, which were minor, actually.    If
   I can describe one of them which, with hindsight, may not
   be a major issue - there are a couple actually.   I had
   previously worked at West Bar Police Station where we
   always had a log for events and I suggested we should
   have a log.   Of course, not fully appreciating the
   situation and the confined area in the Control Box, I
   think we subsequently found that my suggestion and my
   idea probably wasn't such a good idea because of the
   space difficulties.

  The other one was that bearing in mind that on the day of
  the briefing of the 801 Police Officers, for the Saturday
  natch, it concerned me that it would not be very
  professional if 801 Police Officers all arrived for a
  briefing at 10.00 am and they were just to find their own
  place and sit down.   It is a minor matter, really, but I
  thought that professionalism dictated that we would
  allocate a row and we would allocate seat numbers to
  Serials so that when an Inspector or a Sergeant got out
  of their transit from Doncaster or Barnsley, wherever it
  ®ay be, they would enter by Gate 0, they would walk into
  the North Stand, they would find their row and they would
  sit.

  There were minor things but really nothing substantial.
                                                 D . G . DUCKENFIELD


 Q. Would I be right in saying as far as you knew prior to
    the match there were no particular problems with regard
    to the order? - a . N o , sir.

 Q. The general format? - A. No, sir. I was told that the
    order was a tried and tested Operational Order. I was
    told - and when I say this please don't think I am
    moving any responsibility away from me - it was a tried
    and tested order.  I was told that the plan was tried
    and tested and I think it fair to say that it should
    not be changed for change's sake and really it is an
    established practice. Everybody know the practice and
    it works.

 Q. Did you, because we might as well grasp this now,
    understand what I will call the 'find your own level'
    system which was going to be used in the Semi Final? -
    A. The difficulty I find with that, sir, is that I am
    not so sure at the time prior to the day. There is a
    degree of uncertainty in my mind that I knew what that
    situation was. As I understood it, the ground had a
    Safety Certificate, the ground had been passed as being
    safe by all concerned and they have specific capacities
    for specific areas and I think when I recall the 'find
    your own level' there was some conversation, I think
    probably on the match day. I know M r . Murray does not
    remember it probably but I thought that somebody had
    said, "is it going to be 'find your own level'?", as to
    when that occurred or what, and I think that that was
    on match day.

 Q. Are you thinking of Mr. Creaser coming to the Control
    Box, is that what you have got in mind? - A. It is
^   difficult. One of the difficulties I find, and I make
    n o .excuse» is that with the passage of time some of the
    things I thought were accurate tend not to be on
> occasions and so all I can say is that on the day in
    question I have a view that somebody said, "Are we
    operating 'find your own level'?"

Q. I take it that you went round the ground at some point.
    In fsct I think you policed two matches prior to the
   Semi Final but they were small ones. I think that is
   right, is it not? - A. Yes, I think on the first
   occasion, sir, it was a Saturday afternoon game with
   Millwall and I met with Inspector Sewell and, as had
   been normal under Mr. Mole, I think Mr. Murray was
   probably in the Control Box running the match because
   it was a match that didn't attract an awful lot of
   attention and there weren't many fans. I did probably
   what most Commanders do. I picked up Inspector Sewell
   who was the experienced Inspector who dealt with these
   ®&tters and said, as I say like any new boy, "Give me a
                                                                38

                                               IL -JL - DUCKENFIELD


    Cook's tour, if you like, of the area" and I did that
    looking around the ground. So I visited the ground and
    walked with him on that particular Saturday afternoon.
    I think after that there was a Tuesday evening match
    with Wimbledon but I didn't play a role in that as
    such. I went there probably much the same as Hr.
    Jackson. It was a night match. I couldn't see an
    awful lot and I sort of observed it more from a
    spectator's point of view but certainly popped my head
    in at various places. I cannot recall too much.

 Q. Did you realise that Mr. Mole had specifically chosen
     the Superintendents and allocated them to jobs because
    he realised that you yourself had limited experience of
    Hillsborough or did you not understand that? - A. Yes,
     I did, sir, actually. What happened was I think even
    by the time of the meeting on the 22nd before I was
    promoted, the thing I recall from my own memory is that
    people had been chosen to fill command positions.
    People were filling those positions and it was all done
    and I looked at it. I suppose as any new Commander,
    you look at it and think, "Well, it has all been
    arranged" and I questioned him about it. I don't say
    that in a disrespectful way. I said, "You have picked
    all these people. What is the situation and why?" and
    he said, ^Well, I know the personalities, I know their
    capabilities and I have seen them in action". He said
    words to the effect, "With no disrespect to you, I know
    what they can do and where they should be". He said,
    "I am helping you out by doing that" and so I was
    grateful.

Q. Did you also have an opportunity to speak to the Club
   people, Mr. Mackrell and Mr. Lock in particular? Prior
   to the match I mean? — A. I am sorry, sir?

Q. Prior to the match, before the match? - A. Mr. Mole and
   I had an arrangement whereby he would take me to the
   Club and introduce me to Mr. Lock and Mr. Mackrell.    I
   suppose in a professional sense, that is in policing
   terms, I knew M r . Lock because he had been a serving
   Police Officer although I do not think we had ever
   worked together closely. Mr. Mole was to arrange for
   ®e ^to 9° to the Club but for some reason that meeting,
   P rfor to taking over, didn't take place and I cannot
   think why not.   I mean it is one of those things in
   business sometimes.

Q. You had walked round the ground with Inspector
   Sewell? - A. Yes, sir.
                                                             39

                                               P- G.

 Q. How good an image, if that is the right word, did you
    have of the geography of the ground? I know you may
    have a very good image of it now? - A. Yes.

Q. I want you to try and think back to 15th April 1989? -
   A. I think that - how can I put it in context? It is
   not a football ground I have visited on regular
   occasions, shall we say, and if you consider if for
   instance I might have visited the ground at the other
   end of town as a Policeman and as a spectator whereas
   at the Sheffield Wednesday ground I think it is safe to
   say that my visits were confined to my visit at the
   Semi Final in 1980 I think it was and then after that
   that one tour round it. So, on the one hand, if you
   say to me, do I know the ground and do I know the
   features, I know where places are but if you want to
   tie me down to specifics then I am limited.

Q. Would I be right in saying you had received no, in
   Police parlance, intelligence to indicate that this
   match would be any different to previous years or had
   you received any indication that there would be any
   iteration, major alterations? ~ A. Yes. As you may
   know, sir, we liaise with other Police Forces and
   obtain intelligence about football supporters and we
   did have an intelligence document in relation to the
   visiting football fans but if I can just, to be fair,
   confine my remarks to matters that concern this
   Inquest.

Q. Yes, indeed. - A. About public order matters then I
   think in fairness, sir, we didn't receive any
   intelligence that related to public order matters as
   such.

Q. You I think made arrangements to have a briefing
   session with senior Officers on 14th April, is that
   right? - A. That is the day before the football match,
   yes, sir.

Q. I think that that was a conventional thing as well? -
   A. There had been I think an accepted practise and the
   main reason was this that at ten o'clock on Friday
   morning prior to the match it had been practise to
   gather together all of the senior Officers of Inspector
   and above to sit them in the North Stand, actually in
   the ground, to let them get the feel of the place. The
   reason being is this; whilst I have said that Mr. Mole
   had hand picked his Officers who knew the ground and
   knew the places there were other people coming along
   who were Inspectors and probably Chief Inspectors who
   may not have been so conversant. The idea being that
   on the Friday morning I would give a briefing to them
                                              P . G. DUCKENFIELD


 and during that briefing point to, for instance,*"That
 is Leppings Lane end on my left, that is the South
 Stand behind me" and point out those features. Those
 people would have read their Operational Order by that
 time and would know what the written word said.

    It would be part of my job to give them an overall
briefing, a broad brush picture of the situation, and
then at the conclusion say to them, "Ladies and
gentlemen, walk the ground, for want of a better term,
go to your locations, look at your areas and acquaint
yourselves with them so that tomorrow when you arrive
at ten o'clock after the briefings when you have got
your men you know where you are going, you know what
you are doing and you know the situation". To that
extent we had laid on transit vans for those people who
were working in outlying areas to be put into those
vans and be driven around to look at the situation and
    & feel of the area. That was the purpose.

    There was just one other point as well, of course,
that if any one of those supervisory Officers had read
something in their order and then having gone to their
Particular location to do their policing we would have
at least 24 hours to overcome any difficulties that
they foresaw.

As a matter of interest did you get any feedback that
required any major changes? - A. I personally did not,
sir.

In that briefing did you discuss aspects of safety with
your senior Officers? - A. Yes, I did, sir. I have got
a typed briefing note. May I refer to it?

Yes, by all means. - A. I am sorry, I handed it to the
West Midlands Police at the time of the Inquiry.

You have not got it now. - A. The original is missing
but if you have a copy?

Yes. - A. Yes, I have got it, sir. Can you just bear
with me so that I can just glance over it?

Yes, certainly, and   remember you do not have to answer
any question out of   this briefing note which may tend
to incriminate you?   - A. Yes, sir. Sir, I am in a
position to comment   upon it if you wish.
                                                              41

                                            D.   G.   DUCKENFIELD


Q. What I would like you to do is to tell me, first of
   all, you have already told me partly what your
   objective was of having this briefing, but what were
   your objectives with regard to this pre-match briefing
   on 14th April, and secondly what were your views with
   regard to responsibility towards the public in general?
   - A. Right.   I think the situation, sir, is this, that
   anyone who has seen the Operational Order, and the
   thickness of it, and the information it contains, must
   be well aware that we cannot cater for every
   eventuality and it is important for me as a Commander
   to set out what my objectives are on the day, so people
   are quite clear where we are.   In that respect I
   prepared a briefing.   Now another unusual feature is I
   typed this briefing, because I was new and I wanted to
   get it right I typed it out and what have you, so this
   is the briefing I prepared.   I went down it and
   basically it was to outline, first of all, the fact
   that it was a 54,000 - I am jumping paragraphs which
   are not relevant.

Q. Yes, we don't need everything. - A. I told people about
   the crowd, how many people we expected, described to
   them the layout of the Ground, and I told them about
   extra time being played, the difficulties with the same
   colours.  Then I came to what I considered to be a very
   relevant part and I said specifically to them:

           "It is our intention today that this match will
           take place without any public disorder and we must
           ensure the safety of the public both inside and
           outside the ground and segregate the opposing
           fans".

   and I talked about obstruction of the highway.        I then
   went on to say:

           "I want the public to be treated properly but
           those who transgress should be dealt with firmly
           but fairly within the law."

   Then,    sir,   I went on to say:

           "I cannot stress too highly the word 'Safety'.
           This ground will be full to capacity today and
           some of you may never have experienced a football
           match of this nature before

Q. Does it say "before" there? - A. I am sorry, no, it
   doesn't:

           "OUr job is to ensure the safety of spectators and
           you must make sure you know the escape routes, the
           problem areas, and that you are fully conversant
                                                             42

                                            D . G.   DUCKENFIELD


           with your responsibilities should a crisis arise.
           There will be a tremendous atmosphere within the
           ground but you must not be caught up in this or
           the events that are taking place on the field you
           must remain detached and clear headed at all times
           to respond to events."

    I then went on, sir, to discuss matters generally and
    point out the individual responsibilities of the Sector
   Commanders, that is who was in charge in the Control
   Room, I said that the Control Room would be commanded
   by Superintendent Murray, and I went on giving
   information, I think, that has already come before this
   Inquest.

Q. Yes. - A. I did make the point that --- I am sorry,
   sir, just bear with me a moment.   Another, I believe,
   relevant paragraph is that I said:

           "All Inspectors ...."

   - and this was on the Saturday briefing -

        "All Inspectors who attended briefing yesterday,
        these officers will, at the end of this particular
        briefing, speak to their respective contingents
        and advise them of what they expect and of the
        particular problems in their area."

  I went on to say:

       "Any difficulties or any decisions within those
       areas will be taken by ...."

  - and this, sir, says Section Superintendent.  I think
  it is a misrepresentation in the transcribing.  It
  really should be Sector Superintendents, so it should
  read:

       "Any difficulties or any decisions within those
       areas will be taken by Sector Superintendents."

  I then went on to make mention of CID matters.  I
  talked about train times, travelling arrangements and I
  think at the bottom of page 5, sir, I emphasised at
  this point something that has probably come out
  previously.  I said:
      ||
       Gentlemen, the order covers most eventualities and
       I can't in this limited time cover everything, but
       there will be additional briefings by your
       Supervisory Officers and your Inspectors have a
       copy of the operational order and are fully
       conversant with what our intentions are today."
                                        D.   G.   DUCKENFIELD


 I finally said to them, sir, in the final couple of
 sentences or so:

     "Firm but fair policing with the correct attitude.
     Safety of supporters in this ground is paramount.
     Nobody gets in without a ticket.
     Nobody takes a drink or banners into the ground
     and nobody goes in who is drunk."

and that was the closing of my briefing, sir.

It is only a very minor point and it is not important:
the paragraph where you say that all Inspectors who
attended the briefing yesterday, that presumably was
included in your briefing on the Friday as well, wasn't
it, but I take it you changed the words when you spoke
it? - A. Yes, sir.  What happened was this, that I had
a draft and when I gave the briefing on the Friday it
had to be changed slightly and in the transcribing the
odd word is incorrect, but it is substantially correct.

You used the same format,   but I think somewhat
shortened, on the Saturday, is that right? - A. Yes,
sir.

That was, of course, addressed to the 800-odd people
who were in the Stadium? - A. Yes, sir.

I think just so that we don't mislead anybody you
actually left out out one paragraph which dealt with
the safety aspect, didn't you, in the Saturday
briefing?   Is that right?   Do you want to have a look?
- A . Which one?

I am not in any sense complaining about it, it is just
that I don t want to have any misunderstandings.   My
understanding is that you did not deal with,  I cannot
stress too highly the word 'Safety'"? - A. Are you
suggesting that I did not say that on the Saturday?

I am asking you. - A. As far as I am concerned, sir, it
is my view that I said it.  The only difficulty I have
is that my original papers were handed in and I make no
complaint about that, but I have only got the
transcribed version and I can't check back.

I may be wrong.   - A. It is my view, sir, that I ....

Yes, you did say it.  It is in the transcribed version,
I beg your pardon, I take it back.  It is certainly in
the transcription anyway. - A. Yes.

                                         D.   G. DUCKENFIELD


Q. You have mentioned that you knew about the Safety
   Certificate and the allocations of specific numbers? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Were you conscious prior to the day of the penning in
   Leppings Lane? - A. I think I knew of the radial fences
   as such but to say I knew of the penning, I am
   uncertain of that, sir.

Q. Would it be fair to say that you did not on the day
   have detailed knowledge of the signing, directing
   people which way to go at the Leppings Lane end? - A.
   No, sir, I had only had that one visit.

Q. In fact, you were very dependent upon the quality of
   the order which you had inherited and the quality of
   the people who were working under you and supporting
   you? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Before I actually turn to the day itself I just want to
   deal with this one aspect which has been mooted several
   times, namely the issue of postponing the kick-off? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. I don't want to talk about the conversation in the
   Control Room, which may or may not have taken place, we
   w i H find out in a minute, but had you considered the
   aspect of postponing the kick-off in general terms? -
   A. I had had a conversation with Superintendent Murray.
   When or where - and I am not talking about the Control
   Box now - my belief is that it was sometime in the run
   up to the match, just as a matter of general
   conversation, as a new man would, "Would you tell me
   about this, that or the other", and that was one of the
   things I asked him about, "When would we delay a kick-
   off , and he gave me the answer in general terms,
    Well, when there is something significant", such as, I
   think his words were, "which seemed unusual for the
   time of year, fog on the Pennines, snow or ice".   I am
   not so sure about that, but something significant which
   would hamper the fans from arriving at the time, and
   that basically was the original gist of the
   conversation.

Q. In any of the other matches which you have ever
   policed, wherever they may have been, had you ever had
   to take a decision to postpone kick-off? - A. No, it
   was quite outside my experience.

Q. In any event, you came to the Ground on 15th April and
   we are now moving on to the day itself, and you have
   told us that you had your briefing, and then I don't
   quite know what you did, but in fact you were not in
   the Control Box until about quarter-to-2, is that

                                        D.   G. DUCKENFIELD


 right? - A. Yes.  What happened on the day was, very
 quickly, after the briefing I walked around the North
 Stand where people were sitting after their briefing,
 speaking to people generally as one might do, saying,
  Do you understand the Order?  Is everything all right?
 Any difficulties? , the usual sort of conversations
 that one might have in the early stages before people
 went out on the streets.

 I then went in a Police car and toured the area, much
 the same as I think Mr. Mole has given evidence.  It is
 the sort of thing one does and I got in the Police car
 and toured the area and toured the outlying districts.
 Then I returned to the Ground at some stage, I am not
 too sure at what      time, and had something to eat
 and then, as you say, went to the Control Box.

Just as a matter of interest, when you were touring in
your car had anything struck you in the outlying area
which alarmed you? - A. No.  I think that the mood of
the day, sir, it was a beautiful day, glorious
sunshine, it was the day where I think people were
going to come and enjoy themselves, and looking at it
there was absolutely nothing to cause me any concern
whatsoever.

Having done that you then had a meal? - A. Yes, sir.

Was it at   the Stadium or was it at the Police ...? - A.
It was in   the gymnasium, sir, at the Stadium.

Then you made your way over to the Control Box? - A.
Yes.

When you got there I take it Mr. Murray was already in
place? - A. Yes.

As were the other three Officers? - A. Yes,    the Control
Room staff were in situ.

Having got there I take it you made a few enquiries as
to how things were in general terms, and were you
reassured that everything appeared to be satisfactory
at that point? - A. Yes, in general terms everything
was going as expected.

I think it was at about that time that Mr. Jackson
popped in, is that right, the ACC? - A. Yes.  Mr.
Jackson was there.

He was already there? - A. Well, I am uncertain.   I
w ®nt to see the referee with Superintendent Murray.    I
think Mr. Jackson was there when we came back from
seeing the referee, I think that is what it was.

So having got there you left again fairly shortly
afterwards with Mr. Murray to look for the referee? -
a. ihe intention was that Mr. Murray and I would go to
see the referee and the linesmen, to explain about the
sarety procedures and evacuation and to identify
?,?fueiVeSw t0 h i m ’ so 1 went to the Control Box and met
with Mr. Murray and our intention was to go and see the
referee straightaway, but as on all big occasions -
we      say this, I presume it is - the referee was in
the centre circle in his civilian clothes with his
officials, looking at the ground, and we had to wait
while they came off and then they came off and went
into their room and we went to see them, and Mr. Murray
spoke with them.                                            r

        what I think, but it is as good as anybody else'8
        recollection. I think the only other person who might
        agree with me is probably Superintendent Marshall, but
        other than that it is open to discussion.

 Q.    In any case, you remember the request, whatever time
       it was? - A. Yes.

 Q.    Did it alarm you when that came through? - A. I think
       what I did, I was standing towards the back because,
       as you probably know, that control room is a little
        bit confined and I got the impression if I stood at
       the front I was in people's way, just purely
       physically, not by being a senior Officer but by being
       stood there. I remember turning to my left and
       looking at the video screen thinking, 'What does he
       want Leppings Lane closed for?' It was that sort of
       thought - 'What does he want that closed for?* The
       reason I remember the bus is I saw a bus going past,
       and I thought, 'Well, why does he want Leppings Lane
       j T ® ® . 8.1? the bus Cfln go past and there aren't any
       difficulties?' That was the sort of thought process
       going through my mind - 'What's it all about?'- and I
       can remember doing that.
Q.     In any case you did not countermand it, you allowed it
        o go ahead? - A. No, not at all. He was the man on
       tne ground, he knew exactly what the situation was. I
       had got a very limited view from a TV monitor.
Q.     At that point had you noticed the filling of the
       stadium at all? - A. I think about that time I was
       Deginning to check up on where we were mentally,
       asking mental questions, as you might say, and I
       remember looking at the Spion Kop and that seemed to
         ® tilling. That seemed to be filling more so than
       other parts of the ground. If you can remember the
       £    ,

                 B°x, y°ii can't see the South Stand because the
       south Stand is on your right, so in effect you cannot
       get a very good assessment, I should say, sir. In
       terms of the North Stand, then I think possibly at
       that stage it appeared half-full, but I don't think
       that concerned me greatly because I think, knowing
               jSS 1 do* lf you have 8ot 3 Stand ticket people
      ao tend to stand on the gangways and have a cup of tea
      rather than take their seat, so that in itself
      probably is not all that significant. But the
      L-eppings Lane terrace, that was filling more so in the
                     J recollect spaces at the front, as though
      people weren t moving forward in that bottom - I have
      heard someone describe it as "well", but really that
      at the time was outside my knowledge. But I have an
      impression that we had the normal sort of 2.30-ish

                                            D« G. DUCKENFIELD


 Q. In difficulties.   Can you recollect whether at this time
    or earlier, or at any time but before the match kicked-
    off, any tannoy messages were broadcast, either to the
    Leppings Lane end or to the crowd in general? - A. I have
    got a recollection...   I don't know what tannoy messages
    were given by other people, but I have recollection of
    saying to the PC in the Control Room, one of those
    remarks that probably Chief Superintendents make
    sometimes when they are looking round the ground, "Don't
    forget to ask people to move forward and spread out," and
    that sort of thing, but that is all.   I don't know
    whether it was carried out.

 Q. Can you hear the tannoy in the Control Box?   Assuming it
    is broadcast can you actually hear it within the Box? -
    A. Do^you know, sir, I cannot give you an honest answer.
    I don t really know.   I think probably later the noise
    was so great it would have been drowned but I cannot give
    you an honest answer.

Q. Anyway, you have told us about the radio breaking down.
   We have heard from others that the radio officer turned
   up, I think you would agree with that? -A. Yes.

Q. You have said there was quite a bit of disruption and it
   all came back.   What happened then?   The radio came
   back on, things settled down after the disruption, what
   was the problem that you could see? - A. Sir, I am not so
   sure things settled down.

Q. Perhaps that was the wrong word. - A. Forgive me, I have
   no wish to disagree.    I have a recollection that once we
   ~ and I will say it now - once we had got back to our
   positions and settled ourselves after the disruption of
   the radio, then it became apparent that in that short
   period that - and these are my words - I think
   Mr. Marshall must have been overwhelmed by something
   totally unexpected because the situation had gone from
   what I said was normality to a situation where there was
   a large crowd at the Leppings Lane end and a sequences of
   events - I   am not sure, but I think by then people were
   beginning to climb over the turnstile walls and that sort
   of thing.

Q. Could you see that on the monitors, or have you learned
   that since?    It is difficult. - A. It is difficult.
   The most specific thing I recall next is the gate
   bursting open.   Would you wish me to go on to that?

Q. Before you deal with that, can you remember any messages
   requesting  the gates to be opened before that happened? -
   A. Yes.  I   think we are talking in terms of things that
   happened simultaneously.    I was not looking at the
   monitor at this particular moment and I recall a request
                                               D» G. DUCKENFIELD


   from Mr. Marshall for the gate to be opened.         I remember
   turning and looking at the monitor on my left.         The
   mo n i t o r , as I recall it, is on the left and I remember
   turning and much the same as I was taken a little by
   surprise with the closing of Leppings Lane and the bus
   passing, I turned and looked and thought, *'What does he
   want the gates opening for?"          An absolute shock.   As I
   turned and looked the gate burst open.         Now I know...

Q. Can we just make sure we know which gate we are talking
   about?   Are we talking about the gate we now all know as
   Gate C? - A. Gate C.

Q. You didn't know it was called Gate C? - A. No, no idea.
   As I turned and looked, I don't know whether I said it,
   it may be I didn't say it, but in my mind thought, "The
   gate has burst open," but PC Bichard, if my memory serves
   me correctly said, f'What's he on about?   The gate has
   burst open anyway."    Bearing in mind we have got a small
   TV screen - and I am guessing - 9" square, black and
   white, possibly 10' away from me, and our perception was
   at that time, and still is today, even though others will
   say that we are incorrect, that that gate had burst open
   and some fans had got in.

  A mounted Officer came to their assistance, whoever they
  were at that gate, and recovered the situation and the
  ^ate was closed.   As far as I was concerned, I thought,
   He has made the request.  That has relieved the
  situation," and that matter was finalised in my mind.

). So what happened then as far as you are concerned?
   Before you tell me that, can you remember where you were
   within the Control Box?   Put it another way, where was
   Mr. Murray at that point?   Was he seated in the place
   where he was supposed to be or were you in that spot? -
   A. No - if I answer it in this way:  I was stood
   somewhere towards the back and on that...   There is a
   raised platform.

. There is a raised platform. - A. I was in about that sort
  of location and I can only presume that Mr. Murray was in
  the front somewhere.

. You were at the back? - A. I was at the back.

. OK, carry on. - A. The next thing that occurred, having
  retrieved the situation, and the next thing that happened
  was that Superintendent Marshall came over again and made
  a request.   Now my understanding is he just made one
  request and this request was quite a shocking experience.
  He said, "If you don't open the gates, someone is going
  to get killed."   That really was, I think it is safe to
  say, quite riveting.   In that respect, I think to stand
                                                           54

                                            D, G. DUCKENFIELD


    there and to be faced with a situation where a colleague
    who is extremely experienced and there have been no
    messages prior to that of a deterioration that is causing
    him concern, to say to you, "Open the gates or somebody
    is going to get killed,1' that really was something which
    was unprecedented, was totally outside my police
    experience and obviously totally outside my police
    training, and really to accede to his request to open the
    gates it would defeat everything we had planned in our
    Operational Order of not allowing people in who were
    drunk, not allowing people in who might be carrying
    offensive weapons.   I do not need to go over that.    I
    am sure you understand that.

Q. Yes. - A. I was stood there thinking about that and the
   enormity of that decision, and thinking, "If I don't open
   the gates people are going to get killed."     Then
   Mr. Murray - the atmosphere in the Control Box, to say it
   was a football ground with probably 50,000 in it, and we
   talk frequently about the noise etc., to use a well worn
   phrase you could hear a pin drop.    The atmosphere was
   electric.   I was stood there and I was asked to make
   that decision and it seemed as though the world had
   stopped.        Murray then said to me, "Mr. Duckenfield,
   are you going to open the gates?"    As you can imagine,
   whatever rigid plans people might have, whatever policies
   you might have, if it means saving lives and preventing
   injury^then you do your level best, don't you, to save
   people's lives?     So I gave the order to open the gates.

Q. The Officer put that out across the radio, I take    it?-
   A. Yes.   Superintendent Murray said...   Just bear with
   me a moment.

Q. Yes, of course. - A. Superintendent Murray - I recall
   him, he had got this personal radio in his hand.
   Forgive me sometimes for demonstrating but this is how it
   comes back to mind.    He had got this personal radio and
   I recall it in his hand, held something like at shoulder
   level like this.     He turned to me and said,
    Mr. Duckenfield,   are you going to open the gates?"  Of
   course I told him to do so.    He then spoke into the
   radio and said, "Open the gates.    Open the gates."   In
   my mind it was "gates" and there was no distinction, and
   that was it.

Q. Did you hear PC Buxton, or somebody from the Land Rover,
   request the postponement of the match?    Did you yourself
   hear that? - A. I am not sure.   If I can just go through
   the thought processes at about that time.    I remember PC
   Buxton being asked for and I remember him coming.    I
   have some difficulty about the postponement which it
   probably may be better to explain later.    I am confused
   because I had it in my mind that postponement was raised
                                                              55

                                            D, G. DUCKENFIELD

   in the Control Box and I went through a thought process
   about that, but as to whether I actually heard PC Buxton
   say it, or it was probably Sergeant Goddard responding at
   some time, I cannot accurately recollect, sir.

Q. Let's put the question the other way.   What is your
   recollection when the issue of postponing the kick-off
   came up?   We know it came up at 2.30 in conversation. -
   A. Yes.

Q. Which you have explained to me.   Are you saying it came
   up again? - A. Yes.

Q. Tell me what your recollection of that is. - A. I have
    got a clear recollection in my mind as to what I thought
    and what I did.   The unfortunate thing is that my
    recollection does not fit into the timescale of events.
    I preface my remarks, but because of the crisis I am
   probably out of sequence with it, but my recollection as
   far as I am concerned, is that at some stage I was on the
   back step of the Control Box.    I remember being, as you
   might say, on my own and thinking through situations.
   Something^- and I don't know what it was - flagged up in
   my mind, "Isn't it now time to consider very seriously
   postponing the kick-off?"    I have a recollection of
   looking through the window of the Control Box to my
   right.   I don t know why I did that.   You can see the
   players   tunnel.   At that stage I recollect seeing a
   crowd of photographers.    I think they were photographers
   because they had all got these orange tabards on.     They
   were in a semi-circle by the players' tunnel.    There
  were other people there, but that is what struck me.      I
   thought,   It is time probably to seriously consider
  delaying the kick-off."

 Something happened which made me believe that the players
 had run out on to the pitch.   I cannot tell you if I saw
 a team - this is where the confusion arises - but
 something triggered in my mind that the players were
 coming out and it was too late for that option.   The
 reason I say it was too late for that option is that I
 thought that whilst I had difficulties outside at
 Leppings Lane, then the difficulties I was going to get
 inside the ground were quite serious, and I saw this
 much.

 I mean, the reason I did not delay it was this, I
 thought,  I have already got 50,000 people in the ground.
 I have got the players coining out," or so I thought.
 There was an air of anticipation about all those people.
 Everything was ready to start and everything was ready to
 go.   I had also got Notts Forest fans on the Spion Kop.

                                                    D. G. DUCKENFTFT.n


     Q. Sorry, you had Liverpool fans on the Spion Kop? - A.
        Yes, thank you.   I had got Liverpool fans on the Spion
        Kop.  so it was my view that had I decided to delay
         if ?    at that sta9e 1 would be concentrating my
        efforts and my resources on two fronts.   I would have
        to communicate the delay of the kick-off to the crowd
        within the ground and cope with - can I use the word
         discontent'?   I am not saying that is right but I just
        cannot think of a better one.

 Q. Yes. - A. And cope with the problems within the ground,
                   to them and explaining all those
    difficulties etc. but, of course, if the players were
    on the pitch or had come out they were, dare I say it,
    contented to some extent and I could focus all my
    attention on the Leppings Lane end.   There is another
    aspect and I am not so sure whether this is one that
    came after.   Delaying kick-off is a decision that one
    can make.   Delaying kick-off and communicating it to a
    group of people who you want to act upon it is a
    totally different thing than just making the decision.

 Q. Your recollection is that whatever sparked it off in
              ^ was at either just before or coinciding
    with the players coming on to the pitch.    Is that what
    you are saying? - A. Yes, sir, but - and I add the but
             ~ 1 ^ ave also 9 ot a recollection it might have
    oeen before the gates were opened.    This is where I say
    to you I am uncertain.    There is confusion and with no
    disrespect to anybody that is the best I can do with
    that.

Q. In any event you rejected it as an option on the day? -
   a . Yes, I did.


Q. I think that is a convenient point.    We will pause and
   we will have lunch.    Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,
   as I nave said to every witness who has had a break,
   please remember that you are on Oath and strictly
   speaking you are in the witness box during the lunch
   flour and so do not discuss the evidence if you would be
   so good please.   Yes.

                        LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT

Q. Mr. Duckenfield you can probably remember where we had
   3 ust got to the point where you had told me about
   authorising the opening of the gates? - A. Yes, sir.

°*        1 d i s c u ssed with you and you told me about your
     thinking regarding the possibility of postponing kick-
     orr and some of the reasonings that went through your
     aind at that time? - A. Yes, sir.
                                                                   57

      J think You have already told me that you did not know
      the numbers of these gates.   You just said "the gates"
      or words to that effect? - A. That is right.

 Q.    Did another message come through from the Sergeant
      asking that another gate be opened? - A. Yes.   What
      happened was that having given the order for the gates
      to be opened then a short time later, it might have
      been a minute or so, I can't be precise, I heard a
              °n      ra<^ ° that seemed to come into the whole
      of the Control Box where someone said, "If you don't
      open Gate A it is going in anyway".    I personally
      couldn't identify the individual but that is the
      message I heard.

 Q. Did you respond to it or did you hear any response to
    xt? - A. To the best of my recollection it was
    responded to because the belief in the Control Room was
      f T I® ? essa9e was, "Open the gates", meaning plural
    and I took that to mean all the gates and that should
    have been opened as well.

      Ju6 cameras were focused in the main on Gate C, would
      that be right? What we now know as Gate C, you may not
      have known it at the time? - A. My recollection is that
      one camera was focusing on Gate C.

Q. Did you see any of the other gates actually opening? -
   A. No, I can't say that I did, sir.

Q. Did you see any of the other gates open as opposed to
   opening? - a . N o , sir, not at all.

Q. Whilst you were taking    the decision in saying, "Open
   the gates", of course,    various other things were going
   on in the Control Room    by other people, that would be
   right, would it not? -    A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you yourself give any directions or instructions
   with regard to putting serials of Officers in specific
   locations? - A. The situation, sir, was such that I was
   totally consumed by the decision that there was.  As I
   said earlier, it was totally unprecedented and outside
   my experience and I was totally focused on that at that
   stage.

Q- This question is clearly one which may tend to
   incriminate you.  I am not saying that the others have
   not been as well but this one is very specifically
   so. - a . Yes.

    ^ en     order was ^iven to open the gates what
    thoughts went through your mind at that point as to
    th*        hfpp?n to the People who would enter through
    the gates? As I say, you do not have to answer this
                    d° n0t wiSh to - - A. My recollection,
       i    that there was space in the concourse and if
    that gate was opened I could save people's lives.
 Q. Did you appreciate at that time the geography of the
    ground and in particular therelationship of the gate
    to the tunnel? - a. No, sir.                      9
 Q. All these are prejudicial questions. Were you at that
    time in a position to visualise the entry points on to
    tne terracing from the concourse area? - A. No, sir.
 Q. You understand the question. Have you understood what
           a?kfd?        1 am asking you is, did you have a
           piC^ re °f the co?course area and the way that
    people would have to go if they were going to get
              °      stands or on to the terracing? - A. At

            fJ;aCin9
   space in the      beneath the Control Box and there was
                 concourse.
Q. Again this is    a prejudicial question. You did not, I
   It it , give     any orders for serials to position
   themselves to    direct the fans in any particular
   Ilit*l°+
      was totally    the concourse
                    consumed by the area? - A. As I said, sir,

Q. Did you yourself give any directions for people to be
               b?h^ d Gate A with a view to channelling

  A !L ? C°Ur and again this is a prejudicial question? -
          i s. r19^ - 1 do not know what the situation was
  exactly but action was taken to alert serials who were
               an? d^5ecti°ns were given to go to the North
  Stand and on to the perimeter track as a result of the
  situation that had developed.

 Q. Were you anticipating that people would be going into
    that stand when you gave that particular direction? -
    A* Yes, because of that I thought people may go into
    that stand who probably had not tickets.

 Q. Was that your concern, that it might be ticketless
    people who might be going into the stands as opposed to
    terracing people. Terracing is not the right word but
    you know what I mean, people who would normally be
    standing going into the stands? - A. I suppose with
    hindsight I don’t really know what I thought at that
    particular time.

 Q. Did you at that time, and it is very difficult of
    course because such a lot of time has passed, realise
    which was the gate that led to the North Stand? - A.
    No, sir, I don’t think I did. I think some
    conversation may have been in the Control Box but I
    don t think I did. It is difficult with the passage of
    time.

Q. What I am interested in is that when the second request
   came through from some unknown person to you? - A. Yes,
   I think my recollection there is that somebody might
   have said, "Where is that?” or "Where does that lead
   to. or something like that and that is what might have
   developed. As to whether that was said in the Control
   Box or somebody related it subsequently I am unsure.

Q. Were you throughout this period still standing on that
   ledge at the back of the Control Box or had you moved
   down, can you remember? - A. I can't remember, sir.

Q. Can you recollect whether you were ever seated in the
   front row of the Control Box? - A. No, I don’t think I
   was, sir.

Q. At this point prior to the match kicking off? - A. No,
   my rec°Hection is that I was never sat down that day.

Q- From where you were standing how much of the Leppings
   Lane terraces were you actually able to see? Never
   mind what you saw but how much of it could you see from
   where you were standing? - A. In general terms you have
   a view of the terrace from the side on, as it were.   I
   suppose it may be restricted because of me standing up
   at the back and the roof coming into play or the
   window, TV cameras, if my memory serves me correctly
   but I could see the terracing.

. Had you noticed any marked disparity between the centre
  and the wings - I use the word "marked". - A. I would
  say, sir, that what I saw - and what time are you
  referring to, sir, can I ask?

’           aft®r the gate had been opened, sorry. - A. No,
    1 didn t, sir. I saw what I believed to be, I can only
    best describe it as normality.

    Did you, after the gate was opened, notice any increase
    xn crowd density or crowd movement into the centre
    pens, pens 3 and 4 we are talking about? - A. No, I
    didn't, sir.                                    ’

. Did you see from where you were - you may not have done
  - but were you able to see Superintendent Greenwood on
  the field? - A. Yes. If I take you back in time, the
         time 1 saw him was when some fans started to come
  onto the pitch. I might have taken you on a little bit
  in time, but the first time I recall seeing him was
  when some fans started to come through one of the
  lwilme£er &fltes onto the track, and I turned and said,
   Where s Superintendent Greenwood?", and I saw him
  coming from the players' tunnel and he was hurriedly
  walking round the perimeter track to go to that
  location. That is when I first saw him.

 Did he come up to the Control Box at all as far as you
 remember? - A. I don't recall Superintendent Greenwood
 ever coming to the Control Box.

 You had not noticed any marked disparity when you
 looked. Did you see match kick-off at all? - A. No,
 it s remarkable but I don't recall the match kicking
 Oil •

When do you first recollect seeing something which
attracted your attention to the Leppings Lane
terracing, as being not normal? - A. I have a
recollection of looking out of the Control Box window
and seeing some people coming out of a gate.  I don't
know which one. Obviously with the events as they are
I presume 3 or 4, but I can't be accurate as to which
one.  I saw some people coming out of a gate and they
were walking onto the perimeter track and that is when
I first saw something other than one would expect.

It was at that point that you said, "Where is
Superintendent Greenwood?", and you saw him walk
across, or hurry across? - A. I think probably I looked
flt it first of all because I was uncertain as to what
the situation was.   I mean I wouldn't ordinarily send a
Superintendent to deal with a fan who has just come out
                                                         61

                                          D. G. DUCKENFIELD

    of a gate. It was probably a slower process than that,
    but in due course, yes.

 Q. What you are saying is you noticed at first, you didn't
    necessarily think this is a task for the
    Superintendent, but something then happened - as it
    developed you are saying you realised .... - A. Yes. I
    think that what I recall is that, as I said earlier,
    things go through your mind of, ^'What's happening
    here? and then you watch the situation, watch it
    develop, and as it develops with more coming out, then
    obviously you trigger off in your mind, "Let's do
    something about this".

 Q. Did you from where you were notice a difference in
    density? Superintendent Greenwood described it as a
    longitudinal split - I don't know if you were here when
    he said that? - A. No, I don't recall that.

 Q. He said that it was more dense towards the fence than
    it was further back. Did you notice that? - A. No, I
    didn t notice anything like that at all, sir.

Q. You did notice, I think, a lady Police Officer at gate
   1, is that right? - A. Yes. What was happening is that
   tans were walking along the perimeter track, I would
   say aimlessly really, and making their way towards the
   corner flag and I think gate 1, beneath the Control
   Box, and she was totally oblivious to what was going
   off. Someone tried to get in touch with her on the
   radio to say, "Direct these fans into this pen", or
   through a gate, I should say actually, and that is when
   I saw the Policewoman.

Q. Was it then that you arranged to send somebody down to
   try and assist this young lady? - A. Yes. What
   happened was that she either did not have a radio or
   she had one and could not hear, I don't know, and as a
   result of that Chief Inspector McRobbie, who was in the
   Control Room with me purely as an observer that day, I
   don t know whether I said it to him or he volunteered,
   but the only way to get in touch with her was to send
   someone down onto the touchline to speak to the Police
   Officer.

Q. Had you by then formulated any views as to what was
   going on, and again remember this is a potentially
   incriminating question. - A. No, sir, I had not formed
   any views at all.

Q. Chief Inspector McRobbie went out of the Box? - A. Yes,
   sir.                                                   ’

                                         D. G. DUCKENFIELD

Q. And we have seen pictures of him - you probably saw
   them this morning? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you then continue to watch the terracing and the
   area around it? - A. Yes, I was watching the events
   behind the goal.

Q. What was it that you were noticing at that point? - A.
   That more people were coming out of the pen, more
   people were coming onto the pitch and at that stage, I
   think by that stage the next event that I recall was
   that Superintendent Greenwood had moved round to that
   end of the Ground. I think that in a sequence of
   events I have got a picture of him standing on a
   hoarding at that end, somewhere in the region of the
   goal - I am not too specific about that but somewhere
   there - waving his arms, and Superintendent Murray
   saying in the Control Box words to the effect, "He
   wants the game stopped. Stop the game".

  Now, that is the next incident there, then from then
  there was some problem with regard to stopping the
  game, because as I understand it we had an established
  practice where we would get in touch with the Inspector
  on the touchline, but as to why we departed from that
  or whether or not an effort was made to contact that
  Inspector I don't know, but Mr. Murray left the Control
  Box, I don t know why - I mean I don't know if he was
  instructed or whether I said something - Mr. Murray
  left the Control Box and went down towards the
  touchline to speak to the linesman, to override the
  system and get the linesman to stop the game.

 Now, the next thing I recall is seeing a Superintendent
   no, I think to be honest seeing a Police Officer who
 I later discovered was a Superintendent - running
 across the football pitch into the middle of the pitch
 while the game was going on and stopping the referee,
 and as you can imagine that is quite a remarkable
 thing, and the game was stopped. At that stage I think
 I then saw that people were coming onto the pitch who
 were injured, and then immediately I took a course of
 action to alert all the emergency services.

                                            D. G. DUCKENFIELD

           Superintendent Murray come back, as far as you can
       remember. You may not, but I just want to find out
       what you remember, after having run down? - A. I have
       got a vision of him coming back for some reason, to
       convey a message, but I can't think what he did. I
       think he came back into the Control Box for some
       reason and immediately left to return to the pitch to
       assist Superintendent Greenwood.
 Q.    Then he has told us that, in fact, he did not come
       back for quite some time. Does that fit in with your
       recollection? - A. Yes, my recollection is he did not
       come back for some time until I had left to go
       elsewhere.
 Q.    Had Mr. Jackson turned up before you realised that the
          I      ?       to be stoPPed, or did he come after?
         A. The timing is difficult, in that I have got a
       recollection of standing in the Control Box watching
       the events unfold, that is the people coming onto the
       perimeter track or edge of the pitch, and being intent
       on looking at what was going off before me, and then
       Mr. Jackson came into the Control Box, and standing
       alongside me.                                      5

Q.     When the match was stopped, and I think you said it
       was about that time you realised there were some
       injuries? - A. Yes.

Q*    At that point were these injuries which you became
      aware of people on the pitch or in the terracing, can
      you remember? - A. I never recall people on the
      terracing from my position - and it sounds awful this
      tv,  iuf lnJ^red or seeing anything untoward there.
         e hing that struck me, I have got a vision of a
      young man who started hobbling and to some extent
      Lane^goal^^S      and flopping down by the Leppings

Q.    You may have heard, but certainly if you did not I can
      h®        Superintendent Murray was saying that when
      ne got back down onto the pitch he realised that
      ambulances were needed and he radioed in a fleet of
      ambulances would be required. Do you recollect that
      coming through? - A. I remember the message because I
      naa called for assistance on the Major Incident Plan,
      ana i remember some conversation about an ambulance
      and someone speaking in contradictory terms, and I do
      not know who, the conversation being something like,
                                      D. G. DUCKENFIELD

  You don't want one ambulance, you want a fleet of
 ambulances down here", and that's the recollection I
 have.

 In fact, we have heard from Mr. Jackson that what was
 requested and what he authorised was I think it is
 called Operation Support, is that right? - A. Yes,
 that is right, sir.

 That is not necessarily the same thing as a Major
 Incident Plan, or is it, I do not know? - A. No. If I.
 can explain the situation, generally speaking if we
 have a situation where we require manpower above and
 beyond that that is, shall we say, normal in our
 locality, if I call Operation Support that means that
 we have some crisis situation of the magnitude of,
 dare I say it, a riot in a city centre sometimes, or a
 disaster situation, and because I say riot first,
 please do not think that — --

No. - A. It is the fastest way of getting every
available Officer on duty from all over the County to
3 Particular location. So looking at the situation
and knowing that things were beginning to get
difficult there with injuries on the pitch, I called
Spffati01? Support, which was to get every available
Officer in the County that could be spared to the
football ground.

Then I think Mr. Jackson had to confirm that, did he
not, because of Standing Orders, or whatever? - A.
That was it. I was starting to give instructions and
   remember it distinctly. Having started off a process
of giving instructions, the order Operation Support
cannot be given unless it is by Assistant Chief
Constable, and someone came back from the Headquarters
Operations Room saying, "You can't have that unless
*>uU i Ve Sot ACC's approval", and of course I said,
 He s stood alongside me, it isapproved".    That was
the gist of it.

Do you know what time that was done, what time the
Operation Support was approved by ACC? - A. No. In
telling you the story, sir, I can only tell you it as
it is. I know that there are times available, but
those times were told to me afterwards. My timings
a 5er this event are such that I issue instructions
and I have no sense of timing.

Would it be right to say that you stayed up in the
Control Box until you actually left at about 3.30, or
perhaps even later,   to go towards theDirectors' Room?
~ A. That is right, sir.

 Do you remember at what point a suggestion was made
 that bolt croppers should be made available? Did that
 come from you, or was it a request in? - A. That was a
 request in, sir. Bearing in mind by now it was a hive
 of activity, quite intense and messages were flowing,
 I think the way to describe it is thick and fast, I
 was issuing instructions and messages were coming in
 and I just recall someone mentioning bolt croppers and
 I can't say who or where it came from.

Do you remember giving any orders around this time for.
tannoy messages to go out? - A. Yes, among other
things, I remember saying to PC Ryan, I would think it
is, *'Ask the crowd to ease back" and it would be wrong
   me^to say not to push forward, but the gist of it
was, "Ask the crowd to ease back", and that was the
gist of it.

It is very difficult I realise with the passage of
time, but do you recollect was this after the match
had finished or before, or can you not remember? - A.
I think that at this time, sir, there were so many
things that we were doing, for want of a better term,
that it is difficult to recollect.

This is an incriminating question. Did you give any
instructions for anybody to go round the back to see
what was going on at the back of the terracing? - A.
The difficulty is, sir, at that time I have difficulty
recollecting what instructions were given and what was
taking place.

Do you recollect utilising the emergency evacuation
message? - A. No sir.

Again this is a question which you can think about
before you answer: can you tell me why you did not do
that?    I am not saying it would have made any
difference;   I am just interested to know why you did
not do that? - A. My main intention at that time, and
bearing in mind I am sort of thinking back over two
years, was to do something about the injuries and to
get people to hospital, and I had a concern that if I
did something about the evacuation - now I did not
specifically consider that at that stage but I am
talking generally - then it was distinctly possible
that people might leave the ground. Now if people
left the ground, then I was going to be in extreme
difficulty.



                          /Q.   I think you have
                                             D. G. DUCKENFIELD

>. I think you have misunderstood the question.   I was not
   asking you whether you made any public address
   announcement to the crowd about the incident, but whether
   you put out the coded message? - A. No, I did not do that
   at all.

. Because that would not have been understood, assuming it
  wor eT * ^ the crowd I mean? - A. Yes, I misunderstood
  you, I thought you were talking about evacuation.

. What I meant was did you put out the coded message? - A.
  No, not at all.                                 &

  Which one would have used as a preliminary to evacuation?
  " A • No•

. Can I now repeat it?   Did you think about it at the time
  or have you got any reason why you did not do it? - A.
  sir, 1 think the honest answer is I did not think about
  it because in the heat of the moment and the crisis, with
  so much going on and so much to think about, it is
  something I did not think about.

. When was it    that you actually found out there were
   u   t     *   ?s °PP°sed toinjuries? - A. My own view is
  when I came    back from the directors' box because I saw
  bodies lined    up outside the gate beneath the Police
  Control Box.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

 Mr. Duckenfield, just go back to the planning stage,
 please.   You mentioned to the Coroner that you were
 aware there was a Safety Certificate in force for the
 ground? - A. Yes, sir.

And that the Safety Certificate contained a schedule
giving the certified capacities of various parts of the
             I 3hink the accuracy, sir, is that I was
aware of the Safety Certificate and the detail it
normally contained.  I am not being evasive, but
specifics...                       &        *

ri§?*«*be..ac!;V!;a*e * Were you aware that the Safety
Certificate did include figures for the safe capacity of
various parts of the ground? - A. Yes, sir.

woe 5v?at       background.   Here is the question: what
was the significance of that in your mind as you
f££T°a         match? - A. The significance, sir, was
                their particular field had examined the
ground and decided upon a capacity which was safe for a
particular area and it was safe to operate within those
limits.
                                               D. G. DUCKENFIELD

. Did you in fact, before the disaster, did you believe the
  ground was safe to be used up to the capacities which had
  been worked out? - A. Yes, sir.

. Now come to the event itself, and I have just got two
  questions about that.    They relate to the time at which
  you gave the order to open the gates.    First of all, at
  that time was it obvious to you that there was a risk of
  injury to people in pens 3 and 4 as a result of opening
  the gates? - A. No, sir.

. The second question is this:  were you indifferent to the
  risk of injury to people in those pens? -A. No, sir.

        MR. MANNING:       I have no questions of the Chief
 Superintendent,       thank you.

      THE CORONER: ^ I think, Mr. King, you will have some
 questions, so it might be easier if we pause now so we do
 not interrupt you.   We will stop for ten minutes.

                        (Short adjournment)

     ^ THE CORONER:  Before Mr. King starts - ofcourse, I
 don t know what the questions aregoing     to be but I
 suspect some of them will be questions of the type for
 which you would be entitled to exercise your privilege,
 so I am reminding you of this at this stage and I will do
 the same as I did with Mr. Murray.     From time to time I
 will give you a refresher, so to speak. Is that
 satisfactory?    Do you understand that?

        THE WITNESS:     Yes, sir.

        THE CORONER:     Mr. King.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Mr. Duckenfield, would you accept now that 95 people lost
Jue i Fc 1jLve? because of overcrowding in pens 3 and 4 on
the 15th of April, 1989? - A. That is a very difficult
one, sir, but yes, people did die because of that.

Well,   it is not difficult, is it, after the event? - A.
    ?lr» 1 think you misunderstand me.         It is just
difficult because of the circumstances.

I see.   So the starting point in our investigation as to
now these deaths came about is the starting point of how
  *    come about there was overcrowding in pens 3 and 4?
- A. Yes, sir.

You were the Officer in overall command? - A. Yes, sir.
                                               D. G. DUCKENFIELD

 Q. You have told us quite a bit of what you did not know.
    I just want to check that I have got my evidence
    correctly down.   You told us that you did not know of
    the precise contents of the Safety Certificate, is that
           “ A. As I think I said earlier, sir, it is
    difficult to recollect after such a long period.

 Q.     Before the game had you been supplied witha   copy of the
       Certificate? - A. I cannot recollect, sir.

 Q.    Did you call     for one? - A. I recall asking    about it,sir.

 Q.    You say that     your knowledge of the geographyof the
      ground was limited? -A. Yes, sir.

 Q. Based on how many journeys round the ground prior to the
    15th of April? - A. I cannot answer with any accuracy,
    sxr •

 Q. How many roughly? - A. I would be guessing, sir, and I
    cannot give you an accurate answer.

Q. You told us this morning, your evidence is you did not
   have any detailed knowledge of the signings at the
   Leppings Lane end of the ground? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Before the game began did you have any knowledge as to
   who would have the responsibility for the directing of
   spectators and the controlling of numbers going on to the
   Leppings Lane terraces? - A. For the directing of
   spectators I assumed that was a joint responsibility
   between the Police Service and the club.

              evef make any investigation yourself before the
      15th of April, 1989, as to who had that specific
      responsibility? - A. I did not ask a specific question,
      as far as I recollect, but you are asking me about
      matters over two years ago now, sir.

Q. Before the 15th of April, 1989, did you have a copy of
   what is known as the ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at
   Sporting Events Guide to Policing Football? - A. Yes,
   sir.                                                 ’

Q. Had you read it? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Had you read also the standing instructions for the
   policing of football matches? - A. Yes, sir.

  Therefore you would know that the standing instructions
  tor the policing of football matches included a
  recommendation that the stewards should be distributed
  throughout the ground in accordance with a detailed pre-
                                                             69

                                             D. G. DUCKENFIELD

    arranged schedule agreed between the Police and
    management? - A. Yes, sir.

 Q. Did you know whether there was this detailed pre-arranged
    schedule between Police and management before the 15th of
    April, 1989? - A. I personally had not seen a detailed
    pre-arranged schedule, sir.

 Q. Did you ask the question whether there was one to anybody
    at any of the planning meetings? - A. Sir, when taking
    over a Police Division there are many things to consider
    and I am sure I asked many questions.

 Q. Well, I am asking you, therefore, was there to your
    knowledge a detailed pre-arranged schedule agreed between
    Police and management with regard to the distribution of
    stewards at the Hillsborough ground? - A. Sir, my
    recollection is that I had not seen a detailed pre­
    arranged schedule.   Having said that, other Officers
    were in day to day contact with footballing and I have no
    wish to pass the buck, and that is not my intention.
    There may have been one but I do not recall having seen
    it*

 Q. Did you know before the 15th of April, 1989 semi-final
    there was to be no stewarding by the club as regards the
    Leppings Lane terraces?    Did you know that? - A. I don't
    think I knew that.   I am uncertain about that particular
    question, or that aspect that you ask me about.

Q« In the light of that which you say you were ignorant of
   on the 15th of April, 1989, can you seriously say to
   these Inquests that you felt yourself competent to be in
   overall command of the Hillsborough ground?

        THE CORONER:   That is definitely an incriminating
   question and you should   think hard.

         THE WITNESS:   The   way I would answer the question
   is this.    I had been promoted to the rank of Chief
   Superintendent to take over the responsibility of the
   running of the Hammerton Road Division.     As I said
   earlier today, I was something of a generalist as opposed
   to a specialist.    I consider that overall, as a Police
   Officer, with many years' service, that as a Police
   Officer I was competent and capable of carrying out my
   duties.    Having said that, you are well aware that by
   comparison to Chief Superintendent Mole I did not have
   his experience of running capacity football games of the
   semi-final type at the Hillsborough football stadium.

Q. In the light of that total inexperience, because it was
   total inexperience, wasn't it, how can you seriously say
   that you had anything - and I am sorry to put it as
                                        D. G. DUCKENFIELD

bluntly as this - to commend the proposition that
yourself should be in overall command in the Control Box
on the 15th of April? -A. Sir, it is my view that as a
senior Police Officer I was not, as I have already said,
as experienced as Chief Superintendent Mole, but I had
with me a very experienced handpicked specially selected
team of Officers who were chosen by Chief Superintendent
Mole and they were there to support me.

Were they to support you or - and I have to put this to
you in the light of your stated ignorance - simply to
fulfil your role leaving you really with very little you
could offer by way of command? - A. Sir, I had the
ability overall as a Chief Superintendent and I had a
contribution to make.




           Q. Let me try and discover
                                                                 71

                                                   D. G. DUCKENFIELD


 Q. Let me try and discover what you did know if I may.
    First of all, had you been supplied with a copy of the
    Green Guide to safety at sports grounds? - A. Sir,
    there was one at the Chief Superintendent's office at
    Hammerton Road Police Station.

 Q. There may well have been one at the Police Station.
    Ha? y°u Personally been given one? - A. Sir, no one had
    walked up to me and handed me a copy of the document.

 Q. When did you first see a copy of the Green Guide to
    ^ f e t y at sports grounds, given that you were being
    appointed as overall Commander at the Hillsborough
    game? - A. I cannot accurately tell you that, sir.

 Q. Was it before the game? - A. I do not know the answer,
    sir. The answer to the question is that when taking
    over command at a Police Station there are many
    documents. There are documents that appertain to that
    particular Police Station. As far as I am aware that
    was a document along with the other documents that you
    have described.

 Q. You have told us that you were particularly concerned
    for the safety of the public at the Hillsborough Semi
    Final. That is what you have told us. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. How could you assess safety first of all if you did not
   make yourself fully acquainted with the layout of the
   ground? - A. Sir, let us examine the situation. I had
   been in command 21 days I think before the Semi Final.
   There is only so much that one can do in so short a
   period.

Q. How could you assess safety at the Hillsborough ground
   without even having made sure that you have looked at
   documents which have been supplied to the Police
   specifically directed to safety at sports grounds? - A.
   Sir, I didn't say that I hadn't looked at them.

Q. Let me see in a bit more detail about what you did know
   even on the limited walk round the ground that you had.
   Could we have C.267 first please? That is a view of
   the Leppings Lane terraces, is it not? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. It is a view which I am sure you had already taken     on
   board when walking round the ground on the
   opportunities you chose to take? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.    If we can just look at another photograph, C.268,that
     xs a view looking down on to the Leppings Lane
     terraces? - a . Yes, sir.
                                                              72
                                               D. G. DUCKENftkt,n


         THE CORONER: Mr. King, I do not think that is a
    proper view to put to this witness because that was
    almost certainly taken off a gantry. Now unless you
    wish to ask him whether he climbed up the gantry to
    look at it...

        MR. KING: So be it, sir. I am quite content to
   go on the earlier photographs. If Mr. Griffiths will
   put back the other photograph I am quite content with
   that.

         THE CORONER:   Yes.

        MR. KING: Believe it or not, sir, I was only
   trying to be helpful at this stage.

        THE WITNESS:    Are we on 267, sir?

Q. Yes. You would be aware, would you not, that the
   Leppings Lane terraces were divided into pens? - A
   Yes, sir.

Q. You would be aware of that before the Semi Final on
   15th April by just even walking round the ground? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. You would be aware, just by looking, that the fences
   between the pens were broken, the radial fences, only
   at one point and that was at the back where one sees a
   radial gate? - A. I was aware that there were gates at
   the back, sir.

Q. It does not take long expertise simply to see that by
   just walking and looking, does it? You would also
   notice no doubt the central entry point on to the
   terraces via an entry which is bounded by two walls
   which run down on to the terrace. You can see that? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. You would be aware, would you not, and I mean before
   the Semi Final, that that entry point led from a
   tunnel? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. If I can show you another photograph, an aerial
   photograph, C.255, and it is not trying to be unhelpful
       it is the only one I can find of a complete view of


       THE CORONER: I do not actually mind you using
  that other photograph so long as it is understood that
  ne could not have had that view unless he climbed the
  gantry.
                                                                  73
                                                  P . G. DUCKENFTKT.n


          MR. KING: I do not think I am going to suggest,
     sir, in 255 that Mr. Duckenfield took an aerial flight
     in order to see the ground. That was not meant to be
     facetious.

 Q. You can see there, can you not, Mr. Duckenfield, a
    general view of the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes, sir.

            see the block of turnstiles and there is a
    dividing wall on the concourse behind the two sets of
    turnstiles? - A. Yes, sir.

 Q. You would have been aware from your walk round the
    ground that that was the position, would you not? - A.
    That the dividing wall was in that area?

 Q. Yes. - A. I knew of the dividing wall, yes.

 Q. If I can take you a bit further you would also know,
    would you not, that the block of turnstiles which is on
    the right hand side, which we know are turnstiles A to
    G, they lead into the area of the concourse where one
    finds the tunnel entrance? You would know that just by
    looking. - A. I knew that the turnstiles went into the
    concourse area.

Q. You would know through just walking passed, would you
   not, of the existence of the tunnel entrance? - A. I
   had seen the tunnel, sir.

^      5 °an ^ust take you to another photograph, C.263? -
    A • YSS•

Q. That is a clear view of the tunnel leading down to the
   centre of the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. As overall Commander in charge of the game you are not
   saying seriously, are you, that you were ignorant of
   the existence of that tunnel leading down into the
   centre area of the terrace? You are not suggesting
   that, are you? - A. No, I knew at that particular point
   there was a tunnel.

Q. Tell me, before the game began you would know, wouldn't
   you, that the spectators had tickets for different
   parts of the ground? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You would know, because no doubt you had looked at the
   Operational Order, that certain turnstiles were
   allotted to the Liverpool spectators at the Leppings
   Lane end? - A. Yes, sir.
                                                               74
                                               D. G. PUCKENFTFn'.n

 Q. The whole of the turnstiles at that end were for the
    Leppings Lane fans? - A. Yes, sir.

 Q. You would be aware, would you not, that the ticket
    holders for the terrace were going to go through what
    are called turnstiles A to G? You would know that? -
    A. I knew that the Liverpool fans were going at that
    end, sir. Whether I knew exactly that A to G was for
    the terrace, I am not sure at that time.

 Q. Did you at any stage acquaint yourself with the details
    of the arrangements for the ticketing and the
    turnstiles being used by the spectators? - A. My
    understanding of the situation was that the ticketing
    arrangements were a matter for the Club and that
    discussions in relation to the organisation of the game
    and the appropriate ends and matters of that order were
    discussed prior to my arrival and ticketing
    arrangements were made by the Club as ^part of their
    responsibility.                        •

Q. Were you not aware of the fact that the Leppings Lane
   terraces were to be used by people who had come — and
   if could ask M r . Griffiths to point it out - through
   turnstiles A to G or are you saying you just did not
   know that at all? - A. I was assured that the
   arrangements had been made. Tickets were colour coded.
   Tickets were allocated for areas at that end.

Q. Were you aware just by looking round the ground that
   anybody who came through turnstiles A to G would have
   in front of them the tunnel? - A. No, sir.

Q. Leave aside the lettering A to G for a moment just
   walking round the ground you could not have been in
   ignorance, could you, that anybody coming through the
   turnstiles with the dividing wall on the left, which
   you told us you knew about, would have the tunnel in
   front of them? - a . Sir, you are now speaking with
   hindsight. Can I take you back to the 14th April and
   not the 15th April? You are referring to my experience
   around the ground. I gained as much experience as I
   could in looking round the ground. With hindsight and
   you drawing attention to particular issues, you do
   raise those issues but at the time I wasn't aware of
   the situation.

Q. Mere you aware of anything of importance in relation to
   the method of entry of spectators into the Leppings
   Lane end of the ground? - A. Can you explain that, sir?

Q. Let me ask you this; you told us, did you not, that at
   some stage you remember a conversation that fans would
                                                              75
                                               P . G. DUCKENFIELD


   find their own level on the Leppings Lane terraces? —
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. You have also told us that you were concerned for
   safety? ~ A. Yes, sir.

Q. You were also saying to us that you were satisfied that
   the arrangements as to safety were proper ones? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. First of all, what did you understand was the means for
   the filling of the Leppings Lane terraces by the
   expression 'fans will find their own level'? - A. My
   understanding of that was, sir, that people would enter
   the ground in an orderly fashion and having entered the
   ground decide for themselves their viewing location and
   find their own location and take up a position of their

 T}. Would there be any provision made with a view to
     preventing overcrowding in that situation? - A. Sir,
     yith regard to overcrowding, Officers were positioned
     in the West Stand, Officers were positioned on the
     perimeter track, and as a result of that they had an
     excellent view of the West Terrace.

 Q. Are you saying that there was any provision for the
    prevention of overcrowding by the method of the fans
    finding their own level? - A. Sir, what I am saying is
    this, that that part of the Ground had been examined by
    experts who had determined it was safe, and it was safe
    to a level of 10,100 people. With that knowledge, sir,
    there should not be overcrowding on that terrace.

 Q. Did you understand that there would be any intervention
    by the Police as regards the filling of the Leppings
    Lane Terraces at any stage? - A. Can you be more
    specific, sir?

Q. Yes. When did you understand, if at all, that the
   Police would intervene in the course of the filling of
   the Leppings Lane Terrace when the system of "find your
   own level was in operation? - A. Sir, it is my view
   that when a Ground is safe with a capacity of 10,100
   then there should be no need for the Police or anyone
   else to intervene - save of course for extreme
   circumstances - where people arrive normally and have
   the choice, and choose their own spot.

Q. So when would you envisage, on your view, when did you
  ,envisage on your view, that there would be intervention
   by the Police, if at all? - A. Well obviously if there
   were signs of distress or discomfort.

Q. So in other words, your understanding of the system on
   15th April on the Leppings Lane Terrace was that unless
   there were signs of discomfort from the fans there
   would be no active intervention by the Police, is that
   right? - A. No, not exactly. Let's take it stage by
   stage. What you have said indicates that we are not a
   caring organisation. My view is this, that this is a
   partnership from all sides and that partnership exists
   between the responsible bodies who are running the
   match, that is the Police and other parties, and also
   the fans.^ Now I don't put the onus on the fans in
   their entirety to tell us if they are in distress. We
   would also be looking and caring for them.

Q. But as regards safety, and I mean prevention against
   overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end on 15th April,
   the system you describe as the one you were expecting
   was taking place effectively meant that the spectators
   were being left to monitor their own safety, weren't
                                       D.   G.   DUCKENFIELD


 they, because you would only intervene when it had
 become so unsafe that they were showing signs of
 distress? - A. I think, sir, that my last answer
 checked my former answer. I think my last answer to
 you, and if it was not clear I shall repeat it, is that
 the Police would act on their own initiative if they
 saw signs of distress or discomfort.

But you would agree if you wait until signs of distress
before you intervene on terraces such as the Leppings
Lane Terraces divided with those radial fences, you are
intervening at a time when something has already gone
wrong? - A. No, sir. I think that you are taking
things far too far down the line. My view is this,
that Police Officers who are experienced and have been
properly briefed are looking at the situation and they
know when situations are, shall we say, developing.

You say when Officers have been properly briefed? - A.
Yes, sir.

You yourself told us that your briefing simply
contained the references to safety which you have told
us about? “ _A. No, sir, I didn't say that my briefing
notes contained simply safety, but what I did say was
that they were a broad brush picture.

I agree.  I just want to investigate .... - A. In
accordance with the ACPO Guidelines.

I will come back to the ACPO Guidelines later. Can I
just deal with your briefing, given your evidence of
the need to make sure Officers are properly briefed on
these matters? Your briefing as to safety was
completely general, wasn't it? - A. Sir, when you are
dealing with 800 Police Officers for the whole of a
Ground then I can do no more.

Your briefing, whether there was any more you could do
is a different question, but your briefing was
completely general, wasn't it? - A. It was a general
briefing, sir.

To your knowledge, first of all did you give any
instructions to the Officers immediately below you that
they should brief particular serials in relation to the
need to monitor the Leppings Lane Terraces for
overcrowding? - A. No, sir.

Do you know anybody yourself, from what you know - I
accept yours is only a limited range of knowledge, but
from your knowledge - do you know of any briefing prior
to 15th April, 1989, which contained provision as to
the monitoring of the Leppings Lane Terraces for
                                                              78

                                            D.   G.   DUCKENFIELD


    °uern ! ^ din8? " A * Bearin8 in mind, sir, that I briefed
    the Officers, and other senior Officers covering their
    respective areas carried out their own briefings, they
    may have done but I have no knowledge of the details of
    their briefings.

 Q. Does it surprise you that so far there has been no
    evidence of any briefing to Officers in relation to a
    specific duty of monitoring the Leppings Lane Terraces
    for overcrowding? Does that surprise you? - A. Sir, my
    answer is that, and I draw attention to earlier
    evidence, those Officers who were policing the
    perimeter track and in specific locations, had policed
    those areas before, as I understood it were well versed
    in policing those areas, and knew the situation.

Q. Knew what situation? - A. Knew the situation that
   existed with regard to a complete terrace and what to
   expect on those terraces.

Q. What did you understand, would you expect them to
   understand, as regards the Leppings Lane Terrace, given
   that it was divided up by those perimeter fences? - A.
   My understanding, sir, was this, that that terrace was
   safe, that the system of "find your own level" had
   worked previously, it had worked well and there was no
   reason to believe it would not work again.

Q. That wasn't my question quite. I wanted you to tell me
   what you understood and expected those people you have
   identified, those serials you have identified, the ones
   on the perimeter track, the ones in the West Stand,
   what you would have expected them to know about the
   situation on the Leppings Lane Terraces as regards
   overcrowding, given it is divided up by radial fences?
   - A. Sir, would you mind just repeating that again, a
   little more slowly please?

Q. I am trying to discover what you understood would be
   known by serials as regards the Leppings Lane Terraces
   and the situation which they should look out for on the
   Leppings Lane Terraces, given it was divided up into
   radial fences? - A. I am not sure, sir, of the
   specifics that individuals will be looking out for any
   more than the rest of the Ground. The rest of the
   Ground was policed by Officers who would bear in mind
   roy general briefing, and they would carry out their
   duties as normal on that area and any other area.

Q. So are you saying as overall Commander that you did not
   regard the Leppings Lane Terraces with the radial
   fences, divided up in the way we can see, as having a
   particular area of concern which ought to be drawn to
   serials, as regards monitoring it for overcrowding? -
                                                             79

                                           D.   G.   DUCKENFIELD


    A *.L®t me tflke you back to what I said earlier, and I
    think the Coroner asked me this morning, nothing was
    drawn to my attention in the handing over of
    responsibilities, and in particular with regard to
    football, that I should look at the Leppings Lane
    Terraces in particular, and furthermore, as I have
    stated, the Safety Certificate indicated that terrace
    was safe.

 Q. So it comes down to this, doesn't it, Mr. Duckenfield,
    that as regards the Leppings Lane Terraces you had not
    in any way turned your mind to the fact that it was
    divided up into individual pens with radial fences? -
    A. Sir, I was aware of the radial fences but nothing
    came to mind that indicated that it was anything other
    than safe.

Q. And on your evidence there was no specific briefing, to
   your knowledge, to any serial to monitor those pens for
   signs of overcrowding, that is right, isn't it? - A.
   Sir, I can only speak of my personal briefing, and as
   you know my personal briefing did not contain any
   specifics.

Q. Equally, and I need not take you through it but we all
    know it very well, there is not a jot of instruction in
    the Operational Order with regard to the problem or the
   concern for overcrowding on any part of the Ground, but
   the Leppings Lane Terraces in particular? There is
   just not a word about it, is there? - A. Sir, can I
   refer you to my comments earlier this morning, and I
   think I must draw your attention to the opening words -
   ?r . think they were the opening words - in my
   briefing? Basically I said something to the order of
   an Operational Order of this nature cannot possibly
   cover every eventuality, and that was part of the
   reason for my briefing.

Q. I agree not every eventuality but do you not think that
   ensuring as best one can there is no overcrowding at a
   capacity game on a terrace such as the Leppings Lane
   Terrace merits something other than the label, "another
   eventuality'? - A. Sir, I don't wish to appear
   unconcerned.  I can see the situation, but truthfully
   •               are trained Officers, their primary aim
   is the protection of life and property and they act on
   initiative, and they take due account of the
   circumstances around them.
                                      D.   G.   DUCKENFIELD


 But if you only wait for Officers to act on
 initiative, then in fact do you not have in operation
 simply a casual system that if on the off-chance, if
 by luck   and fortune, somethingis noticed in the crowd
 by way of distress, only then will something be done
 about a   potential overcrowdingon the terraces?  That
 is whatyou are left with as regards the system,   is it
 not? - A. No, I think you have there related a series
 of things — and X cannot think of a better word — and
 minimised the responsibility of Police Officers and
 their concern and their actions, and our concern for
 the welfare of people.

I will not pursue this particular matter any further
save this: you told us earlier about the need for
proper briefing. Do you still stand by your evidence
that you regard the briefings, which were given to
your knowledge on 15th April, were sound and
sufficient as regards protecting spectators on the
Leppings Lane terrace from the risk of overcrowding? -
A. Sir, if I was not present at each individual
 , iefing, then it is unfair to ask me to comment upon
them.                                              c

If it be the case that not one jot was said in any
briefing to any Officer about ensuring and taking
steps to ensure that overcrowding did not happen on
the Leppings Lane terraces, if no jot was said to that
effect, are you still saying that you would be
satisfied that proper briefings had been given? - A.
Sir, I have no wish to be impertinent, do you know
that that didn't occur? Do you know the contents of
the other briefings? - A.

It is a very fair comment.   I can only go on the
evidence we have heard.

     MR. CATCHPOLE: I apologise, I hesitate to rise,
but I would just remind my learned friend of the
evidence given by Mr. Creaser on this point. It may
be he would want to have a quick look at it before he
continues. It is not exactly a specific briefing, but
Mr. Creaser did give evidence that he spoke to
Inspector White about the briefings. I just remind
him of that.

     MR. ISAACS: Sir, I am very grateful to my
learned friend Mr. Catchpole. Certainly I was not
present during Chief Inspector Creaser's evidence,
otherwise I may have picked it up and I am very
grateful.

     THE CORONER: This may be an opportune moment to
break for 10 minutes while you look this up. I cannot
                                                                  81

      help you because I cannot remember the point without
      looking it up.

        •             Sir, I am quite happy just to deal
      quickly with Inspector Creaser because I do remember
      his evidence, sir.

           THE CORONER: Excellent.

           MR. KING: But I am in your hands entirely.           So
      be it, let us rise.

           THE CORONER: Let us stop for a few minutes.          Have
      you got a page number?

           MR. KING:    We will deal with it.

           MR. CATCHPOLE:   I have got a passage here which I
      can show to my learned friend. He will understand the
      reason why I have risen.

           THE CORONER:   If you give me the page number I
      can look it up as well.

              CATCHPOLE: It is page 37E. I am unsure of
     the day.    I think he gave an example of it a bit
      ater on, I think it was on page 40, and possibly on
     page 41.

          THE CORONER: Thank you.

                        (Short Adjournment)

Q*    i . M R * KING:   Mr. Duckenfield, is it your evidence
           ^ou would have expected the individual track
                  in the serials in the West Stand to be
     specifically briefed as to a duty and role for the
     monitoring of the terraces for overcrowding? - A. When
     you use the word "overcrowding” in that manner it
     tends to flag up probably a previous knowledge of
     overcrowding, and I have some difficulty with that.
     But h a v m g said that, not wishing to be difficult,
     what I would say is that I would expect them with
     their knowledge to brief with regards to safety.

Q.   It is quite right that Chief Inspector Creaser
     undoubtedly said, and I have not in fact taken that
     out of my mind, that at an informal briefing he
     claims, and I accept that is his evidence, that there
     would be mention made of a need to monitor
     overcrowding, but it is certainly also the evidence,
     so that the picture is complete to you, that any
     individual track Officer who we have had giving
     evidence, who has been asked about his briefing, his
                                     D.   G. DUCKENFIELD


evidence always is that he received no specific
briefing, and that would be a fair summary of the
position. So with that background, can I ask you does
it surprise you, given your view of safety at the
ground, that no track Officer so far has given
evidence that he received such a briefing? - A. It
does, sir.

Because in fact, on the system which was being
operated on the day where you were simply allowing
fans to find their own level, careful monitoring of
individual pens on the Leppings Lane terrace was
crucial to the safety of the fans, was it not? - A.
Certainly not so much in the pens, but the whole of
the ground, monitoring of safety and levels was
crucial.

Mr. Duckenfield you were able to see, and I showed you
the photograph, that the terrace was divided up into
pens with radial gates at the back, were you not? - A.
Yes sir.

You do not need to have much more knowledge than that,
or any more knowledge than that, to appreciate, do
you, that anybody going into, shall we say, the centre
pen, if he wants to move sideways, having entered, has
to go through the radial gate at the back other than
going out of the tunnel and going round the back
again, that is just common sense, is it not? - A. Yes
sir.

Just looking at it one can see, can one not, that if,
in fact, that pen becomes crowded at a capacity game,
there is an obvious risk - it may not happen but there
is an obvious risk - that access to that gate at the
back will become blocked, that is obvious, is it not?
- A . I am not happy with the word "obvious", sir. I
go back to the situation and I can only repeat experts
have looked at that end of the ground and experts have
made an assessment of the situation knowing full well
all the circumstances and have come to the conclusion
it is safe.

Mr. Duckenfield, those experts included the Police,
did they not? - A. There were representatives on the
Officer Working Party, yes sir.

Tell me, because you are the man who was in overall
command, imagine I was a spectator coming down the
tunnel onto the centre pens - all right - at a time
when the pens were filling up? - A. Yes sir.

Imagine that I get myself in a position near the front
- all right? - A. Yes.
                                                                       83

     Q.     Imagine then that it becomes more full so I would like
            to get out - all right? - A. Yes sir.

          wflQC^ ° r 8°^nS.ont° the Leppings Lane central pens
          was concerned, it was up to them, without any

                                        D. G. DUCKENFIELD


 wish to exercise their right to leave, then they do so
 Dy using sound common sense.

 So is that your approach to safety as regards the
 spectators in the centre pens, that it is up to their
 common sense to show them how to escape the situation?
   A. Sir, if I can choose words rather differently,
 as I have said earlier, the care and safety of
 spectators is a partnership, and if people choose to
  eave those pens under normal circumstances then that
 is what I described earlier.

 But in normal circumstances when --

       MR. ISAACS; Sir, I am sorry to interrupt my
   earned friend, but I do recollect now, perhaps a week
 or so ago, exactly the same points being made with the
 pi?- ?rn   t*ie Plan that is now being discussed, namely
 Chief Superintendent Mole. Chief Superintendent
 miclcenfield has said now on a number of occasions,
  When I took over this game I was informed, and I
 understood, that the terrace would be safe", and he
      given his reasons why he understood that to be the
 case.

        These matters really relate very clearly to the
plan and the operational nature of the plan and I do
not know how far my learned friend now wishes to take
t h l *but.?u are g°inS over very, very old ground and
       » Ylth respect, is not the man who should be
answering these questions. The man who should be
answering these questions has already had these
ques ions asked of him. I make this point now perhaps
to try and save some time and to relieve the Jury of
this burden.

      MR. KING:Sir, with respect, I      submit this is
 the man to ask the questions to. He was in overall
command. He has given evidence to us that he was
            u® t0 safety- 1 am entitled to investigate
with him what was obvious not from what Mr. Mole may
            t0 him ’ or what a°yt>ody else said to him,
but what was obvious from just looking at the layout
  . , e ground, and that is what I am investigating
           witness who was in overall command on the
aay. All my questions have arisen through looking at
and   putting to the witness the sheer layout of the
fho        radial      fences, the pens, the position of
the radial gate at the back.     I am entitled to ask
this witness those matters.

     MR. ISAACS: Sir, there is a world of difference,
  is isaster having taken place, certain aspects

 what is the situation now when one looks at it, and
 the situation that was in any man's mind, or any
 woman's mind,        at that time. Chief Superintendent
 Duckenfield has said, "When I took over in the time
       1 had» 1had this experienced team and
 effectively I was told, and indeed the Safety
  e£tificate told me as much, that the terrace was
 safe . H o w e v e r much one wants to identify the tunnel,
 the radial gates, the imaginary fan who comes when he
 has not been there before and how is he going to get
 out, it is something we have heard time and time
 again. It is just a bouncing around exercise. I do
 not know how far it gets us.

      MR. KING: Sir, I do not regard it as a bouncing
 around exercise. I am entitled to investigate, with
 the overall Commander of the game on 15th April, what
 he appreciated and what was or was not obvious to him
 as to the conditions on the Leppings Lane terrace,
 given that he was in overall command in the Control
 Box, sir.

     THE CORONER: Mr. King, I think that is right, but
on the other   hand (a) we have traversed the ground
with others and (b) we have traversed the ground with
this witness twice already, and I have not stopped you
  at least I   have not stopped you yet - because you
want to findout what was known to this witness, but
once we have got his answer we do not need to repeat


         KING: i agree, sir, but what I am trying to
establish with the witness is what was obvious to him
    J am bound to say - and I say it openly - what
could have been obvious to him from the sheer looking
at the ground and taking him through it, and his
answers, and investigating whether his answers, in
tact, ring true, given what he has asserted. I am
entitled to do that, sir.

     THE CORONER: To a degree.

     MR. ISAACS: There is a world of difference, with
respect, between saying, "Was it not obvious to you?"
a   saying, Is it not obvious to everybody now
looking back? What is the situation with the
imaginary hypothetical fan?" Sir, that is not, with
respect, what this Inquest with this witness should be
about.  I echo my previous remarks.

         KING: Sir, with respect I have not once put
to this witness, "Looking back do you not think that
....   Not once have I put that, and my learned friend
makes a very good crie de coeur on behalf of his

         THE CORONER:      I think you have got to accept his
    answers.

         MR. KING:   I agree, but I am entitled to
    investigate the basis for his answer to see whether it
    has a basis.

         THE CORONER:      Press on.

         MR. KING:      I am obliged, sir:

 Q. Mr. Duckenfield, take it at the moment at this position,
    you have conceded or agreed with me that you would expect
    those who were delegated to have the responsibility,
    whoever they be, to be instructed and briefed as to the
    need to monitor the crowd at the Leppings Lane end, you
    have agreed with that? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You have agreed with me that you knew the Leppings Lane
   terrace was divided by radial fences? - A. Yes.

Q. You have agreed with me that you knew it was divided into
   pens by those radial fences? - A. Yes, but on the semi­
   final day, those pens - the gates were open.

Q. Yes, and the sole means of moving sideways at the back
   was by radial gates at the back? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Just looking at the ground, those radial gates were
   positioned at the back, whereas people who enter the
   terrace enter not at the back but at a point further down
   when they come through the tunnel?   That is right? - A.
   Are you suggesting because of the buttress walls, for
   want of a better description?

Q. Yes. - A. People do arrive, and this is said with
   hindsight now, of course, people do arrive a yard or two
   on to the terrace.

Q. Let me just leave those basic facts and I will not take
   the matter any further with you at this stags as to the
   obviousness of the patent difficulties I put to you any
   spectators would find themselves in once those centre
   pens became any sort of full, to escape sideways.   I put
   it to you, that obviousness, that difficulty, is based on
   just looking at the layout of the ground, not any other
   sort of knowledge?   You don't agree? - A. Sir, you say
   it is obvious.   To me it was not obvious.   To the
   experts it was not obvious and to everyone else it was
   not obvious.

Q. Would it be obvious to you to this extent that if you
   were to see on the centre pens a fullness - whatever we
   call by fullness - and if you were to see obvious large
                                         D. G . DUCKENFIELD

 spaces in the side pens, that that picture would indicate
 that there had not been by spectators a "finding of their
 own level" across the terrace? - A. Can I just qualify
 what you are saying?   Are you referring to a disparity
 in the centre pens?

I am referring to a position whereby one has two centre
pens which on any view are full, whatever we mean by that
for the moment - I will not quibble with you about words,
particularly - and you have side pens which are obviously
empty in the sense of clear, empty spaces.   If you see
that situation, and if you see that situation shall we
say a quarter of an hour before kick-off at a capacity
game, are you saying that of itself would not give you
any indication as to whether or not fans were being able
to find their own level? - A. Sir, accepting at a quarter
to three a disparity as you suggest, then disparity is
not of itself unusual on football terraces.

Even with a capacity game with only a quarter of an hour
to go? - A. There is one point I must make here, sir.  I
do not know what a capacity terrace at Leppings Lane
looks like with 10,100 people on it.

You are not suggesting, are you, Mr. Duckenfield, that
you believed that 10,000 people on the Leppings Lane
terrace when distributed in a way which was safe, would
give rise to a picture whereby you would have two pens
which were full and side pens which had clear, wide open
spaces in them?   You are not really suggesting that, are
you? - A. I did not say that at all, sir.   Sir, my view
is this, I am just drawing attention to a particular
point.^  However, going back to the original question,
disparity of itself is not significant.

When, in your judgment, would disparity be of
significance? - A. When Police Officers, or stewards, or
possibly fans, drew matters to my attention or Officers'
attention.

Do I take that answer to mean only until you see some
sort of overt sign of distress would you be worried about
disparity, is that what you are saying? - A. Sir, I have
a thought that about twenty minutes ago I answered
something in a similar vein where I said I would not
arrive at a crisis situation.   I said I thought there
was a situation where we were proceeding to a situation.
I thought I had dealt with that a short time ago.

Your answer does come back to this, that you are saying
to us that disparity would only be a matter of concern
for you if somebody complained about it in the sense of
saying, "There is something wrong here"? - A. No, sir.
                                          D. G . DUCKENFIELD

  Your interpretation, I believe, of what I am saying is
  incorrect and if that is my fault then I apologise.

* ^ is probably all my fault.    Tell me when you would
  regard disparity, obvious disparity on the terraces at
  the Leppings Lane end, that is to say, centre pens on any
  view full, side pens clear, open spaces, at a capacity
  game?   When would that disparity give rise to concern to
  you. - A. I think I have said earlier, sir, I can do no
  better than to say that disparity causes me concern when
  many factors come into play.   I think you are suggesting
  that the Police Service doesn't care and doesn't take an
  interest, and we do.

. What I am suggesting and trying to discover is what, if
  anything, you understood the system was for coping with
  overcrowding, and anticipating overcrowding, on the
  Leppings Lane terraces.   That is what I am
  investigating. ^ You agree with me that the Operational
  Order contains in itself the operational instructions to
  Serials, but contains absolutely nothing about the safety
  of spectators in terms of their being protected from
  overcrowding on the terraces? - A. Sir, can I take you
  back?                                               3

 Do you accept that? - A. Sir, I have lost track of what
 you said.

Do you accept that in the Operational Order there is no
mention to any of the Serials in their duties about the
need to protect spectators and to look after their safety
and to protect them from overcrowding on the Leppings
Lane terraces? - A. Sir, there are general references in
the Operational Order, and this has been said before, in
the intention.   I made reference in my briefing to
safety and there are Police Officers who are delegated to
that area, who have responsibilities, so the Police as a
whole accept their responsibility for safety on those
terraces.

If, from the Control Box, one is able to see that there
 is a disparity in the sense that centre pens are full,
whatever we mean by that term, and there are blatant
obvious spaces on the side pens, would you agree with me
this much as to what is obvious, because I appreciate you
don t agree with much of what I say is obvious, but it is
obvious that you as the Police looking after those
terraces would not want any greater number of people to
enter the centre pens as opposed to the side pens?    You
would not want that to happen for their safety, would
you? - A. If we have got to a difficult level, then I
agree with you.
                                                             90

                                              D. G. DUCKENFIELD

 Q. What do you mean by a "difficult level"? - A. Sir, there
    are many factors and I think we are now getting into the
    hypothetical situation where I am finding some difficulty
    in answering your questions.

 Q. It is not meant to be a difficult question.   It is meant
    to be a view from the Control Box of someone in your
    position, observing, if one did, a marked disparity
    between the centre pens and side pens, seeing the centre
    pens on any view of the term were full - there may be
    spaces, but full.   Plenty of spaces in the side pens.
    You would not, would you, if you are concerned for the
    safety of spectators, want any greater number of people
    to enter the full area as opposed to the side area?    You
    would want to ensure that the people coming in would now
    go to the side area, would not you? - A. If the centre
    pens were full then we would take action.

Q. What action would you take? - A. Sir, I am sure there are
   many options open to the Police Service and depending on
   the circumstances we would consider each case on its
   m erits.

Q. Before the 15th of April, 1989, had you had any
   contingency planning, which you are aware of, as to what
   you would do if the centre pens became full, the side
   pens obviously had space in them and you did not want any
   more people in the centre pens and you wanted to divert
   people to the side pens?   Had you had any contingency
   planning on that issue at all? - A. Sir, I think, as has
   been made plain through this particular Inquiry, the
   Police Service are not casual in their approach to
   things. Having said that, they do not always have a
   written down contingency plan for every eventuality.
   That is just not possible.

Q.    Was there any contingency planning, to your knowledge, to
     deal with that situation? - A. There was no written down
     contingency plan to my knowledge.

Q.    Leave aside what is written down.   To your knowledge was
     there any contingency planning for that situation? - A.
     Sir, I can do no better than say that in the Police
     Service we act according to circumstances as they present
     themselves, and that is not a casual, unprofessional,
     uncaring approach.

Q. I understand that answer.    You have repeated it a number
   of times.    I am just asking whether or not, apart from
   anything written down and you said there wasn't, was
   there to your knowledge any contingency planning to deal
   W lth that situation?   As I understand your answer the
   answer is there was not, is that right? - A. There was no
   contingency plan to my knowledge.

Q. Thank you.   Were you aware of any arrangements made by
   anybody - I do not necessarily mean an individual, but by
   any body in the terms of either the club or the Police,
   any arrangements made prior to the 15th April, 1989, to
   encourage the even distribution of spectators on the
   Leppings Lane terraces?   Were you aware of any
   arrangements? - A. Can you advise me as to who you
   include in that, sir?

Q. I leave it open to you completely.   Were you aware
   yourself, as overall Commander, of any arrangements which
   had been made to encourage the even distribution of
   spectators across the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. I
   think I have already answered that, sir, in that it was a
    find your own level" situation.

Q. That would not encourage the even distribution, would it?
   - A. Not in terms of people actually participating.

Q.   It is nothing active, it is a totally passive system of
     leaving the fansto their own devices, isn't it? -  A.
     Sir, we go back to the original situation, and I am sorry
     to repeat myself, but this system had worked before.    It
     was an accepted system and that was the system in
     operation.

Q.    So the answer to my question is there were not
     arrangements, to your knowledge, made to encourage even
     distribution of the crowd on the terraces? - A. No, sir.




           Q. That is correct
                                                                     92

 Q. That is correct? - A. Yes, sir.
 Q. In the round then, Mr. Duckenfield,apart from the fact
    that you repeat the whole time that from what you had
    been told nothing had gone wrong before, can you help
    us with any specific planning which existed to your
    knowledge which was designed to prevent overcrowding on
    the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. Sir, the system as a
    whole, that is Police Officers and possibly stewards
    who were overseeing the Leppings Lane terrace, I would
    suggest that they had a responsibility in keeping with
    many other people to monitor for difficulties on the
    Leppings Lane terrace.
Q. Only if they saw difficulties - and I leave it atthis
   point - under your system wouldthere be any
   intervention. You have got to have a difficulty before

     my view is that you say the    word ’difficulty’ which
     introduces in some people's    minds a finality as though
     we have got a long way down    the road and I find that
     unfair. I think, as I have     said earlier, Police

     example of a developing situation where you would
     expect intervention which had not yet reached overt
     signs °f distress in the crowd? - A. Mr. King, I don't
     wish to take the matter further because we seem to be
     disagreeing about a word. I can do no better than the
     answer I have given, sir.
Q. I am sorry. You fairly disagreed with me when I
   suggested that the system which you understood was
   operating was one where there would only be
   intervention as regards overcrowding on the terraces if
   there was signs of distress. You disagreed with that
   and so what I want to know is, when would you say a
   developing situation would arise? What is that
   developing situation which you would expect
   intervention in regard to even if we had not reached
   the signs of overt signs of distress? What is the

           SIXTY NINTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

             WEDNESDAY,   13th MARCH 1991

         DAVID GODFREY DUCKENFIELD Recalled

       Cross-Examined by MR. KING (Continued)

Last night, Mr. Duckenfield, I had suggested to you
that the system being employed as regards the filling
of the Leppings Lane terraces, being employed by the
Police, relied on good fortune, if overcrowding was to
be prevented, and nothing else, and I think you
disagreed with me? - A. Yes, sir.

Just one final point on that:  did you know that in
1988 when, of course, the semi-final had also been
played by reference to this system of finding your own
level, that in 1988 the tunnel had been closed off
apparently to prevent people getting into the centre
pens which had become full? - A. No, sir.

Can I go straightaway now to that time on 15th April
1989, when you were in the Control Box and you received
the first message from Mr. Marshall for gates to be
opened?  You knew, I assume, what gates he was
referring to? - A. The gates at the Leppings Lane end,
sir.

How did you know that? - A. Because Mr. Marshall was at
the Leppings Lane end.

So you were quite satisfied in your mind that you had
made proper enquiry as to the gates to which he was
referring?  You knew to what he was referring? - A. The
circumstances, sir, were that Superintendent Murray had
sent resources to that end and when the message came,
"Open the gates", for the first time, I remember
immediately looking to my left to the video monitor,
which was on the left hand side high up on the wall.

Yes, and seeing what? - A. At that stage, looking at
it, I saw what I believed to  be gate C toburst open
and fans enter the Ground.

The decision, therefore, which you were being asked to
make was in relation to gates, is that right? - A. Yes,
sir.

Did you therefore think there was more than one gate
involved? - A. At that stage, sir, the only thoughts in
my mind were that, taking it stage by stage, on the
first occasion he said words to the effect, "Open the
gates", and I recall looking at the video monitor and
                                      D. G. DUCKENFIELD


the impression was that the gate had burst open and
fans had entered, and at that stage there was a mounted
Officer who retrieved the situation and closed the
gate.

When the further message came for the gates to be
opened, again you knew it was in the plural, gates? -
A. Yes, sir.

And again you would know that those were the gates
which led onto the concourse at the Leppings Lane end?
- A. Yes, sir.  Can I qualify that?

Certainly. - A. I say gates.  The only reason I am
questioning that in my mind, at some stage later, as
you will know, and I am not wishing to jump the
sequence, gate A was mentioned and someone raised a
question as to where that was, but in general terms
gates onto the Leppings Lane end.

You, indeed, told us that you were expecting people to
go onto the concourse if the gates were opened, because
that was a process of thought which you went through? -
A. Yes, sir.

You knew, didn't you, that in the middle of the
concourse, somewhere in the middle of the concourse,
was the tunnel which gained entry onto the centre pens
of the terraces, you knew that much? - A. I knew where
the tunnel was, sir.

And you would know that was roughly in the middle of
the concourse? - A. Yes, sir.

You told us that you did not know precisely the
relationship of the particular gate you might have been
looking at, for example gate C, to the tunnel, that is
what you told us? - A. Yes, sir.

But what you would know and you could not ignore would
be that you could not exclude, could you, that anybody
going through those gates, whichever gates they were,
it would lead them into the middle of the concourse?
That was obvious, that it could be the case, couldn't
it? - A. Opening the gates would lead to the concourse.

And if there are three gates involved, a number of
gates, and you don't know which one leads where, it
doesn t really matter, all you can say to yourself is,
if those gates are opened people are going to end up in
the concourse, isn't it? - A. I said yesterday, sir, if
I opened the gates people will go on the concourse.
                                         D. G. DUCKENFIELD


You knew there was a large crowd outside the gates you
could see? - A. Yes, sir.

You knew that the effect of opening the gate you could
see, because it was focussed, the camera, wasn't it, on
what we know as gate C, yes? - A. I am sorry, sir?

The camera you could look at when you were making your
decision as to whether to open the gates was actually
focussed on the gate which we know to be gate C? - A.
Yes, sir.

You would know that the effect of opening that gate was
to introduce a large number of people onto the
concourse? - A. Yes, sir.

You also would know, wouldn't you, just by looking at
the terraces around that time, that there was certainly
no room for a large number of people in the centre
pens, just by looking at it, wouldn't you? - A. Sir,
the centre pens would be approaching --- they were
filling and approaching full.

Just let me show you a photograph, which is C509.   I
know that is looking at it from the opposite end from
where you were and I accept that, but as regards the
centre pens you could not suggest, could you, that
round about 10-to-3, when you were making your decision
whether to open the gates, that it was clear and
obvious just by looking at the terrace that the centre
pens could not possibly have room for a large number of
further people, that is right, isn't it? - A. Looking .
at this, sir, and as you have so rightly stated, this
photograph is not taken from the position that I
occupied, I think we have to bear that in mind, that 1
was in the Control Box, I was standing towards the back
of that Control Box, and as a result my view from that
Control Box across those terraces was not necessarily
as good as this photograph suggests, but having said
that, looking at this photograph that you have shown me
there appears to me to be room on those terraces at
that stage.  If you look at the word "Fly" behind the
goal, and walk up from the word "Fly", behind that
Policeman, it is my view, leading up to that carrot or
banana, that on this very small photograph there is
space.

   there and I can take that matter no further.    I can take
  it no further at all.    However, going back a stage
  turther than that, my primary objective was to save life
  and if we look at that statement I have made, and I am
  referring to the gates, and when I say this it seems to
  minimise all the heartache and the tragedy and suffering
  of the others and I have to be careful sometimes when I
  use strong terms, but when I opened the gates it was mv
  intention to save life.    With that major decision I
  saved life.    There was nobody killed outside.

. At the time you gave the order to open the gates, you did
  not - and you have agreed with me - you did not turn your
  m l ij l  6 r i s ^ that the large number of people who
  would be enteri ng through that gate would go through on
  to the centre pens?      You did not give any thought to
  that risk, did you? - A. Mr. King...

 Could you just answer that question. - A. My answer                              is
 this:  there was no obvious and serious risk to me.

 Ther e was no obvious and serious risk that that large
 number of people would enter the centre pens, is that
 what you are saying? - A. Mr. King, I cannot take the
 matter any further.

      THE CORONER:   Mr. King, whether you like the
 response, is neither here nor there, but you have got...
 in the end you have got to accept his reply.

     MR. KING:  Of course, but I am entitled,                           sir,    to
investigate the factual basis.

         THE CORONER:          In the end repeati ng            the question...

         MR.   KING:        I agree entirely, sir.It is an issue.

     THE CORONER:              You might       then get an        answer, but it
is the q u a l i t y . ..                                               ’

        MR. K I N G :       Of course:

The     factual basis behind your answer is this,
M r . D u c k e n f i e l d , I j u s t want to m a k e s u r e t h e f a c t s a r e
ri ght, the f a c t s ar e that you            knew the gates were about
to       be opened on your order?              That is the        fact? - A. Yes.
sir.                                                                       ’

The fact is you knew that that gate would enter on to the
concourse? - A. The gates would enter on to the
concourse.

                                                            28
                                           D. G. D U C KENFIELD

 You would know that was not an obvious means of entry to
 anyone coming on to the concourse?   There was no way
 anybody just being there would know that was a means of
 entry, would they?

       MR. CATCHPOLE:  I am not sure that is a proper
 question, particularly in the light of the evidence given
 by Dr. Nicholson as to the ratio of people in the
 Leppings Lane terrace as opposed to overall entry.
 Equally, in relation to the evidence given by Mr. Murray
 yesterday about the fact the North West terrace was
 filling up at roughly the same rate as the centre pens.
 It depends whether you are asking this Officer whether he
 thought^it was, or whether he is asking this Officer it
 was obvious to a hypothetical supporter, which is not a
 proper question.

      MR. KING:   With respect, sir, I am not dealing with
 arguments about what the evidence indicates.    We can all
 argue about what the evidence indicates.    I am asking
 this witness about what he knew in his mind on the 15th
 of April as regards the means of entry.    That is
 certainly what I have been asking about.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Certainly if that is the question I
have no objection and I apologise.

      MR. ISAACS:    Sir, may I justintervene to try and
 help here.    My learned friend Mr. Catchpole's
 intervention is one I would wish to make but I am
conscious I do not want to be seen to be getting up all
 the time. ^ I am concerned that once again although my
 learned friend says he is asking Mr. Duckenfield about
what was obvious to him at the time, the questions do not
come out that way at all.     The questions are being
framed in a way to ask, "VJould it not be obvious... ?M
Obvious to whom, I ask rhetorically.     That is not, as I
understand it, what Mr. Duckenfield is being asked
questions about.     If those matters are to be asked in
this way:    Was it not obvious to you that...?" then we
are getting somewhere.     Otherwise, and again I use the
phrase advisedly, it is another bouncing off exercise,
which is not right.

       MR. KING:   With respect, I am investigating the
behaviour of Mr. Duckenfield between 2.55 and three
0 5 ^ ° ^ after he has introduced a large number of people,
which he agrees, through gates on to the concourse.     I
am investigating what he did to monitor the terraces
during that period and what his state of knowledge was as
to the means^of entry on to the terraces.     That is what
1 have been investigating, sir.
                                                             29
                                           D. G. DUCKENFIELD

       I have established through the witness that he knew
 there was an obvious means of entry on to the terraces
 through the tunnel and I have established that through
 him, that he knew that.     I have also established through
 him that he knew of the entry round the sides of the
 South Stand from prior knowledge himself of the ground.
 I now want to investigate the means of entry via the
 other route.    He has told me he knew there was a means
 of entry through a gate.     What I want to investigate is
 whether that is through prior knowledge or whether that
 is through something which was obviously to oe seen on
 his visit round the ground or from some other source.
 That is what I am entitled to investigate, his source of
 knowledge.    It is important.

      THE CORONER:   I think you are entitled to
 investigate as to whether or not he knew what the entries
 were and where he would locate them.

     HR. KING:   Yes.   I am also entitled to investigate
his state of knowledge as to how those means of entrances
were presented at the ground.

     THE CORONER:   He has already given us substantial
answers on that, as to what he had noticed with regard to
signing, which is what I think you are saying?

     MR. KING:   Sir, I am entitled to investigate what
he knew as to how it was presented at the ground.

     THE CORONER:   You do not need to go over the ground
several times, though.

     MR. KING:   I agree.   With respect, sir, I am only
arriving at this point now.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, but it is a point which I have
already established with him.

     MR. KING:   Of course, but I am entitled, sir, to
investigate his answer.

     THE CORONER:   If you dispute it.

     MR. KING:   Sir, exactly, if I dispute what his
state of knowledge was.   I want to investigate what his
state of knowledge was as to the presentation of that
means of entry.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. King, are   you suggesting...   My
recollection of Mr. Duckenfield's   answer is that he did
not know that the signing or lack   of it had not impinged
upon his consciousness.   Are you   going to try and
persuade him to say that it had?
                                          D. G. DUCKEN'FIELD

      MR. KING:   Not at all.   What I am trying to
 discover is that from his walk round the ground, because
 it is a useful piece of evidence, his walk round the
 ground, what he was able to see.   We know from his walk
 round the ground he was able to see the tunnel as a means
 of entry.   We know from his walk round the ground, and I
 have not done the gap in the wall yet, we know from his
 walk round the ground that his means of entry into the
 South Stand was one which did not impinge on him from his
 walk round the ground because he knew about it already.

      THE^ CORONER:  Yes, he said that.   It might be
 helpful if you asked him to describe his walk around the
 ground because I think that might help us a little bit
 more as to what actually happened.

       MR. KING:  Mr. Duckenfield, you tell us about the
 walk round the ground. - A. Sir, that is difficult.   I
 had a walk round the ground.   I can answer the question
 quite simply, and may I take you back to the point about
 the south entrance?   I said I knew about that south
 entrance from some years ago, but taking it in stage, I
 was aware there was an entrance round the south side of
 the West Terrace, I was aware of the tunnel, I was aware
 of the wall with the gap in it, I was aware there was an
 entrance on to the north side of the West Terrace and I
 was aware there was a raised section where fans would go
 and had found it as popular as the central pens.

Let me just ask you this one question:  were you aware
from your walk round the ground of any means of
direction, going round the ground, when one is in the
concourse area, that if you go through the gap in the
wall you would get to the terrace by another route? - A.
It is difficult when you know the route because you tend
not to look for indications.

All right, I won't take that any further with you.   Let
me S°^back to the 15th of April where you are in the
position of having introduced this large number of people
into the concourse.   What you do know, and you must know
this much, is that the tunnel was a wide open tunnel on
the concourse giving access to the terrace?   You knew
that much? - A. I knew the tunnel gave access to the
terrace.

It was a wide open tunnel on the concourse clearly to be
seen.   You knew that? - A. Yes, I knew there was a
tunnel.

^   ^   not a t any stage in the light of your knowledge
that the people were going to end up on the terraces, you
knew that? - A. I knew that people were going to go to
all parts of the terrace.    There is just another point
                                          D. G. DUCK E N F I E L D

 there.   There is also the West Stand that we seem to
 have forgotten about.   When Gate B was opened then the
 fans who were outside with tickets for the seated section
 - we seemed to have concentrated far too much, Hr. King,
 upon the terrace, but there are other places.

 Hr. Duckenfield, you told me when I was pressing you
 before where you thought generally the people would end
 up, you said, "Generally on the terrace," that is the
 answer you gave me, but you want to add into that, and I
 accept, the West Stand? - A. Yes.

You must, however, have wanted to see what the effect
would be on the terrace, and the West Stand if you will,
of the introduction of so many people in such large
numbers so shortly before kick-off into the concourse,
when you knew, and you told us you knew, that you thought
they were going to end up generally in this area? - A. I
would look at the terrace, but as I said earlier, I did
not see anything significant until the Policeman opened
the gate.

This is your evidence:  from the Control Box you did not
see the strong surge which I have described to you in the
centre pens? - A. I did not see a strong surge.

Your evidence yesterday was you did   not even notice a
marked disparity between the centre   pens and the side
pens? ^ That was your answer to the   learned Coroner. - A.
Sir, disparity I saw earlier in the   day.

The question from the learned Coroner was, "Had you
noticed anjj marked disparity between the centre pens and
the wings? 1   When you very fairly asked the learned
Coroner the time to which the learned Coroner was
referring to, the learned Coroner indicated he was
speaking after    the gate had been opened.  Your answer to
him was. "No,     I saw normality." That was your answer? -
A. That s right.

I am just clarifying that, therefore.   You did not see
any^marked disparity at all? - A. I saw normality but
let s just qualify that by saying that you have shown me
a photograph where there was space, and that can also be
normali ty.

Can I show you a photograph we have all looked at many
times, but I am dealing now with the period between your
causing the gates to be opened at 2.52 and your noticing
people coming through a gate helped by a Police Officer.
Can I show you   326A please? - A.Yes, sir.

Did you at anystage, up until the time you say  you saw
these people coming out through a gate, from your vantage
                                                D. G. DUCK E N F I E L D

     point did you see anything which showed a marked
     disparity of the sort which we can see on 326.A? - A. No,
     sir, I don t recall it.    Just let me qualify that.    My
     position was in the Control Box.    I was looking at that
     from a different angle.    I am not an expert on matters
     such as this and I would have to look again when there
     was a crowd, but I would say I could not see what is
     portrayed in the foreground of this picture.

. At the end of the day neither you nor I have to assess
  whether that is right or wrong, but that is your
  evidence? - A. No, sir.   What I am saying is this, it is
  not whether that is right or wrong, what I am saying is
  that from my position in the Control Box my view of the
  West Terrace at that time was totally different to that
  photograph.   The angle I was standing at on the raised
  platform looking through that window would give me, I
  suggest, a totally different view of that terrace than
  the one you are pointing out here.

’      course you would be having a view looking from the
    different angle, but you have a good view across the
    whole of the terrace, don't you?    We have all been in
    this Box.   You have a good view across the whole of the
    terrace, don t you? - A. Let me just raise one point.
    Was there a crowd in that West Terrace when you were
    standing there?

    No, Mr. Duckenfield. - A. Well, then, Mr. King, I would
    suggest to you that my perception of what the situation
    was on the day of the semi-final with a crowd on that
    terrace is accurate;  accurate as regards my perception.

    You had the facility of these cameras which could take
    you all the way the whole length of the terraces, did you
    not? - A. I had a camera operator in that Control Room.
    In general terms, and I cannot say to what extent they
    extend, we had a facility to look at that terrace.

    Did you have a good view of pen 6 from that Control Box?
    -A. From my view personally or from a camera?

From the Control Box did you have a good view of pen 6? -
A. I had a view of the terrace.

Were you satisfied before the game began that you were in
a position to be able to monitor and look at the state of
the L e p p m g s Lane terraces, before the game began? - A.
Before the game began I could monitor all parts of the
ground.



          Q. Were you satisfied in y our mind
                                                                     33
                                                      D. G. DUCKENFTFT.n

     Q. Were you satisfied in your mind that in the Control Box
        you would be m a position to monitor the state of the
        crowd m each of the pens in the centre terraces? - a
        We could look at the terrace but there were Officers i n
        better positions to monitor the state of the crowd on
        that terrace.

     Q. Were you concerned that because of your position in the
        Control Box there was an area of the terrace which
        ^sally was one which was outside your view? — A. At the
        time I was in the Control Box it appeared that the
        terrace was in my view.

     Q. Mr. Duckenfield, I will not take it any further than
        this; that looking at 326A, the emptiness of pen 6 is
        so clear and obvious that even if you were looking from
        the other angle you, in the Control Box, must have been
        a£>le to see that marked emptiness in pen 6? It is
        beyond belief that you thought there were not those
        gaps in pen 6? - A. Sir, I find it amazing that you can
        suggest that from this particular picture, you can
        suggest to me what view I had on that day.

    Q. Did you have any view of pen 6 on that day? - A. I had
       views of the whole terrace.

    Q. What was your perception if you were looking at this
       terrace at the time I am referring to, that is to say
       between 2.52 and 3 o ’clock. What was your perception
       of pen 6. - A. I cannot give you an accurate answer as
       to what my perception was of pen 6 save to say that
       there appeared normality.

    Q. You would agree with me that that photograph of pen 6,
       and I accept that you say you did not see it, is not
       normality, would you not? - A. It is unusual.

    Q. It is not normality, is it, Mr. Duckenfield? - A. No
       on a Semi Final you would expect people to be there . '

    Q. After you have introduced into the concourse area a
       large number of people en masse to see the state of the
       centre pens and the marked emptiness of pen 6 on one
       side and indeed emptiness on the other side by your
       Control Box, that would give an obvious indication,
                not/ that something had gone horribly wrong
       with those people coming on to the terraces’ That
       would be obvious, would it not? - A. My view from the
       Control Box was such that nothing was obvious.

    Q. It would also appear that you were not even
       anticipating that by introducing this large number of
       people into the concourse that they might make their



H
                                                                       34
                                                       D. G. PUCKENFIELD


       r,aL in^ the %& n t r e Pe n s - You did not even think about
       that, did you? - A. I have said that there are several
       avenues into the ground.

 Q. I appreciate that but did it even enter your mind that
    °n€\ r°ute they might take, this large crowd of people
    would be down the tunnel into the centre pens? Did
    that even cross your mind as a possibility? - A. Thev
    were going to take all routes, Mr. King.

 Q. Did it cross your mind as a possibility then that thev
    might go down the centre tunnel? - A. They would use
    a 1 routes, Mr. King, and I can add nothing further.

 Q.    So that would include the centre tunnel? - A. It would.

Q.     When did you connect in your mind the opening of the
      gates and the introduction of the large number of
      people into the concourse with the problem which was
      developing on the Leppings Lane terraces.   When did you
      make that connection? - A. That is a difficult answer
          . uCan t honestly give you an answer at this stage.
      What happened was that the gate opened and we were into
       another series of events.

Q. Do you recall a message going out from the Control Box
   to ask people to come to the Leppings Lane end because
   of a pitch invasion? - A. I d o n ’t remember it but let
   me just qualify that. Someone may have said it I
   +vn*t 4.^n°W ‘ 1 don,t know what message was conveyed at
   that time m that respect.     I c a n ’t say yes or no.

Q.    Did you consider you were dealing initially with a
      pitch invasion? - A. I d i d n ’t know what we had got at
      the outset.                                        a

Q. Did you think, therefore, you were dealing with a pitch
   invasion? - A. That was a possibility.

Q. Did any other possibility cross your mind other than a
   pitch invasion? - A. It is difficult sat here today
   when so much has gone through your mind to say exactly
   what went through your mind at that time.     My accurate
                i1S that
   and I didn’t know  why.fanS were coinin9 on to the pitch

Q*        that stage you are telling us you made no connection
       n your mind as to what had happened shortly before
      <2.52, this unprecedented introduction of a large group
      of people through gates into the concourse area behind
      the terraces? You made no connection at that stage, is
      that what you are telling us? - A. I have told you that
      I had seen nothing on that terrace of the events you
                                                 D. G. DUCKENFTKT.n


 have described to cause me concern and when I saw that
 gate open I wondered what the situation was.

      MR. PAYNE:  I have kept count.      That is six times
 we have had that same answer.

     MR. KING: When thereafter do you say, how long
after, did you say to yourself, "There is a connection
between my unprecedented decision to open the gates and
the introduction of people into the concourse and what
is happening at the Leppings Lane terrace"?

     THE CORONER:  In fairness he did actually answer
that three minutes ago.

     MR. KING: Can I show you the document 517A and B
please? This is a log which my learned friend, Mr.
Payne, very kindly introduced into the evidence.   It is
a log of radio messages passing through the Operations
Room outside the ground and the Ambulance Service. Mr.
Duckenfield, just acquaint yourself with it for a
moment.  This is a log, as I have described, of
messages passing through a PC Rook of the South
Yorkshire Police Operations Room and the Ambulance
Service.  It is in two pages.

     THE CORONER:  Just help the Jury, Mr. Griffiths,
as they cannot find their copies.

     MR. KING: Unfortunately it will not make sense
for me to continue until the Jury have copies.

     THE CORONER:    We will have some more copies made.

     MR- KING: Sir, no doubt it is all down to my so-
called manner of cross-examination.  I note it is five
to twelve which is the hour that Mr. Catchpole says we
should break.

      THE CORONER:  Why do we not rise? Mr. King, I am
relieved to see that your estimate of time is as bad as
mine.   That is a great comfort to me.

     MR. KING:  Sir, I will aim certainly to finish
before the lunch adjournment.  I think that is perhaps
being more realistic than I was yesterday.

                    (Short Adjournment)

     THE CORONER:    What C number was this document
again please?

    MR. ISAACS:     Sir, C.517A and B.
                                                                  36

Q.        MR. KING: Mr. Duckenfield, before I turn to this
     document, there is just one matter I want to clarify as
     regards a point you raised just before the short
     adjournment.  You were saying about your view from the
     Control Box and I was asking you questions about your
     view from the Control Box of pen 6.  It is right, is it
     not, that if you had had any difficulties in your mind
     as regards pen 6 with your own eyes you did have the
     facility to have the camera zoom in on pen 6, did you
     not? - A. I am not being evasive, sir.  I d o n ’t know
     the technical capabilities and extent of those cameras.

Q. You had cameras which if you wanted the operator to
   help your eyes you could ask the operator saying,
   "Look, I have got difficulty seeing the whole of the
   terrace.  Could you please take the camera in on pen
   6?" You could have asked him that, could you not? - A.
   I could have asked him that. What I am saying is that
   I do not know the extent to which a view can be
   obtained from a camera on to pen 6.

Q. Have you ever seen the cameras operating on the
   terrace? - A. I saw the cameras operating on that day.

Q. I am not asking you hypothetical questions.    You were
   actually in the Control Box with the screens, were you
   not? - A. That is perfectly true but two years ago I
   di dn ’t anticipate I would have to think of specifics
   and I have no wish to be difficult, sir. All I am
   saying is that I will accept there are cameras that
   look on that terrace.

Q. I just want to accept if you will, and you may not,
   that you in the Control Box, if you are trying to
   monitor the terrace and you have any difficulties about
   seeing a particular part you can ask for the cameras to
   go in on to it. You have that facility, do you not? -
   A. You have that facility.

Q. Let me now go to the question which I was asking you
   just before the adjournment, namely the first time you
   made a connection between your decision to open the
   gates and let people into the concourse and troubles on
   the terrace.  I was directing you to this log which was
   517A and B and it is a log from the South Yorkshire
   Police Operations Room, PC Rook, to the Ambulance
   Service. - A. Yes.

Q. Do you see a message going out at 1508, which is to be
   seen on page 2 of this little bundle, 517B, at 1508.14?
   - A. Yes.
                                                                     37
                                                      D. G. PUCKENFTRT.D


Q. Could you just read that out to us? - A. It says:

         "A lot injured, apparently one of the gates,
         has t h e y ’ve been pushing and pushing and
         shoving I understand and one of the gates has,
         they’ve collapsed the gates and there’s."

Q. Right. As a matter of fact no spectator collapsed any
   gate, did they, on 15th April1989? That  is correct,
   is it not? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. As a fact that which we know to be gate C was opened on
   your authority and instruction.   That is right, is it
   not? - A. On the second occasion?

Q.    On the second occasion, yes. -    A. Yes.

Q.    It was on the second occasion that thelarge number of
     people came through, was it not? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. As regards gate A, although you say you received a
   message that there was a danger of it being collapsed
   if you did not do something about it, you actually gave
   the order to open the gate, did you not? - A. I had
   already given the order "Open the gates" earlier.

Q. But you repeated your order to open gate A as a
   specific gate.  You actually gave an order, "Open gate
   A" did you not? - A. I am uncertain in that the order
   was given to open the gates and I d o n ’t accurately
   recollect whether anybody referred it to me when the
   message came over.  It was accepted it should have been
   opened.

Q. All I am trying to establish is that as regards the
   gate you actually knew about, that is gate C which you
   could see on your camera which was opened at 2.52, and
   as regards gate A, those gates had been opened on
   Police authority, had they not? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   They had not been collapsed,      had they? - A. No, sir.

Q.    Can you give any explanation yourself as to how at
     eight minutes past three a message was going out to the
     Ambulance Service, first of all, connecting injuries
     and the need for ambulance with the gates?   I am only
     asking you now about the connection between the
     injuries and the gates for the moment, not the precise
     detail but just the connection between the injuries and
     the gates.   Can you explain why that went out at eight
     minutes past three? - A. I cannot understand that, sir.
                                                      D- G. PUCKENFTFTT.n


 W ^ ? ir v,t h f c ^ tro1 Box you had a me an s of c om munication
 with the South Yorkshire Police O pe r at i on s Room, did
 you not? - A. Yes, sir.

Did you kn o w that a request for am b ul an c es was going
out. - A. Yes, I think we have j um p ed a little in time
S C a J. e •


Yes, we have. - A. A nd we have m i s s e d the events that
took place.  I have no wish to go over ground but I
think I should draw your attention to some stage;          I am
sorry, that is pr ob a bl y a wrong c ho ic e of wor d there.
At a stage where I saw people on the pit ch and I called
for operational support there we re simultaneous
messages about m an y things going off.

Yes, I accept all that.  I want to know whe th er at
eight minutes past three you had any know le dg e of this
message and you say not? - A. Not at all, no.

At eight minutes past three had you made a connection
b e twe en the gates, whatever h a p pe n ed with the gates
and what was happening on the Lep pi ng s Lane terraces? -
A. No, sir, but I would like to q u a l i f y that.      The
sequence of events is that peop le came on to the
per i me te r track.   The next thing tha t ha pp e ne d was that
it was ne cessary to implement o p e r at i on s upport and the
major incident plan and at that stag e I had not
c o nne ct ed the two.




                                /Q. You cannot give us any.
                                                              39
                                             D. G. DUCKENFIELD

 Q. You cannot give us any clue as to how the connection
    was made m this message from the South Yorkshire
    Police Room to the Ambulance Service at that hour? -      A
    No idea at all.

 Q. Because within the Ground the only people who had
    knowledge that the gates had been opened on Police
    authority was within the Control Box, that is right,
    isn't it?                                       6 ’

           THE CORONER:   No.

           THE WITNESS:   No, that can't be right, sir.
 Q.        MR. KING:   I just want to investigate who knew,
      therefore - I may be wrong and I apologise if I am -
      who knew that the gates had been opened on the orders
      of the Control Box? You obviously knew and those in
      your Control Box knew? - A. Yes.

 Q. You are quite right, the serials who opened the gates
    would know? - A. Yes.

Q. The request for the ambulances was being sent through
   via,your Control Room, wasn't it? - A. I am hesitating
   saying yes. I don t recall the message. The messages
     recall were that there was a message about an
   ambulance, and I remember somebody countermanding that
   and saying, You don't want an ambulance, you want a
   fleet of ambulances".

Q. You say you have no knowledge of this message or how
   this message went out at 8-minutes-past-3? - A. Yes
   sir.                                                ’

Q. Was there ever a time during the afternoon when you
   gave an explanation as to what had happened on the
   Leppings Lane Terrace, connected with the collapse of
   the gates or the storming of the gates or something
   like that? -A. I spoke with many people that
   afternoon, sir. Can you be more specific?
Q. Certainly. We know and you know that the gates were
   opened on the authority of the Police, we have been
   through that? - A. On the second occasion?
Q. On the second occasion. We know that there were
   crushings and injuries and deaths at the Leppings Lane

Q. Sorry, I am not taking a particular point there. There
   came a time when you knew of injuries and problems on
   the Leppings Lane Terraces? - A. Yes, sir.
                                                                         40

                                                     D. G. DUCKENFIELD

 Q. Was there ever a time when anybody asked you              as to what
    had happened, how this had come about?

 Q*            THE CORONER:   This is an incriminating question
          and you don t have to answer it. - A. There were many
          people that afternoon who came to see me in the Control
          Box.

 Q*             MR* KING:       At any stage in the afternoon when you
       were asked for an explanation as to how it had
       h a p p e n e d , did you at any stage give an answer which
       would indicate that what had happened was that in some
       way gates had been colla p s e d or stormed by the fans
       themselves.

 Q.        THE CORONER:       This is incriminating as well, of
      course. - A. The way I would answer that is this, Mr.
      King. After the disaster had occurred it is fair to
      say I saw many people.      Many people came to see me and
      asked me various things, and some of the most
      significant factors on that day, and there is no
      inference to be d r a w nfrora that, but some of the most
      significant factors will remain with me for evermore.
               r e S ard to details or shall I say conversations
      which at the time seemed inconsequential, because I was
      heavily involved in a hive of activity, a frenetic
      Control Box, and d e s p erately trying to get the job done
      •   •   •   •




Q. Mr. Duckenfield .... - A. I now wish to take the matter
   no further.

Q. You may not wish to take it any further, Mr.
   Duckenfield, b u t ! am going to until I am stopped ask
   you to give a fair and square answer to this question.
   Did you at any stage in the afternoon, when asked for
   an explanation as to what had happened, give an answer
   to the effect that what had happened was that gates or
   the gates had been stormed, broken down or collapsed by
   the conduct of the fans.

Q*             CORONER:   This is an inc r i m i n a t i n g question:
      you don t have to answer it.

Q*         MR* KING:   Is the answer, if you do choose to
      answer it, yes, no, can't remember? - A. I heard Mr.
      Jackson give his evidence the other day w hen he was
      asked about this and he can't recollect who said what
      and to whom in that Control Box.

Q. Is the answer yes, no or can't remember? - A. I would
   say to you this, that with the passage of time I am
   uncertain as to the clarity of con v e r s a t i o n s at
                                                                   D. G. DUCKENFIELD

  p a r t i c u l a r t i m e s on   the    day   and   I   wish    to   take   the
  H a t t e r no further.

 hr. Duckenfield, do I deduce from that you are saying
 there      is a
            possibility you may have said and given an
 explanation that what had happened for the cause of the
 problems at Leppings Lane was that the gates had been
 stormed or broken or colla p s e d by the conduct of the
 rans.

       THE CORONER:      Mr. King, I have un d e r s t o o d Mr.
 Duckenfield s answer.         I am fully aware of the line of
 questioning.      It is e x c eedingly doubtful whether, in
 tact, it advances the q u estion of how somebody died
 \ou m a y p u t the question; I will re-warn Mr.
 Ljuckenfleld; you will have to accept his answer.
 Either he does not answer or you have to accept it but
 we are not going to go over the ground ....

      MR. KING:   Can I say, sir, because you raised                                  it
 to me, that the reason why it is relevant as to how
 people ....

     _ MR. ISAACS:     I am sorry, sir, if my learned
rriend wishes to deal w ith this, let's deal with it
where it should b e d e a l t with, not in the p resence of
the Jury at this time, if my learned friend wishes to
have an argument about it. He does not need to explain
to you, we already know why he is advancing this
P u r ?iCular line and 1 have already said to you it is
wholly irrelevant, you have made certain decisions
about it.

     MR. KING:    If my learned friend is going to take
an opportunity to give a speech that is wholly
irrelevant then, sir, it does not lie in his mouth if
an argument is being raised through him as to relevance
or questions for me to answer it.

1-k      C0 R0 ^ P ;     Just a minute. What I said was
that I have allowed you to ask the question; I am going
to re-warn Mr. D u c k e n f i e l d of his rights:
Wh i c h are ^that you do not have to answer.  I con s i d e r
the question to be one wh i c h may tend to incriminate
you; you do not have to answer it if you        don't w i s h to-
you may answer it if you do want       to.                     ’

     THE CORONER:     Then if need      be, we will ask the
ruling° leaVe and a r S ue             il
                             o u t > but that is my present

       MR. KING:           So be it, sir.
                                                                      42

                                                  D. G. DUCKENFIELD

 Q. My question to you is this, Mr. Duckenfield.         Did you
    at any stage in the afternoon when asked for an
    explanation as to h ow the problems had aris e n at the
    Leppings Lane end, give an explanation w h i c h was to the
    errect that what had happened was in some way
    spectators had broken down, stormed or c o l l a p s e d the
    gates. You gave an answer and I then asked you this
    supplemental, is it yes, no or can't remember.          You
    then gave an answ e r and then I asked you this question:
    do you accept there is a possibility that you may have
    given that answer, and that was where we had reached.
 Q.        THE CORONER:         And I remind you and won't repeat
      it ail again. - A. The only answer I can give, sir is
      that two years after the event I am u n c e r t a i n of ’
      certain c o n v e r sations and I wish to say no more about
      the matter.

 Q’            KIu G:  ° ne thinS is certain, Mr. Duckenfield,
      isn t it, that you would know all along that the cause
      and the reason for the problems in the L eppings Lane
      end wasn t that spectators had collapsed gates, but
      that spectators had been introduced through the gates
      on Police instructions?

           THE CORONER:     I am not objecting to the principle
      of the question but I just think it isn't phrased
      correctly. What you are saying is that the entry ---
      are you asking hi m w h ether he knew ___
            MR. KING:   The entry, yes.

           THE CORONER:   That the entry through the gates
      was on Police authority?

          4-uR ‘ KI ? ? : And 1 am not now talking of the 1 0 0 or
      so, the small n u m b e r who came through at 2.48 I am
       aiking about the large number who came through at 2.52
      and w h enever the other gates were open, sir.

             THE WITNESS:   I am sorry, Mr. King, can you
      repeat that again? Because of the dialogue I lost the
      t r a m of what your first one was.

   n    v                       ’ Duckenfield, I will m ove on. Mr.
   Duckenfield, did there ever come a time in the
   afternoon when you c o n n e c t e d your decision to opening
   the gates and al l o w i n g a large number of people into
   p n H ? C O n AOUS Se u - th the P robleras St the Leppings Lane
         ' / f li        Klr)g> there must have been a time but I
   can t tell you when.

Q. Leaving aside when that was, what would it be, what
   facts would there be in addition to what you already
                                                                43

                                               D. G. DUCKENFIELD

    k new by 3 o'clock, what other facts did you learn which
    gave you ^ that connection? - A. I find some difficulty
    in this in that we have a situation that is progressing
    at a pace, that is a rescue operation.          It is
    progressing      at a pace and the sole objective is to do
    what we can      for the people who are injured, and
    obviously the people who are dead. To be precise
    dur i n g an after n o o n of activity which was quite
    shocking and horrific about when I conn e c t e d the two, I
    am sorry, I      am not being evasive I just can't tell you.
 Q. It is not for me to judge whether you are being
    evasive, Mr. Duckenfield, but what I can .... - A. I
     think there is an understanding, there has to be an
    understanding, Mr. King, that - and I choose my words
    carefully - there has to be an und e r s t a n d i n g that we
    were under some difficulties.     I say that and I take
    n o t hing away from the bereaved; in anything I say I
    fully respect the families of the be r e a v e d and the
    injured.^ But there were occasions when we didn't, I am
    sure I didn't stop my mind and do things because I was
    iuoving on apace.

Q. But a statement to the effect that the cause was that
   the fans had collapsed the gate, or they had broken in
   or stormed, w o u l d be to attribute the cause to the
   b e h a v i o u r of the fans, wouldn't it? - A. Mr. King, you
   <are returning to a matter that I was w a r n e d about a
   short time ago and I have given you an answer in
   respect of that matter that I consider to be
   satisf a c t o r y and I have no wish to take the matter
   further.

        THE^CORONER:   Yes, and      I think we      should leave it
   because it is a decision for      the Jury.
         MR. KING:    Absolutely,    sir, and I      am moving on:
Q. Mr.   Duckenfield, at any time between 3 o'clock and
   15.06 when you saw that the game was being stopped
   through the agency of Mr. Greenwood, at any time
   through that period had you connected the opening of
   the gates on your authority and what was happening,
   through that period? - A. No, sir.
Q. At that period had you through the cameras looked at
   the front of the Leppings Lane Terraces, centre pens,
   v n e r e you could see and must have been able to see an
   ever increasing problem? - A. I didn't see an ever
   increa s i n g problem, sir, but as I say I am talking from
   £ personal point of view.

Q. kell let me show you for that period the series of
   photographs w h i c h begins at 326A, starting at 14.59 and
                                                          44

                                          D. G. DUCKENFIELD

going right through to 6-minutes-past-3, when the game
was ^s t o p p e d . It starts at 326A, then it is 327, then
it is 328, 329 and I suspect that is where it stops? -
A. I have go t 326A in front of me.

    C e r t ^ n l y what was clear in your mind originally was that
    the request for "Delay kick-off," was before Mr. Marshall
    came through with his request for "Open the gates"?
    That was your recollection? - A. The difficulty I am
    facing is this, that what I believed on the day and
    shortly afterwards in terms of sequence of events from
    2.40 onwards, was proved to be slightly inaccurate in
    that in^ the crisis that developed I flagged up various
    events in my mind in the days or weeks afterwards.         The
    problem is that you recall things, and they get jumbled.

 Q. So be it.    Let me forget about PC Buxton.   Let me just
    deal then with up to 2.40, whether or not PC Buxton has
    asKed for it to be delayed and you have this situation
    where ten minutes previously you had asked for the
    agreement as to when it was that kick-off would be
    delayed.   Ten minutes later, did it turn your mind at
    that stage with the deteriorating situation, that you
    should consider at that stage delaying kick-off? - A. At
    2.40 when the radio went down thoughts of many things
    were stopped.    The disruption was such that everybody
    had to move out of the way, and this has been said by
    many witnesses, the disruption was such that thought
    processes, actions, etc. were disrupted.

Q. Mr. Duckenfield, before the radio went down, after 2.30
   but before the radio went down at any stage did you
   consider delaying the kick-off? - A. The way I can reply
   to you is this, Mr. King:     I had it in my mind that I
   thought ^very seriously about delaying the kick-off.     I
   had a view at one stage that that was as the players ran
   out on the pitch.     My perception of that was that it was
   somewhere around the time the request came for the gate
   to be opened.    The difficulty with that belief is that I
   subsequently learned many weeks afterwards that the
   players did not run out on to the pitch until
   approximately five minutes to three.      Therefore, to
   answer your question, yes I seriously considered delaying
   Kick-off     a point.    WTien I thought it was is at
   variance with official records, if I actually saw people
   run on to the pitch and I am not so sure I did.

Q. Would this be unfair, Mr. Duckenfield, that the reason
   you did not in fact delay kick-off was because in fact
   you applied in your mind what was a relatively rigid
   agreement that if the reason for why people were late in
   your mind was that it was their own choice and therefore
   you would not delay kick-off?   Is that unfair? - A. That
   is totally unfair, sir.

Q. It might be born - that approach - from your inexperience
   of policing the football matches, I d o n ’t know? Do you
   think that is totally unfair? - A. I think what you are
   suggesting is totally unfair.

 Q. Finally, rlr. Duckenfield, do you think your inexperience
    of policing football matches on the 15th of April, 1989,
    in any way adversely affected the decis io ns you made? -
    ^ • The crucial decisions that had to be made on that day
    were made by a Police Officer who, when told of a major
    decision to open gates, which was totally unprecedented,
    when that Police Officer was faced with that decision he
    was up to that decision.    On that day I tried my best in
    sll circumstances and once r ea li s in g the seriousness of
    the situation at the Leppings Lane end then that Police
    Officsr was U P to the job to call Operat io n Support, and
    that is the situation.

 Q. That Officer may have been up to the job,
    Mr. Duckenfield.   Do you regard y o ur se lf as having been
    up to the job when you did not give any thought when you
    gave the order for the gates to be opened as to where the
    people would go, that large crowd, after they had entered
    the concourse? - A. Mr. King, I have told you repeatedly,
    with respect.                                              7’

Q.   I know.  The final point, Mr. Duckenfield, the message
     which you expected people to hear on talk-through, "Open
     the gates,  would not tell anybody as to what gates were
      eing referred to, would it? - A. Having r ece iv ed a
     request from Mr. Marshall at the Leppings Lane end where
     they were fully a cq ua in te d with the situation, and the
     request to open the gates and our passing of the message
     to open the gates, then those at that end k n e w exactly
     what the situation was.

Q. Do you seriously bel ie ve that? - A. That is my view.

Q. Your message on talk-through of "Open the g a te s ," would
   not give any clue in the message as to what was the state
     a  6 L e P P inSs Lane terraces, wo ul d it, in the message?
     A. In the message, Mr. King, taking the bare words that
   you have used, it wou ld not give a view.

Q. That message, the bare message, wo ul d not in its words
   give any instruction or direction to anybody to close off
   anything, to close off any means of access or divert
   anybody, would it? - A. I disa gr ee w it h you strongly.

Q.   It would not in the words give any ins tr uct io n to close
     off the tunnel, would it? - A. Mr. King, we have been
     over this ground before and I will say it again, the
     decision to open the gates was totally unprecedented.
     The atmosphere at that end - we h ave no need to describe
     it, everybody knows.   The Police Officers there knew the
     situation.  Everybody knew the situation.      T he decision
     was given to open the gates and those Police Officers
     there knew what was going to happen and I can take the
     matter no further.

. They did not know,  and could not know, the state of the
  Leppings Lane terraces?    They were on the wrong side of
  it. - A. Mr. King I have nothing to add.

      MR. KING:         Thank you.

      THE    CORONER:      Mr. Catchpole?

      MR.    CATCHPOLE:      I have no questions.

      THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien,            you will be a little
 bit longer than that, I take it?

      MRS.   MCBRIEN:      Yes.

      THE CORONER:        Miss Addleman?

      MISS ADDLEMAN:        No questions,        sir.

      THE CORONER:        Mr. Russell?

      MR. RUSSELL:        I have no questions.

      THE CORONER:   I do not think it is wor th s ta rt in g
before lunch but there is just one thing w h i c h the jury
have mentioned to me.     In fact they have mentioned it
twice, and that is what about the video evidence of the
terraces.    I have had the videos looked at and there is
actually next to noth in g on the videos because, of
course, not everything was recorded.       That does not mean
to say they weren't possibly scenes, but there is, I
understand, a little tiny bit which is actua ll y on the
compilation which you have seen.     T he re is another
little bit which starts at 15.03 and goes on for a few
minutes.

     What we have done is'that we have clipped it, if
that is the right word, and we will show it to you, but
it is very poor quality and I do not think it is going to
help us very much.   As far as I can tell there isn't
much recorded.   Does that help?

     Right, two o'clock.  Mr. D uc ke nfield you will
remember you are still on oath.

 Q. Mr. Duckenfield, I b e l i e v e d you w o r k e d c l os e ly w i t h
    Superintendent Mar s ha ll on public or de r s it u ati on s for
    about three years be for e you were promoted.                Is that
    right? - A. Yes, I was the Deputy D i v i s io n al C o mm a nd er
                ?olice Stat io n and he was the C o mm a n d e r of
    the Subdivisional Station.         He was the S u p e r i n t e n d e n t
    at the Police Sta ti on b en e a t h me at W es t Bar.

 Q.    You had not po lic e d a foot bal l ma tc h at H il l s b o r o u g h
       for about ten years.     That is right, is it not? - A.
       Yes, I was a Chief I ns pector there in 1980.

 Q. When you returned in 1989 Leppings Lane terrace was
    different, wasn't it? - A. Yes, I u n d e r s t a n d that in my
    absence they had f it te d the radial fences.

 Q. Di d you notice anyt hi ng different w ith the p e r i m e t e r
    fence or not? - A. No, I am sorry, Mrs. McBrien, I
    can t be specific about that.

Q. You did notice the radial fences.     D i d you enqu ir e why
   these radial fences had been c on st ru ct e d? - A. I can't
   recall the detail of that entering into any
   conversation.

                    n °^ ^ i n k it m i g h t h ave some b e a r i n g on t h e w a y
      t h e t e r r a c e w o u l d be c o n t r o l l e d in a n y way.      It w o u l d
      n o t m a t t e r if it w a s an o p e n t e r r a c e o r it h a d r a d i a l
      fences.         It w o u l d m a k e no d i f f e r e n c e , is t h a t w h a t y ou
      a r e s a y i n g ? “ A. I am t r y i n g to t h i n k b a c k a n d b e
      helpful.  I c a n ’t say ca te g or ic a ll y w ha t f l a sh ed up in
      my mind about that.

Q. You were not told about the 1981 c r u s h in g that h a d
   taken place there I p r e s u m e ? - A. No, t hat as I
   understand it had been dealt with as you r i g h t l y say in


Q.    If I tell you now that was the reason for the ra di al
      fences being installed, it was b e ca u se of that
      incident, you woul d not disag re e w it h that. - A. I see.

Q. So you just accept e d the system of 'find yo ur own
   level'.      Did you fully un de rs ta nd w h a t t h a t m e a n t if
   you were not sure of w hy the radial fen ce s had b e e n
   installed?      Did you re al l y u nd ers ta nd the system? - A.
   I am trying to think b ack an d my r e c o l l e c t i o n is that
   at some stage and the d ir ec t c o nve rs at io n was a bo ut
   Semi Final day, that the sys te m was 'find your own
   l e v e l '.
                                                                            55

 Q- What did that mea n to you? - A. That the fans w o u l d
    enter on to what was r e g a rd e d as a safe t e rra ce wi th a
    safe capacity of 10,100 pe op le and choose th e ir own
    viewing area.

 Q. Did you understan d the tunnel and the radial gates, the
    tunnel doors and the radial gates w o u l d be in the
    locked open posit io n for that s y s te m to o pe ra te at Semi
    Final matches? - A. I am sorry, you are asking me two
    questions, Mrs. McBrien, forgive me.

Q.     I am sorry,   I will take one at a time then.     - A.    W o ul d
      you please?    Thank you.

Q.     Did you understand that the tunnel doors l e ad ing       to the
      terrace would be in the locked open p os it i on at a       Semi
      Final match when the g ro u n d was b e i n g used? - A.   My
      understanding wou l d be that those doors w o u l d be     open
      in the tunnel.

Q. Also the radial gates at the top of the radial fences,
   did you understand that they also w o u l d be in the
   locked open positi o n at a Semi Final match? - A. Yes,
   fastened back on to the wall.

Q.   So fans were able to use the whole       circuit, so to
     speak, in that they c o ul d go right    ar ou nd and have this
     freedom of movement. - A. Yes.

Q. You were aware that the system h a d w o r ke d
   satisfactorily for the 1987 and the 1988 Semi Finals
   weren't you? - A. Yes.

Q. There seemed to be not hi ng to draw to your a tt en t io n
   that was seriously w ro ng w ith that system, is that
   right? - A. Not at all.

Q.    There is one matt e r r ela ti ng to that which I w o u l d like
     to ask you about.     Do you think it is im po rt an t to k ee p
     the gangways leading to those radial gates, as you come
     down the tunnel and the radial gates are at the back,
     do you think it wo u l d be important to keep t h e m clear?

          THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, I do not w an t to start
     interrupting you at such an early stage but we have
     talked about the g an gw ay s several t im es and th e re
     aren't any gangways.     M ay be I mig ht h e l p you. You see,
     if you ask, should the gangways be k e p t open, the
     answer must be, if he knows the position, no, b e c a u s e
     there aren't any.   If you w er e to ask him, s h o u ld there
     have been an open g a ngw ay at the back, I think I w o u l d
     Uust about accept that question.

     MR. KING:  Sir, she could use the w o r d access.
Should the access to that point be w ha te ve r.

     THE CORONER:      Yes,   access.   I w o u l d be h a pp y with
that as well.

     MR. KING:  W h a t e v e r is meant b y that,   it is the
means of getting f r om A to B.

     MRS. McBRIEN:  Could I call t he m l a ter al gangways
transversing the terr ac e?

     THE CORONER:  I wo ul d not use the w o r d 'gangway'
at all if I were you because if you do the answer has
got to be no.

    MRS. McBRIEN:  W h y I used that p a r t i c u l a r w o rd is
that I have read it so often in i n f o r m a t i o n I have got.

       MR. CATCHPOLE:      We may have had this be fo re but
the word was used rather loosely at the T ay l o r Inquiry
until evidence was given by I think Dr. E a s t w o o d and
then the Sheffiel d C it y Council that th e re w ere no
gangways in the t ec hni ca l term on that t e r r a c e at which
po i nt the termino l o g y was ti gh t en ed up. So the Taylor
Inquiry is litter e d with reference to g a n g w a y s when in
fact they were not talk ing about g a n g wa y s as we k n o w
them.

            THE CORONER:   Because we ha pp e n to know the
       answer we don't want to fall into the same trap.

            MRS. McBRIEN:   That is where I h av e seen it. I
       have even got the page down, I think, where I have read
       it.

            THE CORONER:   I think Mr. King's word is better
       than mine - use the word access.

 Q*         MRS. McBRIEN:   Do you think that it is important
       to keep the access route leading to the radial gates
       clear at the back of the pens, to ena bl e fans to move
       from side to side easily? - A. There is a problem with
       that, Mrs. McBrien, in that now w it h h i nd s i g h t and
       having seen so many changes, o bvi ous ly that flags up in
       my mind in an ideal world it would be pr ef er ab le for
       those gates to be clear.

Q. Yes, but in fact don't you think that any access
   points, entrance or exit points, need to be in the
   control of somebody inside the Stadium?         They are
   importance places, aren't they, to d i re c t people? - A.
   Yes, I think that now as we have mo ve d on we must look
   very seriously at the safety aspect and consider the
   situation.  I am obviously g en e ra li s in g because I can't
   think of a specific ground at the moment, or what have
   you, but obviously now safety is paramount.

Q.     I remember o n e w i t n e s s saying that at a no th er ground
      there were radial fences with radial gates, and they
      were under Police control, so that sys t em was being
      used somewhere else in that way.           I k n ow no w that there
      are no radial fences at Hi ll sb or o ug h so that problem
      has been alleviated.           Now, still on this I am afraid,
      when the Club s engineer, Dr. Eastwood, constructed the
      radial fences at Hillsborough it was agre ed at the
      Working Party meeting that the rad ia l gates would be
      under Police control on the terrace.            W ere you ever
      aware of that condition? - A. No, I think that at the
      time that was probably discussed, as o pp o s e d to
      whatever else might have happened, a g r ee d to or what
      have you, I wasn t there, and I am s or ry I can't help
      you with regard to that.

Q. Did you h e a r a b o u t it later? I know you would not be
   at that meeting or it would not be a n y t h i n g to do with
   you then, but have you heard about it since?

           THE CORONER:   We are only i n t e r e s t e d in whether
      he knew about it before 15th April *89.           He obviously
      knows about it now, everybody knows ab ou t it now.

                                                    D. G. DUCKENFIELD

Q. Did you know about that before 15th April, 1989? - A.
   No, sir, that was the dilemma.  I have learned about it
   since but I did not know it at the time.

Q*         MRS.   McBRIEN:     Had there been cont ro l    ....

           MR. PAYNE:   I do apologise to Mrs. McBrien for
     interrupting, but it is important that a
     misapprehension, or a m i s- st at em en t does not pass so
     that it then becomes established as if it were a fact.
     I have^looked up the memorand um that Mrs. McBrien is
     referring to and we have, in fact, had evidence about
     that from two sources, one from Dr. Eastwood and the
     other from Mr. Mole, who was also present and is
     mentioned as one of those listed at the top of the
     minute.   Dr. Eastwood gave his evidence about it.        When
     Mr. Mole gave evidence about it he said that the
     reference to control was p ar ti cularly related to the
     introduction of the new gangway, pen 5, that was being
     put in at the time, and that is the context in which
     that point is mentioned so it is important that that is
     seen in perspective.

          MR. CATCHPOLE:   With respect to my learned friend
     that is not actually quite right, beca us e the original
     memo^of 1981 which I am sure you will remember, the
     original stipulation was - there were four
     stipulations, I think - and it was that they should be
     under Police control,  so it is all radial gates if you
     take the two memos together, so Mrs. McBrien is right.

          THE CORONER:   I think thereal issue is what does
     the word control mean and that, of course, is a matter
     of evidence and for the Jury to decide.   I think Mr.
     Payne, that is right actually, there is an earlier
     reference in '81 to control.  Have you found the
     minute?  I can t locate it without searching through
     all my stuff.

          MR. CATCHPOLE:   It is C386 if anyone wants to
     look it up, and it is the memo of 11th September, 1981.
     It is simply that I think Mrs. McBrien was actually
     right but in truth the debate is about what it meant.
     It is the bottom of the first page.

          THE CORONER:       Yes,   (iii),   and that is   '81.

          MR. PAYNE:   That is right.    The min ut e that I was
     referring to is C475 wh ic h is 7th August, 1985.    That
     is where the word control is used in the context that I
     was referring to, that Mr. Mole gave evidence about.

          THE CORONER:    Yes.  You were using the word
     control anyway.   So long as you stick to the word
                                               D. G. DUCKENFIELD

 control, so ^long as you don't say what it means, I
 think that is okay.   The Jury will make up their mind
 what it means, if anything.

      MRS. McBRIEN:   I used       to use the word manned but
 you corrected me and I have       learnt my lesson:

 If there was Police control at the radial gates, or if
 there would have been, they would have been able to
 monitor the numbers going into the pens and monitor the
 behaviour of the fans, wouldn't they?

     THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, you can't say that.
I think you can rephrase the question.  If you say that
you are really saying if it was manned, you are playing
with words.  You may ask this Officer, not that it will
do you any good because it is purely hypothetical, ask
him whether he was aware whether Police Officers were
stationed at those gates.  I think that is the way to
tackle this.

     MRS. M c B R I E N : Mr. Duckenfield, were you aware of
Police Officers being at those radial gates on 15th
April, 1989? - A. No, Mrs. McBrien.

And they were not on the terrace at all, were they,            as
far as you were aware? - A. As far as I am aware.

Did you think that changes needed to be made to the
1989 Operational Order or did you accept it just as it
w a s , c o m p l e t e l y ? - A. I think the situation was, Mrs.
McBrien, that having taken over I was ass ur ed that it
was a tried and tested plan, and that it had worked
very well indeed on the two previous o cc asions and
there was no need to change it, because the view was
that it had worke d before and it would work again.              I
just made minor adjustments in general terms, as I
mentioned yesterday, but matters just about seating
arrangements and minor issues of that order.

So you were not aware that improvements were being made
annually to it?   We have been told that was actually
happening. - A. I am sorry if I misled you.       I think in
general policing terms, whilst I am saying to you that
the plan had not changed, over a number of years any
plan progresses and evolves and minor amendm en ts are
made, but substa nt ia ll y the plan was the same.

Had you studied the Green Guide from cover to cover and
really understood it?

     THE CORONER:   He has answered that question and
said he had not, I think it would be fair to say.

 Q. Were you aware that fans were d i v e rt e d to Leppings Lane
    by the Police?   The ones who wo ul d norm al ly be going in
    through those turnstiles were d i v e r t e d to Leppings Lane
    and they were going to add to the numbers already there?
    Were you aware of that? - A. Can I just clarify that?          I
    may have misunderstood.   Are you sa yi ng that some fans
    who had tickets for turnstiles 77 and 78 at the Penistone
    Road end for the North Stand were b ei n g diverted to the
    Leppings Lane end?

 Q»   This is informati on that I have had at some stage...

           THE CORONER:    We haven't had it, Mrs. McBrien.
      However, you may ask him whether he knows.        If the
      answer is no, then...    If the a n s w er is yes, then we
      will see.

 Q*        MRS. MCBRIEN:    I have come across it at some stage.
      - A. I will answer the question - I didn't know.

 Q. There was a request from S u p e r i n t en de n t Marshall to close
    Leppings Lane to traffic at 2.17, is that right? - A. I
    will not disagree on the closure of Leppings Lane.              Can
    I remind you that Mr. Murray and I d is ag re e about the
    time but the closure of Leppings L ane I will accept.

Q. knatever the time was, you did not c om p ly with that
   request immediately, did you?     Is that right? - A. No.
   Can I explain?     It was a request that I was aware of,
   being in the Control Room.     It was not a decision I
   became involved in because that was a matter of routine
   that would be dealt with by S up er in te nd ent Murray and his
   Control Ro om staff.    To that extent my recollection is
   that because it was a request from Superintendent
   Marshall it was carried out straight away.

Q. When I asked Superintendent Murray about this I asked him
   if he could have advised you, so it seemed to me that you
   were going to make the decision on that, not him? - A.
   Well, can I make it clear?      My u n d e r s t a n d i n g of the
   situation on the day, and of the subseq ue nt evidence, is
   that Superintenden t Marshall asked for the closure of
   Leppings Lane.     That message came into the Control Box
   and it was of the type that would be acceded to by the
   Control Room staff without reference to
   Sup eri ntendent Murray or myself.      N o w you asked me a
   supplementary question on that, did you not?

Q. No, I do not think so, apart from the one relating to
   Superintendent Murray. - A. The s it ua t io n is, if I have
   D8en h e l p f u l , is as I have described#

Q. Perhaps if we go into this in a little detail then.              You
   said yesterday when you heard the request, "What's he
                                                  D. G. DUCKENFIELD

  asking that for?" or somet hi ng on those lines?       - A.
  That's right.

. So you thought that was unusual, is that right? - A.
  Well, it was unusual in this resp ec t in that I did not
  think it probably warra nt ed it b e cau se I saw a bus
  passing and I think the way I d es c r i b e d it, or if I
  didn't yesterday, this was the way I thought about it,
  "Why does he want Leppings Lane c lo sin g when traffic is
  passing?"

. Did you wonder if he could be serious about such a
  request? - A. Well, the situa ti on is that
  Superintendent Marshall, being a very experienced
  Officer, was out on the ground, as it were, standing in
  Leppings Lane and I had d ele ga te d responsibilities to
  Superintendents and he obviously knew what the situation
  was and asked for a course of action.

. As you say you did not see a n y t h i n g unusual then and
  strangely enough, and said this y est erd ay as well, that
  Superintendent Marshall said when he gave his evidence
  that there was nothing unusual h a p pe n in g at the time.
  He said the numbers arrivi ng were about what he would
  expect and the behav io ur of the fans at that time of the
  day was very satisfactory, there were no problems, no
  obvious problems that he could see.

        THE CORONER:    Mrs.   McBrien,    what is the question?

        MRS. MCBRIEN:   I am trying to lead on to it, if I
 may.

        THE CORONER:    Just ask it.

     MRS. MCBRIEN:    S u pe r in te n de nt Murray also said when
he looked on the monitor that he could see no problems
and to close Leppings Lane before a match, that was not
part of the Operati ona l Order, was it? - A. No, but if I
can dr aw attention to what I think I said yesterday, that
no Operational Order can cater for every eventuality and
that is why senior Officers like Superintendent Marshall
were given specific roles to m ak e their own decisions
about their own area.

Do you think it is wise to make any big changes to the
Operational Order, or is it wise to keep quite strictly
to the Order?

     THE CORONER:   No,    I do not       think that is going to
help us, Mrs. McBrien.

     MRS. MCBRIEN:     Well, the c lo s in g of Leppi ngs Lane,
it was not a conti ng en c y plan either, was it? - A. There
                                                        D. G. DUCKENFIELD

 wasn't a specific contingency plan for the closure of
 Leppings Lane but probably I can h ig hl ig h t points that
 have been made before.   It has been put to me and other
 Officers that there are no s pe c if i c contingency plans for
 certain eventualities and the c l o su re of Leppings Lane is
 an example of how we do not have a con ti ng en cy plan, but
 not having one then we act re a so n ab ly and responsibly and
 close Leppings Lane.

. Would you agree that the clos in g of it would be an
  obstruction of the highway?    To close a road off surely
  is an obstruction to traffic using it, isn't it?

        THE CORONER:   No, Mrs. McBrien.          You do not need
 to answer that question.        We k now the Lane was closed.
 We know that Superintendent M ar s ha ll asked for it.        We
 know that Mr. Duckenfield k new of it.           We do not need to
 kn o w whether it was an o b s tr u ct i on to the highway or not.

          MRS. MCBRIEN:            Or whe the r it was an
 i n co n v e n i e n c e . ..

         THE CORONER:             No, we don't need to know any of
 that,    not from Mr.           Duckenfield.

      MRS. MCBRIEN:               What do you think the effect would
 be of closing it?               Have you any idea about what it might
 do ?

         THE CORONER:            To whom?

         MRS. MCBRIEN:    To the f lo w of the fans? - A. As I
 understood it, the closure of Lepp in gs Lane was purely to
 vehicular traffic.       I think I am right in that it was
 never actually closed in totality.         I think the
 d i re ct ive was given to close it, but I h ave a
 recollection that probably buses were allowed to pass
 occasionally.

Yes, I believe they were up to a c e rta in time.      We have
seen photographs of buses b ei n g a ll ow ed through.   I am
 trying to establish the di ff er en t way people would be
coming down. ^ If the traffic was m o v i ng on the road they
would be confined mainly to the pavement.         If the
traffic was taken away they would h av e the whole width of
the pavement and the road in wh i ch to move down so it
would appear that masses would d e v e l o p instead of a line
of people?      That is the effect I see straight away. - A.
I can understand what you are saying but on the day my
view of Leppings Lane was limited to the view on the
m on ito r and I am afraid I can no t take it any further
about that situation.

. When you were looking at the m on it or from the Control Box
  did you notice that large crowds had develo ped outside
  the turnstile area at about 2.30? - A. I find some
  difficulty, Mrs. McBrien, whilst trying to be helpful,
  about large crowds.   Yes, there w er e crowds, but the
  very numbers suggested that we were anticipating 8,000
  people per hour to get to Leppings Lane, so yes, there
  would be crowds.

. At that time, or about that time, di d you look at the
  pens - I am not sure if you said this this morning or
  not.   Did you have a v ie w of the Leppings Lane terrace,
  or choose to look at it at about that time? - A. I think
  I said I would be co nt in ual ly looking around the ground.

. Did you call for any tannoy messa ge s to be given out
  inside the ground at that time?     W he n you looked at the
  terrace did anything come to your mind so that you would
  have to do something to get an even dis tr ib ut io n of fans
  across the terrace? - A. Noth in g comes to mind
  specifically that anything flagged up in my mind that
  there was something dr am atically unusual about the
  terrace.

 Not at 2.30, but you did not give out messages
 encouraging people to spread out? - A. I think at some
 stage in the afternoon I made a pas si ng comment to
 someone about - like other things - "Don't forget to ask
 people to move forward and spread out."

 You do not know when that was? - A. No, I am sorry.            It
 was part of the sort of c o n v er s at i on s that exist in a
 Control Box from time to time over matters, and sometimes
 people make comments such as I did.

 You say there were no tannoy messages? - A. No.      I think
   said that tannoy messages would be given of a general
 nature, but in terms of g i v in g you specific detail, with
 the passage of time I am in some difficulty.

Could I refer to the Taylor...?           No,   I can't.

     THE CORONER:   No, Mrs. McBrien, because Mr. Isaacs
has already indicated that he will not answer the
questions and I think that is p rob ab ly right, at least he
is privileged not to answer.

  ,  MRS. MCBRIEN:   That was quite an important questi on
I nad.   I will leave it.

     MR. KING:   Sir, just to be fair to Mrs. McBrien.
i took the policy decision I did.                In fact unless the
question is potentially i n c r i m i n a t i n g he does not have
the privilege and one does not k now what part of the
                                                    D. G. D U C K E N F I E L D

 transcript Mrs. M c B ri e n is referring to.  She should not
 be misled by me, not by you, sir, into b e l i e v i n g that no
 part of the transcript can be used b ec aus e it may not be
 an incriminating q ues ti on she is asking.

       THE CORONER:       I think that is true.

      MR. ISAACS: Sir, I think the q ue s ti o n was w he th er
the transcript as a whole should or should not be put
and, of course, the observation I made at the outset was
in relation to my advice to Mr. D u ck enf ie ld ^hat if it
was put to him, 'Is this what you said?" he would, as a
matter of^course, say, "I am not going to an sw er that
question.     To that extent it does not really ma tt e r
what is put, he will give that answer, on the a ss umpt io n
that you take the v ie w that the w a rn in g could p rop erly be
given.

     THE CORONER:    I think the point Mr. King is mak in g
is there may be things in the transcript w h i c h are not
incriminating, or not even tending to incriminate,
however broadly you c on str ue it.

        MR. ISAACS:         That may well be right.       The
difficulty then, of course, is not what is a ct ua ll y put,
and in fact it is undoubtedly right.              There is a good
d e a l o f w h a t is in the transcript that...         In fact my
submission would be that none of it is i nc r imi na ti ng, but
it is a policy de c is io n I have taken so far as
M r . Duckenfield is conce rn ed and I have given him that
advice.          The dec i si o n starts, though, w it h a r e fu sa l to
answer any question relating to the accuracy, or
otherwise, of the transcript itself and one does not get
past there.




              MR. KING:       Well,   sir,   I am only   trying.
                                                            D. G. DUCKENFTET.D


      MR. KING:   I am only try in g to h el p Mrs. McBrien.
That cannot be right as a p r o p o s i t i o n of law, sir,
unless one takes as a p r o p o s i t i o n of law that the
question whether you accept a given p a r t of the
transcript, and it would have to be i de nt i fi ed which
part we are refer r in g to, is a p o t e n t i a l l y
incriminating question.     As you know, sir, t he re are
two rules of evidence.     One is the p r i v i l e g e and the
other is where a witness is on O at h b e f o r e you, sir, he
is o bli ged to answer proper r el ev an t qu es ti on s and he
cannot refuse to answer t hem unless t h e y come w it hi n
the privilege.    There is that b a l a n c e and Mrs. M c Br i en
is entitled, therefore, to p ut to you the part she
wants to put and you, sir, co ul d m ak e a ruling.

     THE CORONER: Yes, I think you are right.        Mrs.
McBrien, can you tell me wh ic h p a g e you want me to look
at?

      MRS.    McBRIEN:       Page 14.

     THE CORONER:  Which day?      Can you give your p age
to Mr. Griffiths and I will look and find it?      Yes, it
is Thursday, 25th May.  W h i c h letters are you
interested in so that I can have a look?

     MRS. M c B R I E N :    The ones r e fe r ri ng to the t a n no y
messages.

     THE CORONER:  Yes, but it has got A,                B, C, D, E,
F, G down the margin.

      MR.    KING:    I     suspect it is letter C, sir.

     THE CORONER:      I think that you can look at this.
It is be tw ee n B a nd C, p a ge 14.

     MR. ISAACS:     Sir, in m y submission, if he is going
to be as ke d whethe r that is a cc ur a te then he s ho ul d be
given a warning.

      THE CORONER: Yes, bu t I am just letting h i m look
at   it at the moment. I h ave not yet got as far as
that.

I think it is appr o pr ia t e to give you the w a r n i n g on
this pa rt ic ul ar passage.   It d ep end s h o w far one
goes. - A. Yes.

      THE  CORONER: Mrs. McBrien, shall I ask the first
questio n  bec ause it will be e a si er ? I am just
a ssisting you.
                                                              D. G. PUCKENFIET.D


Q. Subject to that warning that you do not have to answer
   a quest ion which may t e n d to incr im in at e you and, in
   the case of the transcript, that goes not o nly to the
   subject matter but also as to w he t he r or not it is an
   accur at e record of what was said.        You have r ead the
   pa ss age at C on p age 14 of Thursday, 25th May, m or nin g
   session.    The first question, sub jec t to the warning,
   is that an accurate r ep r es en t at i on of the exch an ge
   whic h took place b e twe en you and the q u e s t io n er at that
   Inquiry? - A. Sir, as I u nd er s ta nd it, b a s e d on the
   advice of my legal advi se r and b a s e d on your g u id an ce
   just now I choose to c la i m my p r i v i l e g e in this case.

        THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, you h e ar d that and
   there is no point in asking the next question.         I
   accept that becau se in p r in c ip l e I think that is right.
   People should be all ow ed to exerc is e their privilege.

        MRS. McBRIEN:   I re a li s ed it was an incrim in at in g
   question myself.   In fact, it was quite incriminating.

Q. When you looked at the monitor, you said you were
   c o ns ta ntl y looking at it, is that right? - A. No, I
   think that I was c o n s t an t ly looking at e ver yt h in q there
   was to look at.

Q. So you could have been looking at it at about 2.45, is
   that right, or the rea bo ut s? ~ A. Yes, I w ou l d b e
   glanc ing at it from time to time.     Can I be specific,
   Mrs. Mc Bri en ? Is it the Leppings Lane one that we are
   looking at?

)- Yes, I am sorry.         Let us say it was 2.45 that you h ad a
   look at the monito r and you saw the p e o pl e outside.
   Let me get this right;            d id you think you could
   p o s s i b l y get all the p e o p l e in that you saw there at
   2.45, that you coul d get th em in b y three o'clo ck ? — a .
   I can't say, Mrs. McBrien.              I can't say ac c ur at e ly wha t
   I was thinking about that time.              I was then into the
   midst of the diffic ul t situat io n a nd a ss es s in g many
   things.

. That was very important, w a s n ’t it, w h et h er the numbers
  could get m by three o' c lo c k?      That wo u ld be
  important.     That is s ome thi ng you w o u l d have to
  consider really, w o u l d n ’t it? - A. At 2.45 I c e r ta in l y
  was co nsi der in g many things.    As I have said earlier
  today, I have desc ri b ed the p o s i t i o n as it was at 2.45
  and I was consideri ng m a n y things.

. You wo u ld no doubt have some idea of the rate of flow
  th rough the turnst ile s at that time? - A. I didn 't have
                                                D. G. DUCKENFTET.n


    specific knowledge of the rate of flow of people
    through the turnstiles at that time.

Q. Just by looking at the numbers, would that mean
   anything to you, and the time that you had left? - A. I
   cannot say specifically that I looked at it and made an
   assessment because of other matters I was dealing with.

Q- So obviously you would not consider the possibility of
   delaying the kick-off at that time, would you? - A. I
   think the answer is I did consider delaying the kick-
   off at some stage about that time and when I say about
   that time I am uncertain as I highlighted this morning.

Q. That was a decision you could have taken at any time? -
   A. The decision to delay kick-off can be taken at any
   time.

Q. Could I ask why you didn't? - A. I think I referred to
   this earlier in that when I was considering it as a
   very serious option, it was when a, shall I use the
   word, crisis was developing for want of a better word
   at the moment.   I looked through the window, and I
   think I described this yesterday, and I saw a half
   circle of what I thought were press photographers at
   the tunnel and I was then considering the situation and
   as I looked to my right something triggered off in my
   mind that the players had come out on to the pitch or
   were coming out on to the pitch and I subsequently
   found out that that probably wasn't right with my time
   sequence and if I go back to what I said yesterday, was
   that whilst you can always delay kick-off there are
   considerations to make.   Those considerations I think I
   went through were that if the players are on the pitch,
   whilst it is not the ultimate end to delaying a kick-
   off it does present you with other problems that I
   highlighted yesterday.   That is why at that stage I
   decided that weighing up the problems that would ensue
   from delaying kick-off in the ground — and I hope you
   will forgive me by not highlighting every one as I did
   yesterday - as opposed to being able to concentrate on
   one end of the ground at Leppings Lane.   That is why I
   decided not to.

Q. If you decided not to delay the kick-off and let us say
   it is still 2.45 and you decided, "No, I am not going
   to do that", don't you think the position out there
   would automatically get worse as people added to the
   crowd outside? - A. I am sorry, would you mind
   repeating that again please?

Q- If at 2.45 you decided that there was no necessity to
   delay the kick-off, do you think the problem you had
                                                                                 72

                                                               D. G. DUCKENFIKT.n


    outside there in Leppi ng s Lane w ou l d a u t o m a t i c a l l y qet
    worse if more pe o p l e added to that crowd and the
    press ure wou ld au t o m a t i c a l l y get greater, w o u l d n ' t it?
    The more people that came along then the g r e a t e r the
    pr ess ure there? - a . We were expecting a f lo w of p eo p le
    through those turnstiles, Mrs. McBrien, and n u mb er s do
    tend to increase a pp roa ch in g kick-off.

Q. Yes, but you al re a d y had a p r ob l em there of p e o p l e
   press in g forward.    They were anxious o b v i o u s l y to get
   in by a certain time.        They were running out of time
   and so they wo u ld b ec o m e anxious, w o ul dn 't they, and
   this could b eco me quite a dangerous s it ua t io n if m or e
   people came along and put more p r es su re in that area? -
   A. It could becom e a problem.

Q. Do you know if ta n n o y messa ge s were given out in that
   part of the groun d to advise pe op le to m ove b a ck or
   something of that nature? - A. I am led to b e l i e v e they
   were b u t _whether that is with in my pe rs o na l k n o w l e d g e
   at the time or wh e t h e r that is knowle dg e that has come
   to me su bsequentl y b ut I u n de rst an d that t a n n o y
   messages were giv en out.

Q. That would be ver y d if fi cu l t to achieve, for p e o p l e to
   actually move back, if they w an t ed to get in b y k i c k-
   °  ' wouldn't it?   It w ou ld n' t achieve much.

        THE CORONER:        I do not think that is a p r o f i t a b l e
   line and it is nea r l y three or thereabouts a nd we will
   stop for ten m i n u t e s .

. Because it was part of the Op er ational Order, of
  course, wasn t it? - A. Taken in general terms, what
  you have said to me is what I said yesterday generally.

. And you weighed that p os si bi l it y of them getting into
  the Ground against the po ss ib i li t y of people being
  injured outside?   They were the issues, weren't they? -
  A. The issues were, as you know quite clearly, I was
  faced, Mrs. McBrien with one of two decisions, and the
  decisions as you well know were either if you don't
  open the gates people are going to get killed, so in
  view of that information I made a judgment and decided
  to open the gates.   My i nf ormation was that had I not
  done that then people would be killed outside.

. Yes, I appreciate it was diffi cu lt and there could have
  been a possibility, I do ap pre ci at e that, but these
  people obviously just needed space, didn t they?      If
  they were in difficulties of being crushed outside, or
  wherever people are being crushed, the thing that they
  require is space? - A. Yes, and I thought I gave them
  that space.

 Yes, you said that by opening the gates they would go
 into the concourse area, which was a large area where
 you thought they would dispe rs e? - A. Yes.

 Now, the way I see this, the action could have been
 excused, the opening of the gate, if those fans outside
 were entering into a large open field, and in those
 conditions then I could see the sense of it ....

      THE CORONER:    No, Mrs. McBrien, we are not having
 speeches or your thoughts as to the excuses or
 otherwise, or disse rt at io ns on fields or anything else.
 You can ask a question.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   The fans w ere going into a
concourse area though, weren't they? - A. Yes.

Now, that was not the viewing area for the match, was
it? - A. No, it was not.

That was only an area that they were passing through to
go to where they were ultimat el y going to end up? - A.
Yes, it was.

And so it would mean very little to them.   What they
would want to do was get to their viewing position by
the quickest access route surely, wasn't it? - A. I am
not so sure I can answer that.   I would have thought
that was speculative.  Yes, they do want to get into
the Ground.                                  &
                                                    D. G. DUCKENFIELD


That was what was obvious, the way they were behaving
outside it showed   they w e r e very anxious to get in by
Kick-off,   so they would still be anxious to get to
their viewing spot, even w he n they came in through the
gate?   A. I don't think I accepted that as a premise.
I think I have answered that earlier today and given mv
thoughts on the matter.

kould you agree that if a large crowd comes in all at
once it is far easier to go with the crowd, even if you
are ^going    a l o n g a little street in Sheffield it is
easier to     keep in the d i re c t i o n those people are going,
rather than try to go to the right, to the left or
t,u r n * . can be very d i f fi cu l t in a large crowd? - A.
Not wishing to be difficult, it does depend on
circumstances.       People can be carried on with other
people but some people can move away.            It is
speculation, Mrs. McBrien, and I find it difficult.            I
wasn t down there at those gates.

                                                         D. G. DUCK E N F I E L D

Q.       ^ HRS. MCBRIEN:        We know there was a possibility of
       i n j u ries^outside the ground, but that was only a
       possibility, wasn't it?       It was not a reality.   Inside
       the ground there were casualties...

           THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, that is neither a
      question nor is it correct.   Move on to your next
      question, or it is only correct with hindsight.

Q*        MRS. MCBRIEN:    Mr. Duckenfield, you thought it was
      reasonably safe to open the gate and let those people in?
               THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, Mr. D u c k enfield has
      g i v e n you his reply several times.   Please move on to a
      question which advances these Inquests.

Q*         MRS. MCBRIEN:   When the people who came into the
      concourse area, once they got into that area, if we could
      look at the Green Guide, page 23, paragraph...

           THE CORONER:       No, Mrs. McBrien, he did not look at
      the Green Guide b e f o r e h a n d and he does not have to look
      at it now.

                MRS. MCBRIEN:     Sir, this is a vital point.

          .THE CORONER:           It is not a vital point if he did not
      see it.

     i• t.*.i .M C B R I E N :
     little while?
                                  Is it all right if I sit down for a

             THE CORONER:      No, Mrs. McBrien, we will pause at
     tive minutes to four and then you can sit down.         What
     p ara g r a p h was it that you were asking him to look at in
     the Green Guide?

            MRS. MCBRIEN:         I really need to sit down.

            THE CORONER:         Very well.   What paragraph?

               MR. CATCHPOLE:            It was page 23, and I would imagine
     it was paragraph 54.                 The difficulty of it, sir, is it
     is under chapter 6.                 It is in relation to egress and it
     is concerned with f u n n elling effects, about people
     c o n v e r g i n g on n a r r o w means of access or egress.   It is
     egress time as o p p o s e d to entrance time.           Of course, it
     is the reverse s i t u a t i o n here, sir.         Perhaps it is not
     even quite on the point of opening gates...

           MR. KING:      Sir, to be fair to Mrs. McBrien, she may
 not have been p u t t i n g to the witness, "Did you read this
 at t h e t i m e you made your decision?"             She may be
 r e f e r r i n g to his e v i d e n c e that he had read and therefore
                                                                               84
                                                        D. G. D U C K E N F I E L D

  would know of a certain matter.  I don't know.                      Sir, I
  am not sure what she was trying to put.
      THE CORONER:          I know, that is the difficulty.
 What page was it?

      MR. CATCHPOLE:   Page 23, paragraph 54.    It
 actually is quite detailed.    It also deals with holding
 capacities as well in r elation to reservoir areas.
      THE CORONER:         Which paragraph is it you are after.
 Mrs. McBrien?

        MRS. MCBRIEN:        P a r a g r a p h 55.

        THE CORONER:       I want to be as helpful as I can to
 you.

      MR. MANNING:   Might we give Mrs. McBrien five
 minutes, sir, on the basis that not only does she try                       and
 do things that...

        THE CORONER:       Yes, OK.
        MR. MANNING:       I was going to sa y with the caveat
 that part of the frustration, as we probably know, is
that she really has been for the las t twenty minutes
 asking question after question, and it has been covered
at least twice, and that is the frus tration.             I am all
for allowing her to compose herself because it is very
dis t r e s s i n g and it is p r obably the 1 ast chance she is
going to have to make a statement or to try to put her
case, which is w hat you h a v e been tr ying to find out,
w hat exactly she is trying to put to the Chief
Superintendent.

     THE CORONER:   You h ave persuaded me.                 We will have
a break for ten minutes.

                       (Short a d j o u r n m e n t )
        THE CORONER:      Yes, Mrs. McB r i e n .

         MRS. MCBRIEN:     Mr. Duckenfield, it was up to you to
d o the directing that day, wasn't it?        You had the
co m m a n d i n g role? You were in charge? - A. I was the
overall Police Commander.

Y o u had an emergen cy situation there at one stage? - A.
At the time of 2.40 or 2.52?      Do you mean o u tside the
gates?

O u t s i d e the gate you had an emergency situ a t i o n and you
a lso had one inside? - A. Yes, I did.
                                                                                  85
                                                           D. G. D U C K ENFIELD

 Q. Did you do anythi ng immediately about the one inside?
    As soon as it was r e alised that s omething was really
    w r o n g did you act immediately on what you saw? - A. I
    a c t e d immediately the request was made.

 Q. Do you think the main thing was to get the fans out of
    that area?        That was the main c o n s i d e r a t i o n - out of the
    c e n t r e pens? - A. I am sorry, I am confused.               Are you
    no w asking me about getting the fans out of the centre
    pens?

 0. Yes. - A. Yes.        As soon as the situation was realised a
    r e s c u e attempt was mounted.

 Q. H o w d i d you go about doing that? - A. All available
    O f f i c e r s were sent to the Leppings Lane terrace.
 Q. Did you put out a tannoy message at that time to let
    p e o p l e in the stadium k now what the situation was, to be
    h e l p f u l to everybody in the stadium? - A. No. At that
    stage there was no tannoy message to say specifically
    what the situation was.

 Q. So people could be very confused if nobody told them
    e x a ctly what was happening, especially the p e o p l e at the
    N o t t ingham Forest end?   They would not know what was
    g o i n g on, would they? - A. Well, at the time, I thought
    the decision was correct, but I have learned later that,
    yes, there was some confusion caused to the Notts. Forest
    fa n s .

Q. T h e r e could be conf u s i o n even on the other side, could
   there not?         People may not be r emaining as c alm as they
   w o u l d be if they heard somebody giv i n g that m e s s a g e over
   the tannoy system? - A. I think you are right in that
   like I have said previously, there are things for a
   c e r t a i n course of action and things against.       In the
   h e a t of the moment, shall we say, or in the e n ormity of
   the situation, it is very difficult to balance and I made
   c e r t a i n judgments w h i c h I thought to be correct at the
   time.

Q. Yo u agree w ith me that the main thing was to get the
   p e o p l e out.  Did you immediately send for c u t t i n g
   e quipment t o g e t that perimeter fence down? -A. As soon
   as the enormity of the situation was discovered and I
   cal l e d for Opera t i o n Support, I then reeled off a stream
   of instructions of various things and at some stage
   somebody m entioned cutting equipment.         Now I do not know
   wh o that was but that was authorised.

Q. W hat t i m e w a s that done? How soon was it? - A. I am in
   s o m e ^ d i f f i c u l t y in giv i n g you an acc u r a t e time. If you
   can imagine that as soon as you r e alise what you have,
                                                                             86

                                                        D. G. DUCKENFIELD

     then you start issuing instructions.       In isjuing those
     in structions Policemen around you h ave to carry them out
     and then relay them to individuals, so I do not know
     e x a ctly what time I issued instructions and I am afraid I
     cannot tell you exactly what time they were carried out.
     My belief is that we did things as quickly as possible.
 Q. You^ were aware that the Fire B r i g a d e would have the
    facilities to cut the fence down? -A. Yes.
 Q. So it was to the Fire Brigade that you needed to make
    your request? - A. Yes, but can I d r a w a distinction?
    At some stage, because there is a Police garage nearby at
    Clay Wheels Lane, I had got the impression that someone
    made a request for cutting equipment and Clay Wheels Lane
    was mentioned.              That was supplementary to possibly the
    Fire Brigade.              Probably someone in their wisdom thought
    that - I don t know, I am spec u l a t i n g - but that the Fire
    Brigade would come quickly with the equipment, but
    n e v e r t h e l e s s there was a Police gar a g e nearby and "Let's
    get their equipment and let's use that as well."
Q. Did c u t t i n g equipment arrive at some stage? - A. Now I
   p e r s o n a l l y cannot tell you if c u t t i n g equipment arrived.
Q. Whether it did or it did not, there were other means of
   g e t ting the people out of those pens, wasn't there, by
   getting them out from the back? - A. Yes.       I think there
   has been e vidence of people assisting to remove people
           the b ack of the tunnel and also from the pens.
Q. Once you h a v e an emergency situation, the slower the
   process of emptying the pens, the m ore likelihood there
   is of more injuries? - A. Yes, I suppose that whilst
   people are crushed...       I did not go down there,
   Mrs. McBrien, so I find some difficulty, but I agree in
   princ i p l e that speed in removal of people is essential.
Q. So a tannoy m e ssag e could have been given out for people
   to move out of those centre pens and go out of the tunnel
   a l t o g e t h e r so that the injured peop l e could be rescued?
   That is right, isn t it? -A. I am sorry if I misled you.
     t is my belief that tannoy messages w ere given to ease
   D3 C K •


  But not to that effect, for people to actually move out?
  io ease back, they may only go a bit further back on the
  terrace.         To go out of the tunnel al t o g e t h e r was what
  was needed so that Police Officers and rescuers could eo
  down to the front of the pens so that they would have
  easi e r access? - A. I have a r e c o l l e c t i o n of two things
     5r a t ur e S 5 ? C t » one of which is S u p e r intendent Greenwood
  on the hoardings trying his best to indicate to people to
  ease bac*.           I am sure in my r e c o l l e c t i o n that if I did
                                                     D. G. DUCKENFIELD

 not give the instruction, that s omebody was doing it on
 the tannoy equipment.   Now I must admit I cannot recall
 exactly what was said, but it is my belief that that sort
 of action was being taken.

 You gave no infor mation of a general type to the fans
 from about five past three until quarter to four, did
 you?    No g e neral announcement was made, was it? - A.
 No, I did not make a general announcement.

 When it finally was made at four o ' c l o c k I believe the
 fans then did behave extremely well and they left the
 stadium quietly.

     THE CORONER:        Mrs. McBrien, that is outside our
time limit and it is not likely to have made any
differ e n c e ho w the fans behaved at four o'clock.   I'm
sorry.

     MRS. MCBRIEN:           At what time did you see the young
man you d e s c r i b e d who was hobbling and dra g g i n g his leg
and flopping down by the goalpost?                 What time was that?
- A. I don't know, Mrs. McBrien.               Can I just set the
scene?     Times that day, I have no concept of times.                  It
may be d i f f i c u l t for people to a p p r e c i a t e that situation,
but once the situa tion developed time was marching and I
had no concept of time.

You had no idea whatsoever when you saw that young man? -
A. No.     The diffi c u l t y I face is that I remember vividly
c e rtain things, but times,        they don't m ean anything.    I
don t mean that...            It is just that in an event of that
nature time goes on         and you are caught up in it.
I just want to put this to you, Mr. Duckenfield.         Taking
into account all the dangers there were of opening the
gates and a l l o w i n g large numbers into the ground,
u nlimited numbers in an uncontrolled way, you were wrong
to give that order to open the gates?
      THE CORONER:   I just did not hear.  I am not
s topping you, but I did not hear the last few words.
     MRS. MCBRIEN:          You were wrong to give the order in
that...   W h a t e v e r you want to ans w e r to that that is
what I feel.




         Q. TH E CORONER:        This is an
                                                           P. G. DUCKENFTRT.n


       THE CORONER:         This is an i n c r i m i n a t i n g point so
 you m ust c o n s i d e r your answer. - A. Can I just c l a ri fy
 then? B a s i c a l l y you are saying I was w r o n g to give the
 order to o p e n the gates?

      MR. KING:          I think what Mrs. M c B r i e n said was that
 it was w r o n g to allow the people in, a large number of
 people, u n l i m i t e d people, uncontrolled.        Those were her
 words, sir.

      THE CORONER:        Let Mrs. McBrien r e p h r a s e the
 question.

 eir
       MR. KING:      I think she has got it w r i t t e n down     9


      THE CORONER: Just ask the qu e s t i o n again so that
 we can m a k e sure you have got it ho w you want it.

      MRS. McBRlEN:  I ma y have added a bit when I was
 saying it but this is what I had w r i t t e n here.

         t0 y O U ' M r ‘ D u c k enfield, that t a k i n g into account
the dangers in o p e ning the gates and a l l o w i n g in large
numbers, that is, u n l i m i t e d numbers into the g r o u n d in
an u n c o n t r o l l e d wa y you were wrong to g ive the order to
open the gates. That is what I am p u t t i n g to you? - A.
      **c B r i e n ' 1 was faced w i t h the s i t u a t i o n that if I
didn t open the gates then people w o u l d be killed
outside.

       MRS. McBRIEN:      Thank you.

-t-u-        C0R0NER: M r • Isaacs, w o u l d you p r e f e r to go
this a f t e r n o o n or w o u l d you rather start in the
m orning?

      MR. ISAACS: This afternoon, sir.       I have not v ery
long.   I t h i n k we have gone through this now so m any
times that th e r e is v ery little.

     THE CORONER:        I am quite happy.        it is entirely
your choice.                                                       J
     ip. ISAACS: I d o not know, sir, if you have any
questions f r o m the Jury b e f o r e I start.
       THE CORONER:     Yes, the J ury h ave some.
                      Further b v THE C O R d n f p

    5 irSt question, and these are p o i n t s the Jury have
asked me to ask you, w h y were m any of the Officers on
                                                                                         89

                                                                       D. G. DUCKENFIELD


      d uty that day from outside the S h e f f i e l d area, eg,
      B a r n s l e y an d Doncas t e r ? - A. Sir, the Police Force in
      S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e in round figures is alm o s t 3,000 in
      total and we need e d 800 Police Officers solely to
      p o l i c e the ground.         The only w a y of a c h i e v i n g that
      num b e r is to call on the resources from t h r o ughout the
      Force area.             You will also bear in m i n d that we were
      l i m i t e d in exp e r t areas and we call e d on m o u n t e d
      Off i c e r s I think from N o t t i n g h a m and Liver p o o l whic h
      were helpful.

 Q. The s u p p l e m e n t a l to that one is that these away
    Of f i c e r s particularly, how familiar w ere they w ith
    H i l l s b o r o u g h and w ith big matches in g e n e r a l ? - a . The
    w a y I can de s c r i b e it is this; that the specific
    c a p a b i l i t i e s of individuals at the lower ranks I am not
    aware of bu t I think Mr. Mole stated that Officers who
    were in areas of importance, shall we say, he had
    i n t r o d u c e d w h a t he called a commu n i t y p o l i c i n g
    p r o g r a m m e at the football g r o u n d so that the same
    Off i c e r s w i t h local knowledge w o u l d p o l i c e those areas
    on e v e r y occasion. So in general terms the regular men
    w h o p o l i c e d it regu l a r l y were in their r e gular         spots
    d oing t h e i r r e g ular job.

Q. S u p p l e m e n t e d by others? - A. Yes, from other areas but
   the s u p p l e m e n t a r y being that we r e c r u i t e d Liverpool
   m o u n t e d Off i c e r s to police the L i v e r p o o l fans at the
   L i v e r p o o l e n d so that there were some r e l a t i o n s h i p and
   Notts the same.

Q. Before the 1989 Semi Final were you you r s e l f b r i e f e d by
   anyone b e a r i n g in m i n d that you had not ha d m uch
   e x p e r i e n c e of p o l i c i n g H i l l s b o r o u g h at that p o i n t in
   t ime? - A. No, sir.                   The only b r i e f i n g s were the
   d i s c u s s i o n s w i t h Mr. Mole.       I am sorry, let me just
   c l a r i f y that.         The meeting that I a t t e n d e d on the 22nd
   March, I t h i n k I am right, w i t h Mr. Mole.                      I had a
   d i s c u s s i o n w i t h Mr. Mole in g e n e r a l terms some time
   later.

Q. A p a r t f r o m that no specific b r i e f s ? - A. No.

Q. In the briefings, not your briefings, w h a t situation s -
   I think I w i l l rephrase this que s t i o n     b e c a u s e I think I
   k n o w what the J ury are getting at. In y o u r briefings
   or any b r i e f i n g s w h i c h you were aware of w h i c h were
   g i v e n to the people, were the conditions, if any,
   r e g a r d i n g the delay in k i ck-off dealt w i t h ? - A. No, I
   d o n ' t think t hey were, sir.

Q.    Is that b e c a u s e the decision of d e l a y i n g kic k - o f f was       a
     c o m m a n d d e c i s i o n ? - A. V e r y m u c h so.
                                                    D. G. DUCKENFIELD



. I will ask this question but I think we actually know
  the answer. Do you know what time elapsed from when
  you saw Superintendent Greenwood waving on the fence to
          actually ran on to the pitch to stop the match
  and did you actually see him wave? Perhaps I should
  actually ask you that first.  Mr. Murray saw him but
  did you see him? - A. The difficulty is, sir, I have a
  belief I saw him. At the time in April 1989 your
  thoughts are clear but with so much passing I had a
  belief I saw him but I most certainly remember seeinq a
  man running on to the pitch to stop the game.

. Have you got any idea of what the time interval was’ -
  A. No, I am sorry, sir, I can't help you.

      THE CORONER:  If I can just turn to you, ladies
 and gentlemen, in fact when Mr. Greenwood gave evidence
 Mr. Russell took him through a whole load of
 photographs and if the photograph is correct where
 there is some movement you can work it out to the
 second because we know what time the match was stopped.

 Had you any previous experience of writing or givinq
 briefings for football matches? - A. I don't think I
  ad ever - I had written them - I wouldn't say I had
 written them.  I had done them before but it is a lonq
            It.is something I can't be specific about.
 I had done briefings for other matters but of this
 nature, of this magnitude, this was the first one.

 If you did not notice any injuries until after the
 match had stopped which I think is what you have said
 is it not? - A. Yes.

Why had you previously requested operational support’
I am not sure whether the Jury have got this right.   Do
y°u remember when you requested operational support? -
A. Yes, I do actually, not in terms of time, but I have
a recollection and this might sound strange.  I have
got a recollection of calling operational support by
virtue of what I felt and there was one thought I might
have jumped the gun if you can understand the
expression.  I thought I might have reacted.  I think
it was then simultaneously I thought, "Oh, I have
obviously made the right decision".

Was it before the match had finished or after so far as
^ * ? ? n+£emem?eJ?
recall              r A‘ 1 can,t
         the match starting.       tel1 y°u/ sir.     I don't

What was it - this is not on here but I will ask it -
that sparked the need for operational support and that
                                              P. G. DUCKENFIELD


 is an incriminating question by the way? I do not say
 tend but^you know what I mean. - A. It is difficult,
 sir, isn't it? As a Policeman you look at situations
 and you assess them.  I don't know.  Sometimes you do
 things because you do them, don't you? That seems a
 Pretty poor answer in the circumstances but I can't
 give you a better answer.

. You told us I think in passing that you went to the
  Directors box.   I asked you did you stay in the
  Control Room and you said you stayed.   It was not the
  box but the Directors' room. What time was that can
  you remember? - A- The only reason I know is probably
  because Superintendent Murray, was it yesterday, said
  that he came back to the Control Box about 3.30. So I
  presume I left when everything was running and I was
  available to leave which was probably...

 In fact that is the question. Why did you g o there if
 there was an emergency situation? - A. I didn't.
 Basically what happened was that the organisation was
 set up and I had a message, and it was some time later
 when things were organised, and it wasn't a case of
 leaving a situation.  Obviously I left the Control
 Box - it is arguable, isn't it - but it wasn't as
 critical and Superintendent Murray came back.

Can you give any explanation to the Jury as to why you
were not able to form an opinion about what was
occurring until after five past three? - A. No, if you
can imagine you are standing in a Control Box looking
out of a window at a situation and you look at
something and a gate opens, a gate opening in itself is
not unusual with the odd fan coming out and then it was
a case of "What's the situation here?" and it was a
progression from that and that is how I saw it.

When you wrote your briefing notes did you show them to
anyone with more experience for their opinion on
them? — A. No, I didn't, sir, actually.

Before the Semi Final took place did you consider
perhaps taking a back seat whilst somebody else with
more experience ran the show on this occasion? - A. My
view was that I had been given an assurance that the
  jn.^aS a 9°od one' the team was the best available,
and the ground was safe as I said and so with that
knowledge of a safe ground, a good team and a good plan
that was the situation.

Just one other question I have on the issue of
contingencies,  you have mentioned reserve serials and
things of that nature.  What in fact were they there
                                                               92

                                                D. G. DUCKENFIELD

  for? - A. There are several reasons really.  For
 instance, to give a for instance, we have mentioned
 that probably people come from Barnsley or Rotherham
 and it may well be at Barnsley or Rotherham they miqht
 have a major incident such as a murder, a rape or
 something else, and they just automatically remove from
 our operation men from their local area to deal with a
   ocal problem.  As a result, we need a reserve serial
 to bring in. That is one of the situations.    If we
 find that there is a need for something on the day
 then we have spare men.   In addition to that when you
 have 800 people it is distinctly possible somebody will
 go sick with flu, or, not so much on Saturdays, people
 can get called away to other jobs, sickness and what
 have you. So things do tend to vary and you need
 reserve serials for the most wide-ranging of
 eventualities.

      THE CORONER:   Thank you.   Mr. Isaacs, would you
 start?

     MR. ISAACS:  Sir, on one of the points from the
Jury, there was some evidence from Superintendent
Greenwood about the briefing notes and I think he said
in evidence that the briefing he heard given by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield was what he would have
expected to hear.

     THE CORONER:    Yes.

               Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS

Mr. Duckenfield, may I deal with the matters that I
want to ask you about in two ways, first of all,
dealing with the Operational Order and before the game
and then about the game and I shall deal with them

      MR. ISAACS:    I was unfair to ray learned friend,
 Mr. Payne.   I have discussed the matter with him.      He
 is going to be a lot shorter than I had envisaged.      I
 was hopeful, having heard that, that we may well finish
 if we do it in the way you suggested, namely, that each
 person has their go, in the day.    I hope that is the
 case.

      THE CORONER:   Do you think if I allowed two days
 for the legal submissions, namely, Tuesday and Wednesday
 - I am not saying we are going to take that long - but
 are you going to exceed that period of time?

      MR. PAYNE:    I should think it is very unlikely.
 To be const ructive and helpful in view of the way the
 timetable seems to be going, what I would respectfully
 suggest is that it might be appropriate to put in any
 written submissions that there are before the weekend.

     THE CORONER:   That would be very helpful because I
could read them over the weekend.

         MR. PAYNE:    I am grateful to that indication.   Now
that being so it will be nece ssary before the written
submiss ions go in to ask you for a ruling as to the
extent of the submissions.        We will need to allocate a
little time to do that before we know h ow much we are
a l l ow ed to put in.    I do not think it will be a very
difficult ruling myself but it is something which we do
need to get a decision about.

     THE CORONER:   I think it is quite difficult,
actually, but be that as it may.   I will come back to
that, Mr. Payne.

      Any thing else on the general point about the timing
 for the legal submissions?     What I want to do is that 1
want to send the Jury out on Mond ay week because I do not
want to put them under time pre ssure to reach their
conclusions.      I want them to feel that if need be they
can overshoot and spend the night somewhere.      Hopefully
they will not overshoot another night, but in fact there
is space, if you like, in the wee k for them to do that.
I would prefer, if I possibly can, send them out sometime
on the Monday morning, which means if we can get our
submissions done on Tuesday and Wednesday, I can start on
my summing-up on Wednesday and Thursday, then I think we
should be on target with timing and we should finish
these Inquests before Easter in fact.      That is what I
want to do.     Is that acceptable?    Does that sound
reasonable?     Nobody has got any complaint about that?
           Does anybody want to address me on the point
 Mr. Payne has raised, namely, where do you draw the line
 b e t w e e n questions of fact and issues of law?

       MR. PAYNE:   Sir, what I would respectfully suggest
 1 s that the best use of time, certainly from my point of
 view, would be if I were to invite you over the
 adjo urnment tonight to re-read and remind yourself about
 the case of Queen and Galbraith, of which I can hand in a
 copy which,. as I understand it, is the most up-to-date
 r uling about the relevant considerations where there is a
 su bmission of no case to answer, wh ich seems to be the
 appropriate criteria.

      THE CORONER:      Have you a copy of that?

      MR. PAYNE:   I have got a copy and perhaps if I put
 that in overnight, the submissions could be more direct
 and to the point.

      THE CORONER:     Yes, we can deal with them tomorrow.

      MR. KING: ^ Can I just say, and it is no fault of
 anybody s, but it is now five minutes to five, sir, and       I
 for one am in certain professional difficulties now.

     THE CORONER:    Yes, fair enough.   We will conclude
the matter tomorrow.    We have got Friday in hand,
anyway.

          MR. CATCHPOLE:       Sir, can I mention very briefly,
tne Zeebrugge case, ex parte Spooner, may also be of some
a s s i s t a n c e to you, since it cert ainly contemplates
submissions of the kind I think my learned friend
Mr. Payne is referring to.            It may be worthwhile
r e f reshing your memory.

     THE CORONER:   I have got a copy of that.   The
other one which you mentioned, Mr. Payne, I haven't got a
copy of.

     MR. PAYNE:   Have you got a copy of the decision of
the judge in the case Mr. Catchpole is refer ring to?

     TH E CORONER:     Mr. Justice Turner do you mean?     I
think I have.

     MR. PAYNE:      Yes, his decision on Day 20.

     THE CORONER:      I have got something.

     MR. PAYNE:      I have got a spare copy of that as
well.

      T w i l T HK C 0R°NER:  y ° u could let me have a spare copy
      I will be able to tell straight away whether I have
      already seen that.

            MR. KING:    Given it is a legal matter, sir, I have
      succe ^ yingT t0 trace a copy of that for some time without
      success.    I wonder if possibly I could have a copy a l s o ’

      that?THE C0R0Ni:'R:            M r * p a yne, you would not object   to

             MR.    KING:     I am obliged,     sir.

             MR. PAYNE:    If submissions are going to be out in

             T 7, CORONER
                  CORONER: I think Mr. King is merely               saying he
      would like to read the Judgment.                                   S

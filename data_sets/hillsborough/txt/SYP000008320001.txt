            I reside at the above address with my mother and father and I am a

            single     person.

               am employed on a full time basis                          by SheC-tf'ield Wednesday

            Football Club at their Hil ls bo ro ug h ground.               I have been employed in

            this     capacity for two          (2) years and at the present time         I work    in the

            Siverside Suite and Steps Resi-a<frant.

            I remember Saturday 15 April               1989 (150489), and on this day my hours

            of duty were Sam            (0800)    until about 9.00pm     (2100>.   I arrived at the

            g round at about 7.30am              (0730 > from the Leppi ngs Ln e n d .    I walked

            along     the walkway separating the River Don from the exterior ground

            wall.      I don't        recall   seeing any other     people about at this time and I

            d o n ’t think there were any parked cars               in the area.    I walked along

            the     path and when I reached the steps to the Restaurant                  I was
                                                                                     /PAGE
                                                                                      *n*-v.*•},j
                                                                                     q /36

approached by two middle aged Liverpool               supporters.     They asked me

where the ticket office w a s .          I told them where       it was but said that

it probably w o u l n ’t be open./ They told me that the Manager of the

football      ground,   Graham H X C K R E L L , had arranged for them to collect

their tickets f r o m ^ h ^ / o f f i t e and at this the two men walked away.

The    rest of the morning was tied up with my chefs duties and I did not

have occasion to go into the football              pitch area or the Leppings Ln

area of the ground.

At about       1.00pm   <1 3 00 ) this date I walked into one of the gangway

areas    in the South Stand and I looked into the ground.                 I have marked

this    position on the ground plan Al and I now produce this exhibit no.

r e f . no.

At this time I can say that there were very f^ew spectators                  in the

ground a nd these were sparsely scattered about                 the various stands.                 1

did not notice any heavy build up of fans                  in the Leppings Ln end pens.

After a few minutes         I returned to the kitchens and I was engaged

preparing meals.

At about 3 . 05pm       (1 5 0 5 ) somebody came   into     thekitchens and said        the

pitch was being         invaded.     1 walked out in        the South Stand to   a

location 1' have pinpointed B 1 on the ground plan.                 I saw that the

Yearns were still        playing football and that there were           large groups of

Liverpool       spectators on trie grassed area behind the Leppings j/n and

goals.        I also saw a Istrge number of fans           climbing over t h y fence from

Pens 3 and 4 onto tp4 pitch area.              In my opinion thes£~ pens were not

overcrowded and j / t h o u g h t   the fans were playing about.          I did not

think there was need for            concern at this stage so I returned          to the

kitchen and continued with my work.

At about 3.20pm         (1520)   I went downstairs        to the kitchen and I learnt

from other members of staff that spectators had been killed in the

ground.        I then made my way to position Cl on the ground plan and I
                                                                                         PAGE     3

           stood there for about fifteen minutes.             liy initial   reaction was one of

           amazement.        There were   injured persons    lying about everywhere and

           everywhere seemed to be in chaos.            liy attent io n was draw*t

           specific       instances,   one being where a man dressed i 13/

           resus c i tat i on ■   He carried on this treatment      for about two or three

           minutes       before stopping and placing a blanket over his head.           This

           person was       left for a few minutes before being taken away on a

           makeshift stretcher by supporters to the Spion Kop area.

           The other instance of note was seeing four young              children aged about

           ten to twelve years of age and they were             carrying the injured to the

           Spion Kop area.         The boys were very upset and tearful        but doing a very

           brave act.

           I again       returned to the kitchen and the staff were         instructed by an

           unknown person to take water bandages and towels to the pitch area

           where the injured were be i ng t r e a t e d W e     then car r ied these articles

           onto the pitch and left them in tj?fe area of the Leppings Ln goal mouth.

           I saw a large number of injure,# and dying persons on the grass and

           they were being treated by           mixture of St. Johns Ambulance men,

           spectators and Police Orfli c e r s .      I cannot describe any of the deceased

           or injured as after that         I ran backwards and forwards with water and

           bandages.

           I would estimate that          I in particular made four trips to the pitch and

           I would estimate that fifteen to twenty other members of the

           Restaurant staff made a similar number of journeys.

           Water was being        carried in pans,   buckets,   stainless steel    containers,

           anything that would hold water.           There was quite a large amount of

                                                                                         S736

          towels and oven cloths taken over but the first aid kit we took was

          only the contents of the kitchen first aid kit.

          At about 4.OOpm     (1600) we had run out of arti cles to take to the pitch

          so 1 again stood at position Cl.            By this time things seemed more

          organised and most of the injured had been taken away.

          During this time 1 stood around the pitch I was not subjected to any

          threats or violence and I did not see any spectators drinking y r                any

          worse the wear for drink.            I do recall   seeing a cameraman 9 dming from

          the direction of pen 1 and he was being             chased by three jor four

          Liverpool    supporter s .    This    cameraman was aged about #0 years of age,

          wearing a blue jacket.         This man got away from the /supporters and was

          not assaulted whilst         in my sight.

          After visiting the Leppings Ln turnstiles earlier that morning,                 I did

          not have occasion to revisit them at a ny stage of the day.               I do not

          know any of the Leppings Ln end stewards and I am not aware of any

           club policy as to the opening of Oates A, 8 or C .

          I was   present at the correspond/ng game           last y e a r and in my opinion

          and from what    I saw I did \joJ/notce any difference          in which these

          corresponding games were policed or controlled.

           I have signed an exhibit        label   referring to the ground plan.

                stationed at Barnsley.



                At 3.19pm          ( 15~1^fen *Satfrday,          April     1989 (150489)   I was on duty in

m               uniform performing dut/^as Acting                   Inspector for the Barnsley Town sub-

                Division when as a result of instructions received I attended at the

                Hillsborough Football Stadium,                   Sheffield in compand with five

                Constables under my command,                 arriving       ther    /S.39pm   (1539)   that day,
                                                                           c jr

                On arrival at the ground, we entered by an entrance on the Penistone

                Rd, and I went directly to the ground Police room as instructed.     I
                                                                       I U — 2- .
                then made my way across an enclosed yard area to the qyitmasium door

                where a commotion appeared to be taking place.                         I saw numerous

persons    laid on the floor of the yard, most of who appeared injured

and not conscious.         Other   injured persons were being      carried into

the gymnasium itself.          I deployed my officers in the area of the

gymnasium door moving   civilians away so as to make eas,y
                                                      eas^y access for, the
                                                       u
injured.     After some time, this was achieved and att 4pm (16DQ) I '[Ng y

entered the gymnasium w here I saw a large number of persons               laid out

on the floor.          It was apparent that these persons were all dead.                I

went to a young man who was at that time unattended.                 I did not see

and cannot say how this        person had arrived at the gymnasium.



I saw that this person was a wl>£ie male of about 2Q-23 years old.                      I

checked for vital signs but none were present and I formed the opinion

that the man was d e a d .



At 4 . 0 2 pm (16Q2)    that day I was joinfKf by Doctor Bull, who examined

the youth and pronounced that         lj^fe was extinct.



I noticed that the youth had turned blue in the face



I then made a search of the clothing and the body in an effort to

identify the person.



I noted the description of the body which was, a young map/of medium

build approK.^^T’9 tall, with browp/hair,          blue/eyes,    possessed hi

teeth and/was     clean shaven.       There was a small o v a ^ i c a r   on the/
                                                                              ^
of the left forearm.



QLOTHING found on the body was:          Red and w h i t e ^Kike training shoes,

black woollen st^ks,        blue js^tns, red and whi te/it r i ped rugby style

shirt with a YSL motiff.

              PROPERTY found on the body consisted o f £7.43 pence cas h.               There was

              no other    property whatsoever on the body.         I took possession of this

              property and labeled the body, after which I placed it in a PVC body

              bag.      I then remained with this body and was present when a scenes of

              crime officer joined me and took a polaroid photograph of the facial

              features of the deceased.         The body was then issued with the

              identification number E8.



              At E.OOam    (0E00)   the following morning Sunday 16 April           1989 (160489)     I

              escorted the body to <a screened off area of the gymnasium where I saw

              a man who identified to me that this was the body of his son, Stephen

              I then made certain enquiries of the relatives and completed a South

              Yorkshire Police sudden death report form in respect of the deceased,



              At 2.35am    (0235)   that day,   I escorted the body of the deceased by

              I then handed the property found on the body,          namely £7.43 cash to a

              detective officer who recorded it at the Property other than found

              property register.

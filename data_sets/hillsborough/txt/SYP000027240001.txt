For the attention of Inspector Sawyer


Dear Inspector Sawyer,
                                    Sheffield Wednesday Inquiry
                                       Leppings Lane End
              As promised during our meeting on Friday, 26 May, I write
to give the answers to questions A, B and C on the Memorandum
which you left with me.


Question A
              Members of my staff did in fact carry out a level survey on
the West terrace on Wednesday, 17 May, and on Monday, 15 May,
we carried out an experiment in which one of the exit gates from
the terrace was subjected to the test load appropriate to a crush
barrier in order to see whether under that load,the quick release
device which we designed operated easily.


Question B
              As explained to Chief Inspector Ross in our telephone conversation
on the evening of 19 May, and in my letter written later that evening,
I was,previous to that,under the impression that the restrictions
imposed by Lord Justice Taylor had been lifted.                                                                        This misunderstanding

 probably came about because we were given permission to carry
 out the stabilising works on the boundary wall at the Leppings
 Lane end and I had mistakenly understood this to be a general
 "clearance" to other things.


 Question C
      It transpired during our meeting that you were not aware
 that on the evening of 19 May,within minutes of discovering
 that I had transgressed,I wrote a sincere apology to Mr. Jones
 assuring him that no disrespect had been meant to his authority.
 I take this opportunity to repeat the apology and to express my
 regret that there had been a breach of the restrictions imposed
 by Lord Justice Taylor.


                                Yours sincerely,

I JOHN FLACK will say:     I was bora on



I am a leading ambulance man and have been with SYMAS for 21

years.    I have been a leading ambulance man for 11 years.

Before that I was a qualified ambulance man.    I have worked

at Corporation Street, Batemoor and Parkway.



Thursday was my day off and on Friday I worked from 1400

hours to 2200 hours.     On Saturday I was to work 1400 hours

to 2200 hours as well.        I have worked on semi-final day

before but have never had to visit the ground except as a

spectator quite a few years ago.



My driver was                  We were called at 1410 hours to

the                  where an old man was having problems

breathing.    We took him to Northern General casualty unit.

We called control to say that we were clear at 1507 (track

19 page 1).     We were in a front line accident emergency

vehicle call number Sierra 209.



At 1510.32    (Track 19 page 3) we received a message that

there had been an incident at Hillsborough.      We were told

to proceed to Herries Road.     We travelled down Herries Road

which is about one and a half to two miles with the blue

light on.     En route at 1514.41 (Track 19 page 5) we were

instructed to proceed on red to the gymnasium entrance.     On

arrival   at Fenistone Road      there was chaos with public
vehicles and police vehicles everywhere.       We were directed

across the junction by the police to the entrance with the

sliding gates.    There were no problems with being directed

across by the police.



We arrived at the ground around 1517..     We got through the

gate and saw Station Officer Eason frantically waving to us.

I got out of the vehicle and told the driver to stay with

the vehicle.     Another   ambulance   S 405   (

          was already there.       I went up to Eason and he

asked for a cot to be taken out of his ambulance.       He said

that there had been a bit of a crush and that a young boy

had been crushed .and...stopped, breathing^-. At this time we

were all unaware of the extent of the situation.     We removed

the cot and made our way by foot onto the pitch.       The game

had stopped and there were no players in sight.      There were

a few people on the pitch.     We went diagonally across the

pitch towards the west stand.     We did not come across any

other ambulance men.    We reached the boy who was lying in

the goal area with a few people around him.        A police man

was giving mouth to mouth resuscitation and a man was giving

cardiac compression.    I assume that he was a doctor from the

way that he was talking.    The doctor said that the boy had a

good chance of surviving.    We then put the boy on to the cot

and ran back across the pitch to the ambulance.        While we

were tending to the child we could see people behind the
fence climbing on top of each other but at that point the

boy ajJpeared to be the worse casualty and we did not see

anyone    else   laid out on the pitch.     I was   really just

concentrating on the boy rather than the crowd.



We got to our ambulance which by this time was coming down

onto the pitch.      We opened the doors and took one of our

cots out so that we could get the cot with the boy onto the

ambulance.       I jumped into the back of the ambulance and

started    resuscitation   and put an airway into the boy's

mouth.    The police officer was doing cardiac massage.   Eason

was in our vehicle and he got onto the radio and informed

casualty- at Northern General of the condition of the child.

We then turned the vehicle round and went back out.       It was

a tight fit to get off the pitch but there were no other

ambulances trying to get in while we were trying to get out.

I was working on the child and so I could not see what the

situation was in the yard.       We got to Northern General at

1529.41 (Track 16 page 4).



At Northern General I spoke to a doctor and he asked whether

there was likely to be more casualties.      I said that it was

serious but I could not say how many more would be coming

up.



I told                   to clean the suction equipment as soon
as possible so that we would be ready for off.                   We were

about three or four minutes in the hospital and then we

loaded the vehicle again.           We wefe now on ERC.          At 1536

(Track 16 page 7) I contacted Control and was told to return

to the ground at the Penistone Road entrance.                 We had a

quick trip back down Herries Road south and a police officer

directed us across the junction.        We went through the first

entrance     and   back   into    the yard.      T here we r e       a   few

ambulances going up Herries Road as we were coming down.

There was    still a lot of confusion at the ground as we

pulled into the yard.       I got out and told                             to

stay with the vehicle.       There were bodies around that area

and police officers walking about.              I spoke to a police

inspector a n d ^sfted where our senior officer was.             He did

not know.



I then saw                                            from Rotherham

station on foot.      I then tried to radio through to control

but could not get through as there was interference on the

radio   in the vehicle.          At this point    t h ere   we r e       fans

grabbing me and asking me to help.        Then a fire man came up

to me and said that they were resuscitating an 18 year old

boy and were getting some response.           I went over to the boy

who was nearby in the gym yard area.             There were people

lying nearby on boards who appeared to be dead.             I went over

and looked at the boy.       He was still warm.       I went back to

the ambulance and got out a cot.              I called
and we loaded the boy onto the ambulance.      I shouted to the

fireman to see if there were any others that we could load

quickly as we needed to move the boy as soon as possible.

There did not appear to be any walking wounded about who

wanted    to   come with us.    As we had one stretcher case

already on the ambulance we could only take slightly injured

people because of the room.       It took us about 2 minutes to

get the stretcher on to the vehicle and I then gave the

order for                o set off.     We were going up to the

Northern General.                used the radio at 1546 (Track

16 page     13)   to say that we were en route to the Northern

General with another arrest on board.       Again I was working

on the patient on the trip up and so did-not follow the

route to the hospital.      It did not seem to take long.



We got to the Northern General and were met by a doctor.     He

said that there was no hope for the boy and he told us to

take him to the plaster room which was a temporary mortuary.

The doctor asked me to tell control that it was getting too

busy at Northern General and that he wanted casualties to be

taken to the Hallamshire.      I radioed Control at 1553 (Track

16 page 15)       and said we were clear and at the same time

passed the message concerning the Northern general and the

Hallamshire.       There was no problem in getting through this

time.

        12 . We went down the main Herries Road to the roundabout and
              then round onto Leppings Lane.          The police were on every

              junction directing us and we w§re not held up at all.                I

              have no idea what time it was when we got to Leppings Lane.



              There was some delay around the gates because of the amount

              of people around.         It was bedlam when we parked with fans

              and police everywhere.        There were about three ambulances in

              front    of   us   on   the   road,   and   I did   notice


*             officer in charge but could not see one.
                                                             I tried to find an

                                                                    Then a police

              inspector came up to me and asked me to take a young boy and

              his dead father because the boy would not leave his father.

              The boy was not injured.         I said that I. could not move dead

              bodies and as the boy was not injured he had no priority.



        13.   The vehicles       started    to move up.     This was    about   five

              minutes after we had arrived at Leppings Lane.           Then another

              police officer came and said there was a doctor and patient

              ready for moving.        I went up to the doctor who had a drip in

              the   p a t i e n t ’s arm.   A Derbyshire ambulanceman who was

              separated from his colleague and had been advanced trained

              helped with the loading of the cot on to our ambulance.

              There was a lot of equipment with the patient and so we did

              not look for any more patients to take with us.              We managed

              to get out onto Penistone Road which took about three or

              four minutes.        I was in the back assisting the doctor who
told us to go to Hallamshire because he had worked there

before and understood that Northern General was quite full.



I was not aware of the journey because I was helping in the

back.     I think    it took about   7 minutes to   get   to   the

Hallamshire.



We unloaded the patient and handed him over to casualty.         I

then radioed clear and was told by control to go back to

Leppings Lane.         We went around to just outside the gate

and the doctor got out       to see who he could help.         The

Derbyshire     ambulance man stayed with us.        I radioed to

control again to ask where the casualty clearing point was.

X.   was- then directed to. the. Herries Road bus depot to stand...

by.     We were able to turn round and go back up Leppings Lane

and along Herries Road where we met Station Officer Eason.

He told us to park       in the driveway to the depot.         All

drivers remained in their vehicles and I liaised with Eason.

We were there about 30 to 45 minutes and then heard control

sending all West Yorkshire vehicles back to base.         We left

 the Derbyshire man and his colleague with his equipment at

 the bus depot.       All South Yorkshire vehicles were then

 instructed to go to the Penistone Road entrance.         We went

 right    up   to   the side of the gym where we were met by

 Mr.David Jones.      We parked the vehicles and he then called

 us together for a briefing.     There were probably about 20 of

 us.    He split us into groups of those on the various duties
     and those who were off duty but had been called in.   He then

     directed us back to the station.   We got back to the station

     at about 1800 hours,    cleaned our vehicle and completed our

     shift.

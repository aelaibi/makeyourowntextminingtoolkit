The Rt. Hon. Margaret Thatcher,
Prime Minister,
10 Downing Street,
LONDON.




Dear Prime Minister,

HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

Following a meeting of the nine local authorities most directly affected by
Hillsborough a letter and report has been sent to the Secretary of State for
Social Services. As you were able to attend the Memorial Service and saw at
first hand some of the acute distress experienced by families I thought it
might be useful to send you a copy direct.

Yours sincerely,




Keva Coombes,
Leader.

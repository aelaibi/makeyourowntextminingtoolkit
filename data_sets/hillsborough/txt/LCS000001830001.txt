    The Director asked Authorities to consider whether any
    one of them could offer to second a person to take over
    the Helpline organisation role currently being undertaken
    by Carole Wilkinson.      The Director then referred to
    his discussions with Alan Holden (Childline) which has

    in this type of forward planning.       It was agreed that

    about the coverage of the tragedy by sections of the
    popular press and the decision to return bodies without

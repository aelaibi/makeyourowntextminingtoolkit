Lord Justice Stuart-Smith


On the 15 April 1989, at the age of 27, I became a widow and my
two young children lost their adored father. I still do not know
the full circumstances of his death, he was simply body no.3.
The fresh evidence that has since come to light has shown what we
have known all along, justice has never been done. The verdict of
accidental death was preposterous, how do 96 innocent people lose
their lives accidentally at a football match ? This verdict must
be quashed.

My children are now at the age when they want answers to their
questions and I feel sure that if justice is not obtained.this
time around then they, like many others, will pursue this campaign
until the end.

If we are ever to lead a normal life again then we must know the
truth of the events of that dreadful day and hope you will
consider all the evidence carefully and compassionately.

The 96 can never have their lives back but maybe there is still
hope for those of us left behind.


Yours Sincerely
